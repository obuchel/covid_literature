3848,Neutrophil heterogeneity and its role in infectious complications after severe trauma,2019-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Trauma leads to a complex inflammatory cascade that induces both immune activation and a refractory immune state in parallel. Although both components are deemed necessary for recovery, the balance is tight and easily lost. Losing the balance can lead to life-threatening infectious complications as well as long-term immunosuppression with recurrent infections. Neutrophils are known to play a key role in these processes. Therefore, this review focuses on neutrophil characteristics and function after trauma and how these features can be used to identify trauma patients at risk for infectious complications. RESULTS: Distinct neutrophil subtypes exist that play their own role in the recovery and/or development of infectious complications after trauma. Furthermore, the refractory immune state is related to the risk of infectious complications. These findings change the initial concepts of the immune response after trauma and give rise to new biomarkers for monitoring and predicting inflammatory complications in severely injured patients. CONCLUSION: For early recognition of patients at risk, the immune system should be monitored. Several neutrophil biomarkers show promising results and analysis of these markers has become accessible to such extent that they can be used for point-of-care decision making after trauma.","Hesselink, Lillian; Spijkerman, Roy; van Wessem, Karlijn J.

4531,A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway,2020-02-18,"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).","Kruse, Robert L.",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029759/,428

6805,Infections and immunological hazards of allogeneic bone transplantation,1995,"Patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) receiving rituximab-containing chemotherapy are at risk of developing respiratory complications, but comprehensive information on these complications and their impact on survival is lacking. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis on 123 NHL patients who received rituximab-containing chemotherapy between 2009 and 2016 in order to describe the incidence, etiologies and effect on survival of respiratory complications defined by new or worsening respiratory symptoms requiring diagnostic work-up or hospitalization. Thirty patients (24%) developed respiratory complications during a follow-up time of 825 (555–1338) days after chemotherapy. They had a higher prevalence of congestive heart failure and lung or pleural involvement at diagnosis as compared to patients who did not develop complications. Overall, 58 episodes of pulmonary complications were observed after median (interquartile) times from the first and last rituximab doses of 205 (75–580) days and 27 (14–163) days respectively. Infectious etiologies accounted for 75% of the respiratory complications, followed by heart failure exacerbation, lymphomatous involvement, and ARDS. Two Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonias were observed, and no complication was ascribed to rituximab toxicity. Respiratory complications required ICU admission in 19 cases (33%) and invasive mechanical ventilation in 14 cases (24%). Using a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, we observed that the occurrence of respiratory complications was associated with a 170% increase in death hazard (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.60–4.40, p = 0.001). In conclusion, respiratory complications in NHL patients receiving chemotherapy are relatively frequent, severe, and mostly infectious and are associated with increased mortality.","Keefer, Kimberly; Bender, Regis; Liao, Jason; Sivik, Jeffrey; Van de Louw, Andry",Ann Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102168/,428

10138,Attitudes Toward People Living With HIV/AIDS: A Model of Attitudes to Illness,2007-01-10,"Aim The Kakamega Forest, western Kenya, has been biogeographically assigned to both lowland and montane forest biomes, or has even been considered to be unique. Most frequently it has been linked with the Guineo‐Congolian rain forest block. The present paper aims to test six alternative hypotheses of the zoogeographical relationships between this forest remnant and other African forests using reptiles as a model group. Reptiles are relatively slow dispersers, compared with flying organisms (Aves and Odonata) on which former hypotheses have been based, and may thus result in a more conservative biogeographical analysis. Location Kakamega Forest, Kenya, Sub‐Saharan Africa. Methods The reptile diversity of Kakamega Forest was evaluated by field surveys and data from literature resources. Faunal comparisons of Kakamega Forest with 16 other African forests were conducted by the use of the ‘coefficient of biogeographic resemblance’ using the reptile communities as zoogeographic indicators. Parsimony Analysis of Endemism and Neighbour Joining Analysis of Endemism were used to generate relationship trees based on an occurrence matrix with paup*. Results The analysis clearly supports the hypothesis that the Kakamega Forest is the easternmost fragment of the Guineo‐Congolian rain forest belt, and thus more closely related to the forests of that Central–West African complex than to any forest further east, such as the Kenyan coastal forests. Many Kenyan reptile species occur exclusively in the Kakamega Forest and its associated forest fragments. Main conclusions The Kakamega Forest is the only remnant of the Guineo‐Congolian rain forest in the general area. We assume that the low degree of resemblance identified for the Guineo‐Congolian forest and the East African coastal forest reflect the long history of isolation of the two forest types from each other. Kenyan coastal forests may have been historically connected through forest ‘bridges’ of the southern highlands with the Congo forest belt, allowing reptile species to migrate between them. The probability of a second ‘bridge’ located in the region of southern Tanzanian inselbergs is discussed. Although not particularly rich in reptile species, the area should be considered of high national priority for conservation measures.","Wagner, Philipp; Köhler, Jörn; Schmitz, Andreas; Böhme, Wolfgang",J Biogeogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167171/,428

10640,Apneic Oxygenation for Emergency Intubations in the Pediatric Emergency Department—A Quality Improvement Initiative,2020-02-13,"INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging tool for anxiety and fear reduction in pediatric patients. VR use is facilitated by Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS) at pediatric hospitals. The primary aim of this study was to retrospectively review the safety of VR by analyzing adverse events after the utilization of VR under CCLS supervision. Secondary objectives were to characterize the efficacy of VR in enhancing patient cooperation, describe the integration of VR into Child Life services, and identify interventions that accompanied VR. METHODS: The Stanford Chariot Program developed VR applications, customized VR interfaces, and patient head straps, and distributed these to CCLS. Chart review analyzed VR utilization through CCLS patient notes. Inclusion criteria were all patients ages 6 to 18-years-old who received a Child Life intervention. RESULTS: From June 2017 to July 2018, 31 CCLS saw 8,098 patients, 3,696 of which met age criteria with pre- and post-intervention cooperation data. Two hundred thirteen patients received VR with an accompanying intervention, while 34 patients received only VR. Adverse events were rare, and included increased anxiety (3.8%, n=8), dizziness (0.5%, n=1), and nausea (0.5%, n=1). Patients were more likely to be cooperative after receiving VR (99.5%, n=212) compared to pre-intervention (96.7%, n=206, p=0.041). VR use was most common in the perioperative setting (60%, n=128), followed by outpatient clinics (15%, n=32). CONCLUSION: VR is safe in pediatric patients with appropriate hardware, software, and patient selection. Side effects were rare and self-limited. VR appears to be associated with improvements in cooperation.","Caruso, Thomas J.; O’Connell, Chloe; Qian, Jimmy J.; Kung, Tiffany; Wang, Ellen; Kinnebrew, Susan; Pearson, Molly; Kist, Madison; Menendez, Maria; Rodriguez, Samuel T.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190243/,428
10660,A Front-end Redesign With Implementation of a Novel “Intake” System to Improve Patient Flow in a Pediatric Emergency Department,2020-02-27,"OBJECTIVE: Our institution performed an educational initiative targeting previously identified barriers to pediatric sepsis recognition and treatment. We hypothesized that provider knowledge, attitude, and behavior would be improved 1 year after implementation. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of a multi-faceted quality initiative introduced to providers in the Emergency Department, inpatient wards, and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care children’s hospital. Educational platforms consisted of quarterly electronic sepsis “newsletters,” brightly colored posters highlighting protocol and screening strategies displayed throughout the hospital, and low-fidelity simulation sessions (drills) led by trained staff and incorporated into daily workflows. The content was driven by feedback from a baseline needs assessment of sepsis education. One year after implementation, the needs assessment was repeated. RESULTS: Over 3 months, facilitators conducted 197 drills and captured a majority of nurses (89%), pediatrics residents (96%), and respiratory therapists (62%). By 6 months, 241 sessions had been completed. Approximately 55.4% of the 442 eligible staff participated in our post-intervention survey. Overall, knowledge of diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock increased from pre-intervention levels (P = 0.015). Among post-implementation respondents, drill participants outperformed their colleagues (P = 0.001). A greater percentage of post-intervention respondents indicated comfort with sepsis recognition (P < 0.001), and fewer reported hesitating to bring sepsis concerns to their care team (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary curriculum balancing active education—through brief, targeted simulation—and general awareness—through electronic resources and a poster campaign—can improve sepsis-related knowledge, attitude, and behavior among pediatric practitioners.","Breuer, Ryan K.; Hassinger, Amanda B.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190264/,428

11485,Train-Associated Injuries Pose a Significant Burden on Trauma Care Systems of Emerging Economies,2020-05-08,"PURPOSE: Air pollutant exposure constitutes a serious risk factor for the emergence or aggravation of (existing) pulmonary disease. The impact of pre-intensive care ambient air pollutant exposure on the duration of artificial ventilation was, however, not yet established. METHODS: The medical records of 2003 patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Antwerp University Hospital (Flanders, Belgium), who were artificially ventilated on ICU admission or within 48 h after admission, for the duration of at least 48 h, were analyzed. For each patient’s home address, daily air pollutant exposure [particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM(2.5)) and ≤ 10 µm (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and black carbon (BC)] up to 10 days prior to hospital admission was modeled using a high-resolution spatial–temporal model. The association between duration of artificial ventilation and air pollution exposure during the last 10 days before ICU admission was assessed using distributed lag models with a negative binomial regression fit. RESULTS: Controlling for pre-specified confounders, an IQR increment in BC (1.2 µg/m(3)) up to 10 days before admission was associated with an estimated cumulative increase of 12.4% in ventilation duration (95% CI 4.7–20.7). Significant associations were also observed for PM(2.5), PM(10) and NO(2), with cumulative estimates ranging from 7.8 to 8.0%. CONCLUSION: Short-term ambient air pollution exposure prior to ICU admission represents an unrecognized environmental risk factor for the duration of artificial ventilation in the ICU.

17820,Pain Medicine Fellowship Program Websites in the United States of America – A Nonparametric Statistic Analysis of 14 Different Criteria,2021-05-21,"OBJECTIVES: Norovirus genotype GII.3[P12] strains have been an important pathogen for sporadic gastroenteritis infection. In previous studies of GII.3[P12], the number of specimens and time span are relatively small, which is difficult to truly reflect the infection and evolution of this type of norovirus. Here we report a molecular epidemiological study of the NoVs prevalent in Jiangsu between 2010 and 2019 to investigate the evolution of the GII.3[P12] strains in China. METHODS: In this study 60 GII.3[P12] norovirus strains were sequenced and analyzed for evolution, recombination, and selection pressure using bioanalysis software. RESULTS: The GII.3[P12] strains were continuously detected during the study period, which showed a high constituent ratio in males, in winter and among children aged 0–11 months, respectively. A time-scaled evolutionary tree showed that both GII.P12 RdRp and GII.3 VP1 sequences were grouped into three major clusters (Cluster I–III). Most GII.3[P12] strains were mainly located in sub-cluster (SC) II of Cluster III. A SimPlot analysis identified GII.3[P12] strain to be as an ORF1-intragenic recombinant of GII.4[P12] and GII.3[P21]. The RdRp genes of the GII.3[P12] showed a higher mean substitution rate than those of all GII.P12, while the VP1 genes of the GII.3[P12] showed a lower mean substitution rate than those of all GII.3. Alignment of the GII.3 capsid sequences revealed that three HBGA binding sites of all known GII.3 strains remained conserved, while several amino acid mutations in the predicted antibody binding sites were detected. The mutation at 385 was within predicted antibody binding regions, close to host attachment factor binding sites. Positive and negative selection sites were estimated. Two common positively selected sites (sites 385 and 406) were located on the surface of the protruding domain. Moreover, an amino acid substitution (aa204) was estimated to be near the active site of the RdRp protein. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis on the epidemic and evolution of GII.3[P12] noroviruses and the results suggested that evolution was possibly driven by intergenic recombination and mutations in some key amino acid sites.

18241,Reply to D. O'Reilly et al,2021-05-06,"IMPORTANCE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent among refugees surviving mass atrocities, especially among women. Longitudinal studies investigating factors associated with PTSD course are essential to enable adequate treatment yet widely lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify longitudinal changes in PTSD severity and posttraumatic coping among severely traumatized female refugees as well as risk and protective factors for PTSD course. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study took place in 14 German cities in the context of a humanitarian admission program that resettled 1000 especially vulnerable women and children from northern Iraq to Germany. Approximately 400 adult beneficiaries of the humanitarian admission program were eligible for the study. At baseline, a total of 116 of the 400 beneficiaries (29.0%) participated, with 96 (82.8%) of these women participating in the follow-up assessment. The study included a baseline assessment conducted 2 years after resettlement (September 1, 2017, to January 12, 2018) and a 1-year follow-up (August 29, 2018, to January 15, 2019). EXPOSURES: Violence and/or captivity during the 2014 genocide in northern Iraq by the so-called Islamic State. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Posttraumatic stress disorder severity and coping strategies were assessed in interpreter-aided interviews using the Impact of Event Scale–Revised. RESULTS: A total of 116 women (mean [SD] age, 32.2 [8.2] years; 115 [99.1%] Yazidi; 1 [0.9%] Christian) participated at baseline. According to the Impact of Event Scale–Revised, a high PTSD severity was found (mean [SD] raw sum score, 60.88 [15.75] of 88, with higher scores indicating greater distress), with no significant change over time. Helpful coping strategies included prayer, belief in collective strength, and belief in personal strength. Earlier symptoms of intrusions (β = 0.389, P = .007) and longer captivity (β = 0.218, P = .02) were identified as being associated with PTSD severity 1 year later. Longer captivity was associated with PTSD aggravation over time (β = 0.227, P = .04). Posttraumatic strengthening in faith (β = −0.206, P = .05) and in social relationships (β = −0.221, P = .03) were associated with a reduction in PTSD symptoms.

19398,Female Participation in Academic European Neurosurgery—A Cross-Sectional Analysis,2021-06-23,"The aim of this retrospective chart review study was to examine the cost effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine, monotherapies in the management of essential hypertension among adult patients (≥18 years) without cancer, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease in the primary care clinics of a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months from the initiation of therapy. Propensity score bin bootstrapping with 10,000 replications was conducted to generate the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both treatment outcome (e.g., reduction of the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) in mmHG) and the cost (e.g., costs of drugs, clinic visits, and labs in Saudi riyals (SAR)). Among the 153 included patients who met the inclusion criteria, 111 patients were on ACEIs/ARBs, while 44 patients were on amlodipine. On the basis of the bootstrap distribution, we found that the use of ACEIs/ARBs was associated with an incremental reduction of SBP of up to 4.46 mmHg but with an incremental cost of up to SAR 116.39 (USD 31.04), which results in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SAR 26.09 (USD 6.95) per 1 mmHg reduction with 55.26% level of confidence. With regard to DBP, ACEIs/ARBs were associated with an incremental reduction of DBP of up to 5.35 mmHg and an incremental cost of up to SAR 144.96 (USD 38.66), which results in an ICER of SAR 27.09 (USD 7.23) per 1 mmHg reduction with 68.10% level of confidence. However, ACEIs/ARBs were less effective and costlier than amlodipine in reducing SBP and DBP with 44.74% and 31.89% levels of confidence, respectively. The findings of this study indicate that the use of ACEI or ARB as a monotherapy seems to be more effective than amlodipine monotherapy in the management of essential hypertension in primary care settings with minimal incremental cost.","AlRuthia, Yazed; Alotaibi, Fahad; Jamal, Amr; Sales, Ibrahim; Alwhaibi, Monira; Alqahtani, Nawaf; AlNajrany, Sina M.; Almalki, Khalid; Alsaigh, Abdulaziz; Mansy, Wael",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8304800/,428
20166,Association between the severity of new-onset depression and unmet healthcare needs of South Korean adults,2021-08-19,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Benefit of early endovascular treatment (EVT) for ischemic stroke varies considerably among patients. The MR PREDICTS decision tool, derived from MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), predicts outcome and treatment benefit based on baseline characteristics. Our aim was to externally validate and update MR PREDICTS with data from international trials and daily clinical practice. METHODS: We used individual patient data from 6 randomized controlled trials within the HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) collaboration to validate the original model. Then, we updated the model and performed a second validation with data from the observational MR CLEAN Registry. Primary outcome was functional independence (defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0–2) 3 months after stroke. Treatment benefit was defined as the difference between the probability of functional independence with and without EVT. Discriminative performance was evaluated using a concordance (C) statistic. RESULTS: We included 1242 patients from HERMES (633 assigned to EVT, 609 assigned to control) and 3156 patients from the MR CLEAN Registry (all of whom underwent EVT within 6.5 hours). The C-statistic for functional independence was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72–0.77) in HERMES and, after model updating, 0.80 (0.78–0.82) in the Registry. Median predicted treatment benefit of routinely treated patients (Registry) was 10.3% (interquartile range, 5.8%–14.4%). Patients with low (<1%) predicted treatment benefit (n=135/3156 [4.3%]) had low rates of functional independence, irrespective of reperfusion status, suggesting potential absence of treatment benefit. The updated model was made available online for clinicians and researchers at www.mrpredicts.com. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the substantial treatment effect and small potential harm of EVT, most patients arriving within 6 hours at an endovascular-capable center should be treated regardless of their clinical characteristics. MR PREDICTS can be used to support clinical judgement when there is uncertainty about the treatment indication, when resources are limited, or before a patient is to be transferred to an endovascular-capable center.","Venema, Esmee; Roozenbeek, Bob; Mulder, Maxim J.H.L.; Brown, Scott; Majoie, Charles B.L.M.; Steyerberg, Ewout W.; Demchuk, Andrew M.; Muir, Keith W.; Dávalos, Antoni; Mitchell, Peter J.; Bracard, Serge; Berkhemer, Olvert A.; Lycklama à Nijeholt, Geert J.; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J.; Roos, Yvo B.W.E.M.; van Zwam, Wim H.; van der Lugt, Aad; Hill, Michael D.; White, Philip; Campbell, Bruce C.V.; Guillemin, Francis; Saver, Jeffrey L.; Jovin, Tudor G.; Goyal, Mayank; Dippel, Diederik W.J.; Lingsma, Hester F.",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378416/,428
20248,Lessons Learned From Emergency Department Fall Assessment and Prevention Programs,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of cardiac surgery. Factors such as cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping and surgical stress may precipitate renal hypoperfusion and ischaemia, inflammation and oxidative stress are associated with development of AKI. Albumin’s pharmacological properties and widespread availability have the potential to mitigate these factors. However, the effect of albumin on cardiac surgery-associated AKI is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of postoperative 20% albumin infusion on kidney function after high-risk cardiac surgery. METHODS: We designed an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial—the ALBICS study (ALBumin Infusion and acute kidney injury following Cardiac Surgery). A total of 590 patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery (combined procedure or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) will be enrolled into the study and randomly allocated to receive a postoperative 20% albumin infusion or standard care in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by centre and baseline renal function. The study fluid will be administered upon arrival in intensive care for 15 h. Patients will be followed up until 28 days after surgery or until discharge from the hospital. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who develop AKI in both groups. Secondary outcomes to be measured are proportions of AKI stage II and III, 28-day mortality, mechanical ventilation time and length of stay in intensive care and hospital. CONCLUSION: This trial aims to determine if a postoperative infusion of concentrated albumin reduces the risk of AKI following high-risk cardiac surgery.

20521,The Role of Pain Catastrophizing and Pain Acceptance in Performance-Based and Self-Reported Physical Functioning in Individuals with Fibromyalgia and Obesity,2021-08-19,"Emerging and re-emerging viral infections have been an important public health problem in recent years. We focused our attention on Toscana virus (TOSV), an emergent neurotropic negative-strand RNA virus of the Phenuiviridae family. The mechanisms of protection against phlebovirus natural infection are not known; however, it is supposed that a virus-neutralizing antibody response against viral glycoproteins would be useful to block the first stages of infection. By using an improved memory B cell immortalization method, we obtained a panel of human mAbs which reacted with TOSV antigens. We identified three epitopes of TOSV Gn glycoproteins by neutralizing mAbs using synthetic peptide arrays on membrane support (SPOT synthesis). These epitopes, separated in primary structure, might be exposed near one another as a conformational epitope in their native structure. In vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the humoral response elicited in mice immunized with the identified peptides. The results underlined the hypothesis that the first two peptides located in the NH(2) terminus could form a conformational epitope, while the third, located near the transmembrane sequence in the carboxyl terminus, was necessary to strengthen neutralizing activity. Our results emphasize the importance of identifying neutralizing epitopes shared among the various phleboviruses, which could be exploited for the development of a potential epitope-based diagnostic assay or a polyvalent protective vaccine against different phleboviruses.","Gandolfo, Claudia; Prathyumn, Shibily; Terrosi, Chiara; Anichini, Gabriele; Gori Savellini, Gianni; Corti, Davide; Bracci, Luisa; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Roman-Sosa, Gleyder; Cusi, Maria Grazia",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402642/,428
21344,Self-inflicted injury and the older trauma patient: a 20 year review of suicide attempts and outcomes,2021-09-20,"BACKGROUND: Compassion in healthcare provides measurable benefits to patients, physicians, and healthcare systems. However, data regarding the factors that predict care (and a lack of care) are scattered. This study systematically reviews biomedical literature within the Transactional Model of Physician Compassion and synthesizes evidence regarding the predictors of physician empathy, compassion, and related constructs (ECRC). METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, OvidJournals, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Scopus using search terms relating to ECRC and its predictors. Eligible studies included physicians as participants. Methodological quality was assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook, using ROBINS-I risk of bias tool for quantitative and CASP for qualitative studies. Confidence in findings was evaluated according to GRADE-CERQual approach. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two included studies (74,866 physicians) highlighted the diversity of influences on compassion in healthcare (54 unique predictors). Physician-related predictors (88%) were gender, experience, values, emotions and coping strategies, quality of life, and burnout. Environmental predictors (38%) were organizational structure, resources, culture, and clinical environment and processes. Patient-related predictors (24%) were communication ease, and physicians’ perceptions of patients’ motives; compassion was also less forthcoming with lower SES and minority patients. Evidence related to clinical predictors (15%) was scarce; high acuity presentations predicted greater ECRC. DISCUSSION: The growth of evidence in the recent years reflects ECRC’s ongoing importance. However, evidence remains scattered, concentrates on physicians’ factors that may not be amenable to interventions, lacks designs permitting causal commentary, and is limited by self-reported outcomes. Inconsistent findings in the direction of the predictors’ effects indicate the need to study the relationships among predictors to better understand the mechanisms of ECRCs. The current review can guide future research and interventions.

21681,Can Propolis Be a Useful Adjuvant in Brain and Neurological Disorders and Injuries? A Systematic Scoping Review of the Latest Experimental Evidence,2021-09-15,"In this investigation, to maximize the desired immunoenhancement effects of PsEUL and stimulate an efficient humoral and cellular immune response against an antigen, PsEUL and the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) were coupled using the N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) reaction to yield a novel delivery system (PsEUL-OVA). The physicochemical characteristics and immune regulation effects of this new system were investigated. We found the yield of this EDC method to be 46.25%. In vitro, PsEUL-OVA (200 μg mL(−1)) could enhance macrophage proliferation and increase their phagocytic efficiency. In vivo, PsEUL-OVA could significantly increase the levels of OVA-specific antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b) titers and cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ) levels. Additionally, it could activate T lymphocytes and facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). These findings collectively suggested that PsEUL-OVA induced humoral and cellular immune responses by promoting the phagocytic activity of macrophages and DCs. Taken together, these results revealed that PsEUL-OVA had the potential to improve immune responses and provide a promising theoretical basis for the design of a novel delivery system.","Feng, Haibo; Yang, Jie; Zhi, Hui; Hu, Xin; Yang, Yan; Zhang, Linzi; Liu, Qianqian; Feng, Yangyang; Wu, Daiyan; Li, Hangyu",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8471226/,428
25739,Adjuncts to Resuscitation,2018-05-26,"The discovery of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A replication inhibitor daclatasvir (1) had its origins in a phenotypic screening lead. However, during the optimization campaign, it was observed that some members of the chemotype underwent a radical dimerization under the assay conditions. This redirected the effort to focus on palindromic molecules, a species subsequently shown to complement the dimeric nature of the NS5A protein. The most challenging aspect of the discovery program was extending antiviral activity to encompass GT-1a virus which was accomplished only after the development of extensive structure-activity relationships. In clinical trials, oral administration of daclatasvir (1) produced a profound effect on viral load with onset that was more rapid than had been seen previously with either NS3 protease or NS5B polymerase inhibitors. A groundbreaking clinical trial that combined daclatasvir (1) with the protease inhibitor asunaprevir (52) established that a chronic HCV infection could be cured with small molecule therapy in the absence of immune stimulation, setting the stage for approval of this regimen for the treatment of GT-1b-infected subjects by the Japanese health authorities on July 4, 2014.","Meanwell, Nicholas A.; Belema, Makonen",HCV: The Journey from Discovery to a Cure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122418/,428

37553,Why the U.S. must prioritize behavioral health management during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-07-17,"In response to shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, makers, community groups and manufacturers around the world utilised 3D printing to fabricate items, including face shields and face masks for healthcare workers and the broader community. In reaction to both local and global needs, numerous designs emerged and were shared online. In this paper, 37 face shields and 31 face masks suitable for fused filament fabrication were analysed from a fabrication perspective, documenting factors such as filament use, time to print and geometric qualities. 3D print times for similar designs varied by several hours, meaning some designs could be produced in higher volumes. Overall, the results show that face shields were approximately twice as fast to 3D print compared to face masks and used approximately half as much filament. Additionally, a face shield typically required 1.5 parts to be 3D printed, whereas face masks required 5 3D printed parts. However, by quantifying the print times, filament use, 3D printing costs, part dimensions, number of parts and total volume of each design, the wide variations within each product category could be tracked and evaluated. This data and objective analysis will help makers, manufacturers, regulatory bodies and researchers consolidate the 3D printing response to COVID-19 and optimise the ongoing strategy to combat supply chain shortages now and in future healthcare crises.","Novak, James I.; Loy, Jennifer",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7391928/,428

Alternatively, N(2)/H(2) plasmas could be used with the potential of increasing overall deposition efficiency (DE) and hence reduce the consumption of high-value feedstock powder. Also, by increasing DE, spraying time would be reduced, thereby providing another contribution to bring down production costs. In this work, TBCs were prepared with Ar- and N(2)-based plasmas with different YSZ powders using Metco 9MB legacy torch. The use of N(2)-based plasma resulted in higher particle temperature and lower particle velocity values than those provided by the Ar-based plasma. The measured DEs were between 41-43 and 53-60% for the Ar- and N(2)-based plasmas, respectively. This represents a ~ 40% increase in the DE. The coatings produced with the two different plasmas exhibited equivalent porosity levels ~ 11-13%. On average, the lowest thermal conductivity values were given by a N(2)-based LD-B YSZ TBC. In the furnace cycle test, the performance of the TBCs prepared with the N(2)-based plasma was superior to that of the TBCs prepared with the Ar plasma, and also exceeding that of an industrial APS TBC benchmark.","Guerreiro, Bruno; Lima, Rogerio S.; Curry, Nicholas; Leitner, Matthias; Körner, Karl",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7816747/,428

This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for arrhythmia classification. The proposed model offers the following improvements compared with traditional CNN models. Firstly, the multi-channel model can concatenate spectral and spatial feature maps. Secondly, the structural unit is composed of a depthwise separable convolution layer followed by activation and batch normalization layers. The structural unit offers effective utilization of network parameters. Also, the optimization of hyperparameters is done using Hyperopt library, based on Sequential Model-Based Global Optimization algorithm (SMBO). These improvements make the network more efficient and accurate for arrhythmia classification. The proposed model is evaluated using tenfold cross-validation following both subject-oriented inter-patient and class-oriented intra-patient evaluation protocols. Our model achieved 99.48% and 99.46% accuracy in VEB (ventricular ectopic beat) and SVEB (supraventricular ectopic beat) class classification, respectively.

53281,986 A Systematic Review of Medical Student Willingness to Volunteer and Preparedness for Pandemics and Disasters,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims COVID-19 has created numerous challenges for people globally. In the UK, few studies have reported poorer outcomes for certain ethnic populations. UK government introduced shielding guidance to protect the most vulnerable patients and this was in force for a number of months. However, shielding guidance was initially released only in English, which resulted in further disenfranchisement of the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic community (BAME). We undertook an audit to understand experiences of shielding particularly in rheumatological BAME patients in multi-ethnic communities in 3 centres - Wolverhampton, Leicester and Oxford. Methods This study was approved in all three sites as an audit. Patients contacting rheumatology helpline or having routine consultations were included. Each centre aimed to recruit at least 20 patients. A questionnaire was developed to capture important data on shielding. The study was conducted between May and June 2020 during the peak of the first wave of Covid 19. Results We recruited 79 patients into this audit, of these 54 were of BAME and 25 of Caucasian ethnicity with 17 males and 62 females. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) was the commonest diagnosis in 49 of these patients (62%) and these patients were older (median ages 56 vs. 46 years, p = 0.14). BSR risk scoring algorithm was used to determine need for shielding (BSR score of 3 or more) - 38 patients fell into this category. The remaining patients had scored lower and had the option of shielding or enhanced social distancing. Of the 13 Caucasian patients who should have been shielding, 11 were (85%). Of the 25 BAME patients who should have been shielding: 17 were, and 8 were not (68%, p = 0.26; 65% looking at South Asian patients alone). Understanding of reasons for shielding was clear for 21 out of 25 Caucasian patients (84%). In contrast, 33 of 54 patients from BAME backgrounds (61%) were clear on this (p = 0.10). Within Wolverhampton and Leicester, the numbers are starker with 20 out of 37 (54%) being clear on this. Very few Caucasian patients made changes to their existing medications with 84% carrying on their medications as they were before the onset of COVID 19. However, of 54 BAME patients, 14 patients had stopped medications - either by themselves or as per advice of health professionals (74%, p = 0.16). There was a significant difference between centres in patients stopping medications with patients from Leicester much more likely (p < 0.001). Conclusion Despite the small numbers, the data clearly suggest that BAME patients were less likely to understand the reasons for shielding, to follow shielding advice, and more likely to change their medications, thereby risking a flare. Addressing culturally competent educational needs and health equality for BAME rheumatology patients continues to remain a challenge. Disclosure S. Dubey: None. K. Kumar: None. H. Bunting: None. T.

53291,335 Planned Surgery in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study from Nottingham,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims To quantify the risk of death among people with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) during the UK 2020 COVID-19 epidemic compared with baseline risk and the risk of death in the general population during COVID-19. Methods A cohort study was performed using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). Coded diagnoses for RAIRD were identified from Hospital Episode Statistics from 2003 onwards. Previous coding validation work demonstrated our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%. ONS published data were used for general population mortality rates. The main outcome measure was age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for all-cause death. Secondary outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality rates. Results 168,691 people with RAIRD were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. 1,815 (1.1%) people with RAIRD died during March and April 2020. The ASMR among people with RAIRD was 3669.3 (95% CI 3500.4-3838.1) per 100,000 person-years, which was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years. In the whole population of England, the ASMR during March and April 2020 was 1361.1 (1353.6- 1368.7) per 100,000 people, which was 1.38 times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years (see related abstract about influenza seasons). Unlike in the general population, sex-specific rates in RAIRD were similar in males and females. When comparing risk of death during COVID-19 to pre-COVID-19, people with RAIRD had an increased risk of death from age 35 upwards, compared to around age 55 upwards in the general population. As the protective effect of being female was not seen in RAIRD, the group at the largest increased risk compared to their pre-COVID-19 risk were women aged 35 upwards. The absolute risk of all-cause death for someone aged 20-29 with RAIRD was similar to someone in the general population aged >20 years older, someone aged 40-49 years with RAIRD similar to someone in the general population 20 years older, and someone aged 60-69 with RAIRD similar to someone in the general population aged >10 years older. Conclusion The excess risk of all-cause death during COVID-19 occurs at a younger age among people with RAIRD than among the general population, and particularly affects females. . We urgently need to quantify how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how much due to disruption to healthcare services to inform better guidance about shielding, access to healthcare and vaccine priorities for people with rare diseases.

Inspired by a public health perspective, the government of Botswana has recently increased the alcohol tax levy, reduced the hours of operation for bars and increased penalties for alcohol-related offences to control alcohol-related harm. While these reforms have been central to policymaking, and caused some controversy, not much is known about the everyday experiences of alcohol consumers in Botswana. Drawing from semi-structured interviews (n = 40) collected amongst drinkers over a five-year period, this paper examines the everyday use of alcohol in Botswana. The analysis demonstrates that alcohol use constitutes an important part of leisure and night-time economy (NTE) activities in Botswana. It is a functional social activity that is used by people to take time away from the routines and pressures of daily life. More importantly, it is pleasurable to people, enhances sociability, and partaken as a form of transaction between men and women in bars. There is need for policy makers to consider the embodied experiences of alcohol use when designing alcohol interventions in Botswana.","Sebeelo, Tebogo B.",Int J Sociol Leis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8164564/,428
54043,Nutritional Impact of Economic Downturn: How the Great Recession Shaped Dietary Behaviors in US Adults,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: Intimate partner homicide (IPH) is a global public health problem. One study conducted over 66 countries found that 13.5% of all homicides and 38.6% of female homicides were committed by an intimate partner. In South Africa, there were no published studies that examine alleged perpetrators of IPH that were referred for forensic psychiatric observation. AIM: To describe the profile of accused persons referred for forensic psychiatric observation for a charge of murder or attempted murder of their intimate partners. Certain characteristics were further examined according to the psychiatric observation outcomes. SETTING: The study was conducted at Sterkfontein Hospital, a forensic psychiatric hospital in Gauteng, South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective record review of accused persons referred for forensic psychiatric observation for a charge of murder or attempted murder of their intimate partners was conducted. The period of the review was 19 years. The definition of intimate partners included current or former spouses and partners, same-sex partners and rejected suitors. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three files, which included forensic psychiatric reports, were reviewed. The findings related to the profile of accused persons and offence characteristics indicated that: (1) history of violent behaviour is prevalent; (2) homicides mostly occur in private homes; (3) knives and firearms are most often used; (4) infidelity, separation and jealousy are common motives; (5) psychotic disorders, personality disorders and substance use disorders feature prominently. A total of 88% of the sample were found fit to stand trial and 82% were found criminally responsible. Factors significantly associated with being found fit to stand trial and criminally responsible following the forensic psychiatric observation were: male gender, having received a tertiary education, employment prior to the offence, earning a salary of more than R10 000, having no previous psychiatric or medical illness, a positive forensic history, previous intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, indicating a motive for the homicide, having no psychiatric illness at the time of the offence which would impact fitness to stand trial and criminal responsibility. Factors significantly associated with being found not fit to stand trial and not criminally responsible following the forensic psychiatric observation were: female gender, having received a primary education, unemployment prior to the offence, having a previous psychiatric or medical illness, no forensic history, no previous IPV perpetration, not indicating a motive for the homicide, having a psychiatric illness at the time of the offence which would impact fitness to stand trial and criminal responsibility. CONCLUSION: The characteristics highlighted in this study can contribute to the development of risk assessment tools which can be used to identify likely perpetrators of IPH. Other interventions, for example controlling access to knives and firearms, reducing substance abuse and improving mental health services, are also important in the prevention of IPH.","Valabdass, Sonali N.; Subramaney, Ugasvaree; Edge, Amanda",S Afr J Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182458/,428
54437,STEP‐DOWN MEDICAL UNIT AS COHORTING STRATEGY FOR SUSPECTED COVID‐19 CASES: A TERTIARY CENTRE EXPERIENCE,2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic diseases, particularly those requiring immunosuppression, are thought to be at increased risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have assessed the mental health of such patients during the current or past pandemics. We aimed to assess the incidence of depression, anxiety & stress in a cohort of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients early during the COVID-19 pandemic, & explore for association with risk of severe COVID-19 based on British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, & other factors. METHODS: A survey including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, & Perceived Stress Scale tools for depression, anxiety & stress, respectively, was administered to a cohort of IBD patients from a tertiary centre in London, United Kingdom, in June 2020. RESULTS: 274 patients responded to the survey (57% response rate), including 54 low risk, 152 moderate risk, & 68 high risk for severe COVID-19. Moderate-severe depression was observed in 61 (22.5%), moderate-severe anxiety in 49 (18%), while 39 (14%) had both diagnoses (Table). Mean (SD) stress score was 16.2 (7.4). There was no association between degree of severe COVID-19 risk & psychological morbidity. Flare symptoms & fatigue were associated with worse psychological morbidity across all measures, while accessibility of information regarding COVID-19 risk & reducing that risk was protective for depression (OR 0.56 [0.33–0.94], p=0.03), anxiety (OR 0.62 [0.4–0.96], p=0.03), & stress (standardized β-coefficient -0.15 [-0.28-(-)0.03], p=0.02) (Figure). 79 (30%) respondents were interested in receiving psychological support during the pandemic, while 200 (76%) expressed interest beyond the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety & stress among IBD patients during the pandemic are common, however their frequency is similar to pre-pandemic rates & general population levels reported during the same period. Ensuring easy access to personalized risk information with targeted psychological support may mitigate psychological burden as patients reintegrate into society & deal with future COVID-19 waves or variants.","Luber, R; Duff, A; Pavlidis, P; Honap, S; Meade, S; Ray, S; Anderson, S; Mawdsley, J; Samaan, M; Irving, P",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195022/,428
55290,Evidence-Based Public Health and the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Balance Between Science and Art?,2021-05-17,"COVID‐19 has and continues to impact every aspect of our lives. In particular, academic institutions have been and continue to be plagued with the uncertainty of how COVID‐19 will impact higher education. In the spring of 2020 all institutions were faced with the reality that remote learning would take place until the end of semester. During the fall semester of 2020 some institutions moved forward with face to face learning. However, they were quickly forced to return to remote learning as the case positivity rate increased. Higher education has offered online and distance education for decades. COVID‐19 has now forced all institutions to pivot and offer the majority if not all classes online in a distance learning environment. During this pivot my university instituted The Mastering Online Teaching Course (MOT). The main goal was to introduce instructors new to teaching hybrid or full online courses the basics and best practices for online teaching during the pandemic. The course was a four week self‐paced course that consisted of four learning modules. The objectives of the course were to 1) create a deconstructed syllabus, 2) incorporate backward design, alignment, and Transparency in Learning and Teaching (TILT) principles into online course design and delivery, 3) develop an assessment strategy that includes formative assessment, peer feedback, and authentic summative assessment, 4) create a variety of assessments in the learning management system, 5) curate and develop accessible content, all of which aligns to learner‐centered outcomes and assessments, 6) add content to the learning management system and organize it so that everything is easy for students to navigate, 7) connect assessments to the gradebook, 8) implement strategies to foster a supportive online learning community and to 9) schedule announcements and set up intelligent agents to keep students organized, up‐to‐date, and on track. During the fall of 2020 several of the objectives from the MOT were incorporated into the Determinants of Health course. This is a required course for all public health majors. The main focus of the course is to describe the major biological and physiological processes that cause ill‐health, with special focus on inflammation, infection, degeneration, neoplasm, and metabolic dysfunction. In particular, a deconstructed syllabus was created and several assessments were developed for the course per the objectives of the MOT. Moreover, a TILT assignment was developed using the Health is a Human Right Exhibit. End of the semester evaluations revealed the incorporated strategies were well received by the students. In conclusion, these are best practice strategies that are being used in a post‐COVID‐19 teaching environment to ensure students remain engaging in a remote learning environment.","King, Adrienne",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239871/,428
55753,Myocardial infarction in the COVID-19 pandemic – Reperfusion therapy revisited,2021-07-14,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans around the world. The emergence of bacterial resistance is becoming more serious; therefore, development of new vaccines is considered to be an alternative strategy against drug-resistant pathogen. In this study, we investigated the pangenome of 173 C. jejuni strains and analyzed the phylogenesis and the virulence factor genes. In order to acquire a high-quality pangenome, genomic relatedness was firstly performed with average nucleotide identity (ANI) analyses, and an open pangenome of 8,041 gene families was obtained with the correct taxonomy genomes. Subsequently, the virulence property of the core genome was analyzed and 145 core virulence factor (VF) genes were obtained. Upon functional genomics and immunological analyses, five core VF proteins with high antigenicity were selected as potential core vaccine targets for humans. Furthermore, functional annotations indicated that these proteins are involved in important molecular functions and biological processes, such as adhesion, regulation, and secretion. In addition, transcriptome analysis in human cells and pig intestinal loop proved that these vaccine target genes are important in the virulence of C. jejuni in different hosts. Comprehensive pangenome and relevant animal experiments will facilitate discovering the potential core vaccine targets with improved efficiency in reverse vaccinology. Likewise, this study provided some insights into the genetic polymorphism and phylogeny of C. jejuni and discovered potential vaccine candidates for humans. Prospective development of new vaccines using the targets will be an alternative to the use of antibiotics and prevent the development of multidrug-resistant C. jejuni in humans and even other animals.","Cao, Hengchun; Xu, Hanxiao; Ning, Chunhui; Xiang, Li; Ren, Qiufang; Zhang, Tiantian; Zhang, Yusen; Gao, Rui",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8265506/,428

This paper studies the landslide vulnerability of Tabriz using visual and statistical evidence. The evaluation of landslide susceptibility was performed using the evidential belief function model (EBF) and the index of entropy. The environmental impact assessment of landslides was carried out using the Promethean II model in three environmental, economic, and social phases. Finally, a landslide strategy plan for decision-makers was developed. The results of the analysis using the EBF model showed that 89.81% of the total area of Tabriz is located in a direct landslide vulnerability zone. The output of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve showed 83.3% accuracy of the EBF model. The impact assessment showed that for the environment, the geological criterion had an output weight of 0.396; for the economy, the road criterion had a weight of 0.477; and for the society, the commercial criterion had a weight of a 0.452; all were the most affected by landslides. The results of monitoring studies of the largest landslides in Tabriz in 1957, 1984, and 2020 showed approximately 41.65 m of land sliding over a period of 63 years. To our knowledge, this study is the first in the world to predict the environmental impact assessment and provide a strategy plan for Tabriz.","Beheshti, Ziba; Gharagozlou, Alireza; Monavari, Masoud; Zarkesh, Mirmasoud Kheirkhah",Arab J Geosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8370059/,428

59173,Neurological presentation of COVID-19: Experience from a tertiary care hospital of Bangladesh,2021-10-08,"One of the major concerns during the production of crude oil especially in tropical waters is the deposition of wax on to the walls of the pipeline. This is due to the low seabed temperatures which can be below the wax appearance temperature (WAT) which leads to wax depositing out through molecular diffusion. Currently, there are many methods to prevent and remedy wax deposition but most of these solutions pose a serious environmental threat and are expensive to produce. Hence, this research investigated the use of an organic and cheaper alternative by utilizing synthetic fatty acid esters such as oleic acid which has shown promising results in reducing the pour point of waxy crude oils. The solution that was used was of palm oil origin, crude palm oil (CPO) and crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) and was subsequently compared with the pour point depressant and wax inhibition efficiency of the current industry used inhibitors utilizing the SETA Pour Point and Cloud Point as well as the cold finger apparatus. It was observed that the palm oil inhibitors were highly effective at 1 wt.% due to the high composition of oleic acid present portraying a similar result to Triethanolamine (TEA) while Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) performed best at low concentration of 0.1 wt.% but deteriorates significantly as the concentration increases due to the polar end agglomerating among itself.","Ragunathan, Thevaruban; Wood, Colin D.; Husin, Hazlina",J Pet Explor Prod Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506093/,428

Here, we present our front-line experience of infection prevention for the psychiatric patient in the COVID era. RECENT FINDINGS: There are unique challenges surrounding COVID-19 precautions within inpatient psychiatric settings. The challenges presented to psychiatric care by COVID-19 begin in the emergency department and follow the patient through the continuum of care once admitted to the facility. Unit infrastructure, patient population, treatment modalities, staffing considerations, and discharge planning are distinct instances where COVID-19 protocols that are well-suited for other hospital settings necessitate revision for psychiatric settings.

59631,Effect of Fremanezumab on Quality of Life and Productivity in Patients With Chronic Migraine.,2020-08-03,"A new coronavirus strain known as SARS-CoV-2 has spread throughout the world. This virus is the causative agent for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission via infected droplets and aerosols generated by infected persons. While COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via food is considered theoretically possible and remains a concern for Canadian consumers. We have conducted an exposure assessment of the likelihood of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in Canadian food sources at the time of consumption. This article describes the exposure routes considered most relevant in the context of food contamination with SARS-CoV-2, including contaminated food of animal origin, other contaminated fresh foods, fomites and SARS-CoV-2 contaminated feces. The likelihood of foodborne infection of SARS-CoV-2 via the human digestive tract was also considered. Our analysis indicates that there is no evidence that foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred and we consider the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 via food and food packaging in Canada as low to remote. Adherence to safe food practices and cleaning procedures would in any case prevent a potential foodborne infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Rose-Martel, Megan; Tompkins, Elizabeth; Rutley, Rebecca; Romero-Barrios, Pablo; Buenaventura, Enrico",Journal of food protection,https://doi.org/10.4315/jfp-20-492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33770187/,428

We collected the annual and monthly laboratory data of confirmed cases from January 2004 to December 2014. In this study, we applied an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast bacillary dysentery incidence in Jiangsu, China. The ARIMA (1, 1, 1) × (1, 1, 2)12 model fitted exactly with the number of cases during January 2004 to December 2014. The fitted model was then used to predict bacillary dysentery incidence during the period January to August 2015, and the number of cases fell within the model's CI for the predicted number of cases during January-August 2015. This study shows that the ARIMA model fits the fluctuations in bacillary dysentery frequency, and it can be used for future forecasting when applied to bacillary dysentery prevention and control.","Wang, Kewei; Song, Wentao; Li, Jinping; Lu, Wu; Yu, Jiangang; Han, Xiaofeng",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539516645153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106828/,428
59921,Dietary strategies for remission of type 2 diabetes: A narrative review.,2021-07-29,"Drug-resistant hypertension (RH) remains a significant and common cardiovascular risk despite the availability of multiple potent antihypertensive medications. Uncontrolled resistant hypertension contributes substantially to excessive cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that sympathetic nervous system over-activity is the main culprit for the development and maintenance of drug-resistant hypertension. Both medical and interventional strategies, targeting the sympathetic over-activation, have been designed in patients with hypertension over the past few decades. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) and carotid baroreceptor activation therapy (BAT) have been extensively evaluated in patients with RH in clinical trials. Current trial outcomes, though at times impressive, have been mostly uncontrolled trials in need of validation. Device-based therapy for drug-resistant hypertension has the potential to provide alternative treatment options to certain groups of patients who are refractory or intolerant to current antihypertensive medications. However, more research is needed to prove its efficacy in both animal models and in humans. In this article, we will review the evidence from recent renal denervation, carotid baroreceptor stimulation therapy, and newly emerged central arteriovenous anastomosis trials to pinpoint the weak links, and speculate on potential alternative approaches.","Li, Ping; Nader, Mark; Arunagiri, Kousalya; Papademetriou, Vasilios",Current hypertension reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-016-0671-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27402013/,428

In this study, Indian traditional spices owing to various medicinal properties were tested in silico for their inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (SP) and main proteases (Mpro) play a significant role in infection development were considered as potential drug targets. METHODS A total of 75 phytochemicals present in traditional Indian spices retrieved from the published literature and Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database, were docked with Mpro (PDB IDs: 6YNQ), and the SP (PDB IDs: 6LXT and 6YOR). RESULTS Through the screening process, 75 retrieved phytochemicals were docked with spike protein (PDB IDs: 6LXT and 6YOR) and main protease (PDB ID: 6YNQ) of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, myricetin, a flavonoid (rank score: 6LXT: -11.72383; 6YOR: -9.87943; 6YNQ: -11.68164) from Allium sativumL and Isovitexin, an example of flavone (rank score:6LXT: -12.14922; 6YOR: -10.19443; 6YNQ: - 12.60603) from Pimpinella anisumL were the most potent ligands against SP and Mproof SARS-CoV-2. Whereas, Astragalin from Crocus sativusL.; Rutin from Illicium verum, Oxyguttiferone from Garcinia cambogia; Scopolin from Apium graveolens L, Luteolin from Salvia officinalis, Emodin, Aloe-emodin from Cinnamomum zeylanicium and Apigenin from Allium sativumL showed better inhibition against Mpro than SP of SARS-CoV-2. The amino acid residues like SER, LYS, ASP and TYR were found playing important role in protein-ligand interactions via hydrogen bonding and Vander Waals forces.

Methods: The groups were classified into non-users, cigarette users, and dual-users according to the present use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Data from the 2018 Korean Community Health Survey (KCHS) were used in this study. The participants were 153,646 adults aged > 19cyears. Results: One-way analysis of covariance models showed that dual-users reported significantly higher depression scores (PHQ-9) and significantly lower sleep quality (PSQI-K), respectively, than did cigarette users and non-users.

However, it is unknown how spatial processing in high-level regions contributes to recognition behavior. As face inversion is thought to disrupt typical holistic processing of information in faces, we mapped population receptive fields (pRFs) with upright and inverted faces in the human visual system. Here we show that in face-selective regions, but not primary visual cortex, pRFs and overall visual field coverage are smaller and shifted downward in response to face inversion. From these measurements, we successfully predict the relative behavioral detriment of face inversion at different positions in the visual field. This correspondence between neural measurements and behavior demonstrates how spatial processing in face-selective regions may enable holistic perception. These results not only show that spatial processing in high-level visual regions is dynamically used towards recognition, but also suggest a powerful approach for bridging neural computations by receptive fields to behavior.","Poltoratski, Sonia; Kay, Kendrick; Finzi, Dawn; Grill-Spector, Kalanit",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24806-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362883/,428

While providing information about the transduced neuron expressing a ligand-activated molecule, chemogenetics does not provide understanding about the antecedent circuit that drives that neuron's activity. For current approaches, this is not feasible, because the activating molecules are not genetically encoded. The insect allatostatin/allatostatin receptor system, a highly specific, powerful inhibitory chemogenetic approach, has this advantage, because the ligand, being a peptide, is genetically encoded. We developed viral vector-based systems to express biologically active allatostatin in neurons in vivo and allatostatin receptors in subpopulations of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate that activity-dependent release of allatostatin induces inhibition of allatostatin receptor-expressing neurons. We validate the approach in the vagal viscerosensory system where inhibitory, rather than the usual excitatory, viscerosensory input leads to sustained decreases in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and bodyweight.","Ngo, Hoai Buu; Melo, Mariana R; Layfield, Sharon; Connelly, Angela A; Bassi, Jaspreet K; Xie, Lin; Menuet, Clément; McDougall, Stuart J; Bathgate, Ross A D; Allen, Andrew M",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937120/,428

METHODS Review of the literature on suicide protective factors of suicide among older adults. RESULTS Improvements on social determinants of health and the timely detection and early treatment of affective disorders are key interventions. Prevention based on community actions and training of gatekeepers may have positive impact. Community programs that promote a sense of usefulness, belonging and that contribute to preserve social integration should be encouraged. Governments should develop the improvement of retirement programs and the development of support systems. The access to general health and mental health services should be facilitated and Primary Care professionals should receive proper training to detect and manage older persons at risk. Actively promoting a culture of coping to different stages of life and to the changes imposed by the advancing of age should form the essential part of a process bringing to better successful aging avenues.

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) can be detected by 18F-FDG-PET at diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity. However, the role of response assessment by end-of-treatment (EOT) PET has only been addressed in small case series. METHODS We performed a retrospective, multicenter study of 37 patients with CD20-positive PTLD after solid organ transplantation treated with uniform, up-to-date, first-line protocols in the prospective German PTLD registry who had received EOT 18F-FDG-PET between 2006 and 2014. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Any nonphysiological 18F-FDG uptake (Deauville score greater 2) was interpreted as PET-positive. RESULTS By computed tomography (CT) final staging, 18 of 37 patients had a complete response, 18 had a partial response and 1 patient had stable disease. EOT PET was negative in 24 of 37 patients and positive in 13 of 37 patients. The positive predictive value of EOT PET for PTLD relapse was 38%, and the negative predictive value was 92%. Time to progression (TTP) and progression-free-survival were significantly longer in the PET negative group (P = 0.019 and P = 0.013). In the 18 patients in a partial response by CT staging, we noted highly significant differences in overall survival (P = 0.001), time to progression (P = 0.007), and progression-free survival (P < 0.001) by EOT PET. CONCLUSIONS Even without baseline imaging, EOT PET in PTLD identifies patients at low risk of relapse and offers clinically relevant information, particularly in patients in a partial remission by CT staging.","Zimmermann, Heiner; Denecke, Timm; Dreyling, Martin H; Franzius, Christiane; Reinke, Petra; Subklewe, Marion; Amthauer, Holger; Kneba, Michael; Riess, Hanno; Trappe, Ralf U",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000002006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29189632/,428
63914,"Clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients in the outdoor setting.",2020-05-01,"Marine ecosystems are generally expected to have bottom-heavy trophic structure (more plants than animals) due to size-based constraints arising from increased metabolic requirements and inefficient energy transfer. However, size-based (allometric) approaches are often limited to confined trophic-level windows where energy transfer is predicted by size alone and are constrained to a balance between bottom-up and top-down control at steady state. In real food webs, energy flow is more complex and imbalances in top-down and bottom-up processes can also shape trophic structure. We expand the size-based theory to account for complex food webs and show that moderate levels of food web connectance allow for inverted trophic structure more often than predicted, especially in marine ecosystems. Trophic structure inversion occurs due to the incorporation of complex energy pathways and top-down effects on ecosystems. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems should be top-heavy, and observed bottom-heavy trophic structure may be a result of human defaunation of the ocean that has been more extreme than presently recognized.","Woodson, C B; Schramski, J R; Joye, S B",Proceedings.

Ifit2 is one such protein which can be induced by IFN or virus infection, and it is responsible for protecting mice from neuropathogenesis caused by vesicular stomatitis virus. Here, we show that Ifit2 also protects mice from pathogenesis caused by the respirovirus Sendai virus (SeV). Mice lacking Ifit2 (Ifit2(-/-)) suffered severe weight loss and succumbed to intranasal infection with SeV strain 52 at a dose that killed only a few wild-type mice. Viral RNA was detectable only in lungs, and SeV titers were higher in Ifit2(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Similar infiltration of immune cells was found in the lungs of both mouse lines, corresponding to similar levels of many induced cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, IFN-β and IFN-λ3 expression were considerably higher in the lungs of Ifit2(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, type I IFN receptor knockout (IFNAR(-/-)) mice were less susceptible to SeV than Ifit2(-/-) mice, although their pulmonary virus titers were similarly high. To test the intriguing possibility that type I IFN action enhances pathogenesis in the context of elevated SeV replication in lungs, we generated Ifit2/IFNAR(-/-) double knockout mice. These mice were less susceptible to SeV than Ifit2(-/-) mice, although viral titers in their lungs were even higher. Our results indicate that high SeV replication in the lungs of infected Ifit2(-/-) mice cooperates with elevated IFN-β induction to cause disease. IMPORTANCE The IFN system is an innate defense against virus infections. It is triggered quickly in infected cells, which then secrete IFN. Via their cell surface receptors on surrounding cells, they induce transcription of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which in turn protect these cells by inhibiting virus life cycles. Hence, IFNs are commonly considered beneficial during virus infections. Here, we report two key findings. First, lack of a single ISG in mice, Ifit2, resulted in high mortality after SeV infection of the respiratory tract, following higher virus loads and higher IFN production in Ifit2(-/-) lungs. Second, mortality of Ifit2(-/-) mice was reduced when mice also lacked the type I IFN receptor, while SeV loads in lungs still were high. This indicates that type I IFN exacerbates pathogenesis in the SeV model, and that limitation of both viral replication and IFN production is needed for effective prevention of disease.","Wetzel, Jaime L; Fensterl, Volker; Sen, Ganes C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02201-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231314/,428
64406,"Initial Outcomes of CardioClick, a Telehealth Program for Preventive Cardiac Care: Observational Study.",2021-09-09,"Reports suggest that COVID-19 affects people of color disproportionately. Texas ranks second in the count of confirmed US cases. This study examined the relationship between county-level racial/ethnic composition and COVID-19 testing/cases in Texas, adjusting for population-level demographic characteristics, health factors, and health care access measures. County-level testing and case data, obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services, were combined with the 2020 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings data. Outcome variables were tests per 100,000 population and cases per 100,000 population. The independent variable of interest was percent of racial and ethnic composition. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used. There was a statistically significant increase in COVID-19 testing/100,000 population with every 1% increase in the proportion of African Americans/Blacks (β = 2065.4; P = 0.009), Asians (β = 2056.2; P = 0.015), and Hispanics (β = 1641.1; P = 764.7). After controlling for county characteristics and cases/100,000 population, these relationships were no longer significant. However, primary care physician rate was significantly associated with testing/100,000 population (β = 64.0; P = 0.027), as was the percent of uninsured (β = -469.9; P = 0.024). An analysis of case data showed that African Americans had the largest number of cases/100,000 (β = 432.2; P = 0.001), followed by Hispanics (β = 422.8; P < 0.001) and Asians (β = 415.4; P = 0.004). As in other parts of the United States, African Americans and Hispanics are most affected by COVID-19 in Texas. Community-based strategies to improve access to testing or reduce community spread outside clinical settings should target counties with low primary care physician rates or a high proportion of uninsured residents.","Adepoju, Omolola E; Ojinnaka, Chinedum O",Population health management,https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544028/,428

This systematic review was conducted to summarize the results of the published articles assessing the incidence of heart diseases in patients infected with COVID-19. The electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and ProQuest were used to search for potentially relevant articles. Articles published from Dec 2019 to April 2020 were included. All cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective observational cohort and case-control studies were selected which reported the incidence or prevalence of myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Based on the inclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected. The incidence of cardiac injury was reported in 8 articles and 8 articles focused on the cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The incidence of new cardiac injury was reported to be 7.2-77% in live and dead patients, respectively. The results showed that patients with cardiac injury had worse outcomes including higher mortality than those without cardiac injury. The most common cardiac injury outcomes were shock and malignant arrhythmias. The most common radiographic findings in patients with cardiac injury were multiple mottling and ground-glass opacities in the lungs (64.6%). A significant number of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (46.3%) or invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 58.5%, acute kidney injury in 8.5%, electrolyte disturbances in 15.9%, hypoproteinemia in 13.4%, and coagulation disorders in 7.3% of patients with cardiac injuries. In addition, survival days were negatively correlated with cardiac troponin I levels (r = -0.42, 95%, p = 0.005). The results of this review showed that myocardial injury in patients with COVID 19 has a poor prognosis. Hence, cardiac investigation and management in these patients are crucial.","Moayed, Malihe Sadat; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Guest, Paul C; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_29; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656737/,428
66323,Residents Need Recess.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND With the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020 Paralympic Games were postponed, impacting the athletes' competition schedule for the year. Due to the interrupted competition schedule and potentially decreased motivation, Paralympic athletes may be at risk for a highly disrupted training schedule, impacting their ability to prepare for the 2021 Games. OBJECTIVE Our purpose was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the training, diet, and fitness of Paralympic cyclists and triathletes. METHODS Twenty-four paracyclists and one paratriathlete (15 females and 10 males; age 37.6 ± 9.3 years) completed two incremental exercise tests to assess sport-specific fitness and reported their training volume and intensity for a specified week prior to the pandemic (February) and again in March, April, and May (during pandemic). Participants also reported their dietary intake and sedentary screen time prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS The amount of time spent engaging in sedentary screen time increased from 4.5 to 6.1 h (p < .001). No effect of the pandemic was found for training volume (14.2 vs 12.5 h; p = .18), intensity (678 vs 650; p = .36), or dietary intake (p > .05). While fitness test duration was nominally increased for the second test (27.3 vs 27.9 min; p = .02), no difference was seen in fitness (average power output: 201 W vs 204 W; p = .5). CONCLUSION Time spent engaging in sedentary screen time activities increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there were no differences in training, fitness, or dietary intake over a short-term (3 months), demonstrating the resilience of these athletes.","Shaw, Keely A; Bertrand, Leandy; Deprez, Daton; Ko, Jongbum; Zello, Gordon A; Chilibeck, Philip D",Disability and health journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715987/,428

66488,"Diagnosed With COVID-19, Nope Just Cabin Fever: The Fundamentals of Staying at Home.",2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates collaborative teamwork by all healthcare providers including pharmacists. Since Pharmacy and Pharm. D students represent the future pharmacists, it is necessary to ensure that they have a good awareness about COVID-19 or any other pandemic that could happen in the future. OBJECTIVE The study aim was to evaluate Pharmacy and Pharm.D students' knowledge and information needs about COVID-19. METHOD A cross-sectional web-based design survey was used to assess socio-demographics and knowledge about COVID-19 amongst Pharmacy and Pharm. D students. After being validated, the questionnaire was formatted into Google forms and distributed amongst undergraduate Pharmacy and Pharm. D students in accredited Universities in Jordan. RESULTS A total of 860 Pharmacy and Pharm.D students completed the questionnaire. Results revealed moderate students' knowledge about COVID-19 (mean knowledge score was 5.6 out of 10). Students had high correct response rates in questions asking about transmission method, treatment, zoonotic transmission and medications to be avoided. However, the students demonstrated low knowledge in questions asking about the incubation period and degree of contagion scores. Several factors were associated with students' level of knowledge including the field of study and academic year. Few students relied on their faculty as the main source of information about the infection and most of them relied on self-reading and social network. CONCLUSION The results of this study clearly demonstrate an unsatisfactory level of knowledge and a lot of information needs about COVID-19 amongst Pharmacy and Pharm. D students. More efforts should be deployed to educate pharmacy students about COVID-19 with an emphasis on the need for a more active role by the universities to achieve this goal.","Jarab, Anan S; Al-Qerem, Walid; Mukattash, Tareq L; Al-Hajjeh, Douaa M",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891073/,428
66574,Pulmonary infections in the athlete.,2009,"The upper esophageal sphincter (UES) plays a central role in safe swallowing. Impaired UES opening is commonly observed in individuals presenting with impaired swallowing and various interventions are available aiming to improve bolus passage across the UES during swallowing. This scoping review addressed the following question: Which behavioral interventions are available to improve UES opening for deglutition? We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Emcare, Web of Science, SCOPUS and ProQuest for studies that met the following criteria: i. behavioral interventions targeting UES opening ii. performed over a period of time, which iii. were assessed using UES specific outcome measures. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute and GRADE frameworks. Data were extracted and synthesized into dominant themes. Of the 357 studies originally identified, 15 met inclusion criteria and reported interventions that were grouped into four intervention types: (1) floor of mouth exercises that were sub-categorized into the Shaker exercise and other strengthening exercises, (2) Mendelsohn maneuver, (3) lingual exercises and (4) mixed exercise paradigms. Across the included studies, varying levels of success in improving various aspects of UES opening metrics were reported. Nine of 15 studies evaluated patients with demonstrated swallowing impairment, whereas six studies evaluated healthy adults. Quality assessment revealed significant variability in study quality, unclear reporting of participant training and treatment fidelity, as well as training dosage. The evidence base for the four behavioral intervention approaches targeting deglutitive UES opening is limited. The translation of existing evidence to clinical practice is hindered by small sample sizes and methodological limitations. Further research in this space is warranted.","Doeltgen, Sebastian H; Kaur, Harsharan; Daniels, Stephanie K; Mohammadi, Leila; Murray, Joanne",Dysphagia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00455-021-10349-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448028/,428

METHODS In a retrospective study design, LDRLs and achievable dose (AD) were assessed for children undergoing superselective IAC for RB treatment. All procedures were performed at the flat-panel angiography systems (I) ArtisQ biplane (Siemens Healthineers) and (II) Allura Xper (Philips Healthcare). Patients were differentiated according to age (A1: 1-3 months; A2: 4-12 months; A3: 13-72 months; A4: 73 months-10 years; A5: > 10 years), sex, conducted or not-conducted chemotherapy. RESULTS 248 neurointerventional procedures of 130 pediatric patients (median age 14.5 months, range 5-127 months) with RB (68 unilateral, 62 bilateral) could be included between January 2010 and March 2020. The following diagnostic reference values, AD, and mean values could be determined: (A2) DRL 3.9 Gy cm2, AD 2.9 Gy cm2, mean 3.5 Gy cm2; (A3) DRL 7.0 Gy cm2, AD 4.3 Gy cm2, mean 6.0 Gy cm2; (A4) DRL 14.5 Gy cm2, AD 10.7 Gy cm2, mean 10.8 Gy cm2; (A5) AD 8.8 Gy cm2, mean 8.8 Gy cm2. Kruskal-Wallis-test confirmed a significant dose difference between the examined age groups (A2-A5) (p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference considering sex (p = 0.076) and conducted or not-conducted chemotherapy (p = 0.627). A successful procedure was achieved in 207/248 cases. CONCLUSION We report on radiation exposure during superselective IAC of a pediatric cohort at the German Retinoblastoma Referral Centre. Although an IAC formally represents a therapeutic procedure, our results confirm that radiation exposure lies within the exposure of a diagnostic interventional procedure. DRLs for superselective IAC are substantially lower compared with DRLs of more complex endovascular interventions.","Opitz, Marcel; Bos, Denise; Deuschl, Cornelius; Radbruch, Alexander; Zensen, Sebastian; Sirin, Selma; Forsting, Michael; Bechrakis, Nikolaos; Biewald, Eva; Bornfeld, Norbert; Ketteler, Petra; Timmermann, Beate; Stuschke, Martin; Guberina, Maja; Wetter, Axel; Göricke, Sophia; Guberina, Nika",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02540-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862237/,428
67937,COVID-19 Transmission Conclusions Justified by the Analysis Results?,2020-09-01,"Numerous studies have focused on the need to expand production of 'blue foods', defined as aquatic foods captured or cultivated in marine and freshwater systems, to meet rising population- and income-driven demand. Here we analyze the roles of economic, demographic, and geographic factors and preferences in shaping blue food demand, using secondary data from FAO and The World Bank, parameters from published models, and case studies at national to sub-national scales. Our results show a weak cross-sectional relationship between per capita income and consumption globally when using an aggregate fish metric. Disaggregation by fish species group reveals distinct geographic patterns; for example, high consumption of freshwater fish in China and pelagic fish in Ghana and Peru where these fish are widely available, affordable, and traditionally eaten. We project a near doubling of global fish demand by mid-century assuming continued growth in aquaculture production and constant real prices for fish. Our study concludes that nutritional and environmental consequences of rising demand will depend on substitution among fish groups and other animal source foods in national diets.","Naylor, Rosamond L; Kishore, Avinash; Sumaila, U Rashid; Issifu, Ibrahim; Hunter, Blaire P; Belton, Ben; Bush, Simon R; Cao, Ling; Gelcich, Stefan; Gephart, Jessica A; Golden, Christopher D; Jonell, Malin; Koehn, J Zachary; Little, David C; Thilsted, Shakuntala H; Tigchelaar, Michelle; Crona, Beatrice",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25516-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526495/,428

Background: People in need of care are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to their age and previous illnesses. At the same time, a large number of daily contacts between nursing staff and those in need of care increase the risk of transmission of the disease. AIM The study aims to illustrate (I) to what extent home care services and semi-residential care facilities are affected by COVID-19, (II) human and material resources, (III) the care situation of those in need of care and (IV) the organizational handling of the situation and outline support requests to politicians. METHODS More than 12,000 home-care nursing services and semi-residential care facilities were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements, 701 nursing services (response rate 7,3 %) and 96 semi-residential facilities (response rate 3,5 %) took part. RESULTS Almost a third (30,1 %, 189 / 627) of the nursing services surveyed are affected by confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 among clients. About half of the services report a reduced use of SGB V (47,6 %, 288 / 605) or SGB XI services (59,7 %, 375 / 628). Two thirds of the semi-residential facilities (65,6 %, 63 / 96) say they are currently closed due to the pandemic. Likewise, half of the nursing services (45,8 %, 253 / 552) reported that care with reduced use of services was at risk / unstable or even not ensured. CONCLUSIONS The results show that the situation of care-dependent people served by home-care services in the present pandemic - and also with a view to a possible second wave - should receive increased attention particularly with regard to unstable / risky care arrangements.","Wolf-Ostermann, Karin; Schmidt, Annika; Preuß, Benedikt; Heinze, Franziska; Seibert, Kathrin; Friedrich, Anna-Carina; Domhoff, Dominik; Stolle, Claudia; Rothgang, Heinz",Pflege,https://doi.org/10.1024/1012-5302/a000761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996858/,428

METHODS The demographic data of 43 COVID-19 patients identified in Weifang were used to investigate whether they had traveled to epidemic areas and whether they had close contact with confirmed cases. On admission, patients' symptoms and results of laboratory tests and imaging were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 43 COVID-19 patients. including 9 third generation infected cases, 16 (37.2%) were imported, who infected the rest. Most cases were middle-aged with approximate sex ratio. A ""super spreader"", Mr. Zhang made it necessary to quarantine 69 medical personnel. Mr. Zhang directly infected six individuals who, in turn, infected another six individuals. Another patient, Mr. Wang, spread the infection to his five family members at a family gathering. Subsequently, the daughter infected her husband. The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever, weakness, dry cough, and cough sputum. In most patients, white blood cell counts were not elevated and lymphocyte counts were decreased. Elevated C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) levels were commonly observed. There was no death among the patients or infection among the medical staff. CONCLUSIONS The infection by the COVID-19 in Weifang was mostly the result of close contact with imported cases.

METHODS During the period from January 1997 to June 2009, 216 patients received initial peritoneal catheters. For the present study, patients were divided into four groups according to the catheter types and the surgery techniques: TO-S: traditional open surgery, straight Tenckhoff catheter TO-C: traditional open surgery, coiled Tenckhoff catheter TO-SN: traditional open surgery, swan-neck catheter MO-S: modified open surgery, straight Tenckhoff catheter The modified surgery was characterized by a low incision site, a short intra-abdominal catheter segment and an additional upward straight subcutaneous tunnel. All patients were followed up for 2 years or until death. Survival rates, complications caused by catheter placement, and the probability of malfunction-free catheter survival were compared between the groups. RESULTS Catheter malfunction was the most frequent mechanical complication, found in 31 patients (14.4%), who experienced 38 malfunctions. Only 2 episodes of catheter malfunction were found in the MO-S group, representing a rate significantly less than those in the TO-S and TO-C groups (both p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curves for malfunction-free PD catheter survival showed a significantly different malfunction-free probability for the various groups (p = 0.009). After 2 years of follow-up, 136 patients (63.0%) survived with their initial PD catheter. The initial catheter survival rate was 76.8% in the MO-S group. Kaplan-Meier curves for initial catheter survival showed that the highest survival rate was found in the MO-S group (p = 0.001).

General dental practices are obligated by NHS guidance to remain open and provide remote consultation and referral where appropriate to patients having pain or problems. AIMS To compare two urgent dental centres with different triage and referral systems with regard to quality and appropriateness of referrals, and patient management outcomes. METHODS 110 consecutive referrals received by a primary care urgent dental centre and a secondary care urgent dental centre were assessed. It was considered whether the patients referred had access to remote primary care dental services, fulfilled the criteria required to be deemed a dental emergency as mandated by NHS guidance, and what the outcomes of referrals were. RESULTS At the primary care centre, 100% of patients were referred by general dental practitioners and had access to remote primary care dental services. 95.5% of referrals were deemed appropriate and were seen for treatment. At the secondary care site, 94.5% of referrals were direct from the patient by contacting NHS 111. 40% had received triaging to include 'advice, analgesia and antimicrobial' from a general dental practitioner, and 25.5% were deemed appropriate and resulted in treatment. CONCLUSION Urgent dental centres face many issues, and it would seem that easy access to primary care services, collaboration between primary care clinicians and urgent dental centres, and training of triaging staff are important in operating a successful system.","Shathur, Adam; Reeves, Samuel; Sameja, Faizal; Patel, Vishal; Jones, Allan",Primary dental journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050168420980961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722140/,428

Italy was the European epicenter for virus spread and one with most cases and deaths. The first Italian patient was diagnosed on February 18th, a young man hospitalized in Lombardy (Northern Italy). The Italian government not only isolated the village where he lived, but a few days later put the entire country in lockdown. We have here analyzed the COVID-19 Italian data during the first three months after the outbreak and the effect of lockdown. COVID-19 virus has a high transmission rate and is associated with high fatality rate especially in the older population. The initial reproduction rate of the virus (R0) in Italy was between 2.1 and 3.3 in different Italian regions, with a doubling time between 2.7 and 3.2 days. The number of confirmed cases has now reached 229,000 but after the lockdown R0 is finally below 1. Despite the lockdown, the number of infected and deceased patients in Italy was very high, with a lethality rate higher than in other countries. It is likely that number of cases is underestimating the real since the number of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic is relatively high. It is important to investigate which patients are more vulnerable and also if other co-factors can account for this high fatality rate, since this pandemia is far from being resolved.","Gastaldelli, Amalia; Mirco, Gastaldelli; Simone, Bastianoni",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.1779147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064066/,428

This study aimed to evaluate the early and late results of MICS for MVRp vs conventional sternotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review of randomized controlled trials or observational studies (with matched populations) comparing MICS and conventional MVRp reporting any of the following outcomes: mortality, MVRp failure, complications, blood transfusion, readmission within 30 days after discharge, long-term reoperation for mitral regurgitation, operative times, mechanical ventilation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or hospital stay. The pooled treatment effects were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS Ten studies involving 6792 patients (MICS: 3396 patients; Conventional: 3296 patients) met the eligibility criteria. In the pooled analysis, MICS significantly reduced the risk for blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR], 0.654; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.462-0.928; P = .017) and readmission within 30 days after discharge (OR, 0.615; 95% 0.456-0.829; P = .001). MICS was associated with a significantly longer cross-clamp time (mean difference 14 minutes; 95% CI, 7.4-21 minutes; P < .001), CPB time (24 minutes; 95% CI, 14-35 minutes; P < .001), and total operative time (36; 95% CI, 15-56 minutes; P < .001), but a significantly shorter ICU stay (-8.5; 95% CI -15; -1.8; P = .013) and hospital stay (-1.3, 95% CI -2.1; -0.45; P = .003). This meta-analysis found no significant difference regarding the risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality, nor complications. CONCLUSIONS Despite longer operative times, MICS for MVRp reduces ICU and hospital stay, as well as readmission rates and the need for transfusion.","Sá, Michel Pompeu B O; Van den Eynde, Jef; Cavalcanti, Luiz Rafael P; Kadyraliev, Bakytbek; Enginoev, Soslan; Zhigalov, Konstantin; Ruhparwar, Arjang; Weymann, Alexander; Dreyfus, Gilles",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668091/,428

74007,Interventions targeted at reducing diagnostic error: systematic review.,2021-08-18,"INTRODUCTION In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 originated from China, and spread rapidly to several countries, bringing a frightening scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE). The CDC recommends N95 or higher-level particulate filtering respirators as part of the PPE while caring for patients with COVID-19, with facemasks as an alternative; and cloth face-coverings in public where social distancing of at least 6-feet is not feasible. With new evidence about the efficacy of facemasks, knowledge gaps remain. AREAS COVERED This reviews the history of respiratory viral pandemics and PPE use, exploring the influenza pandemics of the 20th and 21st century, and prior coronavirus pandemics. A literature search of PubMed and google was done between March 22nd to May 2nd, and on September 28, 2020. The evidence for PPE is described, to delineate their efficacy and 'best safe' practices. Solutions to ameliorate pandemic preparedness to meet surge-capacity to efficiently combat future pandemics, should they arise, are discussed. EXPERT OPINION PPE, when used appropriately in addition to other infection control measures, is effective protection during respiratory viral pandemics. The current evidence suggests that wearing facemasks in the community is protective, especially if used consistently and correctly with other infection control measures such as hand hygiene.","Eke, Uzoamaka A; Eke, Ahizechukwu",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1865812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322947/,428

75058,Impaired Exercise-induced Hypoalgesia in Individuals Reporting an Increase in Low Back Pain During Acute Exercise.,2021-01-05,"iNOS plays an important role in mediating inflammation. In this study, we found that iNOS-derived NO was increased 2.4-fold in the serum samples of 101 patients infected with influenza A virus in comparison with samples of 105 healthy individuals. In A549 human lung epithelial cells, infection with influenza A virus or stimulation with poly(I:C)+IFN-gamma resulted in increased mRNA and protein levels of both IL-32 and iNOS, with subsequent release of NO. Over-expression of IL-32 resulted in upregulated iNOS expression with subsequent NO production. Knock down of IL-32 by IL-32-specific siRNA resulted in the inhibition of dsRNA-induced expression of iNOS and NO release, indicating that IL-32 is an upstream regulatory factor of dsRNA-triggered iNOS production. Surprisingly, over-expression of iNOS resulted in the reduction of IL-32 expression, and suppression of iNOS by the selective iNOS inhibitor S-methylisothiourea sulfate stimulated IL-32 expression, indicating that a negative feedback mechanism operates between the iNOS/NO and IL-32 systems. These findings suggest that influenza A virus infection activates IL-32 and iNOS expression by a heretofore unrecognized complex mechanism, in which the two pro-inflammatory factors regulate each other, involving positive and negative feedback regulatory loops.","Li, Wei; Yang, Fang; Liu, Yan; Gong, Rui; Liu, Li; Feng, Yong; Hu, Pan; Sun, Wei; Hao, Qian; Kang, Lei; Wu, Jianguo; Zhu, Ying",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.200838885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19291698/,428

77627,Up to 2.2 million people experiencing disability suffer collateral damage each day of Covid-19 lockdown in Europe.,2020-05-08,"BACKGROUND Skills in single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) are difficult to acquire. Simulation training leads to skill acquisition but circumstances about skill deterioration are unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate skill acquisition and retention after single-incision laparoscopic simulation training. METHODS From October 2013 to January 2014, 30 surgically naive participants underwent a SILS training curriculum and completed two validated tasks (peg transfer, precision cutting) with subsequent testing to assess acquisition of skills (baseline testing, BT). The participants were randomized into two groups and skill retention testing (RT) was measured after 4 weeks (group A) or 12 weeks (group B). Task completion was measured in time with penalties for inaccurate performance. RESULTS A SILS training curriculum was established. 90 % of the participants completed the training successfully and reached the required levels of proficiency. Comparison of BT and RT revealed significantly better RT performances for peg transfer and precision cutting in group A (P < 0.05). These effects were not seen for RT in group B. Evaluating the RT performance of both groups, group A showed a non-significant trend for improved peg transfer and precision cutting compared to group B. CONCLUSION A proficiency-based training curriculum for acquisition of basic SILS skills was successfully established in our department. The results of this study indicate that acquired SILS skills are well retained for a short period without training (4 weeks) but a longer non-training period (12 weeks) resulted in a significant loss of acquired skills. For enhancement of surgical skills, specialised SILS training curricula could be developed for novices and inexperienced surgeons; however, continuous training is essential to maintain these acquired skills.","Varley, Martin; Choi, Ryan; Kuan, Kean; Bhardwaj, Neil; Trochsler, Markus; Maddern, Guy; Hewett, Peter; Mees, Soeren Torge",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3647-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005011/,428
78263,Welcome to the 11th Volume of Pain Management.,2020-11-25,"OBJECTIVES : As efforts to control COVID-19 continue, we simulate hypothetical emergence of wild poliovirus assuming an immunologically naïve population. This differs from the current global experience with polio and serves as a model for responding to future pandemics. METHODS : Applying an established global model, we assume a fully susceptible global population to polioviruses, independently introduce a virus with properties of each of the three stable wild poliovirus serotypes, and explore the impact of strategies that range from doing nothing to seeking global containment and eradication. RESULTS : We show the dynamics of paralytic cases as the virus spreads globally. We demonstrate the difficulty of eradication unless aggressive efforts begin soon after initial disease detection. Different poliovirus serotypes lead to different trajectories and burdens of disease. In the absence of aggressive measures, the virus would become globally endemic in 2-10 years, and cumulative paralytic cases would exceed 4-40 million depending on serotype, with the burden of disease shifting to younger ages. CONCLUSIONS : The opportunity to eradicate emerging infections represents an important public policy choice. If the world first observed the emergence of wild poliovirus in 2020, adopting aggressive control strategies would be required to prevent a devastating global pandemic.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A; Badizadegan, Kamran",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1891888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33624568/,428

Our aim was to describe the patients admitted to our local hospital with COVID-19 in the spring of 2020. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data were retrieved retrospectively from our local quality register for COVID-19 and include all patients admitted to Østfold Hospital in the period 10 March 2020-31 May 2020. RESULTS A total of 70 patients were admitted, of whom 47 (67 %) were men. The mean age was 59 years (range 18-95). The most common comorbid conditions were obesity (n = 22, 31 %), chronic coronary artery disease (n = 21, 30 %) and diabetes (n = 17, 24 %). Thirteen patients (19 %) had no comorbidities.

79020,Changes in Motor Coordination Induced by Local Fatigue during a Sprint Cycling Task.,2018,"OBJECTIVES Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a newly defined complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection that can result in cardiogenic shock in the pediatric population. Early detection of cardiac dysfunction is imperative in directing therapy and identifying patients at highest risk for deterioration. This study compares the strengths of conventional and strain echocardiography in identifying cardiac dysfunction in critically ill children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and their association with ICU therapeutic needs and clinical outcomes. DESIGN Retrospective, observational cohort study. SETTING A large, quaternary care PICU. PATIENTS Sixty-five pediatric patients admitted to the PICU with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children from March 2020 to March 2021. INTERVENTIONS Global longitudinal strain four chamber was measured retrospectively by strain echocardiography and compared with conventional echocardiography. Cardiac dysfunction was defined by left ventricular ejection fraction less than 55% and global longitudinal strain four chamber greater than or equal to -17.2%. Clinical variables examined included cardiac biomarkers, immune therapies, and ICU interventions and outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Twenty-four patients (37%) had abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction and 56 (86%) had abnormal global longitudinal strain four chamber. Between patients with normal and abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, we failed to identify a difference in cardiac biomarker levels, vasoactive use, respiratory support needs, or ICU length of stay. Global longitudinal strain four chamber was associated with maximum cardiac biomarker levels. Abnormal global longitudinal strain four chamber was associated with greater odds of any vasoactive use (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.3-25.3; z-statistic, 2.3; p = 0.021). The number of days of vasoactive infusion was correlated with global longitudinal strain four chamber (r = 0.400; 95% CI, 2.4-3.9; p < 0.001). Children with abnormal strain had longer ICU length of stay (4.5 d vs 2 d; p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest strain echocardiography can detect abnormalities in cardiac function in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients unrecognized by conventional echocardiography. These abnormalities are associated with increased use of intensive care therapies. Evaluation of these patients with strain echocardiography may better identify those with myocardial dysfunction and need for more intensive therapy.","Basu, Sonali; Kim, Esther J; Sharron, Matthew P; Austin, Ashley; Pollack, Murray M; Harahsheh, Ashraf S; Dham, Niti",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636357/,428

The purpose of this study was to investigate geometrical changes caused by closed-cell design stents in bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms. METHODS 31 patients with 34 aneurysms underwent SACE with closed-cell design stents. Inflow angle α, determined by aneurysm neck and afferent vessel, and angle between afferent and efferent vessel close to (δ1), respectively, more remote from the aneurysm neck (δ2) were graphically determined in 2D angiography projections. RESULTS Stent assisted coiling resulted in a significant increase of all three angles from a mean value (±SEM) of α = 119° (±6.5°) pretreatment to 130° (±6.6°) posttreatment (P ≤ .001), δ1 = 129° (±6.4°) to 139° (±6.1°), (P ≤ .001) and δ2 = 115° (±8.4°) to 126° (±7.5°), (P ≤ .01). Angular change of δ1 in AcomA aneurysms was significant greater compared to sidewall aneurysms (26°±4.9° versus 8°± 2.3°, P ≤ .05). The initial angle of δ1 and δ2 revealed a significantly inverse relationship to the angle increase (δ1: r = -0.41, P ≤ .05 and δ2: r = -0.47, P ≤ .01). Moreover, angle δ1 was significantly higher in unruptured compared to ruptured aneurysms (135°±7.1° versus 103°±10.8°, P ≤ .05). CONCLUSION Stent deployment modulates the geometry of the aneurysm-vessel complex, which may lead to favorable hemodynamic changes more similar to unruptured than to ruptured aneurysms. Our findings also suggest that the more acute-angled aneurysm-vessel anatomy, the larger the angular change. Further studies are needed to investigate whether these changes improve the clinical outcome.","Beller, Ebba; Klopp, David; Göttler, Jens; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Zimmer, Claus; Kirschke, Jan S; Prothmann, Sascha",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27073908/,428

80073,System dynamics modeling as a potentially useful tool in analyzing mitigation strategies to reduce overdose deaths associated with pharmaceutical opioid treatment of chronic pain.,2011,"BACKGROUND Although widely used in the evaluation of the diseased, normal intracranial pressure and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure remain sparsely documented. Intracranial pressure is different from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In addition, intracranial pressure differs considerably according to the body position of the patient. Despite this, the current reference values do not distinguish between intracranial and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressures, and body position-dependent reference values do not exist. In this study, we aim to establish these reference values. METHOD A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Sciences. Methodological quality was assessed using an amended version of the Joanna Briggs Quality Appraisal Checklist. Intracranial pressure and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure were independently evaluated and subdivided into body positions. Quantitative data were presented with mean ± SD, and 90% reference intervals. RESULTS Thirty-six studies were included. Nine studies reported values for intracranial pressure, while 27 reported values for the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Reference values for intracranial pressure were - 5.9 to 8.3 mmHg in the upright position and 0.9 to 16.3 mmHg in the supine position. Reference values for lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure were 7.2 to 16.8 mmHg and 5.7 to 15.5 mmHg in the lateral recumbent position and supine position, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review is the first to provide position-dependent reference values for intracranial pressure and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Clinically applicable reference values for normal lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure were established, and are in accordance with previously used reference values. For intracranial pressure, this study strongly emphasizes the scarcity of normal pressure measures, and highlights the need for further research on the matter.","Norager, Nicolas Hernandez; Olsen, Markus Harboe; Pedersen, Sarah Hornshoej; Riedel, Casper Schwartz; Czosnyka, Marek; Juhler, Marianne",Fluids and barriers of the CNS,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12987-021-00253-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849603/,428

The alteration of local marine ecosystems towards a more temperate state and the appearance/range expansion of subarctic-boreal species at higher latitudes is a complex phenomenon induced mainly by the changing properties of Atlantic water (AW) transported from the south. Areas under the direct influence of AW experience biological Atlantification of their communities on all trophic levels, resulting in the growing complexity of arctic food webs. Here, besides summarising the main documented messages of biological Atlantification, we take a critical view on the threat posed on Arctic marine communities. We take into account the formation of the Arctic marine fauna, as well as the nature of (re)colonisation of Arctic sites by boreal organisms when evaluating the extent of the issue. We take a look at the history of Arctic colonisations by boreal organisms in an attempt to identify 'neonative taxa returning home'.

Novel technologies represent promising tools for their management, the use of which has been greatly encouraged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study is to compare a web-based nutritional intervention versus a traditional one, before and during the Italian 'lockdown' period due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in overweight and obese subjects affected by T2D or impaired glucose regulation (IGR). METHODS For the study, 36 subjects were randomly allocated into two arms: a traditional arm, providing face-to-face individual and group-based intervention; and a web arm, deploying the in-presence traditional approach with intervention provided through web technologies. The outcomes were the data resulting from the comparison between the subjects' anthropometric and clinical parameters as well as PREDIMED scores at baseline with those at 3 months (T3), 6 months (T6) and at lockdown. RESULTS In the web arm we detected a progressive reduction in weight and body mass index (BMI) from baseline to T6 and a minimal increase of both parameters during the lockdown. Improvement of these parameters compared with baseline was observed in controls during the lockdown. The PREDIMED score improved at T6 compared with baseline in both arms. Significant variations were observed considering weight (p < 0.001), BMI (p = 0.001) and PREDIMED scores (p = 0.023) over time.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the IgG antibody production against S and N antigens of the virus and their correlation with the time and severity of the disease. METHODS The IgG antibodies against S and N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens 72 symptomatic patients who tested real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the ELISA technique. Different antibody response was compared and the correlation with the time from disease onset and the severity was evaluated. RESULTS Forty-eight of 72 (67%) patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while 24 (33%) did not have detectable antibodies. Comparison of antibody levels for N and S antibodies showed that they correlate with each other well (r= 0.81; P< 0.001). However, sensitivity of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG and anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 30% and 60%, during the first 7 days after symptom onset (r= 0.53; P= 0.111), but increased to 73% and 68% at more than 1-week post symptom onset (r= 0.89, P= 0.111), respectively. Cases with positive IgG response showed a decreased CD8 cell percentage compared to the negative IgG groups (26 ± 14 vs. 58 ± 32, p= 0.066 in anti-N IgG group and 28 ± 15 vs. 60 ± 45, p= 0.004 in anti-S IgG group, respectively). CONCLUSION Nearly one-third of the confirmed COVID-19 patients had negative serology results. Lower percent positivity at early time points after symptom onset (less than 1 week) was seen using anti-S SARS-COV-2 IgG kit compare to the anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG; therefore, clinicians should interpret negative serology results of especially anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG with caution.","Rezaei, Mitra; Sadeghi, Mohammadhadi; Korourian, Alireza; Tabarsi, Payam; Porabdollah, Mihan; Askari, Elham; Mortaz, Esmaeil; Mahmoudi, Shima; Marjani, Majid",Human antibodies,https://doi.org/10.3233/hab-210440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720878/,428

85605,Software tools to support title and abstract screening for systematic reviews in healthcare: an evaluation.,2020-01-13,"Background Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is increasingly performed in specialized centers. While there is a trend towards a parenchyma-sparing strategy in multimodal treatment for CLM, its role is yet unclear. In this study we present short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic parenchyma-sparing liver resection (LPSLR) at a single center. Patients and methods LLR were performed in 951 procedures between August 1998 and March 2017 at Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Patients who primarily underwent LPSLR for CLM were included in the study. LPSLR was defined as non-anatomic hence the patients who underwent hemihepatectomy and sectionectomy were excluded. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. The Accordion classification was used to grade postoperative complications. The median follow-up was 40 months. Results 296 patients underwent primary LPSLR for CLM. A single specimen was resected in 204 cases, multiple resections were performed in 92 cases. 5 laparoscopic operations were converted to open. The median operative time was 134 minutes, blood loss was 200 ml and hospital stay was 3 days. There was no 90-day mortality in this study. The postoperative complication rate was 14.5%. 189 patients developed disease recurrence. Recurrence in the liver occurred in 146 patients (49%), of whom 85 patients underwent repeated surgical treatment (liver resection [n = 69], ablation [n = 14] and liver transplantation [n = 2]). Five-year overall survival was 48%, median overall survival was 56 months. Conclusions LPSLR of CLM can be performed safely with the good surgical and oncological results. The technique facilitates repeated surgical treatment, which may improve survival for patients with CLM.","Aghayan, Davit L; Pelanis, Egidijus; Avdem Fretland, Åsmund; Kazaryan, Airazat M; Sahakyan, Mushegh A; Røsok, Bård I; Barkhatov, Leonid; Bjørnbeth, Bjørn Atle; Jakob Elle, Ole; Edwin, Bjørn",Radiology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.1515/raon-2017-0046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29520204/,428

A histological examination of the palatine tonsils of 22 children aged 5 to 14 years old who had a paratonsillar abscess and 18 children suffering from chronic tonsillitis was carried out. Fragments of small salivary glands, located both superficially, in the mucous membrane between the stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium and the lymphoid tissue of the palatine tonsils, and between the muscles of the amygdala were found in 42 of the 80 (52.5%) tonsils studied. Along with the unchanged glandular structure, 26 (61.9%) samples revealed areas of destruction foci in small salivary glands with signs of inflammatory and compensatory regenerative activity. The presence of separate interlobular ducts of the salivary glands with pronounced periductal lymph - macrophage infiltration was noted. The subepithelial lymph-macrophage infiltrates found in the lamina propria are associated with the exit of the excretory ducts of the salivary glands to the surface of the mucous membrane. Many thin-walled veins are surrounded by perivascular lymphocellular infiltrates. The inflammatory and post-inflammatory changes in the small salivary glands revealed by us in children with chronic tonsillitis do not exclude their participation in the pathogenesis of paratonsillitis. At the same time, inflammation in the salivary gland can be both primary, as a result of its infection with live microorganisms from the tissues of the tonsil, and secondary, due to the compression of the excretory ducts by the edematous tissue of the tonsil in acute tonsillitis.","Kim, A S; Boyko, N V; Stagnieva, I V; Panchenko, S N",Vestnik otorinolaringologii,https://doi.org/10.17116/otorino20218601141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720650/,428

87807,Implementing a Virtual Flipped Classroom in a Rheumatology Fellowship Program.,2021-09-22,"Background & objectives : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far affected over 41 million people globally. The limited supply of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) kits and reagents has made meeting the rising demand for increased testing incompetent, worldwide. A highly sensitive and specific antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is the need of the hour. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based test (index test) compared with a clinical reference standard (rRT-PCR). Methods : A cross-sectional, single-blinded study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Paired samples were taken for RDT and rRT-PCR (reference standard) from consecutive participants screened for COVID-19 to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT. Further subgroup analysis was done based on the duration of illness and cycle threshold values. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the two tests. Results : Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 99.6 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity of RDT was higher (85.9%) in participants with a duration of illness ≤5 days. Interpretation & conclusions : With an excellent specificity and moderate sensitivity, this RDT may be used to rule in COVID-19 in patients with a duration of illness ≤5 days. Large-scale testing based on this RDT across the country would result in quick detection, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Gupta, Ankesh; Khurana, Surbhi; Das, Rojaleen; Srigyan, Deepankar; Singh, Amit; Mittal, Ankit; Singh, Parul; Soneja, Manish; Kumar, Arvind; Singh, Akhil Kant; Soni, Kapil Dev; Meena, Suneeta; Aggarwal, Richa; Sharad, Neha; Aggarwal, Anivita; Kadnur, Harshith; George, Netto; Singh, Komal; Desai, Devashish; Trilangi, Praveen; Khan, Adil Rashid; Kiro, Vandana V; Naik, Shivdas; Arunan, Bharthi; Goel, Shivam; Patidar, Diksha; Lathwal, Amit; Dar, Lalit; Trikha, Anjan; Pandey, Ravindra Mohan; Malhotra, Rajesh; Guleria, Randeep; Mathur, Purva; Wig, Naveet",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_3305_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33146157/,428

A increase in the number of complex liver resections has determined a growing interest in new devices able to 'optimize' the liver transection. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare a radiofrequency vessel-sealing system with the 'gold-standard' clamp-crushing technique. METHODS From January to December 2012, 100 consecutive patients undergoing a liver resection were randomized to the radiofrequency vessel-sealing system (LF1212 group; N = 50) or to the clamp-crushing technique (Kelly group, N = 50). RESULTS Background characteristics of the two groups were similar. There were not significant differences between the two groups in terms of blood loss, transection time and transection speed. In spite of a not-significant larger transection area in the LF1212 group compared with the Kelly group (51.5 versus 39 cm(2) , P = 0.116), the overall and 'per cm(2) ' blood losses were similar whereas the transection speed was better (even if not significantly) in the LF1212 group compared with the Kelly group (1.1 cm(2) /min versus 0.8, P = 0.089). Mortality, morbidity and bile leak rates were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS The radiofrequency vessel-sealing system allows a quick and safe liver transection similar to the gold-standard clamp-crushing technique.","Muratore, Andrea; Mellano, Alfredo; Tarantino, Giuseppe; Marsanic, Patrizia; De Simone, Michele; Di Benedetto, Fabrizio",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/hpb.12207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467672/,428

What triggers SD in intracerebral hemorrhage is poorly understood. We employed intrinsic optical signaling, laser speckle flowmetry, and electrocorticography to elucidate the mechanisms triggering SD in a collagenase model of intracortical hemorrhage in mice. Hematoma growth, SD occurrence, and cortical blood flow changes were tracked. During early hemorrhage (0-4 h), 17 out of 38 mice developed SDs, which always originated from the hematoma. No SD was detected at late time points (8-52 h). Neither hematoma size, nor peri-hematoma perfusion were associated with SD occurrence. Further, arguing against ischemia as a trigger factor, normobaric hyperoxia did not inhibit SD occurrence. Instead, SDs always occurred during periods of rapid hematoma growth, which was two-fold faster immediately preceding an SD compared with the peak growth rates in animals that did not develop any SDs. Induced hypertension accelerated hematoma growth and resulted in a four-fold increase in SD occurrence compared with normotensive animals. Altogether, our data suggest that spontaneous SDs in this intracortical hemorrhage model are triggered by the mechanical distortion of tissue by rapidly growing hematomas.","Fischer, Paul; Sugimoto, Kazutaka; Chung, David Y; Tamim, Isra; Morais, Andreia; Takizawa, Tsubasa; Qin, Tao; Gomez, Carlos A; Schlunk, Frieder; Endres, Matthias; Yaseen, Mohammad A; Sakadzic, Sava; Ayata, Cenk",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x20951993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936730/,428
90264,Is Sport Activity Possible After Arthroscopic Meniscal Allograft Transplantation? Midterm Results in Active Patients.,2016,"This study describes the molecular characterization of avian reoviruses (ARVs) isolated during an outbreak in commercial chickens between 2015 and 2016. In addition, a pathogenicity study of a selected ARV strain isolated from a field case of viral tenosynovitis in commercial broiler chickens was performed. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of a 1088-bp fragment of the ARV S1 gene, the investigated sequences were differentiated into five distinct genotypic clusters (GCs), namely GC1, GC2, GC3, GC4, and GC6. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and commercial broiler chickens were challenged with the GC1 genetic type MK247011, at 14 days of age via the interdigital toe web. No significant effects in body weight gain and feed conversion were detected in both chicken types. The Δ interdigital web thickness was most severe at 4 days postchallenge (DPC) in both the SPF and broiler subgroups. The inflammation in SPF birds was slightly more severe compared with broilers. Neither mortality nor clinical signs occurred in the infected groups for the duration of the experiment, despite the presence of significant microscopic lesions in challenged birds. Microscopic changes of tenosynovitis became evident at 3 DPC, with the highest incidence and severity detected at 14 and 21 DPC, respectively. Seroconversion against ARV occurred 3 wk postchallenge, and the microscopic lesions detected in tendon and heart sections were highly compatible with those described in the field. Increased severity of tenosynovitis and epicarditis lesions were noted in the ARV-challenged groups compared with the control groups. Although SPF and broiler chickens showed comparable responses to the challenge with an ARV genetic variant, detected lesions were subclinical, denoting the limitations of our challenge approach. The age selected in this experiment possibly influenced the course of the infection. Data from this study highlight the genotypic diversity of isolates in California, and the outcome of the pathogenicity study can be used as a basis to improve protocols for pathogenicity studies to characterize ARV variants causing clinical disease in the field.","Crispo, Manuela; Stoute, Simone T; Hauck, Rüdiger; Egaña-Labrin, Sofia; Sentíes-Cué, C Gabriel; Cooper, George L; Bickford, Arthur A; Corsiglia, C; Shivaprasad, H L; Crossley, Beate; Gallardo, Rodrigo A",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/12013-121418-reg.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31967428/,428

METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE and EMBASE for existing systematic reviews and individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were included if they investigated the usage intratympanic steroids in patients aged 18 and above, with definite or probable Menière's disease. The quality of the identified existing reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The risk of bias in RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and overall quality of the individual outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method. RESULTS The literature search provided four systematic reviews, from which one yielded a sufficient AMSTAR evaluation and subsequently provided three RCTs relevant for inclusion. Due to the lack of sufficient reporting of the data, quantitative synthesis was not applicable. In the qualitative synthesis for the primary outcome, the results from the RCTs showed that there was a slight indication of steroid treatment reducing the frequency of vertiginous attacks. No serious adverse events were reported. Based on the GRADE approach the quality for both findings is very low. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION The effect of intratympanic steroid treatment in Menière's disease is questionable. There is a great need for further research to sufficiently assess whether steroid treatment may be considered as a safe and effective treatment for patients with Menière's disease.","Devantier, Louise; Djurhuus, Bjarki Ditlev; Hougaard, Dan Dupont; Händel, Mina Nicole; Guldfred, Frank Liviu-Adelin; Schmidt, Jesper Hvass; Edemann-Callesen, Henriette","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135678/,428

Some evidence has indicated that a vascular aetiology may be implicated. We used contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and echocardiography to study renal perfusion and global blood flow and compared our findings with measurements taken in a group of septic shock patients and healthy volunteers. METHODS Prospective case-control study. Renal perfusion variables were assessed with contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS); macrovascular blood flow was assessed using Doppler analysis of large renal vessels; echocardiography was used to assess right and left heart function and cardiac output. RESULTS CEUS derived parameters were reduced in in COVID-19 associated AKI compared to healthy controls (perfusion index 3415 v 548 a.u., p = 0·001; renal blood volume 7794 v 3338 a.u., p = 0·04). Renal arterial flow quantified using time averaged peak velocity (TAPV) was also reduced compared to healthy controls (36·6 v 20·9 cm/s, p = 0.004) despite cardiac index being similar between groups (2.8 v 3.7 L/min/m2, p = 0.07). There were no differences in CEUS derived or cardiac parameters between COVID-19 and septic shock patients but patients with septic shock had more heterogeneous perfusion variables. CONCLUSION Both large and small vessel blood flow is reduced in patients with COVID-19 associated AKI compared to healthy controls, which does not appear to be a consequence of right or left heart dysfunction. A reno-vascular pathogenesis of COVID-19 AKI seems likely.","Watchorn, James; Huang, Dean Y; Joslin, Jennifer; Bramham, Kate; Hutchings, Sam D",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890313/,428
92998,Prediction Models for COVID-19 Need Further Improvements.,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND Various techniques have been employed for the early detection of perioperative cerebral ischaemia and hypoxia. Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is increasingly used in this clinical scenario to monitor brain oxygenation. However, it is unknown whether perioperative cerebral NIRS monitoring and the subsequent treatment strategies are of benefit to patients. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of perioperative cerebral NIRS monitoring and corresponding treatment strategies in adults and children, compared with blinded or no cerebral oxygenation monitoring, or cerebral oxygenation monitoring based on non-NIRS technologies, on the detection of cerebral oxygen desaturation events (CDEs), neurological outcomes, non-neurological outcomes and socioeconomic impact (including cost of hospitalization and length of hospital stay). SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 12), Embase (1974 to 20 December 2016) and MEDLINE (PubMed) (1975 to 20 December 2016). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing studies on 20 December 2016. We updated this search in November 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated in the review. We imposed no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) dealing with the use of cerebral NIRS in the perioperative setting (during the operation and within 72 hours after the operation), including the operating room, the postanaesthesia care unit and the intensive care unit. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. As we expected clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies, we employed a random-effects model for analyses and we examined the data for heterogeneity (I2 statistic). We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADEpro. MAIN RESULTS We included 15 studies in the review, comprising a total of 1822 adult participants. There are 12 studies awaiting classification, and eight ongoing studies.None of the 15 included studies considered the paediatric population. Four studies were conducted in the abdominal and orthopaedic surgery setting (lumbar spine, or knee and hip replacement), one study in the carotid endarterectomy setting, and the remaining 10 studies in the aortic or cardiac surgery setting. The main sources of bias in the included studies related to potential conflict of interest from industry sponsorship, unclear blinding status or missing participant data.Two studies with 312 participants considered postoperative neurological injury, however no pooled effect estimate could be calculated due to discordant direction of effect between studies (low-quality evidence). One study (N = 126) in participants undergoing major abdominal surgery reported that 4/66 participants experienced neurological injury with blinded monitoring versus 0/56 in the active monitoring group. A second study (N = 195) in participants having coronary artery bypass surgery reported that 1/96 participants experienced neurological injury in the blinded monitoring group compared with 4/94 participants in the active monitoring group.We are uncertain whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an important effect on the risk of postoperative stroke because of the low number of events and wide confidence interval (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.20; 2 studies, 240 participants; low-quality evidence).We are uncertain whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an important effect on postoperative delirium because of the wide confidence interval (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.45; 1 study, 190 participants; low-quality evidence).Two studies with 126 participants showed that active cerebral NIRS monitoring may reduce the incidence of mild postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) as defined by the original studies at one week after surgery (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.95, I2 = 49%, low-quality evidence).Based on six studies with 962 participants, there was moderate-quality evidence that active cerebral oxygenation monitoring probably does not decrease the occurrence of POCD (decline in cognitive function) at one week after surgery (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.04, I2 = 80%). The different type of monitoring equipment in one study could potentially be the cause of the heterogeneity.We are uncertain whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an important effect on intraoperative mortality or postoperative mortality because of the low number of events and wide confidence interval (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.03, I2= 0%; 3 studies, 390 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence to determine whether routine use of NIRS-based cerebral oxygenation monitoring causes adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The effects of perioperative active cerebral NIRS monitoring of brain oxygenation in adults for reducing the occurrence of short-term, mild POCD are uncertain due to the low quality of the evidence. There is uncertainty as to whether active cerebral NIRS monitoring has an important effect on postoperative stroke, delirium or death because of the low number of events and wide confidence intervals. The conclusions of this review may change when the eight ongoing studies are published and the 12 studies awaiting assessment are classified. More RCTs performed in the paediatric population and high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery (e.g. neurosurgery, carotid endarterectomy and other surgery) are needed.","Yu, Yun; Zhang, Kaiying; Zhang, Ling; Zong, Huantao; Meng, Lingzhong; Han, Ruquan",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd010947.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29341066/,428

95280,The impact of compassionate care education on nurses: A mixed-method systematic review.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate perioperative morbidity and outcome in dogs and cats undergoing esophageal surgery. DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 63 client-owned dogs and 9 client-owned cats. PROCEDURES Medical records of dogs and cats that underwent esophageal surgery were reviewed for information on signalment, history, results of preoperative diagnostic testing, condition treated, details of surgery, intraoperative complications, and postoperative complications. Long-term follow-up data were obtained via veterinarian and client telephone conversations. The relationship between complications and survival to hospital discharge was evaluated by means of regression analysis. RESULTS The most common indication for surgical intervention was an esophageal foreign body in dogs (50/63 [79%]) and esophageal stricture in cats (3/9). Complications were documented in 54% (34/63) of dogs and 3 of 9 cats. The most common immediate postoperative complications were respiratory in nature (9 dogs, 1 cat). Partial esophagectomy and resection with anastomosis were significantly associated with the development of immediate postoperative complications in dogs. The most common delayed postoperative complications were persistent regurgitation (7 dogs) and esophageal stricture formation (3 dogs, 1 cat). For dogs, a mass lesion and increasing lesion size were significantly associated with the development of delayed postoperative complications. Six dogs (10%) and 1 cat died or were euthanized prior to discharge, and pneumomediastinum and leukopenia were negative prognostic factors for dogs being discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results of this study suggested that the short-term prognosis for dogs and cats that survive surgery for treatment of esophageal lesions is favorable, with 90% of patients discharged from the hospital (57/63 dogs; 8/9 cats). However, dogs treated for more extensive esophageal lesions as well as those undergoing esophagectomy or resection and anastomosis were more likely to develop postoperative complications.","Sutton, Jessie S; Culp, William T N; Scotti, Katherine; Seibert, Rachel L; Lux, Cassie N; Singh, Ameet; Wormser, Chloe; Runge, Jeffrey J; Schmiedt, Chad W; Corrie, Jessica; Phillips, Heidi; Selmic, Laura E; Nucci, Daniel J; Mayhew, Philipp D; Kass, Philip H",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.249.7.787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654165/,428
95584,Pain Management in Home Health Care: Relationship With Dementia and Facility Admissions.,2020-07-14,"AIMS In order to prevent a major outbreak of COVID-19 disease in Norway, a series of lockdown measures was announced on 12 March 2020. The aim of the present paper was to describe the impact of this lockdown on the treatment of injuries. METHODS We collected hospital data on injury diagnoses from a national emergency preparedness register established during the pandemic. We identified the number of injured patients per day in the period 1 January-30 June 2020, and analysed the change in patient volumes over two three-week periods before and during the lockdown by sex, age, level of care, level of urgency, type of contact and type of injury. RESULTS Compared to pre-lockdown levels, there was an overall reduction of 43% in injured patients during the first three weeks of lockdown. The decrease in patient contacts did not differ by sex, but was most pronounced among young people. Substantial reductions were observed for both acute and elective treatment and across all levels of care and types of contact, with the exception of indirect patient contacts. The change in patient contacts varied considerably by injury type, with the largest reduction observed for dislocations/sprains/strains. The decrease was much lower for burns/corrosions and poisoning. CONCLUSIONS A substantial reduction in the treatment of injuries was observed during lockdown in Norway. Possible explanations for this finding include an overall decrease in injury risk, a redistribution of hospital resources and a higher threshold for seeking medical attention as a result of the pandemic.","Ohm, Eyvind; Hauge, Lars J; Madsen, Christian; Grøholt, Else K; Evensen, Miriam; Reneflot, Anne",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494821993725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33624554/,428

Previously, we developed a liver-regeneration therapy using autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which is under clinical investigation. Cell-cell interactions between BMSCs and macrophages (Mφs) participate in the improvement of liver function and alleviation of liver fibrosis, although the associated mechanisms have not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated phenotypic changes in Mφs caused by interactions with BMSCs, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Co-culturing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived Mφs (BMDMs) with BMSCs substantially upregulated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), MMP12, and MMP13 expression, and downregulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) expression. To identify humoral factors involved in phenotypic changes occurring in Mφs, microarray analysis was performed with microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from extracellular vesicles in the supernatant of co-cultured BMSCs and LPS-stimulated BMDMs. We found that miR-6769b-5p was highly expressed and that transfecting miR-6769b-5p mimic upregulated MMP9 in LPS-stimulated BMDMs and downregulated TNFα and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β). MiR-6769b-5p expression in BMDMs was decreased by LPS stimulation but was increased by co-culture with BMSCs. Microarray and pathway analyses of gene expression in LPS-stimulated, miR-6769b-5p-transfected BMDMs revealed changes in the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-signaling pathway and decreased the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). LPS-stimulated BMDMs exhibited increased MMP9 expression and decreased the expression of TNFα and IL-1β by ATF4 knockdown. These findings indicate that upregulating miR-6769b-5p in BMDMs induced a fibrolytic phenotype, where MMP9 was highly expressed and inflammatory cytokine expression was decreased by the suppression of ATF4 expression. These findings imply that regulating miR-6769b-5p or ATF4 expression in BMDMs may be helpful for treating chronic liver disease.","Nishi, Maiko; Matsumoto, Toshihiko; Fujisawa, Koichi; Suehiro, Yutaka; Takami, Taro; Yamamoto, Naoki; Yamasaki, Takahiro; Sakaida, Isao",Stem cells and development,https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2020.0123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962510/,428

Studies have described individual aspects of bedside teaching in community settings, including the logistics of using the PCM, but there has been no evaluation of it as a teaching method. This study aimed to evaluate the PCM and whether it helped students develop consultation, clinical and clinical reasoning skills. The study was based at the Oxford University Primary Care Department. Penultimate clinical year students (n = 63) were recruited to take part in this mixed methods study. Students completed a questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions rating the PCM. A focus group explored questionnaire themes. GP tutors completed a questionnaire about the PCM and the logistics of delivering it. Three tutors took part in semi-structured interviews. The PCM helped develop students' consulting, and clinical reasoning skills. Teaching was improved when tutors were unrushed and had increased time to provide feedback and teaching. Delivery logistics of the PCM impacted on whether tutors were rushed and found it difficult to teach. Most benefit was derived when students were well briefed with sufficient debriefing time following a consultation. The following steps are recommended for effective delivery of the PCM teaching model: ensure tutors are appropriately trained; comprehensively brief the student about how to gain the most out of the learning experience; plan the logistics; ensure appropriate review and debriefing following consultation; review clinical cases after the session teaching on any outstanding aspects.","Allan, Rachel; McAleer, Sean","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",https://doi.org/10.1080/14739879.2021.1908174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33847234/,428

Herein, a novel magnetic adsorbent, DTPA-modiﬁed chitosan-coated magnetic silica nanoparticle (FFO@Sil@Chi-DTPA), was successfully prepared and used to enhance the Pb(II) selective adsorption from multi-metal wastewater based on anion-synergism. In the competitive experiment conducted in a multi-ion solution, the type of selective adsorption of metals was changed by the adsorbents before and after amidation, in which FFO@Sil@Chi-DTPA exhibited an excellent selectively for capturing Pb(II), while FFO@Sil@Chi demonstrated highly selective adsorption of silver. More importantly, the selective adsorption of Pb(II)S by FFO@Sil@Chi-DTPA was enhanced from 111.71 to 268.01 mg g-1 when the coexisting MB concentrations ranged from 0 to 100 mg L-1 at pH 6.0. In the Pb(II)-MB binary system, Pb(II) and MB exhibited a synergistic eﬀect, in which the presence of MB strengthened the adsorption effect of Pb(II) due to the sulfonic acid groups in MB molecules that create new specific sites for Pb(II) adsorption, while MB adsorption was also enhanced by the presence of Pb(II). This work provides a new strategy for exploring novel adsorbents that can enhance the selective removal of heavy metal in complex wastewater based on anion-synergism.","Huang, Yaoyao; Zheng, Huaili; Hu, Xuebin; Wu, Yuyang; Tang, Xiaohui; He, Qiang; Peng, Shangyu",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399211/,428

Research from other settings and other countries is not necessarily transferable to the Australian NH sector. We sought to identify and describe RCTs conducted in Australia which investigated interventions targeted at improving care for NH residents. DESIGN The design of this study comprised a systematic literature search with a narrative review. Studies were included if they were RCTs published after 2000, conducted in an Australian NH, and evaluated a health intervention which may have directly or indirectly benefitted the NH resident. SETTING Australian NHs. PARTICIPANTS Nursing home residents. MEASUREMENTS Jurisdiction (state or territory where the study was conducted), number of NHs recruited in each trial, number of residents included in each trial, intervention characteristics, comparator characteristics, and characteristics of outcome. RESULTS Only 43 articles reporting on 39 RCTs were identified. In contrast, 30 Australian musculoskeletal RCTs were published in just 2 years (2011-2012). Most of the RCTs identified were conducted in New South Wales (n = 14), Queensland (n = 10), and Victoria (n = 9). The mean number of NHs included in each trial was 22.4 (standard deviation (SD) = 27.0), with a median of 14.5 (interquartile range (IQR) = 27.8), while the mean number of residents included was 412.4 (SD = 921) with a median of 187 (IQR = 341.0). The most common interventions targeted: managing dementia (n = 20), prevention of falls (n = 7), and addressing mental health issues (n = 6). CONCLUSION This review provides evidence of the paucity of high-quality research in the form of RCTs, in the Australian NH setting and demonstrates the need for Australia to improve its research capability in the NH sector.","Pham, Tony; Bugeja, Lyndal; Holmes, Alice; Ibrahim, Joseph E",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33216941/,428

100684,Acute Wound Complications After Total Knee Arthroplasty: Prevention and Management.,2017,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease characterized by progressive rise of pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, which can lead to right ventricular (RV) failure. It is usually diagnosed late because of the nonspecificity of its symptoms. RV performance and adaptation to an increased afterload, reflecting the interaction of the PA and RV as a morphofunctional unit, constitute a critical determinant of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Therefore, early detection of dysfunction may prevent treatment failure. Cardiac MRI constitutes one of the most complete diagnostic modalities for diagnosing PH. It allows evaluation of the morphology and hemodynamics of the PA and RV. Several cine steady-state free-precession (SSFP)-derived parameters (indexed RV end-diastolic volume or RV systolic volume) and phase-contrast regional area change have been suggested as powerful biomarkers for prognosis and treatment. Recently, new cardiac MRI sequences have been added to clinical protocols for PH evaluation, providing brand-new information. Strain analysis with myocardial feature tracking can help detect early RV dysfunction, even with preserved ejection fraction. Four-dimensional flow cardiac MRI can enhance assessment of advanced RV and PA hemodynamics. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging may allow detection of replacement fibrosis in PH patients, which is associated with poor outcome. T1 mapping may help detect interstitial fibrosis, even with normal LGE imaging results. The authors analyze the imaging workup of PH with a focus on the role of morphologic and functional cardiac MRI in diagnosis and management of PH, including some of the newer techniques.

Tighter agreement is observed when right and left eye data are averaged, suggesting an approach suitable for clinical practice. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the retinal vessel caliber measurements generated by different commercially available platforms and their associations with systemic blood pressure and age. METHODS A total of 209 participants were recruited from a UK optometric practice. After a routine eye examination, participants had disc-centered retinal photographs and systemic blood pressure taken. Retinal vessel calibers (central retinal artery equivalent, central retinal vein equivalent, and arteriovenous ratio) were calculated using both MONA REVA and VesselMap. RESULTS An inverse Pearson correlation was observed between central retinal artery equivalent and mean arterial blood pressure on both platforms (r = -0.275 [P ≤ .001] and r = -0.388 [P ≤ .001] for MONA REVA and VesselMap, respectively); this correlation was also observed with arteriovenous ratio and blood pressure. An inverse correlation was observed between central retinal artery equivalent and age (r = -0.362 [P ≤ .001] and r = -0.404 [P ≤ .001] for MONA REVA and VesselMap, respectively); this was also seen between central retinal vein equivalent and age (r = -0.322 [P ≤ .001] and r = -0.369 [P ≤ .001]). Arteriovenous ratio remained independent from age for both platforms. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good agreement between the platforms for all three variables. CONCLUSIONS Although absolute caliber measurements differed between the platforms, the correlations observed were of similar magnitudes, with good agreement between the two platforms. Tighter spaced limits of agreement were observed when right and left eye data were averaged for each subject. In the absence of localized ocular pathology, this approach should be used.","French, Christian; Heitmar, Rebekka",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,https://doi.org/10.1097/opx.0000000000001774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34570034/,428

METHODS The database in our institution was queried to identify all patients treated with CAS from January 2005 to December 2012. In this time frame, 120 (18.8%) patients (mean age 64.9 ± 7.7 years; 96 men) underwent sbCAS and 517 (81.2%) patients (mean age 65.7 ± 7.7 years; 421 men) received uCAS. The primary endpoint was the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 30 days or any ipsilateral stroke within 1 year. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the rates of the primary endpoint between the sbCAS and uCAS groups (6.7% vs 4.6%, p=0.358). The rates of the primary endpoint among symptomatic patients was 8.0% in the sbCAS group and 5.0% in the uCAS group (p=0.299) and 3.1% and 4.0%, respectively (p=0.821) among asymptomatic patients. During the 30-day periprocedural period, the rates of the primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the sbCAS and uCAS groups among all patients (5.8% vs 4.4%, p=0.479), symptomatic patients (6.8% vs 5.0%, p=0.594), or asymptomatic patients (3.1% vs 3.5%, p>0.999). After this period, the incidences of any ipsilateral stroke were similarly low (0.8% and 0.2%, respectively; p=0.342). CONCLUSION The study showed that simultaneous bilateral CAS had no more adverse events than unilateral CAS during the periprocedural period or within 1 year. This 1-stage strategy may become a valuable alternative in the treatment of patients with severe bilateral carotid stenosis.","Jiang, Xiong-Jing; Dong, Hui; Peng, Meng; Zou, Yu-Bao; Song, Lei; Xu, Bo; Zhang, Hui-Min; Wu, Hai-Ying; Zhou, Xian-Liang; Yang, Yue-Jin; Gao, Run-Lin",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815626900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26823486/,428
100952,Advance care planning for patients with COVID-19: a communication guide.,2021-04-02,"OBJECTIVES Roughly 10% of occupational injuries result in permanent impairment and a permanent partial disability (PPD) award. After initial return to work (RTW) following a work injury, many workers with permanent impairment face RTW interruption (breaks in ongoing employment due to reinjury, poor health, disability, lay-off, etc.). Most RTW and reinjury research has focused on worker-level risk factors, and less is known about contextual factors that may be amenable to workplace or workers' compensation (WC)-based interventions. The aim of this study was to identify modifiable organizational and psychosocial workplace factors associated with (i) RTW interruption and (ii) reinjury among workers with a permanent impairment. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included WC claims data and survey data for 567 injured workers who RTW at least briefly after a work-related injury that resulted in permanent impairment. Workers were interviewed once by phone, 11-15 months after WC claim closure with a PPD award. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between each workplace factor of interest and each outcome, controlling for whole body impairment percentage, gender, age, nativity, educational level, State Fund versus self-insured WC coverage, employer size, union membership, industry sector, and employment duration of current/most recent job. RESULTS Twelve percent of workers had been reinjured in their current or most recent job, 12% of workers were no longer working at the time of interview, and <1% of workers reported both outcomes. The most frequently reported reason for RTW interruption was impairment, disability, and/or pain from the previous work injury. Lower reported levels of safety climate, supervisor support, and ability to take time off work for personal/family matters were significantly associated with both RTW interruption and reinjury. Inadequate employer/health care provider communication, perceived stigmatization from supervisors and/or coworkers, and lower levels of coworker support were significantly associated with RTW interruption but not with reinjury. Discomfort with reporting an unsafe situation at work, absence of a health and safety committee, and higher job strain were significantly associated with reinjury, but not with RTW interruption. Inadequate safety training and lack of needed job accommodations were not significantly associated with either outcome. There were no notable or statistically significant interactions between workplace factors and degree of impairment, and no consistent direction of association. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that several potentially modifiable organizational and psychosocial factors are associated with safe and sustained RTW among injured workers with work-related permanent impairment. The lack of interaction between any of these workplace factors and degree of impairment suggests that these findings may be generalizable to all workers, and further suggests that workplace interventions based on these findings might be useful for both primary and secondary prevention. Though primary prevention is key, secondary prevention efforts to sustain RTW and prevent reinjury may reduce the considerable health, economic, and social burden of occupational injury and illness.","Sears, Jeanne M; Schulman, Beryl A; Fulton-Kehoe, Deborah; Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah",Annals of work exposures and health,https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843964/,428
100977,[Opportunities for use the cascade model of medical care for people living with HIV].,2020-12-26,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? What is the physiological interpretation of SpO2 fluctuations observed during normobaric hypoxia in healthy individuals? What is the main finding and its importance? There is a significant flow of information between SpO2 and other cardio-respiratory time-series during graded hypoxia. Analysis of the pattern of SpO2 variations has potential for non-invasive assessment of the engagement of respiratory control system in health and disease. ABSTRACT Background peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) exhibits a complex pattern of fluctuations during hypoxia. The physiological interpretation of SpO2 variability is not well understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SpO2 fluctuation carries information about integrated cardio-respiratory control in healthy individuals using a network physiology approach. Method we explored the use of transfer entropy in order to compute the flow of information between cardio-respiratory signals during hypoxia. Twelve healthy males (age [SD] 22 [4] years) were exposed to four simulated environments (fraction of inspired oxygen [FI O2 ]: 0.12, 0.145, 0.17, and 0.2093) for 45 minutes, in a single blind randomised controlled design. The flow of information between different physiological parameters (SpO2 , respiratory frequency, tidal volume, minute ventilation, heart rate, end-tidal pressure of O2 and CO2 ) were analysed using transfer entropy. Results normobaric hypoxia was associated with a significant increase in entropy of the SpO2 time-series. The transfer entropy analysis showed that, particularly at FI O2 : 0.145 and 0.12, the flow of information between SpO2 and other physiological variables exhibits a bidirectional relationship. While reciprocal interactions were observed between different cardio-respiratory parameters during hypoxia, SpO2 remained the main hub of this network. Conclusion SpO2 fluctuations during graded hypoxia exposure carry information about cardio-respiratory control. Therefore, SpO2 entropy analysis has the potential for non-invasive assessment of the functional connectivity of respiratory control system in various healthcare settings.

101068,Human papilloma virus-related cancers: MSM and trans people living with HIV are still getting left behind.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Infection and inflammation induce epigenetic changes that alter gene expression. In periodontal disease, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis occur, which can lead to compromised barrier function of the gingival epithelia. Here, we tested the hypotheses that infection of cultured human gingival epithelial cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis disrupts barrier function by inducing epigenetic alterations and that these effects can be blocked by inhibitors of DNA methylation. METHODS Primary human gingival epithelial (HGEp) cells were infected with P. gingivalis either in the presence or absence of the non-nucleoside DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors RG108, (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), or curcumin. Barrier function was assessed as transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). DNA methylation and mRNA abundance were quantified for genes encoding components of three cell-cell junction complexes, CDH1, PKP2, and TJP1. Cell morphology and the abundance of cell-cell junction proteins were evaluated by confocal microscopy. RESULTS Compared to non-infected cells, P. gingivalis infection decreased TEER (P < 0.0001) of HGEp cells; increased methylation of the CDH1, PKP2, and TJP1 (P < 0.0001); and reduced their expression (mRNA abundance) (P < 0.005). Pretreatment with DNMT inhibitors prevented these infection-induced changes in HGEp cells, as well as the altered morphology associated with infection. CONCLUSION Pathogenic infection induced changes in DNA methylation and impaired the barrier function of cultured primary gingival epithelial cells, which suggests a mechanism for systemic consequences of periodontal disease. Inhibition of these events by non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors represents a potential strategy to treat periodontal disease. This article is protected by copyright.

Existing studies have small sample sizes and are observational cohorts in design. Patient psychiatric risk factors, method of delivery, and type of labour analgesia received were inconsistent among studies. Most studies relied on screening tests for diagnosing postpartum psychiatric illness and did not assess the impact of labour analgesia on postpartum psychiatric illness as the primary study objective. CONCLUSIONS Future studies should correlate screen-positive findings with clinical diagnosis; consider adjusting the timing of screening to include the antepartum period, early postpartum, and late postpartum periods; and consider the degree of labour pain relief and the specific pharmacologic labour analgesia used when evaluating postpartum psychiatric disorders.","Munro, Allana; MacCormick, Hilary; Sabharwal, Atul; George, Ronald B",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01587-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32020416/,428

BACKGROUND Limited long-term data are available describing the durability of benefits after femoropopliteal revascularization. METHODS In a multicenter, prospective, core-lab adjudicated study, 250 subjects with de novo or restenotic femoropopliteal arterial lesions were treated with the S.M.A.R.T.® stent. The primary endpoint of target vessel patency, a composite of ultrasound-assessed patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), was evaluated through 3 years. Secondary endpoints included stent fracture and health status. Health status was measured using generic and disease-specific instruments, including the Peripheral Artery Questionnaire (PAQ). RESULTS At 3-year follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimated target vessel patency was 72.7%, freedom from clinically driven TLR was 78.5%, and the incidence of stent fracture was 3.6%. The PAQ summary score was markedly impaired at baseline (mean 37.3 ± 19.6 points) and improved substantially at 1 month (mean change from baseline of 31.4 points, 95% CI: 28.5-34.3; P < 0.001). Disease-specific health status benefits assessed by the PAQ were largely preserved through 3 years of follow-up (mean change from baseline, 28.0 points, 95% CI: 24.3-31.7; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing revascularization for moderately complex SFA disease, use of the self-expanding S.M.A.R.T® stent was associated with a high rate of target vessel patency through 3 years and led to substantial and sustained health status benefits.","Bunte, Matthew C; Cohen, David J; Jaff, Michael R; Gray, William A; Magnuson, Elizabeth A; Li, Haiyan; Feiring, Andrew; Cioppi, Marco; Hibbard, Robert; Gray, Bruce; Khatib, Yazan; Jessup, David; Patarca, Roberto; Du, Jing; Stoll, Hans-Peter; Massaro, Joe; Safley, David M",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.27569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29521013/,428

Capitalizing on nursing students' strengths and supporting areas for remediation will maximize student success. PURPOSE This study explored undergraduate nursing student strengths and areas for remediation at program entry and across all years of nursing education study. METHODS We used a cross-sectional design and collected data via the Academic Success Inventory for College Students survey tool. Baseline data were collected on first-year students after program start, and data were collected for all years of study at the end of the academic terms. RESULTS Compared with other undergraduate students, nursing students exhibited strengths in study skills, in self-organization strategies, in their certainty of progress toward career goals, in recognizing the importance of their studies, and in levels of socializing that did not hinder academic performance. At some data collection points, they had strengths in motivation, confidence, and concentration. Nursing students indicated areas for remediation in studying or test-taking anxiety and their perception of the educator's ability to organize, teach, and assess student progress. CONCLUSION Nurse educators' pedagogical approaches should augment nursing student strengths. Remediation is required to support student success relative to anxiety, and students need orientation to the process of learning.","Brown, Janine; McDonald, Meghan; Besse, Cheryl; Manson, Patti; McDonald, Reid; Rohatinsky, Noelle; Singh, Madeline",Nurse educator,https://doi.org/10.1097/nne.0000000000000882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530904/,428

Less and less invasive laparoscopic approaches to SG have been proposed and shown to be safe and feasible. OBJECTIVES We developed a reduced port laparoscopic approach to sleeve gastrectomy (RLSG) with the aim to further optimize the advantages of laparoscopy. Preliminary and safety profile of RLSG as well as 3 years weight loss outcome are hereby discussed. SETTING University Hospital, Kuwait. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients had morbid obesity with history of failure of conservative treatment. The RLSG procedure was performed using only two skin incisions. RESULTS The analyzed population comprised 808 patients, including 642 women and 166 men. Mean age and BMI were 28.34 ± 8.37 and 41.09 ± 6.34, respectively. Mean operative time was 43 ± 20 min (range, 31-185). Mortality was nil. Overall morbidity rate was (4.5%). Three patients had postoperative leak (0.4%). Median duration of hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-5). Mean percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) was 23.18 ± 17.3% at 1 month, 55.08 ± 22.9% at 6 months, 82.6 ± 22.6% at 1 year, and 84.3 ± 22.4% at 3 years. Mean percentage total weight loss (%TWL) was 9.34% at 1 month, 22.42% at 6 months, and 34.57% at 1 year. CONCLUSION RLSG is a safe and effective surgical option in patients with morbid obesity.

Of these transcripts, the majority-long, noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-are greater than 200 nucleotides in length and are necessary for various roles in the cell. It is increasingly appreciated that these lncRNAs are relevant in both health and disease states, with the brain expressing the largest number of lncRNAs compared to other organs. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive, fatal brain tumor that demonstrates remarkable intratumoral heterogeneity, which has made the development of effective therapies challenging. The cooperation between genetic and epigenetic alterations drives rapid adaptation that allows therapeutic evasion and recurrence. Given the large repertoire of lncRNAs in normal brain tissue and the well-described roles of lncRNAs in molecular and cellular processes, these transcripts are important to consider in the context of GBM heterogeneity and treatment resistance. Herein, we review the general mechanisms and biological roles of lncRNAs, with a focus on GBM, as well as RNA-based therapeutics currently in development.","DeSouza, Patrick A; Qu, Xuan; Chen, Hao; Patel, Bhuvic; Maher, Christopher A; Kim, Albert H",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13071604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807183/,428

When a cue later occurs without punishment, this unexpected omission of aversive outcome is encoded as reward via activation of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons. How such activation occurs remains unknown. Using real-time in vivo functional imaging, optogenetics, behavioral analysis and synaptic reconstruction from electron microscopy data, we identify the neural circuit mechanism through which Drosophila reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons are activated when an olfactory cue is unexpectedly no longer paired with electric shock punishment. Reduced activation of punishment-encoding dopaminergic neurons relieves depression of olfactory synaptic inputs to cholinergic neurons. Synaptic excitation by these cholinergic neurons of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons increases their odor response, thus decreasing aversiveness of the odor. These studies reveal how an excitatory cholinergic relay from punishment- to reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons encodes the absence of punishment as reward, revealing a general circuit motif for updating aversive memories that could be present in mammals.","McCurdy, Li Yan; Sareen, Preeti; Davoudian, Pasha A; Nitabach, Michael N",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21388-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602917/,428

We investigated perinatal outcomes associated with labor induction among women with a trial of labor after one cesarean delivery. METHODS This retrospective study included 339 women with a trial of labor after one prior cesarean and a singleton term fetus in cephalic presentation in 2013-2016 in a French maternity unit. Labor induction was performed with oxytocin, artificial rupture of membranes and/or prostaglandin E2, according to the Bishop score. The primary outcome was a composite of uterine rupture, low Apgar score, neonatal resuscitation or admission to a neonatal unit. The secondary outcomes included cesarean delivery after onset of labor, postpartum hemorrhage and maternal hospital stay after delivery. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios adjusted (aOR) for potential confounders. RESULTS In our sample, 67.3% of women had spontaneous labor and 32.7% were induced. More than half of the women received oxytocin during labor regardless of the mode of labor. The proportions of the composite outcome and of cesarean after onset of labor were higher in the induced group compared to the spontaneous group (26.1% vs 15.8%, p = 0.02 and 45.0% vs 27.6%, p<0.01, respectively). There were 9 uterine ruptures (2.6%) and this proportion was higher in the induced group compared to the spontaneous group, although this difference was not statistically significant (3.6% vs 2.2%, p = 0.48). After adjustment, labor induction was associated with higher risks of the composite outcome (aOR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.29-4.65), cesarean after onset of labor (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.15-3.68) and maternal hospital stay after delivery ≥6 days (aOR = 6.20, 95% CI: 3.25-11.81). No association was found with postpartum hemorrhage. CONCLUSION Labor induction after one prior cesarean was associated with a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcome. Nevertheless, the higher proportion of uterine rupture did not differ significantly from that in the spontaneous labor group.","Vecchioli, Emma; Cordier, Anne-Gaël; Chantry, Anne; Benachi, Alexandra; Monier, Isabelle",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764773/,428

Since its first recognition in Wuhan, many topics were discussed intensively about COVID-19, both in the public and scientific community. Personal protective equipments and especially masks were among the hottest topics during this pandemic. Regardless of which mask is used, performing hand hygiene frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water if hands are dirty; is the most effective preventive measure for COVID-19. The type of mask used when caring for COVID-19 patients will vary according to the setting, type of personnel/person, and activity. Although the main transmission route for COVID-19 is droplets, during aerosol generating procedures airborne transmission may occur. Keeping the distancing and medical masks and eye protection during close contact efficiently protects against respiratory diseases transmitted via droplets. Airborne precautions include goggles and respiratory protection with the use of an N95 or an equivalent mask respirator to prevent airborne transmission.","Azap, Alpay; Erdinç, Fatma Şebnem",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2004-199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336079/,428

The disease is now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the early reports, the patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly men, and children appeared to be less susceptible to this infection. With modern and efficient transportation, the disease quickly spread to almost all corners of the world and the mortality far exceeds those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children and adolescents. Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare. The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention. Clear understanding of the immune responses to the virus in children and the transmission potential of asymptomatic children are of paramount importance for the development of specific treatments and vaccine in order to effectively control the ongoing pandemic.","Lu, Xiaoxia; Xiang, Yun; Du, Hui; Wing-Kin Wong, Gary",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330332/,428

The purpose of this study is to report the added value of switching from ADAPT to Solumbra in unsuccessful revascularization stroke patients. METHODS This is a retrospective, single center, pragmatic, cohort study. From December 2017 to November 2019, 935 consecutive patients were admitted to the Stroke Unit and 176/935 (18.8%) were eligible for MT. In 135/176 (76.7%) patients, ADAPT was used as the first-line strategy. SS was defined as the difference between first technique adopted and the final technique. Revascularization was evaluated with modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) with success defined as mTICI ≥ 2b. Procedural time (PT) and time to reperfusion (TTR) were recorded. RESULTS Stroke involved: Anterior circulation in 121/135 (89.6%) patients and posterior circulation in 14/135 (10.4%) patients. ADAPT was the most common first-line technique vs. both SR and Solumbra (135/176 (76.7%) vs. 10/176 (5.7%) vs. 31/176 (17.6%), respectively). In 28/135 (20.7%) patients, the mTICI was ≤ 2a requiring switch to Solumbra. The vessel's diameter positively predicted SS result (odd ratio (OR) 1.12, confidence of interval (CI) 95% 1.03-1.22; p = 0.006). The mean number of passes before SS was 2.0 ± 1.2. ADAPT to Solumbra improved successful revascularization by 13.3% (107/135 (79.3%) vs. 125/135 (92.6%)). PT was superior for SS comparing with ADAPT (71.1 min (CI 95% 53.2-109.0) vs. 40.0 min (CI 95% 35.0-45.2); p = 0.0004), although, TTR was similar (324.1 min (CI 95% 311.4-387.0) vs. 311.4 min (CI 95% 285.5-338.7); p = 0.23).

Isolated caudate lobe resection is a challenging procedure even for an experienced surgeon. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and outcomes of laparoscopic isolated caudate lobectomy and to compare these with the open technique. We retrospectively analyzed 21 patients who underwent isolated caudate lobectomy between January 2005 and December 2018 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Patients who underwent either anatomical or non-anatomical resection of the caudate lobe were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they underwent laparoscopic or open surgery. Intra-operative and postoperative outcomes were compared with a median follow-up of 43 months (4-149). A total of 21 patients were included in the study. Of these, 12 (57.14%) underwent laparoscopic and nine (42.85%) underwent open caudate lobectomy. Median operation time (204.5 vs. 200 minutes, p = 0.397), estimated blood loss (250 vs. 400 ml, p = 0.214) and hospital stay (4 vs. 7 days, p = 0.298) were comparable between laparoscopy and open group.

However, virtually nothing is known about its natural cycle. Here, we show the role of nectar-producing plants in the hosting and dissemination of Asaia. We isolated Asaia strains from wild mosquitoes and flowers in Senegal and demonstrated the transmission of the bacteria from infected mosquitoes to sterile flowers and then to 26.6% of noninfected mosquitoes through nectar feeding. Thus, nectar-producing plants may naturally acquire Asaia and then colonize Anopheles mosquitoes through food-borne contamination. Finally, Asaia may play an indirect role in the reduction in the vectorial capacity of Anopheles mosquitoes in a natural environment (due to Plasmodium-antagonistic capacities of Asaia) and be used in the development of tools for Asaia-based paratransgenetic malaria control.","Bassene, Hubert; Niang, El Hadji Amadou; Fenollar, Florence; Doucoure, Souleymane; Faye, Ousmane; Raoult, Didier; Sokhna, Cheikh; Mediannikov, Oleg",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64163-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346047/,428

111570,A systematic review of ketamine for the treatment of depression among older adults.,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND Neurological disorders are considered one of the greatest burdens to global public health and a leading cause of death. Stem cell therapies hold great promise for the cure of neurological disorders, as stem cells can serve as cell replacement, while also secreting factors to enhance endogenous tissue regeneration. Adult human multipotent stem cells (MSCs) reside on blood vessels, and therefore can be found in many tissues throughout the body, including palatine tonsils. Several studies have reported the capacity of MSCs to differentiate into, among other cell types, the neuronal lineage. However, unlike the case with embryonic stem cells, it is unclear whether MSCs can develop into mature neurons. METHODS Human tonsillar MSCs (T-MSCs) were isolated from a small, 0.6-g sample, of tonsillar biopsies with high viability and yield as we recently reported. Then, these cells were differentiated by a rapid, multi-stage procedure, into committed, post-mitotic, neuron-like cells using defined conditions. RESULTS Here we describe for the first time the derivation and differentiation of tonsillar biopsy-derived MSCs (T-MSCs), by a rapid, multi-step protocol, into post-mitotic, neuron-like cells using defined conditions without genetic manipulation. We characterized our T-MSC-derived neuronal cells and demonstrate their robust differentiation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS Our procedure leads to a rapid neuronal lineage commitment and loss of stemness markers, as early as three days following neurogenic differentiation. Our studies identify biopsy-derived T-MSCs as a potential source for generating neuron-like cells which may have potential use for in vitro modeling of neurodegenerative diseases or cell replacement therapies.","Arad, Michal; Brown, Robert A; Khatri, Raju; Taylor, Rodney J; Zalzman, Michal",Cellular & molecular biology letters,https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-021-00279-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407767/,428

Swine are intermediate hosts and 'mixing vessels' for generating reassortants, progenies of which may harbour pandemic propensity. Swine handlers are at the highest risk of becoming infected with IAVs from swine but there is little information on the ecology of IAVs at the human-animal interface in Africa. We analysed and characterized nasal and throat swabs from swine and farmers respectively, for IAVs using RT-qPCR, from swine farms in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Sera were also analysed for IAVs antibodies and serotyped using ELISA and HI assays. IAV was detected in 1.4% (n = 17/1,200) and 2.0% (n = 2/99) of swine and farmers samples, respectively. Viral subtypes H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 were found in human samples. All virus-positive swine samples were subtyped as H1N1pdm09 phylogenetically clustering closely with H1N1pdm09 that circulated among humans during the study period. Phenotypic markers that confer sensitivity to Oseltamivir were found. Serological prevalence of IAVs in swine and farmers by ELISA was 3.2% (n = 38/1,200) and 18.2% (n = 18/99), respectively. Human H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 antibodies were found in both swine and farmers sera. Indigenous swine influenza A viruses and/or antibodies were not detected in swine or farmers samples.

This study used proteomics and gene set enrichment analysis to assess effects of a GH releasing hormone (GHRH) analog, tesamorelin, on circulating immune markers and liver tissue in people with HIV (PWH) and NAFLD. METHODS 92 biomarkers associated with immunity, chemotaxis, and metabolism were measured in plasma samples from 61 PWH with NAFLD who participated in a double-blind, randomized trial of tesamorelin versus placebo for 12 months. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on serial liver biopsies targeted to immune pathways. RESULTS Tesamorelin, compared to placebo, decreased interconnected proteins related to cytotoxic T-cell and monocyte activation. Circulating concentrations of 13 proteins were significantly decreased, and no proteins increased, by tesamorelin. These included four chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL13 [MCP4], IL8 [CXCL8]), two cytokines (IL-10 and CSF-1), and four T-cell associated molecules (CD8A, CRTAM, GZMA, ADGRG1), as well as ARG1, Gal-9, and HGF. Network analysis indicated close interaction among the gene pathways responsible for these proteins, with imputational analyses suggesting down regulation of a closely related cluster of immune pathways. Targeted transcriptomics using liver tissue confirmed a significant end-organ signal of down-regulated immune activation pathways. CONCLUSIONS Long-term treatment with a GHRH analog reduced markers of T-cell and monocyte/macrophage activity, suggesting that augmentation of the GH axis may ameliorate immune activation in an HIV population with metabolic dysregulation, systemic and end organ inflammation.","Stanley, Takara L; Fourman, Lindsay T; Wong, Lai Ping; Sadreyev, Ruslan; Billingsley, James M; Feldpausch, Meghan N; Zheng, Isabel; Pan, Chelsea S; Boutin, Autumn; Lee, Hang; Corey, Kathleen E; Torriani, Martin; Kleiner, David E; Chung, Raymond T; Hadigan, Colleen M; Grinspoon, Steven K",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852720/,428

113566,Which Metrics Are Being Used to Evaluate Children and Adolescents After ACL Reconstruction? A Systematic Review.,2020-08-01,"Intra-individual processes are thought to continuously unfold across time. For equally spaced time intervals, the discrete-time lag-1 vector autoregressive (VAR(1)) model and the continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model are equivalent. It is expected that by taking into account the unequal spacings of the time intervals in real data between observations will lead to an advantage for the OU in terms of predictive accuracy. In this paper, this is claim is being investigated by comparing the predictive accuracy of the OU model to that of the VAR(1) model on typical ESM data obtained in the context of affect research. It is shown that the VAR(1) model outperforms the OU model for the majority of the time series, even though time intervals in the data are unequally spaced. Accounting for measurement error does not change the result. Deleting large abrupt changes on short time intervals (that may be caused by externally driven events) does however lead to a significant improvement for the OU model. This suggests that processes in psychology may be continuously evolving, but that there are factors, like external events, which can disrupt the continuous flow.","Loossens, Tim; Tuerlinckx, Francis; Verdonck, Stijn",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85320-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737588/,428

114158,Virtual Nation: Telemedicine's Breakout Moment.,2020-05-19,"Worldwide the pandemic of COVID-19 spreads rapidly and has had an enormous public health impact with substantial morbidity and mortality especially in high-risk groups, such as older people and patients with comorbidities like diabetes, dementia or cancer. In the absence of a vaccine against COVID-19 there is an urgent need to find supportive therapies that can stabilize the immune system and can help to deal with the infection, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly. This is especially relevant for our geriatric institutions and nursing homes. A major potential contributing factor for elderly is due to their high incidence of malnutrition: up to 80% among the hospitalized elderly. Malnutrition results when adequate macronutrients and micronutrients are lacking in the diet. Often missing in public health discussions around preventing and treating COVID-19 patients are nutritional strategies to support optimal function of their immune system. This is surprising, given the importance that nutrients play a significant role for immune function. Several micronutrients, such as vitamin D, retinol, vitamin C, selenium and zinc are of special importance supporting both the adaptive and innate immune systems. As suboptimal status or deficiencies in these immune-relevant micronutrients impair immune function and reduces the resistance to infections, micronutrient deficiencies should therefore be corrected as soon as possible, especially in the elderly and other vulnerable groups. According to epidemiological, experimental and observational studies, some case reports and a few intervention studies the supplementation of vitamin D and/or zinc are promising. The multiple anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin D could explain its protective role against immune hyper reaction and cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. A randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study even shows that high dose vitamin D supplementation promotes viral clearance in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. Besides, the data of a recent prospective study with COVID-19 patients reveal that a significant number of them were zinc deficient. The zinc deficient patients had more complications and the deficiency was associated with a prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Thus, immune-relevant micronutrients may help to increase the physiological resilience against COVID-19.","Gröber, Uwe; Holick, Michael F",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Additionally, to aid in the detection of new viral phosphorylation sites, we used the scan-x tool to make thousands of high-specificity serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation predictions in 229 viruses that replicate in human cells. By cross-validating our prediction results with the literature-based entries in the virPTM database, we highlight the effectiveness of the scan-x tool with viral data and extrapolate the existence of at least 4000 as yet unidentified phosphorylation sites on hundreds of viral proteins. Together, these results imply a substantial role for human kinases in mediating viral protein functions and suggest, more generally, that viral primary structure may provide important clues to aid in the rational design of therapeutic agents.","Schwartz, Daniel; Church, George M",Science signaling,https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.2001099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20807955/,428

METHODS The CiteSpace software was used to visually analyze the relevant research of severe COVID-19 published by CNKI and Web of Science databases from January 30th to April 20th in 2020. The analysis content included the author of the literature, the publishing institutions, and high-frequency keywords. RESULTS There were 389 Chinese literatures and 59 English literatures included. Analysis using CiteSpace software showed that there were four large teams in China currently concerning about the research on severe COVID-19. The co-authoring of each team was relatively close, but the teams were lack of cooperation. The main issuing institutions were affiliated hospitals of colleges and universities, but colleges and enterprises had less participation. The authors of English-language publications mainly had five research teams, some of whom had co-authored relationships. The country with the most enormous volume of English-language publications was China, followed by the United States and Canada. The Chinese keyword co-occurrence, clustering and highlighted words analysis showed that the main research areas of severe COVID-19 included clinical features, traditional Chinese medicine treatment, medical imaging, integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment and so on; nucleic acid detection, clinical features and diagnosis, plague theory and etiology mechanism, traditional Chinese medicine and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment, severe COVID-19 combined with diabetes and prognosis research will become future research trends; keyword cluster analysis showed that severe COVID-19, combined chronic underlying diseases, CT imaging characteristics will also become new trends in the field of research. Co-occurrence analysis of keywords in English literatures showed that the main research areas of severe COVID-19 included the names of novel coronavirus, pandemic diseases, infectious diseases, medical supplies distribution, and indicators related to myocardial damage. CONCLUSIONS Researchers in China and abroad have different concerns about severe COVID-19. Domestic research focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of severe cases, while foreign countries attach importance to epidemic response and prevention.","Chen, Hongyan; Huang, Xiaoyi; Wei, Fengxiang; Li, Min; Liu, Liuhong; Yang, Ziqing; Chen, Siyi; Chen, Ken",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200514-00384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32684210/,428

OBJECTIVE To assess contemporary outcomes of transvenous embolization as a stand-alone therapy for cerebral AVMs. METHODS We prospectively followed 40 patients with 41 AVMs who underwent transvenous endovascular therapy between January 2008 and January 2015. Patient demographics, AVM characteristics, endovascular techniques used, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and complications were assessed independently. RESULTS Thirty-eight of 41 (92.6%) AVMs were anatomically cured. The mean patient age was 37.7 yr (range, 18-69 yr) and 55% were female. Twenty-seven (67.5%) patients presented with hemorrhage. The mean size of the AVM nidus was 2.8 ± 1.2 cm, and low Spetzler-Martin grade AVMs comprised 41.5% of lesions. The majority of patients were treated in 1 session (56%; n = 23). The mean follow-up period was 28.4 (range, 6-106 mo). There was 1 (2.5%) hemorrhagic complication related to microcatheter navigation and 1 (2.5%) venous infarction was observed without clinical consequences. At 6-mo follow-up, 1 (2.5%) patient had significant disability. There were no recurrences during the follow-up period. Overall mortality was 2.5% and procedure-related mortality was 0%. CONCLUSION This prospective contemporary series demonstrates a high rate of complete AVM obliteration and excellent functional outcomes in patients with both ruptured and unruptured AVMs treated with transvenous embolization. This approach is promising and warrants further investigation as a treatment for select AVMs.","Mendes, George A C; Kalani, M Yashar S; Iosif, Christina; Lucena, Adson F; Carvalho, Rui; Saleme, Suzana; Mounayer, Charbel",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29281075/,428

Despite guidelines describing clinical features and histopathologic criteria to distinguish these lesions, misdiagnoses still occur. We report our experience over 30 years in a pediatric population with malignant melanoma. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 150 pediatric patients treated for malignant melanoma between 1973 and 2007 at our institution. Outcomes measured included age, Breslow thickness, Clark level of invasion, tumor location, local and distant failure rates, and overall survival. RESULTS One hundred fifty pediatric patients were evaluated. The mean age was 15.1 years. The mean Breslow thickness was 2.05 mm and corresponding Clark level of invasion was 3.47. There were 43 known recurrences (29%); 29 distant, 14 nodal, and 7 local. Overall survival was 84% with a mean follow-up of 8.5 years. Sixteen patients (10.7%) were incorrectly diagnosed on initial pathologic examination. Overall survival in the misdiagnosed group was 66%. CONCLUSION Pigmented skin lesions in the pediatric population represent a diagnostic challenge to pathologists and clinicians. Improvements in diagnostic techniques with rigorous characterization, as well as increased physician awareness, should lead to a reduction in errors of diagnosis.","Aldrink, Jennifer H; Selim, M Angelica; Diesen, Diana L; Johnson, Jeffrey; Pruitt, Scott K; Tyler, Douglas S; Seigler, Hilliard F",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635298/,428
117096,Pharmacological therapies for patients with human coronavirus infections: a rapid systematic review.,2020-09-01,"Background Cough is a common symptom for which people frequently present to community pharmacies. Previous articles from developing countries have shown that the provision of self-medication consultation for cough in community pharmacies were suboptimal, with knowledge deficiency being a contributing factor. However, little is known regarding the ability of pharmacy students in handling self-medication consultations in developing countries. Objectives To measure the competency of Indonesian pharmacy students in providing self-medication consultations for patients with chronic cough and to identify factors associated with the provision of appropriate advice. Method This study is a cross-sectional study. A simulated patient method using a product and a symptom-based request of chronic cough was used in students from a pharmacy school in Indonesia. The nature and amount of information gathered and advice provided by pharmacy students were noted and audio-recorded. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the provision of appropriate advice. Results The information gathered by participating students was not comprehensive. The most common types of information gathered were related to the nature and duration of the cough. Information relating to accompanying symptoms, medications, and allergies was gathered in less than 60% of the participating students for both product and symptom based scenarios. The appropriate advice of direct medical referral was provided in 54% and 56% of the 183 participating students for the product and symptom-based request scenarios respectively. Asking about symptom duration and prior medical conditions were positively associated with the provision of appropriate advice in the symptom and product based requests respectively. Conclusion Student competency in self-medication consultation for chronic cough needs to be improved. Appropriate information-gathering is a predictor of appropriate advice. Further qualitative research identifying factors affecting students' competence in providing self-medication consultation is required, so that suitable interventions are developed and implemented.","Brata, Cecilia; Halim, Steven V; Setiawan, Eko; Presley, Bobby; Wibowo, Yosi I; Schneider, Carl R",Pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.18549/pharmpract.2021.2.2269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035868/,428

CASE PRESENTATION An active male in his nineties with a high level of function, despite several severe chronic diseases, was admitted to Oslo University Hospital after two days of fatigue, fever, dyspnoea and dry cough. He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4º C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection. On day 5 after symptom debut he was tested for COVID-19 which was positive. He had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the same day, a chest CT scan was performed that showed ground-glass opacities. In subsequent days the patient's health rapidly deteriorated. He developed irreversible respiratory failure with hypoxia without hypercapnia despite substantial oxygen support. Chest X-ray taken on disease day 7 showed progression of consolidations. The patient died 9 days after symptom debut. INTERPRETATION This case illustrates a severe course of COVID-19 with fatal outcome. The patient was also one of the earliest admitted with COVID-19 in a Norwegian hospital and marked a new phase of the epidemic, as he had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Borén, Håkon Kinck; Kjøstolfsen, Gjertrud Hole; Aaløkken, Trond Mogens; Latif, Nadim; Brekke, Hanne; Lind, Andreas; Hesstvedt, Liv","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32321232/,428

C. trachomatis enter the cells and replicate to infect different tissues/organs, giving rise to a spectrum of pathological conditions; however, the exact mechanism or receptor(s) for their entry is not well understood. Here we report that CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), an apical epithelial anion channel, is required for cellular entry and internalization of C. trachomatis. Human epithelial cell lines expressing functional CFTR internalized more C. trachomatis than the cells expressing mutant Delta508 CFTR. The in vitro cellular uptake of C. trachomatis can be blocked by CFTR inhibitors or antibody, and the in vivo cellular uptake of C. trachomatis in CFTR mutant (CFTR(-/-)) mice was significantly less compared with that in the wild-type. Direct interaction between CFTR and C. trachomatis LPS (lipopolysaccharide) is demonstrated by their immune-co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation. Despite an increase in CFTR expression observed upon C. trachomatis LPS challenge, a reduction in its ion channel activity is observed, consistent with the notion that CFTR functions as a receptor for cellular entry and internationization of C. trachomatis, with compromised ion-channel function. These findings, for the first time, demonstrate that CFTR functions as a cell-surface receptor for epithelial cell entry, and internalization of C. trachomatis and these findings may lead to the development of new treatment strategies to curtail the spread of chlamydial infections.","Ajonuma, Louis Chukwuemeka; Fok, Kin Lam; Ho, Lok Sze; Chan, Paul Kay Sheung; Chow, Pak H; Tsang, Lai Ling; Wong, Connie Hau Yan; Chen, Jie; Li, Shen; Rowlands, Dewi Kenneth; Chung, Yiu Wa; Chan, Hsiao Chang",Cell biology international,https://doi.org/10.1042/cbi20090227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20178459/,428

This article provides background on and explores ""telepresence"" in healthcare literature. Telepresence strongly impacts the patient experience, but it is poorly defined in current research. The aim was to conceptually define telepresence using qualitative methods. DESIGN Dimensional analysis was used to analyze telepresence in clinical literature and create a clearer definition of telepresence as a concept. Multiple databases were searched for articles related to telepresence. Thirteen international articles related to telepresence were selected for analysis. METHODS Dimensional analysis allowed for multiple viewpoints to be explored within each distinct context and perspective. FINDINGS Twenty-five dimensions were discovered within the articles, which were synthesized to seven core dimensions of telepresence: connection, technological mediation, experienced realism, trust, being supportive, collaboration, and emotional consequence. CONCLUSIONS Telepresence is highly impactful on the patient's experience of telehealth care visits. The conceptual map produced by this dimensional analysis provides direction for clinicians to improve their ability to be present with patients during telehealth care. Potential implications include a starting point for future qualitative research, and the use of this dimensional analysis to inform clinical guidelines, improve clinician training, and assist in the development of new care models.

AREAS COVERED : The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of current knowledge on sex differences in COPD management. EXPERT OPINION : There is no solid evidence of sex differences in response to usual COPD treatments but there are sex-related differences in management of patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. It is difficult to explain the reason for these differences, but most likely they are due to local prescribing habits, rather than solid scientific reasons. However, there are also signals of different sex-related responses, the qualification and quantification of which is difficult with the information currently available. These signals should lead to the inclusion of more women in clinical trials, but also to the design of prospective clinical studies to assess the possible differences linked to sex in COPD treatment responses, whose identification is an important step towards the definition of personalized COPD therapy.","Matera, Maria Gabriella; Ora, Josuel; Calzetta, Luigino; Rogliani, Paola; Cazzola, Mario",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2021.1888713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560876/,428

Temporary changes in re-imbursement, inclusion of home office and patient home environments, and increased access to telehealth technologies by patients, health care staff and health care facilities were key to provide an environment for creative and consistent high-quality stroke care. The continuum of care via telestroke has broadened to include prehospital, inter-facility and intra-facility hospital-based services, stroke telerehabilitation, and ambulatory telestroke. However, disparities in technology access remain a challenge.

Most transvaginal procedures are performed as hybrid procedures [3]. To our knowledge, this is the first video depiction of a pure transvaginal umbilical hernia repair in a human. METHODS This is a 38-year-old woman, body mass index 36.4 kg/m(2), with a symptomatic port site hernia in the umbilical region after a previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient was positioned in stirrups in a steep Trendelenburg position. Sterilization of vaginal cavity was performed with 10 % povidone-iodine solution. A 2 cm transverse incision at the posterior fornix was made, and a SILS port (Covidien, North Haven, CT) was introduced. One 12 mm trocar and two 5 mm trocars were placed through SILS port. Standard straight laparoscopic instruments were used. A 12 cm round Parietex mesh (Covidien) was placed in a specimen retrieval bag and deployed into the peritoneal cavity. The mesh was extracted, unfolded in the abdominal cavity, and circumferentially fixated to the abdominal wall with an AbsorbaTack device (Covidien). The colpotomy incision was closed with a running absorbable suture. RESULTS The procedure lasted 103 min and was performed on an outpatient basis. No intraoperative complications occurred. The patient was doing well and had no pain or recurrence at 2, 6, and 9 months' follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience with transvaginal ventral hernia repair in humans suggests that this procedure is feasible and safe. This approach may improve cosmesis and decrease the risk of future ventral hernias. Potential cons may include a longer operative time, mesh infection, and risk of visceral injury with a pure transvaginal approach. As transvaginal surgery evolves, techniques and devices will become increasingly refined to tackle these challenges.","Wood, Stephanie G; Panait, Lucian; Bell, Robert L; Duffy, Andrew J; Roberts, Kurt E",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2847-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23436091/,428

After the actual study methodology and results were revealed, learners engaged in facilitated open discussion. After the session, learners completed an electronic survey to rate perceived usefulness and suggest improvement areas. RESULTS A total of 15 learners participated; most completed the survey (13/15; 87%). The MEJC was rated as very or extremely useful. Qualitative feedback indicated that it was convenient, allowed creativity, and enabled rich discussion without prior preparation. When possible, improvement suggestions were implemented. DISCUSSION The authors offer an evidence-based MEJC approach that is free, interactive with virtual breakout rooms and requires no prior learner preparation. Early indicators suggest that others navigating the COVID-19 crisis may want to implement this approach.","Cadieux, Magalie; Campos-Zamora, Melissa; Zagury-Orly, Ivry; Dzara, Kristina",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,https://doi.org/10.1097/ceh.0000000000000321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284187/,428

124558,"Covid-19: Moderna and Pfizer vaccines prevent infections as well as symptoms, CDC study finds.",2021-04-01,"Performing realistic and reliable in vitro biological dose verification with good resolution for a complex treatment plan remains a challenge in particle beam therapy. Here, a new 3D bio-phantom consisting of 96-well plates containing cells embedded into Matrigel matrix was investigated as an alternative tool for biological dose verification. Feasibility tests include cell growth in the Matrigel as well as film dosimetric experiments that rule out the appearance of field inhomogeneities due to the presence of the well plate irregular structure. The response of CHO-K1 cells in Matrigel to radiation was studied by obtaining survival curves following X-ray and monoenergetic12C ion irradiation, which showed increased radioresistance of 3D cell cultures in Matrigel as compared to a monolayer. Finally, as a proof of concept, a12C treatment plan was optimized using in-house treatment planning system TRiP98 for uniform cell survival in a rectangular volume and employed to irradiate the 3D phantom. Cell survival distribution in the Matrigel-based phantom was analyzed and compared to cell survival in a reference setup using cell monolayers. Results of both methods were in good agreement and followed the TRiP98 calculation. Therefore, we conclude that this 3D bio-phantom can be a suitable, accurate alternative tool for verifying the biological effect calculated by treatment planning systems, which could be applied to test novel treatment planning approaches involving multiple fields, multiple ion modalities, complex geometries, or unconventional optimization strategies.","Kartini, Dea Aulia; Sokol, Olga; Wiedemann, Julia; Tinganelli, Walter; Witt, Matthias; Camazzola, Gianmarco; Kraemer, Michael; Talabnin, Chutima; Kobdaj, Chinorat; Fuss, Martina C",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abb92d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937608/,428

However, owing to the dynamic nature of the immune system, this approach has often been challenged by concerns regarding the lack of adequate long-term responses in patients. The development of microneedles (MNs) has resulted in the improvement and expansion of immuno-reprogramming strategies due to the housing of high accumulation of dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the dermis layer of the skin. In addition, MNs possess many outstanding properties, such as the ability for the painless traverse of the stratum corneum, minimal invasiveness, facile fabrication, excellent biocompatibility, convenient administration, and bypassing first-pass metabolism that allows direct translocation of therapeutics into the systematic circulation. These advantages make MNs excellent candidates for the delivery of immunological biomolecules to the dermal antigen-presenting cells in the skin with the aim of vaccinating or treating different diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune disorders, with minimal invasiveness and side effects. This review discusses the recent advances in engineered MNs and tackles limitations relevant to traditional immunotherapy of various hard-to-treat diseases.","Amani, Hamed; Shahbazi, Mohammad-Ali; D'Amico, Carmine; Fontana, Flavia; Abbaszadeh, Samin; Santos, Hélder A",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33340568/,428
124720,A Modeling Approach to Radiation Therapy in the Era of COVID-19.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND To improve consistency and streamline development and publication of clinical guidelines (GL), there is a need for appropriate software support. We have found few specific tools for the actual authoring and maintaining of GLs, and correspondingly few analyses or reviews of GL development tool functionality. In order to assist GL developers in selecting and evaluating tools, this study tries to address the perceived gap by pursuing four goals: 1) identifying available tools, 2) reviewing a representative group of tools and their supported functionalities, 3) uncovering themes of features that the studied tools support, and 4) compare the selected tools with respect to the themes. METHODS We conducted a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar in order to find GL development tools (GDT). We also explored tools and Content Management Systems (CMS) used in representative organisations and international communities that develop and maintain GLs. By reading a selected representative group of five GL tool manuals, exploring tools hands-on, we uncovered 8 themes of features. All found tools were compared according to these themes in order to identify the level of functionality they offer to support the GL development and publishing process. In order to limit the scope, tools for designing computer-interpretable/executable GL are excluded. RESULTS After finding 1552 published papers, contacting 7 organizations and international communities, we identified a total of 19 unique tools, of which 5 tools were selected as representative in this paper. We uncovered a total of 8 themes of features according to the identified functionalities that each tool provides. Four features were common among tools: Collaborative authoring process support, user access control, GL repository management, electronic publishing. We found that the GRADE methodology was supported by three of the reviewed tools, while only two tools support annotating GL with MeSH terms. We also identified that monitoring progress, reference management, Managing versions (version control), and Change control (tracking) were often the missing features. CONCLUSION The results can promote sector discussion and eventual agreement on important tool functionality. It may aid tool and GL developers towards more efficient, and effective, GL authoring.","Khodambashi, Soudabeh; Nytrø, Øystein",BMC medical informatics and decision making,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-017-0530-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870182/,428

126951,The Evolution of the Walch Classification for Primary Glenohumeral Arthritis.,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented major challenges to the health sector in 2020. The burden of disease arising from COVID-19 can be expressed as the number of years of life lost to disease or death. For example, death at age 40 involves a loss of far more years of life than death at age 80. METHODS The disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost to COVID-19 were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost through death (YLL) and the number of years lived with disability (YLD), on the basis of laboratory-confirmed notifiable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany in 2020 (documented as of 18 January 2021). The methodology was based on that used in the Global Burden of Disease Study. Pre-existing diseases do not enter into the determination of YLL; rather, the residual life expectancy that is applied in this calculation corresponds to a mean age-specific level of morbidity. RESULTS 305 641 years of life were lost to COVID-19 in Germany in 2020. The percentage of DALY lost by persons under 70 was 34.8% in men and 21.0% in women. 99.3% of the COVID-19 disease burden was accounted for by death (YLL). The daily average years of life lost due to death was lower for COVID-19 than for the major non-communicable diseases. Persons who died of COVID-19 lost a mean of 9.6 years of life; those who were under 70 when they died lost a mean of 25.2 years of life. Men lost more years of life than women (11.0 vs. 8.1 years). CONCLUSION The effects of COVID-19 on public health can be expressed through the burden of disease indicators. This method yields additional information that should be put to use early in the course of future outbreaks.","Rommel, Alexander; Lippe, Elena von der; Plass, Dietrich; Ziese, Thomas; Diercke, Michaela; Heiden, Matthias An der; Haller, Sebastian; Wengler, Annelene",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2021.0147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958032/,428

A systematic review.,2020-02-29,"BACKGROUND Clinicians in resource-limited settings commonly use the World Health Organization criteria to diagnose pneumonia in children. AIM The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the WHO criteria compared with chest radiograph for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children under 5 years of age presenting to an emergency department (ED) in Nepal. METHODS A prospective cross-sectional study of children presenting to an ED with respiratory complaints in Nepal was conducted. It included all children under 5 years of age with cough or difficulty breathing who received a chest radiograph. Paediatric pneumonia was diagnosed according to WHO criteria when a child presented with a cough or difficulty breathing and met the age-related WHO-defined respiratory rate for tachypnoea. The criterion standard was radiographic pneumonia. The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of the WHO criteria for diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS Of 324 patients enrolled, 72 had radiographic pneumonia. The median (IQR) age was 17 (23) months. Overall, WHO criteria had a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI 59-81) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 50-63). Respiratory rate had poor diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia with an area under the curve of 0.65.

To minimize the patient's postoperative pain and morbidity including wound complication caused by two consecutive major abdominal operations, we adopted a totally laparoscopic approach and used a composite mesh graft. Also, to maximize the oncologic efficacy, we adopted the ""anterior approach"" technique. A 44-year-old woman with large hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in her right lobe was transferred to our hospital for surgical treatment. Preoperatively predicted FLR by a CT scan was 21% and type II portal vein anomaly was detected. A totally laparoscopic approach was planned. During the first stage operation, right anterior and posterior portal veins were meticulously dissected and tied. After parenchymal transection by the ""anterior approach"" technique, two glissonian pedicles of the right liver were individually isolated. A composite mesh graft was used to prevent severe adhesion on both liver partition surfaces. During the second-stage operation, 9 days after the first stage operation, the two isolated glissonian pedicles were initially transected. After full mobilization of the right lobe, the right hepatic vein was also transected. The right lobe was removed through the Pfannenstiel incision. She was discharged 7 days after the second stage operation. Her postoperative course was uneventful and there was no HCC recurrence for 15 months after hepatectomy. A totally laparoscopic ALPPS procedure can be a feasible technique that ensures patient safety and oncologic superiority, even in patients with complicated anatomical variation.","Ha, Heon Tak; Han, Young Seok; Chun, Jae Min",Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,https://doi.org/10.14701/ahbps.2017.21.4.217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29264585/,428

A previous pooled analysis clearly identified elevated D-dimer levels as being associated with severity of COVID-19. Since then, several other studies have provided clearer support for this initial evidence. However, potentially under-recognized by those reporting on D-dimer is the considerable variation in reporting units for D-dimer, and thus also the potential for misreporting of D-dimer data based on poor or incomplete reporting. A PubMed search was used to identify recent papers reporting on D-dimers in COVID-19-based studies. We report that: (1) most publications did not identify either the manufacturer or D-dimer product used; (2) most did not identify whether D-dimer values were reported as D-dimer units (DDU) or fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (~2 × differences); (3) nearly half did not identify normal cut-off values; (4) some did not report numerical findings or units for D-dimer; (5) where reported, most identified units as either mg/L or μg/mL; (6) we identified at least four errors in reporting from 21 papers.

However, reports of hemolysis call for caution in using these pumps, especially in neonatology and in pediatric intensive care. Cavitation can be a cause of blood damage. The aim of our study was to obtain information about the cavitation conditions and to provide the safest operating range of centrifugal pumps. A series of tests were undertaken to determine the points at which pump performance decreases 3% and gas bubbles start to appear downstream of the pump. Two pumps were tested; pump R with a closed impeller and pump S with a semiopen impeller. The performance tests demonstrated that pump S has an optimal region narrower than pump R and it is shifted to the higher flows. When the pump performance started to decrease, the inlet pressure varies but close to -150 mmHg in the test with low gas content and higher than -100 mmHg in the tests with increased gas content. The same trend was observed at the points of development of massive gas emboli. Importantly, small packages of bubbles downstream of the pump were registered at relatively high inlet pressures. The gaseous cavitation in centrifugal pumps is a phenomenon that appears with decreasing inlet pump pressures. There are a few ways to increase inlet pump pressures: (1) positioning the pump as low as possible in relation to the patient; (2) selecting appropriate sized venous cannulas and their careful positioning; and (3) controlling patient's volume status.","Ganushchak, Yuri M; Körver, Erik Pj; Maessen, Jos G",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659120936453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32627671/,428

Technique effectiveness and 1-year local recurrence were evaluated by computed tomographic scans. Complications, mortality, and hospital days were recorded. The performance between an experienced and inexperienced interventional radiologist was compared. RESULTS The overall technique effectiveness after a single SRFA was 95.5% (93.1% for HCC and 97.1% for metastases). Four of the eight unsuccessfully treated lesions could be retreated (secondary technique effectiveness of 97.7%). Local recurrence at 1 year was 2.9%. Technique effectiveness was significantly different for lesions<5 cm (96.7%) and >5 cm (87.5%) (P=0.044) but not for lesions<3 cm (95.9%) and 3-5 cm (100%). Compared to clear parenchymal property (97.3%), vessel vicinity (93.3%) (P=0.349) and subcapsular (95.2%) (P=0.532) had no, but hollow viscera vicinity (83.3%) had a significantly lower technique effectiveness (P=0.020). Mortality rate was 0.9%. Major complications and hospital days were higher for cirrhosis Child-Pugh B (20%, 7.2 days) than Child-Pugh A (3.1%, 4.7 days) patients and for metastases (5.1%, 4.3 days).

RESULTS There was no significant difference in the operative time and blood loss between the two groups. However, the VAS pain scores were significantly better in the SITS group in first 24 hours after surgery. Patient satisfaction scores in the SITS group were also significantly better in the first 24 and 48 hours after operation. CONCLUSION Although three-port thoracoscopic surgery for PSP is well established, SITS results in better patient satisfaction and decreased postoperative pain in the treatment of PSP.","Chen, Pin-Ru; Chen, Chien-Kuang; Lin, Yu-Sen; Huang, Hsu-Chih; Tsai, Jian-Shun; Chen, Chih-Yi; Fang, Hsin-Yuan",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8090-6-58; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507268/,428

These individuals require additional support to achieve good sexual health but the best way to provide this remains needs to be better understood. Methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials of behavioural and psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting sexual health in high-risk young populations. Outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants were under 25 years old and in one of the following high-risk groups: alcohol and other drug use; ethnic minority; homeless; justice-involved; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; or out-of-home care. Results: Twenty-eight papers from 26 trials met our inclusion criteria, with all but one conducted in North America. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure along with knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health but considerable differences in measures used made comparisons across studies difficult. Change in knowledge and attitudes did not consistently result in long-term change in behaviours. Conclusions: There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America across all high-risk groups of young people. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes, with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work. An international consensus on outcome measures would support the research field going forward, making future meta-analyses possible.","Brown, Ellie; Lo Monaco, Samantha; O'Donoghue, Brian; Nolan, Hayley; Hughes, Elizabeth; Graham, Melissa; Simmons, Magenta; Gray, Richard",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501652/,428

The authors of this paper synthesized the available MRI data for forensic age estimation in living children and young adults to provide a comprehensive overview that can guide age estimation practice and future research. To do so, the authors searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science, along with cited and citing articles and study registers. Two authors independently selected articles, conducted data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. They considered study populations including living subjects up to 30 years old. Fifty-five studies were included in qualitative analysis and 33 in quantitative analysis. Most studies had biases including use of relatively small European (Caucasian) populations, varying MR approaches and varying staging techniques. Therefore, it was not appropriate to pool the age distribution data. The authors found that reproducibility of staging was remarkably lower in clavicles than in any other anatomical structure. Age estimation performance was in line with the gold standard, radiography, with mean absolute errors ranging from 0.85 years to 2.0 years. The proportion of correctly classified minors ranged from 65% to 91%. Multifactorial age estimation performed better than that based on a single anatomical site. The authors found that more multifactorial age estimation studies are necessary, together with studies testing whether the MRI data can safely be pooled. The current review results can guide future studies, help medical professionals to decide on the preferred approach for specific cases, and help judicial professionals to interpret the evidential value of age estimation results.","De Tobel, Jannick; Bauwens, Jeroen; Parmentier, Griet I L; Franco, Ademir; Pauwels, Nele S; Verstraete, Koenraad L; Thevissen, Patrick W",Pediatric radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-020-04709-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734341/,428
135307,Advancing research and evidence for compassion-based interventions: A matter of the head or heart?,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Artificial stroke models can be used for testing various thrombectomy devices. OBJECTIVE To determine the value of combined stentriever-aspiration thrombectomy compared with the stentriever-alone approach. METHODS We designed an in vitro model of the intracranial circulation with a focus on the middle cerebral artery (MCA) that closely resembles the human intracranial circulation. After introducing fresh clot in the MCA, we used conventional biplane angiography and microangiographic fluoroscopy to compare recanalization rates and occurrence of emboli in new, unaffected territory for thrombectomy approaches in which a stentriever (Solitaire flow restoration stentriever, Covidien) was used alone or in combination with continuous manual aspiration through a Navien catheter (Covidien). RESULTS In a total of 22 experiments (11 for each approach), successful clot delivery to the MCA was achieved in all cases. Successful angiographic recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b-3) was achieved more frequently with the combined stentriever-aspiration approach than with the stentriever-alone approach (in 10 vs 4 experiments, p=0.023). Emboli in new territory occurred in three experiments with the stentriever-alone approach, and none were seen with the combined approach (p=0.21). CONCLUSIONS The combined stentriever-aspiration approach to thrombectomy leads to better angiographic recanalization rates than use of the stentriever alone. Further experiments are needed to test the value of balloon-guide catheters and aspiration performed using other types of catheters and modes of aspiration.","Mokin, Maxim; Ionita, Ciprian N; Nagesh, Swetadri Vasan Setlur; Rudin, Stephen; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789594/,428
135583,A systematic review examining the effectiveness of medicines information services for patients and the general public.,2019,"The introduction of first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) was a major advance in the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease, with DES significantly reducing the incidence of restenosis and major adverse coronary events compared with bare metal stents. Next-generation DES now utilizes lower profiles, thinner struts, and other technological advances to help extend their safety and efficacy. Importantly, studies of next-generation devices have now gone beyond controlled clinical trials with selected populations to registries and studies with all-comer populations, where more diverse and complex sets of patients and lesions have been managed. Thus, a large body of evidence and comparative data about the safety and efficacy of these devices has accumulated. The Resolute™ zotarolimus-eluting stent (R-ZES; Medtronic Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) is a next-generation DES that uses a novel biocompatible polymer on a cobalt alloy stent platform to extend the duration of drug elution and improve the stent's efficacy. The Integrity™ platform (Medtronic, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) used in the most recent iteration of the R-ZES stent further enhances the flexibility and deliverability of the stent in complex lesions by incorporation of a continuous sinusoidal design. In the following review, the clinical data is critically examined for the R-ZES and discuss its performance using comparative data currently available for next-generation DES. It is concluded that R-ZES use in complex patients and lesions is associated with durable efficacy and safety and represents another generational improvement in DES technology, which undoubtedly will enhance patient outcomes postpercutaneous coronary interventional.","Banerjee, Subhash",Cardiology and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40119-012-0010-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135286/,428

Searches of the recent peer-reviewed literature were conducted for descriptions of relevant training. Federal guidance issued during 2015 was also reviewed. Four stakeholder meetings were conducted with representatives from health care, academia, private industry, and public health to discuss issues associated with ongoing training. Our results revealed few articles about training that provided sufficient detail to serve as models. Training programs struggled to adjust to frequently updated federal guidance. Stakeholders commented that most healthcare training focused solely on infection control, and there was an absence of employee health-related training for non-healthcare providers. Challenges to ongoing training included funding and organizational complacency. Best practices were noted where management and employees planned training cooperatively and where infection control, employee health, and hospital emergency managers worked together on the development of protective guidance. We conclude that sustainable training for infectious disease outbreaks requires annual funding, full support from organizational management, input from all stakeholders, and integration of infection control, emergency management, and employee health when implementing guidance and training.","Yeskey, Kevin; Hughes, Joseph; Galluzzo, Betsy; Jaitly, Nina; Remington, James; Weinstock, Deborah; Lee Pearson, Joy; Rosen, Jonathan D",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2016.0116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28636448/,428

This study examines the cross-sectional association between depressive symptoms and vegetarian diets while controlling for potential confounders. Among 90,380 subjects from the population-based Constances cohort, depressive symptoms were defined by a score ≥19 on the Centre of Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale and diet types (omnivorous, pesco-vegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian and vegan) were determined with a food frequency questionnaire. Associations between depressive symptoms and diet were estimated through logistic regressions adjusting for socio-demographics, other foods, alcohol and tobacco consumption, physical activity and health-related concerns; specificity analyses considered the exclusion of any other food group. Depressive symptoms were associated with pesco-vegetarian and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets in multivariable analyses (Odds-Ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.43 [1.19⁻1.72] and 1.36 [1.09⁻1.70], respectively), especially in case of low legumes intake (p for interaction < 0.0001), as well as with the exclusion of any food group (e.g., 1.37 [1.24⁻1.52], 1.40 [1.31⁻1.50], 1.71 [1.49⁻1.97] for meat, fish and vegetables exclusion, respectively). Regardless of food type, the Odds-Ratio of depressive symptoms gradually increased with the number of excluded food groups (p for trend < 0.0001).

These excellent results cannot be achieved without VAD teams who know the detail of surgical techniques and perioperative management. Preoperative optimization of RV function is essential and intraoperative managements are focused on adequate balance between right and left ventricle to prevent right ventricular (RV) failure. For postoperative RV failure early institution of temporary RV mechanical support improves outcomes. Immediate CT scanning is crucial if LVAD patients complain of new neurological symptoms. When CT reveals cerebral hemorrhage, INR should be reduced as soon as possible. The driveline (DL) exit site remains a significant source of LVAD-related infections, and orientation and immobilization of the DL is important. Although vacuum assisted closure is useful to facilitate drainage and healing in pump pocket as well as DL infections, urgent heart transplantation, bridging to recovery, or pump exchange may become the only options to eradicate LVAD-related infections. Patients with continuous flow LVAD are more prone to developing de novo aortic insufficiency. Although majority of them can be managed medically, some require surgical intervention. The cause of pump thrombosis is multifactorial, including lowered INR and pump speed, and implantation techniques. It is important to exchange pumps in a timely manner either through a median sternotomy or subcostal incision in highly suspected patients indicated by elevated LDH and left-sided heart failure.","Toda, Koichi; Sawa, Yoshiki",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-014-0480-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370679/,428

DESIGN Retrospective, population-based cohort study of cancer decedents between 2004 and 2015. SETTING Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS We grouped 13 085 immigrants who arrived in Ontario in 1985 or later into eight major ethnic groups based on birth country, mother tongue and surname, and compared them to 229 471 long-term residents who were ≥18 years at the time of death. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Aggressive care, defined as a composite of ≥2 emergency department visits, ≥2 new hospitalisations or an intensive care unit admission within 30 days of death; and supportive care, defined as a physician house call within 2 weeks, or palliative nursing or personal support worker home visit within 6 months of death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between immigration status and the odds of each main outcome. RESULTS Compared with long-term residents, immigrants overall and by ethnic group had higher rates of aggressive care (13.7% vs 17.5%, respectively; p<0.001). Among immigrants, Southeast Asians had the highest use while White-Eastern and Western Europeans had the lowest. Supportive care use was similar between long-term residents and immigrants (50.0% vs 50.5%, respectively; p=0.36), though lower among Southeast Asians (46.6%) and higher among White-Western Europeans (55.6%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, immigrants remained more likely than long-term residents to receive aggressive care (OR: 1.15, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.21), yet were less likely to receive supportive care (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). CONCLUSIONS Among cancer decedents in Ontario, immigrants are more likely to use aggressive healthcare services at the end of life than long-term residents, while supportive care varies by ethnicity. Contributors to variation in end-of-life care require further study.","Chu, Anna; Barbera, Lisa; Sutradhar, Rinku; Oz, Urun Erbas; O'Leary, Erin; Seow, Hsien",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078633/,428
144875,Combining opioid and adrenergic mechanisms for chronic pain.,2014,"Background: While antenatal corticosteroids are routinely used to decrease adverse neonatal outcomes following preterm delivery, corticosteroids are also associated with worse outcomes in patients with viral respiratory infections. Currently in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear whether antenatal corticosteroids for infant benefit outweigh the potential harm to a pregnant woman with a COVID-19 infection.Objective: To determine at which gestational ages administering antenatal corticosteroids is the optimal management strategy for hospitalized women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) who have a COVID-19 infection.Methods: We designed a decision-analytic model to assess the maternal and infant outcomes associated with antenatal corticosteroid administration for risk of preterm delivery following rupture of membranes in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. We used a theoretical cohort of 10,000 women at each gestational age between 24 and 32 weeks who were hospitalized with PPROM and found to be COVID-19 positive. Maternal outcomes included intensive care unit admission and death related to COVID-19 infection. The infant outcomes of interest included respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, neurodevelopmental delay, and death, and were assessed along with maternal and infant quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate model assumptions.Results: In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women with COVID-19 infection and preterm prelabor rupture of membrane between 24 and 32 weeks, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths at each gestational age. No antenatal corticosteroid use resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths at each gestational age. Antenatal corticosteroid administration also resulted in fewer cases of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and infant death. Overall, we found that between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation, administering antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy as it resulted in higher combined QALYs than no corticosteroid use. For 31 and 32 weeks of gestation, antenatal corticosteroid administration resulted in lower combined QALYs. On sensitivity analyses, we found that with increasing gestational age, the probability which antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy decreased.Conclusion: Administration of antenatal corticosteroids was an effective management strategy compared to no corticosteroid administration at gestational ages less than 31 weeks. These results provide data for clinicians to utilize when counseling pregnant patients hospitalized with PPROM and have a COVID-19 infection.","Zhou, Clarice G; Packer, Claire H; Hersh, Alyssa R; Caughey, Aaron B","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1763951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429722/,428
145280,Prolonged treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with high-flow nasal oxygen: A story of oxygen and resilience.,2020-10-08,"Accurate mechanics measurements during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) facilitate optimizing ventilator support settings. Yet, these are influenced substantially by endotracheal tube (ETT) contributions, which may dominate when leaks around uncuffed ETT are present. We hypothesized that 1) the effective removal of ETT leaks may be confirmed via direct comparison of measured vs. model-predicted mean intratracheal pressure [mPtr (meas) vs. mPtr (pred)], and 2) reproducible respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs) may be derived from no-leak oscillatory Ptr and proximal flow. With the use of ETT test-lung models, proximal airway opening (Pao) and distal (Ptr) pressures and flows were measured during slow-cuff inflations until leaks are removed. These were repeated for combinations of HFOV settings [frequency, mean airway pressure (Paw), oscillation amplitudes (ΔP), and inspiratory time (%t(I))] and varying test-lung Crs. Results showed that leaks around the ETT will 1) systematically reduce the effective distending pressures and lung-delivered oscillatory volumes, and 2) derived mechanical properties are increasingly nonphysiologic as leaks worsen. Mean pressures were systematically reduced along the ventilator circuit and ETT (Paw > Pao > Ptr), even for no-leak conditions. ETT size-specific regression models were then derived for predicting mPtr based on mean Pao (mPao), ΔP, %t(I), and frequency. Next, in 10 of 11 studied preterm infants (0.77 ± 0.24 kg), no-to-minimal leak was confirmed based on excellent agreement between mPtr (meas) and mPtr (pred), and consequently, their oscillatory respiratory mechanics were evaluated. Infant resistance at the proximal ETT (R(ETT); resistance airway opening = R(ETT) + Rrs; P < 0.001) and ETT inertance (P = 0.014) increased significantly with increasing ΔP (50%, 100%, and 150% baseline), whereas Rrs showed a modest, nonsignificant increase (P = 0.14), and Crs was essentially unchanged (P = 0.39). We conclude that verifying no-leak conditions is feasible by comparison of model-derived vs. distending mPtr (meas). This facilitated the reliable and accurate assessment of physiologic respiratory mechanical properties that can objectively guide ventilatory management of HFOV-treated preterm infants.","Singh, Rachana; Courtney, Sherry E; Weisner, Michael D; Habib, Robert H",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.01120.2011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22207721/,428

AIM A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to elicit treatment attribute preferences among patients with haemophilia A and caregivers of children with haemophilia A. MATERIALS & METHODS A survey of sociodemographics and preferences was completed by an online panel of adult patients with haemophilia A and caregivers of children (<18 years) with haemophilia A. The DCE included a series of questions in which respondents chose their preferred option from pairs of hypothetical treatment profiles with systematic variation in the levels of six attributes (safety concerns with too much clotting, bleed protection, dosing frequency, length of time the product has been approved for use, product type and joint health studies). Preference weights and relative attribute importance scores were estimated using random parameters logit models. RESULTS One hundred and thirteen patients (mean age: 35.5 years) and 96 caregivers (mean age of child: 10.3 years) were included. For patients with haemophilia A, the top three attributes ranked from the most to least important were: (a) dosing frequency; (b) bleed protection; and (c) safety concerns with too much clotting. For caregivers of children with haemophilia A, the ranking was as follows: (a) safety concerns; (b) bleed protection; and (c) dosing.

146686,Prevalence of Comorbid Anxiety Disorders and Their Associated Factors in Patients with Bipolar Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder.,2020,"PROBLEM There is a paucity of guidance regarding implementation of telemedicine curricula at the clerkship level, particularly with students actively engaged in video and telephone encounters. The COVID-19 pandemic caused rapid shifts in the delivery of medical education to clerkship-level students. This article describes the successful pilot of a direct patient care, virtual health curriculum at the clerkship level and discusses lessons learned. APPROACH All 18 preceptors and 5 students at Stanford University School of Medicine, California, enrolled in the required 4-week family medicine clerkship in April 2020 were connected as virtual partners via a commercial video platform. The combined use of both this video program and Epic electronic health record (EHR) software as modes for teaching and patient care led to technical challenges and logistical hurdles. As part of an iterative process, clerkship leadership identified problems via preceptor and student interviews and integrated that feedback in order to create a model for delivering high-quality, clerkship-level clinical instruction during the COVID-19 shelter in place order. OUTCOMES Of those who completed an evaluation, the majority of preceptors (n = 16; 89%) and students (n = 4; 100%, 1 student did not respond) expressed satisfaction with the virtual, remote teaching model conducted over 37 clinic visits. A detailed 14-step process list resulted from identifying and addressing both audio and video technical challenges and is provided for use by other institutions that wish to implement this workflow. NEXT STEPS Future directions include assessing patient perspectives on the involvement of students in virtual visits, soliciting patient input for a more robust patient-physician-student virtual experience, and integrating a multi-party platform, when available, via the EHR to afford greater student autonomy.","Rydel, Tracy A; Bajra, Rika; Schillinger, Erika",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883401/,428

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to comprehensively review definitions of continuous CMR scores in children <10 years of age. METHODS A scoping review was conducted using a systematic search of four scientific databases up to June 2016. Inclusion criteria were children <10 years of age and report of a continuous CMR score. RESULTS Ninety-one articles were included. Most studies were published from 2007 to 2016 (96%). Nearly all continuous CMR scores (90%) were calculated using the sum or the mean of z-scores, and many articles age-standardized and sex-standardized components within their own population. The mean number of variables included in the risk scores was 5 with a range of 3-11. The most commonly included score components were waist circumference (52%), triglycerides (87%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (67%), glucose (43%) and systolic blood pressure (52%). IMPORTANCE Continuous CMR scores are emerging frequently in the child health literature and are calculated using numerous methods with diverse components. This heterogeneity limits comparability across studies.

147040,Factors Contributing to Missing COVID-19 Cases During Contact Tracing-Reply.,2021-03-15,"Pathogen spillover from managed bees is increasingly considered as a possible cause of pollinator decline. Though spillover has been frequently documented, evidence of the pathogen's virulence in the new host or mechanism of transmission is rare. Stingless bees (Apocrita: Meliponini) are crucial pollinators pan-tropically and overlap with managed honeybees (Apis mellifera) in much of their range. Nosema ceranae is the most prevalent disease of adult A. mellifera. We used laboratory experiments and field surveys to investigate the susceptibility of stingless bees (Tetragonula hockingsi) to N. ceranae, infection prevalence and transmissibility via flowers. We found that 67% of T. hockingsi fed sucrose with N. ceranae had detectable spores in their ventriculus, and they died at 2.96 times the rate of sucrose-only fed bees. Five of six field hives harboured bees with N. ceranae present at least once during our five-month survey, with prevalence up to 20%. In our floral transmission experiment, 67% of inflorescences exposed to infected A. mellifera yielded N. ceranae spores, and all resulted in T. hockingsi with N. ceranae spores in their guts. We conclude that N. ceranae is virulent in T. hockingsi under laboratory conditions, is common in the local T. hockingsi population and is transmissible via flowers.","Purkiss, Terence; Lach, Lori",Proceedings.

147176,The experience of financial burden for patients with multimorbidity: A protocol for a systematic review of qualitative research.,2019,"BACKGROUND The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility of minimally invasive digestive anastomosis using a modular flexible magnetic anastomotic device made up of a set of two flexible chains of magnetic elements. The assembly possesses a non-deployed linear configuration which allows it to be introduced through a dedicated small-sized applicator into the bowel where it takes the deployed form. A centering suture allows the mating between the two parts to be controlled in order to include the viscerotomy between the two magnetic rings and the connected viscera. METHODS AND PROCEDURES Eight pigs were involved in a 2-week survival experimental study. In five colorectal anastomoses, the proximal device was inserted by a percutaneous endoscopic technique, and the colon was divided below the magnet. The distal magnet was delivered transanally to connect with the proximal magnet. In three jejunojejunostomies, the first magnetic chain was injected in its linear configuration through a small enterotomy. Once delivered, the device self-assembled into a ring shape. A second magnet was injected more distally through the same port. The centering sutures were tied together extracorporeally and, using a knot pusher, magnets were connected. Ex vivo strain testing to determine the compression force delivered by the magnetic device, burst pressure of the anastomosis, and histology were performed. RESULTS Mean operative time including endoscopy was 69.2 ± 21.9 min, and average time to full patency was 5 days for colorectal anastomosis. Operative times for jejunojejunostomies were 125, 80, and 35 min, respectively. The postoperative period was uneventful. Burst pressure of all anastomoses was ≥ 110 mmHg. Mean strain force to detach the devices was 6.1 ± 0.98 and 12.88 ± 1.34 N in colorectal and jejunojejunal connections, respectively. Pathology showed a mild-to-moderate inflammation score. CONCLUSIONS The modular magnetic system showed enormous potential to create minimally invasive digestive anastomoses, and may represent an alternative to stapled anastomoses, being easy to deliver, effective, and low cost.","Diana, Michele; Mutter, Didier; Lindner, Véronique; Vix, Michel; Chung, Hyunsoo; Demartines, Nicolas; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3360-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24385246/,428

148136,Traveling to New York City to Tackle COVID-19.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND To date, transgastric access in humans for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been poorly evaluated. OBJECTIVE To compare endoscopic visualization of the transgastric access point with the laparoscopically defined ideal entrance to the peritoneal cavity. DESIGN Prospective pilot study in humans. SETTING Single tertiary-care center. PATIENTS This study involved 31 patients referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. INTERVENTION Access points were marked by endoscopy alone, endoscopy combined with diaphanoscopy, and endoscopy after pneumoperitoneum. Points were correlated with a laparoscopically visualized, previously defined ideal access area. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS To choose the appropriate access point within the laparoscopically defined ideal access area to the peritoneal cavity away from major vessels and adjacent organs, by using endoscopy and to establish landmarks for the endoscopist, look for a learning curve, and identify potential problems. RESULTS The percentage of access points within the laparoscopically defined ideal area was 35.5% with endoscopy alone, 13.8% using the diaphanoscopy method, and 45.2% after transcutaneous pneumoperitoneum. A safe access point (> or = 3 cm from major gastric vessels) could be achieved with the 3 techniques in 83.9%, 65.5%, and 87.1% of patients, respectively. A positive learning curve for endoscopic localization was identified before (P = .008) and after (P = .014) pneumoperitoneum. Virtual complications were greater in obese patients. LIMITATIONS This was a small pilot study with hypothetical complications and problems, because actual transgastric access was not performed. The criteria for an ideal access area were very strict. CONCLUSION Endoscopy, especially with the use of pneumoperitoneum, can reliably locate a safe transgastric entrance point. However, the endoscopically chosen site correlates poorly with the ideal laparoscopically determined site for transgastric access.","Linke, Georg R; Zerz, Andreas; Kapitza, Florian; Warschkow, Rene; Lange, Jochen; Meyenberger, Christa M; Binek, Janek",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2009.11.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226453/,428

The recently introduced knotless barbed suture may provide better outcomes, faster closure time, and decreased material utilization. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the impact of barbed sutures on: (1) wound-related complications; (2) closure and operative time; (3) patient outcomes (range of motion and Knee Society Scores [KSS]); and (4) effects on cosmesis and patients' satisfaction. A literature search was performed using up to February 2017. Barbed sutures were associated with shorter closure times, shorter operative times, and larger cost savings per procedure as well as comparable wound complication rates after total joint arthroplasty. Although the current review is limited by the number of studies included, it demonstrates that overall, barbed sutures contribute to surgical efficiency when compared with conventional skin closure modalities.","Faour, Mhamad; Khlopas, Anton; Elmallah, Randa K; Chughtai, Morad; Kolisek, Frank R; Barrington, John W; Mont, Michael A",The journal of knee surgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1615812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294498/,428

Two experimental conditions are described with the aim of finding whether the ""attractiveness effect"" results from attention to internal or external facial features, or both. Pairs of attractive and less attractive faces (as judged by adults) were shown to newborn infants (mean age 2 days, 9 hours), where each pair had either identical internal features (and different external features) or identical external features (and different internal features). In the latter, but not the former, condition the infants looked longer at the attractive faces. These findings are clear evidence that newborn infants use information about internal facial features in making preferences based on attractiveness. It is suggested that when newborn (and older) infants are presented with facial stimuli, whether dynamic or static, they are able to attend both to internal and external facial features.","Slater, Alan; Bremner, Gavin; Johnson, Scott P; Sherwood, Penny; Hayes, Rachel; Brown, Elizabeth",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0102_8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680294/,428

However, a technical standard for oxygen therapy nursing, as well as how this would improve clinical outcomes and symptoms, is yet to be explored. METHODS From February 9, 2020, to March 31, 2020, 58 patients of confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the 20th ward of the Eastern Branch, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Fifteen patients who did not receive oxygen therapy and 13 patients who were transferred from other hospitals were excluded. The rest of the 30 patients that received standardized oxygen therapy in our unit were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, and finger pulse oxygen saturation were collected during hospitalization. RESULTS Clinical outcomes of the 30 patients were as follows: 27 patients (90.00%) were cured and discharged; 3 patients (10.00%) who continued to stay in hospital were stabilized with symptoms relieved. The fingertip oxygen saturation was 94.80%±3.49% at ICU admission and 97.8%±1.27% when transferred out of ICU after standardized oxygen therapy (P<0.005). The symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and muscle aches of the patients were improved when transferred out of ICU, compared with their condition when admitted to ICU (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The standardized oxygen therapy nursing strategy for patients with COVID-19 emphasizes the nursing measurement, which focuses on the patient's oxygenation. It is led by nurses and starts oxygen therapy at an earlier stage. It not only improves the clinical outcomes of critical patients but also effectively reduces the infection risk of medical staff while emphasizing nursing quality management.","Pan, Wenyan; Li, Jingjing; Ou, Yufeng; Wu, Yitao; Cai, Shining; Zhang, Yuxia; Wang, Chunling",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692228/,428

Computed tomography (CT) was performed in the conscious cat to avoid aggravation of air leakage associated with ventilation. The additional CT findings were consistent with a novel pattern of a traumatic avulsion of the left principal bronchus expanding into the carina and caudal thoracic trachea. Despite the complex avulsion pattern, successful treatment was achieved surgically by performing an end-to-end anastomosis via a fifth right intercostal lateral thoracotomy.

Genomic studies of these strains shall aid in deciphering potential drug targets and genomic influence on pathogenesis. Hence, in this study we performed deep statistical profiling of codon usage in these serovars. The overall base composition analysis reveals that these serovars are over biased to AU than GC. Similarly, relative synonymous codon usage also showed preference towards A/U ending codons. Parity Rule 2 analysis inferred unequal distribution of AT and GC, indicative of other unknown factors acting along with mutational pressure to influence codon usage bias (CUB). Moreover, absolute quantification of CUB also revealed lower bias across these serovars.

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) receptor and dual-labeled trastuzumab with both a fluorophore (IRDye800CW) and a radioactive label (111In) can be used for multimodal imaging of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of HER2-targeted multimodal imaging using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast cancer model. METHODS Trastuzumab was conjugated with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl (ITC)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and IRDye800CW-NHS ester and subsequently labeled with 111In. In a dose escalation study, the biodistribution of 10, 30, and 100 μg [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW was determined 48 h after injection in BALB/c nude mice with orthotopic high HER2-expressing tumors. Also, a biodistribution study was performed in a low HER2-expressing breast cancer model. In addition, multimodal image-guided surgery was performed in each group. Autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemically stained slices of the tumors were compared for co-localization of tumor tissue, HER2 expression, fluorescence, and radiosignal. RESULTS Based on the biodistribution data, a 30 μg dose of dual-labeled trastuzumab (tumor-to-blood ratio 13 ± 2) was chosen for all subsequent studies. [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors (101 ± 7 %IA/g), whereas uptake in orthotopic low HER2-expressing MCF7 tumor was significantly lower (1.2 ± 0.2 %IA/g, p = 0.007). BT474 tumors could clearly be visualized with both micro-SPECT/CT, fluorescence imaging and subsequently, image-guided resection was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors demonstrated correspondence in fluorescence, radiosignal, and high HER2 expression. CONCLUSIONS Dual-labeled trastuzumab showed specific accumulation in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors with micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging and enabled image-guided tumor resection. In the clinical setting, [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW could be valuable for preoperative detection of (metastatic) tumors by SPECT/CT imaging, and intraoperative localization by using a gamma probe and fluorescence image-guided surgery to improve radical resection of tumor tissue in patients with HER2-positive tumors.","Deken, Marion M; Bos, Desirée L; Tummers, Willemieke S F J; March, Taryn L; van de Velde, Cornelis J H; Rijpkema, Mark; Vahrmeijer, Alexander L",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-019-0564-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31754913/,428

Results Five were men. The median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 27 to 33). In three cases the physician worked more than 12 hours a day in emergency and hospitalization services and not wear a mask at all times. The most frequent symptoms were axillary temperature above 38°C, malaise, dry cough, and odynophagia (the latter in three of the cases). The diagnosis was made at a median of 3 days (interquartile range: 3 to 4 days). The symptoms that persisted the most were dry cough (present during ten days in four doctors). Dysgeusia was the only symptom with the most extended duration (15 days in only one doctor). In the six cases, the course was favorable. However, these doctors found it difficult to return to functions in their hospital centers adequately.

Clinical relevance of medical technical innovations often remains unclear even though laparoscopic surgical procedures are characterized by continual advancement of various devices. Lately, in dissection and sealing technology, fast-cutting ultrasonic scissors are combined with simultaneous bipolar coagulation (bimodal dissection device (BDD)). We investigated how this new technology, operative expertise, and patient-specific factors (body mass index, age) influence operation time in laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection. METHODS Between 2008 and 2016, 161 laparoscopic sigmoid resections (52% conventional dissection device (CDD); 48% BDD) performed in a single center were retrospectively evaluated. Biometric patient data, complication rates, and surgery duration, reflecting the learning curve, were analyzed. Operations were performed by experienced surgeons (n = 3) and trainees (n = 4). RESULTS Minor postoperative complications (e.g., impaired wound healing, non-revisional secondary bleeding) occurred in 11 cases (6.8%). Major complications (e.g., bleeding requiring revision, anastomotic leakage) were observed in 3.7%. No heat-related coagulation damage was observed. BDD reduced operation time for both experienced (CDD 150 min, BDD 125 min; p < 0.001) and trainee surgeons (CDD 169 min, BDD 135 min; p = 0.036). Reduction of operation time (indicative of a learning curve in progress) was observed for all surgeons. The curve was steeper using BDD. CONCLUSIONS Patient-specific factors did not have a significant effect on operation time. Even taking the learning curve into account, a combination of ultrasonic dissection and simultaneous bipolar coagulation reduces operation time of laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid resection, regardless of surgeon's expertise.","Weyhe, Dirk; Uslar, Verena Nicole; Tabriz, Navid; Burkowski, Ina; Heinzel, Ralf; Müller, Andreas; Belling, Annette; Köckerling, Ferdinand",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-017-2896-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28879419/,428

Actually, participants (Study 1 N = 80, Study 2 N = 78) were given the same non-mealworm containing food in all conditions. Disgust was measured using: tactile sensitivity, food intake, liking and desire to eat. Results of Study 1 showed that a sustainability passage (sustainability advantages of entomophagy), but not a delicacy passage (oro-sensory qualities of insects), was effective in reducing disgust. In Study 2, contrary to prediction, a passage describing the sustainability and nutritional advantages entomophagy failed to reduce disgust - falafel intake, liking and desire to eat were decreased. However, a passage which described how mealworm flour is produced, did significantly reduce disgust. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that written passages can alter the disgust response, notably resulting in a maintenance of food intake. Interventions that increase the perception of familiarity of a novel food, but not logic-based arguments, may be a key driver of the amelioration of disgust. These results also support the suggestion that altering the ideational component of disgust can result in changes of distaste perception.","Gumussoy, Maya; Macmillan, Chloe; Bryant, Stephanie; Hunt, David F; Rogers, Peter J",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.105088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385476/,428

Following implantation of mammalian cancer cells into the perivitelline space of developing zebrafish embryos, both local and intravenous oncolytic virus treatments produce a tumor-specific infection with measurable antitumor effects. Tumor cells are injected at 48 h post fertilization, with oncolytic virus treatment then being administered 24 h later to allow for an initial period of tumor development and angiogenesis. Confocal fluorescent imaging is used to quantify dynamics within the tumor environment. The natural translucency of zebrafish at the embryo stage, coupled with the availability of strains with fluorescent immune and endothelial cell reporter lines, gives the model broad potential to allow for real time, in vivo investigation of important events within tumors throughout the course of virotherapy. Zebrafish xenografts offer a system with biologic fidelity to processes in human cancer development that influence oncolytic virus efficacy, and to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the model's use in the context of virotherapy. Compared with other models, our protocol offers a powerful, inexpensive approach to evaluating novel oncolytic viruses and oncolytic virus-based combination therapies, with potential application to investigating the impacts of virotherapy on immune response, tumor vasculature, and metastatic disease.","Mealiea, David; Boudreau, Emilie; De Silva, Naomi; Okamoto, Lili; Ho, Tiffany; Fish, Jason E; McCart, J Andrea",Cancer gene therapy,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-020-0194-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647136/,428

We measured keratometry, central corneal thickness (CCT), white-to-white (WtW) distance, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and axial lentgh (AL) both before and after cycloplegia. The IOL powers were calculated using Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff/theoretical (SRK/T), Holladay 1 and Haigis formulas. AL-Scan (Nidek Co., Gamagori, Japan) was used for all measurements. RESULTS There was a significant increased in keratometry, CCT, ACD, AL, and Holladay 1 after cycloplegia (p < 0.05), whereas WtW, SRK/T, and Haigis were not changed significantly in group 1 (p > 0.05).

156710,Distance Assessment for Detecting Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: A Systematic Review of Psychometric Evidence.,2020-12-08,"Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving therapy; therefore, equitable distribution of this scarce resource is of paramount importance. We searched contemporary literature on racial, gender, and socioeconomic disparities across the LT care cascade in referral, waitlisting practices, allocation, and post-LT care. We subsequently identified gaps in the literature and future research priorities. Studies found that racial and ethnic minorities (Black and Hispanic patients) have lower rates of LT referral, more advanced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma at diagnosis, and are less likely to undergo living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Gender-based disparities were observed in waitlist mortality and LT allocation. Women have lower LT rates after waitlisting, with size mismatch accounting for much of the disparity. Medicaid insurance has been associated with higher rates of chronic liver disease and poor waitlist outcomes. After LT, some studies found lower overall survival among Black compared to White recipients. Studies have also shown lower literacy and limited educational attainment were associated with increased post-transplant complications and lower use of digital technology. However, there are notable gaps in the literature on disparities in LT. Detailed population-based estimates of the advanced liver disease burden, LT referral and evaluation practices, including for LDLT, are lacking. Similarly, little is known about LT disparities worldwide. Evidence-based strategies to improve access to care and reduce disparities have not been comprehensively identified. CONCLUSION: Prospective registries and alternative ""real-world"" databases can provide more detailed information on disease burden and clinical practices. Modeling and simulation studies can identify ways to reduce gender disparities due to size or inaccurate estimation of renal function. Mixed-methods studies and clinical trials should be conducted to reduce care disparities across the transplant continuum.","Nephew, Lauren D; Serper, Marina",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.25996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33492795/,428
156765,Physical activity participation and the risk of chronic diseases among South Asian adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2019,"The pathophysiology of respiratory failure associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains under investigation. One hypothesis is that progressive endothelial damage from the virus leads to microvascular thrombosis. It is uncertain if empiric therapeutic anticoagulation provides benefit over standard deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit at three hospitals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 associated respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare patients who were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation prior to the time of intubation, and those receiving standard DVT prophylaxis doses. The primary outcome was the difference in the 28-day mortality of patients between the two groups. 28-day mortality was not different between groups, occurring in 26.1% in patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation and 29.5% in those who received a prophylaxis dose only (hazard ratio 0.52, p = 0.055). There was no difference in 28-day mortality between groups in patients who were admitted with a serum D-dimer greater than or equal to 2 mcg/mL (hazard ratio 0.67, p = 0.41). Empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection does not improve 28-day mortality when compared to standard DVT prophylaxis, even among those with elevated D-dimer levels.

This within-individual advantage should cause SD to fix, and yet SD is typically rare in wild populations. Here, we explore whether this paradox can be resolved by sexual selection, by testing if males carrying three different variants of SD suffer reduced pre- or post-copulatory reproductive success. We find that males carrying the SD allele are just as successful at securing matings as control males, but that one SD variant (SD-5) reduces sperm competitive ability and increases the likelihood of female remating. We then used these results to inform a theoretical model; we found that sexual selection could limit SD to natural frequencies when sperm competitive ability and female remating rate equalled the values observed for SD-5. However, sexual selection was unable to explain natural frequencies of the SD allele when the model was parameterized with the values found for two other SD variants, indicating that sexual selection alone is unlikely to explain the rarity of SD.","Keaney, Thomas A; Jones, Therésa M; Holman, Luke",Proceedings.

Nurses are the primary providers of HHC; however, little is known of nursing care delivery and quality. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the association between continuity of nursing care in HHC and rehospitalization among PWD. RESEARCH DESIGN This is a retrospective cohort study using multiple years (2010-2015) of HHC assessment, administrative, and human resources data from a large urban not-for-profit home health agency. SUBJECTS This study included 23,886 PWD receiving HHC following a hospitalization. MEASURES Continuity of nursing care was calculated using the Bice and Boxerman method, which considered the number of total visits, nurses, and visits from each nurse during an HHC episode. The outcome was all-cause rehospitalization during HHC. Risk-adjusted logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS Approximately 24% of PWD were rehospitalized. The mean continuity of nursing care score was 0.56 (SD=0.33). Eight percent of PWD received each nursing visit from a different nurse (no continuity), and 26% received all visits from one nurse during an HHC episode (full continuity). Compared with those receiving high continuity of nursing care (third tertile), PWD receiving low (first tertile) or moderate (second tertile) continuity of nursing care had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.25-1.46) and 1.30 (95% confidence interval: 1.22-1.43), respectively, for being rehospitalized. CONCLUSIONS Wide variations exist in continuity of nursing care to PWD. Consistency in nurse staff when providing HHC visits to PWD is critical for preventing rehospitalizations.","Ma, Chenjuan; McDonald, Margaret V; Feldman, Penny H; Miner, Sarah; Jones, Simon; Squires, Allison",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166269/,428

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Aries BA in comparison to that of the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel (RP). The Aries BA was evaluated using retrospective, remnant nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), previously tested by FilmArray RP. Performance characteristics evaluated included positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the FilmArray RP. Discordant analysis was performed using bidirectional sequencing. A time and motion study was performed to compare the laboratory workflow of the two tests. Three hundred samples were included in the study. There were no samples positive for B. parapertussis The PPA and NPA of the Aries BA were 61.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.8 to 82.7%) and 100% (95% CI, 98.7 to 100%). Discordant results included five Bordetella bronchiseptica results that were incorrectly identified as B. pertussis by the FilmArray RP and one false-negative result for both the Aries BA and the FilmArray RP. The overall agreement between the Aries BA and FilmArray RP for the detection of B. pertussis was considered good at 97.7% with a kappa value of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.9). The Aries BA offers a new diagnostic option for the rapid and targeted approach to the diagnosis of pertussis. Unlike the FilmArray RP, the Aries BA did not cross-react with B. bronchiseptica in our study, although a larger sample set should be tested to confirm this finding.","McMillen, T; Chow, H Y; Das, Shubhagata; Dunbar, Sherry A; Babady, N E",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01966-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30787143/,428

The developing prenatal brain is a highly dynamic tissue, but our understanding of key drivers of epigenetic variability across development is limited. We therefore assessed genomic methylation at over 39 million sites in the prenatal cortex using whole genome bisulfite sequencing and found loci and regions in which methylation levels are dynamic across development. We saw that DNAm at these loci was associated with nearby gene expression and enriched for enhancer chromatin states in prenatal brain tissue. Additionally, these loci were enriched for genes associated with psychiatric disorders and genes involved with neurogenesis. We also found autosomal differences in DNAm between the sexes during prenatal development, though these have less clear functional consequences. We lastly confirmed that the dynamic methylation at this critical period is specifically CpG methylation, with very low levels of CpH methylation. Our findings provide detailed insight into prenatal brain development as well as clues to the pathogenesis of psychiatric traits seen later in life.","Perzel Mandell, Kira A.; Price, Amanda J.; Wilton, Richard; Collado-Torres, Leonardo; Tao, Ran; Eagles, Nicholas J.; Szalay, Alexander S.; Hyde, Thomas M.; Weinberger, Daniel R.; Kleinman, Joel E.; Jaffe, Andrew E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/823781,428

A practical resource allocation strategy is the prerequisite for disease control during a pandemic affected by various external factors, such as the information about the epidemic state, the interregional population mobility, and the geographical factors. Understanding the influence of these factors on resource allocation and epidemic spreading is the premise for designing an optimal resource allocation strategy. To this end, we study the interaction of resource allocation and epidemic spreading in the scope of the metapopulation model by incorporating the factors of geographic proximity, the information of the epidemic state, the willingness of resource allocation, and the population mobility simultaneously. We develop a mathematical framework based on the Markovian chain approach to analyze the dynamical system and obtain the epidemic threshold concerning external factors. Combining extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the disease can be controlled effectively when resources are allocated unbiased in terms of the geographical factor during a pandemic. Specifically, the spreading size is the lowest, and the epidemic threshold is the largest when resources are allocated unbiasedly between neighbor nodes and other nodes. In addition, when studying the effects of resource allocation on the epidemic threshold, we find the same results, i.e., information-aware resource allocation with unbiased in terms of the geographical factor will raise the epidemic threshold. At last, we study the effects of mobility rate on the dynamical property and find an appropriate small value of mobility rate that is propitious to control the disease through numerical analysis and simulations. Our findings will have a direct application in the development of strategies to suppress the spread of the disease and guide the behavior of individuals during a pandemic.

A pilot study was conducted during the Fall 2020 semester at a midwestern liberal arts college involving 49 undergraduate students using a new alternative course delivery format called the “Choice Model.” The Choice Model featured courses taught simultaneously in-person and broadcast in Zoom. A key feature was that each student could choose each day the mode they would attend (in-person or Zoom), and both modes) used in-class quizzes through a learning platform to keep students engaged. The results of the Choice Model included a 7.17-point increase in performance on the final exam from Marketing students, class attendance of 92.2% during a pandemic, and students reported increased engagement during class sessions. While students expressed a strong preference for the Choice Model over alternative course delivery models (in-person only, Zoom-only, a 50-50 model), a limitation found the Choice Model was that some students made suboptimal choices for their own learning outcomes.

The COVID-19 pandemic is having a strong impact on BtoB markets in terms of the stop of production, the difficulty of coping with payments, restrictions on the flows of people and goods within national and international markets. The paper discusses that the effects of worldwide lockdowns, social distancing and other related restrictions undermine one of the salient features of business relationships, namely interaction.Design/methodology/approachThe paper relies on a qualitative interpretivist approach based on the data collected from in-depth interviews with key informants and secondary sources. The fashion industry is taken as an emblematic case, given the relevance of BtoB relationships, especially those between global fashion brands and their suppliers, and the dramatic impact of the pandemic.FindingsThe paper shows four effects in terms of relational dynamics. The freezing effect is the maintaining of interaction at minimum operating levels capable of ensuring survival for both interacting actors. The ripple effect can be conceived as a negative effect of the pandemic related to the weakening of the freezing effects in interactions along the supply chain. The rebound effect is a sudden increase in interactive processes among existing relationships. The vicious effect is a negative effect of the pandemic on the interaction that refers to the decay of existing interaction and their ending.Originality/valueThis study fits into the current period of the COVID-19 pandemic to stress the role of interaction involving people and businesses as a key to restart.

170813,Online consultation in the COVID epoch in India: Experience of 1597 appointments - New order cometh,2021,"Based on succinite superior biological and physical properties, elaborated biotextiles are excellent candidates of next generation multifunctional textiles. Here the thin, soft, and strong textile with superior abilities of electromagnetic interference shielding is prepared by technological composition of micro fibres reinforced with micro/nano particles: metal (Al/Ag), silicium dioxide, resin fillers (succinite or its derivatives). The composite biotextile also exhibits an excellent electrical resistance property, and at the same time can be water and air vapour transmissible easily. It has been proven that due to the high electrical resistance of the biotextile, as well as based on the electronegative surface charge of the biotextile, an additional protective repulsive barrier is provided against nano-sized particles (viruses size 20-150 nm). By testing on the electrical conductivity and electrical resistance of the biotextile, it was proved: the static voltage test shows that biotextile material has a good antistatic property. Biotextile tested in tandem with synthetic materials, residual static voltage is recorded, which can be defined as the presence of a conductive and insulating material in the biotextile sample. Polarization index test results show the highest mobility of the dipoles of the biotextile (polarization index PI 3.03). This characterizes it as a good electrical insulating material, but its low insulation resistance limits its use at high voltages. This provides a new strategy to develop multifunctional textile materials. In the research result, the electrostatic interaction of a textile material and a negatively charged particle was modelled and analysed (particle size of the SARS-CoV-2 = 0.09 μm). The developed new technological method for analysing the protective properties of textile materials can be recommended as an additional test to the existing method for testing protective (filtering) materials with a charged surface. © 2021 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

Such hearings have proliferated during the COVID‐19 pandemic, as courts around the world have rushed to develop remote justice options. Scholars and legal professionals have expressed a range of concerns about this development, not least that there are elements of physical courtroom rituals that cannot be rendered virtually. Drawing on two recent empirical examinations of virtual courts, I explore what these hearings look and feel like for participants. I focus on the relationship between the material and symbolic elements of a court ritual and the meaning and experience of virtual co‐presence. In some circumstances, traditional elements of court have been translated for a virtual space. In other ways, the ritual has been transformed. I conclude by discussing the limitations and potential of courts of the future.

The importance of introduction of banking innovations in the crediting market as the most profitable direction of banking activity has been substantiated, the forecast of change in net interest income of Ukrainian banks for the post-pandemic period has been made. Based on the fact that the indicator of the country's success in implementing the norms and measures of the Digital Agenda for the EU and Digital Single Market is the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), which is determined for each EU country annually, the paper makes forecast changes in its components: Connectivity, Human Capital, Use of Internet, Integration of Digital Technology, Digital Public Services. The main factors that inhibit the processes of strengthening the interaction between banks and FinTech companies in Ukraine have been identified. The expediency of improving the current legislation of Ukraine taking into account the best European practices in the field of cooperation between banks and FinTech companies has been substantiated. © 2020 Estudios de Economia Aplicada.

It uses the free Mozilla DeepSpeech tool. This platform independent video calling software enables the elderly or anyone with hearing impairments to enjoy video calls. A transparent interface was designed that is superimposed on the video call, and has simple options that allow us to change the settings for the size and color of the text. It must also be taken into account that many elderly people have visual problems, so it is important to be able to adapt the text.

172528,Interventional pulmonary medicine,2021,"Since December 2019, an emerging outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has begun from Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world. This systematic review aimed to discuss the involvement of the body's systems during COVID-19 infection comprehensively. PubMed database was used to identify relative studies to be included in this review. Four authors searched PubMed independently using determined search terms. Then, the results were merged and duplicates were removed. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified and at least two review authors assessed the eligibility of the studies. The full texts of included studies were reviewed in detail by the authors and the relevant content was extracted and summarized. The pulmonary tract is the most frequent system involved with a wide range of involvement from no pneumonia to white lung and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Computed tomography is the best imaging modality to diagnose COVID-19 infection. Cardiac and renal system injuries are seen during COVID-19 infection and must be taken seriously. Gastrointestinal manifestations are frequently observed during the infection and are probably associated with more severe disease. The placenta acts as an important physiological and immunological barrier that prevents transplacental vertical transmission. COVID-19 infection is a multiorgan involving infection which needs a team of different expertise to diagnose and manage the disease. Although there are many studies available about COVID-19 infection, most of them are focused on pulmonary involvement and the effects of the virus on many other organs and systems remain unclear that shows the necessity of further investigations about the disease.","Aghdam, M.

To provide a rational basis for designing methods for optimal delivery of vaccines to the respiratory tract in a large animal model, we investigated the distribution of droplets generated by a mucosal atomization device (MAD) and two vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMNs) and the immune responses induced by delivery of influenza virus by MAD in pigs. We showed that droplets containing the drug albuterol, a radiolabel (99mTc-DTPA) or a model influenza virus vaccine (S-FLU) have similar aerosol characteristics. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy showed that VMNs deliver droplets with uniform distribution throughout the lungs as well as the URT. Surprisingly MAD administration (1ml/nostril) also delivered a high proportion of the dose to the lungs, albeit concentrated in a small area. After MAD administration of influenza virus, antigen specific T cells were found at high frequency in nasal turbinates, trachea, broncho-alveolar lavage, lungs, tracheobronchial nodes and blood. We conclude that the pig is useful for investigating optimal targeting of vaccines to the respiratory tract.","Martini, Veronica; Hinchcliffe, Michael; Blackshaw, Elaine; Joyce, Mary; McNee, Adam; Beverley, Peter; Townsend, Alain; MacLoughlin, Ronan; Tchilian, Elma",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.134098,428

The instrument was based on the European Union Digital Competence Framework. Method: 1,118 participants aged between 18 and 47 years completed the assessment. This included 677 females (60.6%) and 429 males (38.4%). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess scale structure. Results: Results of the CFA showed an excellent fit to the data, χ2/df = 3.27, p = .01, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.97, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05. Cronbach's α values for the scale and subscales ranged from .78 to .83. Three of the four subscales predicted number of assignments completed and submitted, a measure of predictive validity. Conclusions: The Digital Competence Scale for Online Migration is a valid scale for Mexican students and demonstrates predictive validity. Implication for Theory and/or Practice: The scale may be useful in planning activities for the reinforcement of digital competencies and to identify difficulties and support specific pedagogy for online teaching/learning processes. © 2021 Laureate Education.

177118,Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for COVID-19 pandemic,2020-08-31,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccines have been rapidly developed and deployed globally as a measure to combat the disease. These vaccines have been demonstrated to confer significant protection, but there have been reports of temporal decay in antibody titer. Furthermore, several variants have been identified with variable degrees of antibody resistance. These two factors suggest that a booster vaccination may be worthy of consideration. While such a booster dose has been studied as a series of three homologous vaccines in healthy individuals, to our knowledge, information on a heterologous regimen remains unreported, despite the practical benefits of such a scheme. Here, in this observational study, we investigated the serological profile of four healthy individuals who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, followed by a third booster dose with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. We found that while all individuals had spike-binding antibodies at each of the timepoints tested, there was an appreciable drop in titer by four months following the second vaccination. The third vaccine dose robustly increased titers beyond that of two vaccinations, and these elicited antibodies had neutralizing capability against all SARS-CoV-2 strains tested in both a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudovirus assay and an authentic SARS-CoV-2 assay, except for one individual against B.1.351 in the latter assay. Thus, a third COVID-19 vaccine dose in healthy individuals promoted not just neutralizing antibody potency, but also induced breadth against dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Iketani, S.; Liu, L.; Nair, M.

177204,Prevalence and Correlates of Parosmia and Phantosmia among Smell Disorders,2021-07-05,"I examine the dynamics of confirmed case (and death) growth rates conditional on different levels of severity in implemented NPIs, the mobility of citizens and other non restrictive policies. To account for the endogeneity of many of these variables, and the possibility of correlated latent (unobservable) country characteristics, I estimate a four structural model of the evolution of case growth rates, death growth rates, average changes in mobility and the determination of the severity of NPIs. There are strongly decreasing returns to the stringency of NPIs, especially for extreme lockdowns, as no significant improvement in the main outcome measures is found beyond NPIs corresponding to a Stringency Index range of 51-60 for cases and 41-50 for deaths. A non-restrictive policy of extensive and open testing has half of the impact on pandemic dynamics as the optimal NPIs, with none of the associated social and economic costs resulting from the latter. Decreases in mobility were found to increase, rather than decrease case growth rates, consistent with arguments that within-household transmission, resulting from spending more time at residences due to mobility restrictions, may outweigh the benefits of reduced community transmission. Vaccinations led to a fall in case and death growth rates, however the effect size must be re-evaluated when more data becomes available. Governments conditioned policy choice on recent pandemic dynamics, and were found to de-escalate the associated stringency of implemented NPIs more cautiously than in their escalation, i.e., policy mixes exhibited significant hysteresis. Finally, at least 90% of the maximum effectiveness of NPIs can be achieved by policies with an average Stringency index of 31-40, without restricting internal movement or imposing stay at home measures, and only recommending (not enforcing) closures on workplaces and schools, accompanied by public informational campaigns. Consequently, the positive effects on case and death growth rates of voluntary behavioral changes in response to beliefs about the severity of the pandemic, generally trumped those arising from mandatory behavioral restrictions. The exception being more stringent mandatory restrictions on gatherings and international movement, which were found to be effective. The findings suggest that further work should be directed at re-evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs, particularly towards empirically determining the optimal policy mix and associated stringency of individual NPIs.","Spiliopoulos, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.06.21260077v1?rss=1,428

During the lockdown caused by this disease, many financial losses have been inflicted on people and all industries. One of the fastest ways to save these industries from the COVID-19 is to provide a reliable solution for people's health assessment. In this article, blockchain technology is used to propose a model which provides and validates the health certificates for people who travel or present in society. For this purpose, we take advantage of blockchain features in protecting people's privacy. Since a variety of antibody and human health proving tests against the virus are developing, this study tries simultaneously to design an integrated and secure system to meet the authenticity and accuracy of different people's health certificates for the companies requiring these certifications. In this system, on the one hand, there are qualified laboratories that are responsible for performing standard testing and also providing results to the system controller. Finally, people are considered as the end-user of the system. To provide test information for the entities, the mechanism of KYC tokens will be used based on the Stellar private blockchain network. In this mechanism, the user will buy a certain amount of KYC tokens from the system controller. These tokens are charged in the user's wallet, and the user can send these tokens from his wallet to any destination company, to exchange the encrypted health certificate information. Finally, considering the appropriate platform provided by blockchain technology and the requirement of a reliable and accurate solution for issuing health certificates during the Covid-19 pandemic or any other disease, this article offers a solution to meet the requirements.","Shamsi, Kiarash; Khorasani, Koosha Esmaielzadeh; Shayegan, Mohammad Javad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02169v1.pdf,428

Using a methodology based on modified age-stratified transmission dynamics model, we estimated the attack ratio of COVID-19 among children (individuals 0-11 years) in Ontario, Canada when a large proportion of individuals eligible for vaccination (age 12 and above) are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity among this subpopulation, or the effective herd immunity with additional physical distancing measures (hence effective herd immunity). We describe the relationship between this attack ratio among children, the time to remove infected individuals from the transmission chain and the children-to-children daily contact rate, while considering the increased transmissibility of virus variants (using the Delta variant as an example). We further illustrate the generality and applicability of the methodology established by performing an analysis of the attack ratio of COVID-19 among children in the Canadian population. The clinical attack ratio, the number of symptomatic infections over the total population can be informed from the attack ratio, and both can be reduced substantially via a combination of higher vaccine coverage in the vaccine eligible population, reduced social mixing among children, and rapid testing and isolation.","Wu, J.; Bragazzi, N.

The utility of scRNAseq in respiratory science has been widely embraced over the past few years with key discoveries including the identification of rare cell types, new cell states associated with lung diseases, and a system wide expression of key severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) receptors.

179339,The CT Scan Lung Severity Score and Vaccination Status in COVID-19 patients during the Second Wave in India: Perspective of an Independent Radiology Practice,2021-07-19,"Compared to traditional lectures many people in technical fields learn and retain information more effectively while exploring new content hands-on, working with physical components connecting them together, observing their operation, and taking physical measurements. Hands-on learning is especially important when students have limited experience working with the types of systems and equipment about which they are learning. Fluid power system technology is a topic with many components and intricacies with which students have limited experience. This subject has commonly been taught with a hands-on laboratory component to assist the students in meeting the learning outcomes of the course. However, when courses transitioned to an online format, the hands-on component of the learning experience was removed creating a gap in the students' learning. Though it may not be possible to completely remedy this gap, there are methods to provide a simulated hands-on experience for the students. During the transition to online instruction under COVID-19 conditions in Spring 2020, the authors explored multiple online delivery methods for fluid power systems education aimed to fill the gap left from the removal of hands-on learning. To simulate hands on learning, first person videos of the laboratory experience, fluid power simulations, and supplemental explanation videos were created and delivered to the online students. The combination of these efforts resulted in students expressing that the online labs were one of the most helpful components to them learning about fluid power under the circumstances of transitioning to online instruction. Further, students' self-evaluations of their ability to achieve the learning outcomes of the course indicated that the learning gap was minimized. Though students found the simulated hands-on laboratory videos useful, the students indicated a preference for in-person laboratory assignments. © ASABE 2021 Annual International Meeting","Ryan, S.

179557,Placental vascular remodeling in pregnant women with COVID-19,2021-07-03,"What makes our lungs look red? This seems to be a naÏve and trivial question. Indeed, all the textbooks tell us that what makes our body red is the presence of blood, or more precisely the red blood cells (RBC). Here we provide some experimental evidence as well arguments to prove that this belief is wrong, or only partially true. In fact, we identified an important population of red cells located outside of the blood vessels as highly compacted clusters, in the connection tissues of the lungs of several species of animals including rat and human being. These red cells possessed each a nucleus, expressing several biomarkers of different cell types such as PF4, vWF, SCF-1R, CD200R, TGF-b, etc… Interestingly, being morphologically heterogeneous, they react collectively to certain stimuli. For example, they aggregated on collagen fibers forming clusters of cells resembling that observed in vivo. The red cells may have some features of Hematopoietic Stem Cells, since they were capable of differentiating into other cell types such as alveolar macrophages. In nasal polyps, these cells formed vessel-like structures, confined within a CD31-positive tubes. Upon exposure to toxic chemicals, they formed dense networks, suggesting a possible role in coagulation. Furthermore, the number of these red cells was greatly increased in the lungs of diseased donors, especially in the lungs of CF patients. Instead of being secreted as what happens in normal red cells, vWF proteins were tethered on the cytoplasmic membrane of the red cells isolated from the lungs of CF donors, which may explain at least partially the fibrotic nature of the CF lungs. Taken together, we conclude that what makes the lungs look red is not the red blood cells, rather a distinct population of red cells, we call them Red Soma Cells (RSC). We believe that the discovery and characterization of this important population of cells will have profound theoretic as well as therapeutic implications.","Huang, Song; Lopez, Cindia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.13.435224,428

The research domains explored included the use of peptide microarrays in the mapping of linear B-cell and T cell epitopes, antimicrobial peptide discovery, immunosignature characterisation and disease immunodiagnostics. This review also provides a short overview of peptide microarray synthesis. Methods Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. The review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and data charting was performed using a predefined form. The results were reported by narrative synthesis in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Results Eighty-six articles from 100 studies were included in the final data charting process. The majority (93%) of the articles were published during 2010–2020 and were mostly from Europe (44%) and North America (34 %). The findings were from the investigation of viral (44%), bacterial (30%), parasitic (25%) and fungal (2%) infections. Out of the serological studies, IgG was the most reported antibody type followed by IgM. The largest portion of the studies (78%) were related to mapping B-cell linear epitopes, 10% were on diagnostics, 9% reported on immunosignature characterisation and 6% reported on viral and bacterial cell binding assays. Two studies reported on T-cell epitope profiling. Conclusion The most important application of peptide microarrays was found to be B-cell epitope mapping or antibody profiling to identify diagnostic and vaccine targets. Immunosignatures identified by random peptide microarrays were found to be applied in the diagnosis of infections and interrogation of vaccine responses. The analysis of the interactions of random peptide microarrays with bacterial and viral cells using binding assays enabled the identification of antimicrobial peptides. Peptide microarray arrays were also used for T-cell linear epitope mapping which may provide more information for the design of peptide-based vaccines and for the development of diagnostic reagents.","Vengesai, Arthur; Kasambala, Maritha; Mutandadzi, Hamlet; Mduluza-Jokonya, Tariro L.; Mduluza, Takafira; Naicker, Thajasvarie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.04.433859,428

Data on the B2B relationship were collected from 77 partaking firms in the Spanish Furniture Market Observatory business panel, covering the manufacturer-retailer and manufacturer-supplier relationships for control and comparison purposes.FindingsUsing PLS-SEM, results reflect that social and economic satisfaction act differently in the B2B relationship. The effect of relationship quality on economic satisfaction is greater when value co-creation is introduced as a mediating variable, although this mediation is partial. Moreover, the mediating effect is greater in the manufacturer-supplier relationship than in the manufacturer-retailer one.Originality/valueThe paper reduces the conceptual gap between value exchanges in B2C and B2B contexts. It also introduces a less-common triadic approach along the supply chain for B2B industrial relationships. Evidence is provided on the importance of social satisfaction as an affective dimension of relationship quality and on the mediating role of value co-creation between relationship quality and economic satisfaction.","Sales-Vivó, Vicente Gil-Saura Irene Gallarza Martina G.",International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijrdm-10-2020-0394,428

A recent study used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to quantify the composition of the gut microbiome and identify predictive biomarkers of infection with limited taxonomic resolution. Methods To achieve increased resolution of gut microbial factors associated with V. cholerae susceptibility and identify predictors of symptomatic disease, we applied deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing to a cohort of household contacts of patients with cholera. Results Using machine learning, we resolved species, strains, gene families, and cellular pathways in the microbiome at the time of exposure to V. cholerae to identify markers that predict infection and symptoms. Use of metagenomic features improved the precision and accuracy of prediction relative to 16S sequencing. We also predicted disease severity, although with greater uncertainty than our infection prediction. Species within the genera Prevotella and Bifidobacterium predicted protection from infection, and genes involved in iron metabolism also correlated with protection. Conclusion Our results highlight the power of metagenomics to predict disease outcomes and suggest specific species and genes for experimental testing to investigate mechanisms of microbiome-related protection from cholera.

182702,"Spousal bereavement, mortality and risk of negative health outcomes among older adults: a population-based study",2020-04-19,"Many factors determine whether an individual responding to vaccination will generate an immune response that can lead to protection. Several studies have shown that the prevaccination immune state associate with the antibody response to vaccines. However, the generalizability and mechanisms that underlie this association remain poorly defined. Here, we sought to identify a common pre-vaccination signature and mechanisms that could predict the immune response across a wide variety of vaccines. We leveraged the “Immune Signatures Data Resource” created by the NIH Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) to integrate data from 28 studies involving 13 different vaccines and associate the blood transcriptional status of 820 healthy young adults with their responses. An unsupervised analysis of blood transcriptional profiles across studies revealed three distinct pre-vaccination states, characterized by the differential expression of genes associated with a pro-inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and metabolism alterations downstream of NFκB and IRF7. Innate and adaptive immune cell subsetspecific genes were also associated with the three pre-vaccination states. Importantly, individuals whose pre-vaccination state was enriched in pro-inflammatory response genes known to be downstream of NFκB tended to have higher serum antibody responses one month after vaccination. A supervised analysis of the same data resulted in a single classifier, also enriched for NFκB regulated genes, that predicted the antibody response across most of the vaccines. Projection into single-cell RNA-sequencing data suggested that this pre-vaccination state was attributable to the signature of activation of non-classical monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. Transcriptional signatures of recent exposure to bacterial and not viral infections were enriched in the high pro-inflammatory pre-vaccination state and also included NFκB regulated genes. The pro-inflammatory prevaccination state was highly reminiscent of the innate activation state triggered by TLR ligands or adjuvants. These results demonstrate that wide variations in the transcriptional state of the immune system in humans can be a key determinant of responsiveness to vaccination. They also define a transcriptional signature NFκB activation at baseline, that is associated with a greater magnitude of antibody response to 13 different vaccines, and suggest that modulation of the innate immune system by next-generation adjuvants targeting NFκB before vaccine administration may improve vaccine responsiveness.","Fourati, S.; Tomalin, LE.; Mulè, MP.; Chawla, DG.; Gerritsen, B.; Rychkov, D.; Henrich, E.; Miller, HER.; Hagan, T.; Diray-Arce, J.; Dunn, P.; Levy, O.; Gottardo, R.; Sarwal, M.; Tsang, J.; Suárez-Fariñas, M.; Pulendran, B.; Sékaly, RP.; Kleinstein, SH.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.461847,428
183269,CASTING LIGHT ON THE CHALLENGES OF ILLUMINATING ENT EXAMINATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,2021-07-08,"Purpose/Aims The purpose of this study was to determine whether resiliency activities, compiled into a practice playbook designed for implementation by nurse leaders and self-initiation by clinical nurses, improves resilience in both the nurse leaders and direct care nurses who implement them. Background Evidence indicates strengthening nurse resilience increases well-being, protects against burnout, improves retention and increases patient safety. Methods A resilience playbook was assembled to include stress-reduction activities. Resilience was measured at baseline and after two phases during which participants engaged in leader-led and self-initiated activities. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to measure resilience. Results A total of 118 nurses completed both phases;17 leaders and 101 clinical nurses. A significant increase in mean CD-RISC scores was detected among those who participated in self-initiated activities (p=0.01). Initiating or participating in leader-led activities did not positively impact resilience scores. Further, clinical nurses who participated in leader-led activities were not more likely to participate in self-initiated activities. Conclusions This study supports self-initiated resilience-strengthening activities as beneficial to nurses, but not leader-led initiatives. These results are especially important for nursing leaders as they strive to reduce burnout, improve nurse retention and achieve exceptional practice quality.","Koprowski, Kristen Meyer Diana Stanfill Teresa Tivis Laura J.",Applied Nursing Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2021.151484,428

Some of these cases were among healthcare workers. These reports have raised serious concerns about the natural immunity gained against COVID-19. We report here two possible cases of reinfection in healthcare workers for the first time in Turkey. The first case was a 21-year-old male nurse working in a COVID-19 intensive care unit. RT-PCR test was reported positive on August 10 after complaints of weakness, severe muscle pain, and sore throat. The patient, who received treatment and was followed up according to the protocol, returned to work when two consecutive RT-PCR tests were negative on August 25-26. After 76 days, the patient who presented with complaints of weakness, severe muscle pain, sore throat, and diarrhea had again a positive RT-PCR. The second case was a 28-year-old female doctor working in a COVID-19 clinic. Her RT-PCR test was performed on 25 August after complaints of fatigue, severe muscle pain, headache, cough, anosmia, and dysgeusia accompanied by sub febrile fever were reported positive. She returned to work after two RT-PCR tests on September 10 and 15 were reported negative. Seventy-one days later, the RT-PCR test taken after complaints of fatigue, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, sub febrile fever, and occasional dry cough was evaluated as positive.

Cue-exposure therapy builds on eliciting feelings of craving in patients in safe and controlled environments to condition them to control these feelings. Different efficient and resource-friendly methods of eliciting craving exist, (such as written material, still pictures, etc.). However, these methods create knowledge and skill transfer gaps between therapy sessions and real life scenarios. Virtual reality allows more true-to-life experiences, and research demonstrates its capabilities in eliciting craving in patients. Studies have identified different environments that elicits craving, suggesting bars to be one of the most effective ones. Research also suggests the presence of others to be an effective method of eliciting craving in users. However, the effect of social interaction has not yet been explored. Therefore, this paper presents a virtual bar with the purpose to investigate whether social interaction affects alcohol craving in users. The VR intervention is designed with close cooperation with a psychiatrist experienced in working with individuals suffering from alcohol use disorder. In this paper, we present the designed and developed VR intervention and discuss how an experiment can be conducted after the COVID-19 shutdowns.","Junker, A.; Hutters, C.; Reipur, D.; Embol, L.; Adjorlu, A.; Nordahl, R.; Serafin, S.; Petersen, D.

Drawing together the evidence on what we know works for adolescent girls, as well as the growing literature on positive strengths-based programming which are gradually and increasingly being applied, this commentary calls for a girl-intentional approach to policy and programming. A girl-intentional approach is described through 3 case studies, which illustrate the additionality of new or improved adolescent knowledge, skills, and competencies;improved opportunities for adolescent engagement, voice, and agency;improved community safety and support;stronger, healthier relationships;and stronger and healthier norms, attitudes, values, and goals. The case studies describe program hooks that facilitate operationalization, point to measurable outcomes, and identify opportunities for scale, including the re-opening of schools. Overall, inter-sectoral solutions that address the myriad of issues affecting an adolescent girl's life and tackle pervasive gender inequities require greater emphasis by development actors and national governments.","Banati, P.; Rumble, L.; Jones, N.; Hendriks, S.",Journal of Youth Development,https://doi.org/10.5195/jyd.2021.1071,428

The paper draws on a qualitative study of the subjective experiences of eight school leaders and uses a sensemaking theoretical approach applied to crisis leadership to contribute to understanding leadership in unprecedented situations. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews undertaken in the middle of 2020. At that time participants were working through significant changes resulting from community lockdowns that required their schools to move to remote provision of education. The findings revealed these school leaders engaged in rapid processes of sensemaking and change implementation. They assessed and managed risks, relationships and resourcing in environments where usual processes of change leadership were not available to them. They reported that their attention was predominantly directed to the well-being of their communities. They noted an increase in the community leadership aspect of their role and the requirement of effective, timely and honest communication. They also demonstrated prospective sensemaking orientations in their capacity to reconfigure for a positive and productive future that could emerge from these disruptive experiences.","Longmuir, Fiona",Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership,https://doi.org/10.1177/17411432211027634,428
186766,Comprehensive Evidence-Based Guidelines for Facet Joint Interventions in the Management of Chronic Spinal Pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) Guidelines Facet Joint Interventions 2020 Guidelines.,2020-05-01,"During the co-evolution of viruses and their hosts, the latter have equipped themselves with an elaborate immune system to defend themselves from the invading viruses. In order to establish a successful infection, replicate and persist in the host, viruses have evolved numerous strategies to counter and evade host antiviral immune responses as well as exploit them for productive viral replication. These strategies include those that modulate signaling mediated by cell surface receptors. Despite tremendous advancement in recent years, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these critical points in viral pathogenesis remain unknown. In this work, based on a novel platform of receptor signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoOLigomerization (SCHOOL) platform, I suggest specific mechanisms used by different viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human herpesvirus 6 and others, to modulate receptor signaling. I also use the example of HIV and CMV to illustrate how two unrelated enveloped viruses use a similar SCHOOL mechanism to modulate the host immune response mediated by two functionally different receptors: T cell antigen receptor and natural killer cell receptor, NKp30. This suggests that it is very likely that similar general mechanisms can be or are used by other viral and possibly non-viral pathogens. Learning from viruses how to target cell surface receptors not only helps us understand viral strategies to escape from the host immune surveillance, but also provides novel avenues in rational drug design and the development of new therapies for immune disorders.","Sigalov, Alexander B",Self/nonself,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21487503/,428
186984,"Incidence and sequelae of acute pelvic inflammatory disease among active component females, U.S. Armed Forces, 1996-2016.",2018,"Chronic diarrhea is a common problem in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), resulting in significant morbidity and potential mortality. In the early stages of immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are susceptible to infection with the same enteric pathogens that cause diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts, but with progressive immunodeficiency, these patients become susceptible to numerous opportunistic disorders. The main factor to consider when tailoring the work-up of diarrhea in the HIV-infected patient is the immune status, which is reflected by the total CD4 lymphocyte cell count. A CD4 count of less than 100 cells/microL is significantly correlated with opportunistic disorders. For the HIV-infected patient with diarrhea, repeated stool studies to investigate for bacteria, ova and parasites should be the first step. When either upper or lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms are present and stool studies are negative, endoscopy directed to the probable organ of involvement is appropriate. If localizing symptoms are absent, the most appropriate next test is sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. Not infrequently, despite extensive evaluation, the cause of diarrhea in patients with AIDS remains unexplained. Recently, the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors, has led to a change in the epidemiology of diarrhea in AIDS patients. As their immune status improves, HIV-infected patients treated with combination therapy become less prone to opportunistic disorders. However, diarrhea appears to be frequent because several antiretroviral agents can themselves cause diarrhea.","Mönkemüller, K E; Wilcox, C M",Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11125184/,428
188101,Characteristics and outcomes of paediatric patients admitted to a Danish level-1 trauma centre.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND The Typus Melancholicus (TM) is the premorbid personality of endogenous depression defined by Tellenbach and Kraus and characterized by orderliness, conscientiousness, norm orientation and intolerance of ambiguity. Tellenbach's hypothesis was to find around 50% of TM in the sample of patients with an Unipolar Depression (UD). The present paper aims to make a literature review on the relationship between the Typus Melancholicus (TM) and Unipolar Depression (UD). METHODS Nineteen references were selected through searches on PubMed, Google Scholar and Sciences-Direct with the following MeSH terms in the title: Typus Melancholicus AND Depressive or Depression or Dépression or Depressione. Nine of them were selected for our review. RESULTS Eight of the nine reviewed articles confirm Tellenbach's hypothesis. The literature review also shows that, in a population of UD, TM is always constant regardless of age or sex, has no relationship to clinical characteristics and could contribute to the chronicity of depression. The TM with depression have increased levels of ""lack of vital drive"" and ""feelings of guilt"" and low scores in irritability and dysphoria compared to Non-Typus Melancholicus (NTM). Due to its characteristics, TM could also be involved in some pathologies such as burnout or postpartum depression. TM does not seem to be linked to a particular Personality Disorder or maladaptive personality, but the two may coexist in certain circumstances. It has been suggested that specific psychotherapeutic methods can be used to treat TM with UD. CONCLUSIONS The TM could be very useful in our clinical practice. Better practical knowledge of TM could lead to more efficient psychiatric care as well as heightened capacity to predict new episodes.","Oudart, Emilie; Hanak, Catherine; Ammendola, Sarah",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890388/,428

Small retrospective/prospective series have suggested robotics offers further reduction in postoperative pain and pain medication use compared to standard LSC. Our objective was to compare postoperative pain in patients undergoing robotically assisted (RBT) versus standard LSC for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. METHODS All preoperative endometrial cancer cases scheduled for RBT and LSC from May 1, 2007 to June 9, 2010 were identified. For this analysis, we only included cases not requiring conversion to laparotomy. All patients were offered intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperatively. Intraoperative equivalent fentanyl doses (IEFDs) and pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were assessed. RESULTS IV PCA was used in 206 RBTs (86 %) and 208 LSCs (88 %). Median IEFD was 425 μg for LSCs and 500 μg for RBTs (P = 0.03). Median pain scores on PACU arrival were similar in both groups. Median highest pain score was 5 for LSCs and 4 for RBTs (P = 0.007). Linear regression demonstrated that the IEFD was not correlated with the highest pain score (R = 0.09; P = 0.07). Fentanyl was used postoperatively in 196 of 206 RBTs (95 %) and 187 of 208 LSCs (90 %). The total fentanyl doses were 242.5 (range 0-2705) μg and 380 (range 0-2625) μg, respectively (P < 0.001). The median hourly fentanyl doses were 16.7 (range 0-122.5) μg and 23.5 (range 0-132.4) μg, respectively (P = 0.005). Simultaneous multiple regression analysis further demonstrated RBT was independently associated with a lower total fentanyl dose compared to LSC (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS RBT is independently associated with significantly lower postoperative pain and pain medication requirements compared to LSC. The amount of intraoperative fentanyl analgesia does not appear to correlate with postoperative pain.Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with an estimated 47,130 new cases in 2012.1 An estimated 287,100 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer worldwide in 2008.2 Surgery is the primary treatment of choice for the majority of these women.3 The standard surgical approach has been total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging via laparotomy. Multiple retrospective series have shown that a less invasive surgical approach via laparoscopy (LSC) is feasible and safe, and also associated with improved perioperative outcomes compared to laparotomy in these patients.4 The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) published results of the largest randomized trial (LAP2) comparing LSC to laparotomy in patients with newly diagnosed endometrial carcinoma in 2009.5,6 This landmark study essentially changed the accepted standard surgical approach in this group. Postoperative complications, median blood loss, and median length of stay (LOS), despite increased operative time, were significantly lower in LSC patients despite 25 % requiring conversion to laparotomy.5 The first 802 eligible patients randomized in LAP2 also participated in a quality-of-life (QOL) study. Within 6 weeks of surgery, patients assigned to LSC reported significantly better QOL on all scales other than fear of recurrence.6 Overall, during this 6-week postoperative period, patients assigned to LSC had superior QOL, fewer physical symptoms, less pain and pain-related interference with functioning, better physical functioning and emotional state, earlier resumption of normal activities, earlier return to work, and better body image compared to those assigned to laparotomy.6 Recurrence-free and overall survivals were the same in both groups.7 Multiple published retrospective series have shown possible benefits, such as reduced postoperative pain, using the robotic (RBT) platform compared to LSC or laparotomy in patients with endometrial cancer.8-11 In a randomized trial, LSC was found to be associated with less postoperative pain compared to vaginal approaches in patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease.12 A small retrospective series reported further reductions in postoperative pain in patients who had undergone an RBT hysterectomy compared to a standard total LSC hysterectomy for benign indications.13 A recent cost analysis suggested that patients experienced less pain and required less pain medication use after RBT procedures compared to LSC for endometrial cancer.14 Based on these reports, we sought to analyze postoperative pain and the use of pain medication in patients undergoing RBT compared to standard transperitoneal LSC procedures for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer during a concurrent time period. Of note, current RBT surgery is not truly robotic in that it is not autonomous. A more appropriate term is “computer-assisted surgery,” but to satisfy current convention, we refer to it as “robotic surgery” in this manuscript.","Leitao, Mario M; Malhotra, Vivek; Briscoe, Gabriel; Suidan, Rudy; Dholakiya, Priyal; Santos, Kevin; Jewell, Elizabeth L; Brown, Carol L; Sonoda, Yukio; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Barakat, Richard R; Gardner, Ginger J",Annals of surgical oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23797751/,428

The stool samples of 426 children (213 diarrhoeal and 213 non-diarrhoeal controls) were investigated by electron microscopy and ELISA for the presence of viruses. Six morphologically distinct viruses were visualized: rotavirus, coronavirus-like particles (CVLP), adenovirus, astrovirus, calicivirus and small round virus-like particles (SRV). Rotavirus was detected in 28.6% of the diarrhoeal patients and in 1.4% of the controls. The frequency of infection with rotavirus was highest in the children aged less than 5 years. The mean age of rotavirus-positive patients was 11 months. Although rotavirus was detected in almost every month, there has a seasonal trend for colder months when CVLP cases were fewest. However, the prevalence of CVLP was greater in the control group (23.0%) rather than in those with diarrhoea (8.9%). In the control group, CVLP were detected more frequently during the summer months. An inverse relationship between CVLP and rotavirus was observed in children.

After humoral and cellular immune response detection, different levels of SARS-CoV N protein specific antibodies and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion are shown compared to controls. The humoral immune response was induced more effectively by the DNA priming and recombinant adenovirus boosting regimen. There is a significant difference between heterogeneous and homologous vaccinations. The heterogeneous combinations were all higher than those of the homologous combinations in the induction of anti-N antibody response. Among the three heterogeneous combinations, pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N induced the strongest antibody response. In the induction of IFN-gamma production, the homologous combination of rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N was significantly stronger than that of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N, but was relatively weaker than the heterogeneous combination of pcDAN3.1-N/pcDAN3.1-N/pcDAN3.1-N/rAd-N. This combination was a most efficient immunization regimen in induction of SARS-CoV-N-specific (IFN-gamma) secretion just as the antibody response.

At different times after reconstitution, enriched CD4 and CD45 positive porcine cells were isolated from various mouse organs and tested for the presence of porcine NIPC by porcine IFN-alpha specific ELISPOT assay, after in vitro stimulation by UV inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Although engraftment of porcine cells in SCID mice was shown by flow cytometry and by the production of pig immunoglobulins, no IFN-alpha secreting cells could be detected. This result suggests that NIPC do not derive from bone marrow precursor cells, or that growth factors needed for in vivo expansion of porcine NIPC were absent in mice.","Splíchal, I; Sinkora, J; Reháková, Z; Sinkora, M; Charley, B",Veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9851013/,428
193357,Soft-tissue Defects After Total Knee Arthroplasty: Management and Reconstruction.,2016,"From Babesia caballi in vitro cultures a preparation of 100% infected erythrocytes was obtained. From this, B. caballi antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Böse, R; Peymann, B",International journal for parasitology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8070952/,428

The recombinant virus replicated in cultures of the swine testicle ST cell line and directed the synthesis of S antigen with a maximum yield of approximately 26 micrograms per 10(6) cells. The antigen was cell-associated except in the late phase of the infection, when a small amount (3.5 micrograms per 10(6) cells) was released. The cell-associated antigen consisted of polypeptides of molecular mass 160 kDa and 175 kDa, comigrating with the authentic precursor S' and the mature S protein of PRCV, respectively. The extracellular recombinant antigen corresponded to the 175 kDa mature protein. Some recombinant S protein was exposed on the cell surface and was recognized by neutralization-mediating anti-S monoclonal antibodies. Piglets, inoculated oronasally with the recombinant adenovirus vector developed PRCV-neutralizing serum antibodies and were partially protected against PRCV challenge, demonstrating the potential of live adenovirus as vaccine vector.","Callebaut, P; Enjuanes, L; Pensaert, M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8627235/,428

Assays for human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV); human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1, -2, and -3, respectively); and influenza A and B viruses were incorporated into a single standard assay format. The optimized assay panel was used to test 470 respiratory specimens obtained from 462 children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness that had been previously tested by viral culture (405 specimens) or direct immunofluorescence staining (DIF) (65 specimens). Of 93 specimens positive for respiratory viruses by culture or DIF, 86 (92%) were positive by RT-PCR, including 66 HRSV, 2 HPIV2, 5 HPIV3, 3 influenza A virus, and 10 influenza B virus specimens. An additional 119 respiratory viruses were identified by RT-PCR in 116 patients for whom results were negative by viral isolation or DIF. We conclude that the GeneScan RT-PCR panel can markedly improve detection of acute respiratory virus infections in young children.","Erdman, Dean D; Weinberg, Geoffrey A; Edwards, Kathryn M; Walker, Frances J; Anderson, Barbara C; Winter, Jörn; González, Monica; Anderson, Larry J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12958260/,428

196776,Imported Infections in Rural Mid-West United States - A Report from a Tertiary Care Center.,2020,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway is one of the major oncogenic pathways and is activated in many types of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. It can also be activated by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein. In the present study, we set out to determine the regulatory effects of this pathway on the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Our results demonstrate that the expression of a constitutively active Akt1 profoundly inhibited HBV RNA transcription and consequently reduced HBV DNA replication in HepG2 cells. This suppression of HBV gene transcription was apparently mediated by the activation of mTOR, as it was abolished by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Moreover, treatment of HBV-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells with inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR increased the transcription of 3.5-kb and 2.4-kb viral RNA as well as the replication of HBV DNA. This observation implies that the basal level activation of this pathway in HepG2 cells regulated HBV replication. Consistent with previous reports showing that the HCV NS5A protein could bind to the p85 subunit of PI3K and activate the PI3K-Akt signal transduction pathway, our results showed that expression of this protein could inhibit HBV RNA transcription and reduce HBV DNA replication in HepG2 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway during liver oncogenesis may be at least partially responsible for the elimination of HBV replication from tumor cells and may also provide an explanation for the observed suppression of HBV replication by HCV coinfection.","Guo, Haitao; Zhou, Tianlun; Jiang, Dong; Cuconati, Andrea; Xiao, Guang-Hui; Block, Timothy M; Guo, Ju-Tao",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17609269/,428

Objective To estimate the prevalence of and examine the factors associated with prehypertension in Dhulikhel. Method This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 752 participants of the Dhulikhel Heart Study (DHS). The data collectors interviewed the participants at their home using a tablet based structured pre-tested questionnaire and measured blood pressure using a standard digital blood pressure machine (Microlife, Switzerland). Multivariate analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations with multivariate logistic regression (with household as cluster) adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, income, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and food consumption. Result Males had a three-fold higher odds of prehypertension than females (OR:3.17, 95% CI:1.91-5.26). The odds of prehypertension increased with being overweight (OR:2.29, 95% CI:1.42-3.70) and with being obese (OR:5.00, 95% CI:1.81-13.79) compared to normal BMI. Education reduced the odds of developing prehypertension (OR:0.51, 95% CI:0.29-0.91). Those who met the recommended level of physical activity (OR:0.61, 95% CI:0.40-0.95) also were associated with lower prehypertension prevalence. Conclusion Obese/overweight and being male increased the odds of prehypertension whereas formal education and recommended level of physical activities were associated with lower prehypertension prevalence. Primordial prevention against cardiovascular risk factors at the community level, especially targeting the young adult male, is imperative.","Tamrakhar, D; Karmacharya, B M; Shrestha, R; Koju, R; Fitzpatrick, A L; Shrestha, A",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305754/,428

Independently, medical consumers seek, collect, and use health information for decision making. However, when constructing a CHI-based medical platform, high technology must be applied in a fully understandable and usable format for both health care providers and consumers. This study examines the present status of CHI and its effect on medical consumers. For the development of CHI, we discuss the need for tailored health communications and capacity building with chronic patients at the medical center. First, empowerment is a key characteristic needed for medical consumer health care management. However, promoting patient self-care management of illnesses and health is necessary to create conjugation where cooperation with medical service providers is possible. Also, establishing a health care delivery system that will support cooperation is necessary. Second, tailored health communications can uniquely construct the health information of patients, which prevents unnecessary or excessive information from leading patients to confused and inappropriate decisions. Ultimately, through the present environment of health communication, the innovation of a consumer health care information system has become the tide of the times and the positive effect of improved health can be expected.","Jung, Minsoo",The health care manager,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669427/,428

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: We examined 76 patients with purulent-necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome, who used a plaster splint and a device for offloading the foot. We evaluated the clinical indicators of the healing process, laboratory data and pain intensity. RESULTS Results: Comparing the results of using the device for offloading the foot and the plaster splint showed that the developed by us device had a positive effect on the dynamics of the healing process: the edema disappeared on average 1.5 days earlier; the redness vanished on average 2.5 days earlier. We observed granulation and epithelialization significantly earlier (p <0.05) than in the group where the plaster splint was used. The number of recorded surgical interventions was statistically significant and less (p <0.05) in the group where our device was used. Low pain rates were in patients using a device for offloading the foot due to minimal contact of the wound surface with the floor. CONCLUSION Conclusions: According to the results of comparative using the device for offloading the foot and plaster splint, we found out that using the device for offloading the foot allows creating statistically significant better conditions to accelerate wound healing in patients and reduce the duration of inpatient treatment.","Shevchenko, Rostyslav S; Shevchenko, Stanislav I; Pryimenko, Dmytro S; Tsyganenko, Oksana S; Feskov, Vladimir M",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537738/,428

To better understand the pathogenesis of poxvirus infection and its interaction with respiratory epithelia, we used vaccinia virus and examined its interaction with primary cultures of well-differentiated human airway epithelia. We found that vaccinia virus preferentially infected the epithelia through the basolateral membrane and released viral progeny across the apical membrane. Despite infection and virus production, epithelia retained tight junctions, transepithelial electrical conductance, and a steep transepithelial concentration gradient of virus, indicating integrity of the epithelial barrier. In fact, during the first four days of infection, epithelial height and cell number increased. These morphological changes and maintenance of epithelial integrity required vaccinia virus growth factor, which was released basolaterally, where it activated epidermal growth factor 1 receptors. These data suggest a complex interaction between the virus and differentiated airway epithelia; the virus preferentially enters the cells basolaterally, exits apically, and maintains epithelial integrity by stimulating growth factor receptors.","Vermeer, Paola D; McHugh, Julia; Rokhlina, Tatiana; Vermeer, Daniel W; Zabner, Joseph; Welsh, Michael J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17581984/,428

Chicken embryos were inoculated in ovo (chorioallantoic sac) with the Arkansas (Ark) serotype of IBV at 18 days of age. At 24, 48, 72, and 120 hr postinfection (HPI), bursa, lung, spleen, heart, and thymus were collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and paraffin embedded. The digoxigenin-labeled antisense S1 riboprobe detected viral mRNA in the cytoplasm of respiratory epithelial cells in the primary bronchus at 24, 48, and 72 HPI. Viral mRNA was detected in bursa samples collected at 48 hr. Immunohistochemistry detected viral antigens in epithelial cells of the parabronchi and bursal tissues at 24 and 48 hr, respectively. No viral mRNA or antigen was detected by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, respectively, in heart, thymus, or spleen at any time after inoculation. On the basis of these data, IBV apparently initially infects lung tissue, then migrates to and infects cells of the bursa. These results indicate that in situ hybridization can be useful in detection of IBV-infected chickens and in understanding the pathogenesis and virulence of IBV infection.","Kapczynski, D R; Sellers, H S; Rowland, G N; Jackwood, M W",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12243532/,428

The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of weight gain in periods of early childhood on body composition at 3 years, and whether infant feeding modified the relationship between early growth and body composition at 3 years. We studied 233 children from the prospective cohort study, SKOT (in Danish: Småbørns Kost og Trivsel). Birth weight z-scores (BWZ) and change in weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) from 0 to 5, 5 to 9, 9 to 18 and 18 to 36 months were analysed for relations with body composition (anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance) at 3 years by multivariate regression analysis. BWZ and change in WAZ from 0 to 5 months were positively associated with BMI, fat mass index (FMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) at 3 years. Full breastfeeding for 6 months (compared to less than 1 month) eliminated the effect of early growth (P = 0.01). Full breastfeeding for 6 months (compared to less than 1 month) also eliminated the positive relation between BWZ and FMI (P = 0.009). No effect modification of infant feeding was found for FFMI. In conclusion, high birth weight and rapid growth from 0 to 5 months were associated with increased FMI and FFMI at 3 years. Longer duration of full breastfeeding reduced the effect of birth weight and early weight gain on fat mass.","Ejlerskov, Katrine T; Christensen, Line B; Ritz, Christian; Jensen, Signe M; Mølgaard, Christian; Michaelsen, Kim F",The British journal of nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26131962/,428

METHODS Genbank sequences of six human coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1, were included as reference sequences. Primers were designed based on multiple alignment of reference sequences, targeting the conserved regions of each species of HcoV. Virus strains and nucleic acid preserved in our lab were used as template in developing this automatic-electrophoresis-based one-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay. Detection limits and reproducibility were also evaluated with these templates. Samples with infection of other respiratory viruses preserved in our lab were used to evaluate specificity of this assay. Finally, we tested this assay with 140 clinical samples that were validated by real-time PCR in parallel. RESULTS This automatic-electrophoresis-based multiplex RT-PCR assay was able to detect six human coronaviruses simultaneously. All positive samples in this study were detected with at least one specific fragment of anticipated length (195, 304, 332, 378, 415, 442 bp) . No fragment was detected in negative controls. Detection limits of 1.0×10(1-1.0)×10(2) copies/µl were achieved in tests of single virus. No cross reaction was observed with other respiratory viruses. This multiplex RT-PCR assay showed the same sensitivity and specificity to that of individual real-time RT-PCR validated with clinical samples. Both methods detected 28 positive samples (20%) . CONCLUSIONS Six HCoVs can be detected in one tube by this novel multiplex RT-PCR assay with high sensitivity and specificity.","Niu, Peihua; Zhang, Chen; Lu, Roujian; Wang, Ji; Lou, Yongliang; Tan, Wenjie; Ma, Xuejun",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24985384/,428

This study was undertaken to explore the clinical characteristics and mechanisms of liver damage. METHODS The serial laboratory data of liver function test and hepatic histological examination from 168 patients with SARS were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The abnormalities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were 52.5%, 71.8%, 85.7% and 85.2%. The average levels of ALT of the patients were 56.07+/-51.57 U/L, 86.46+/-69.93 U/L, 106.69+/-102.50 U/L and 111.32+/-160.24 U/L, and the average levels of serum albumin were 37.25+/-5.37 g/L, 35.82+/-4.74 g/L, 34.49+/-5.04 g/L, and 34.26+/-4.70 g/L, at the day of admission, the first week, second week, and third week after hospitalization, respectively. Significant correlation was not shown among liver damage, blood oxygen saturation (SaO2), degree of fever, and immune functional disorder in this study. Hepatic histological examination of 4 patients demonstrated that non-specific inflammation existed in the liver. CONCLUSIONS Liver damage of patients with SARS usually occurs in the early stage of the disease with a high occurrence rate and a prolonged profile, which can be characterized by early, obvious decrease of albumin levels and slightly abnormal levels of ALT. The liver damage induced by SARS seems to be caused by SARS virus directly rather than by low SaO2 or high fever. Hepatotoxic drugs may play a role in increasing the severity of liver damage or prolonging the time of liver function recovery.","Yang, Zhang; Xu, Min; Yi, Jun-Qing; Jia, Wei-Dong",Hepatobiliary & pancreatic diseases international : HBPD INT,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15730921/,428

Electron micrographs of two strains of rotavirus, bovine rotavirus C486 and rhesus rotavirus, show that virally mediated cell-cell fusion occurs within 1 h postinfection. Trypsin activation is necessary for rotavirus to mediate cell-cell fusion. The extent of fusion is relative to the amount of virus used, and maximum fusion occurs between pHs 6.5 and 7.5. Fusion does not require virus-induced protein synthesis, as virus from both an empty capsid preparation and from an EDTA-treated preparation, which is noninfectious, can induce fusion. Incubation of rotavirus with neutralizing and nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies before addition to cells indicates that viral protein 4 (VP4; in the form of VP5* and VP8*) and VP7 are involved in fusion. Light and electron micrographs document this fusion, including the formation of pores or channels between adjacent fused cells. These data support direct membrane penetration as a possible route of infection.

Lessons in leadership from the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required rapid, global health care shifts to prioritize urgent or pandemic-related care and minimize transmission. Little is known about impacts on pediatric orthopaedic surgeons during this time. We aimed to investigate COVID-19-related changes in practice, training, and research among pediatric orthopaedic surgeons globally. METHODS: An online survey was administered to orthopaedic surgeons with interest in pediatrics in April 2020 and a follow-up was administered in February 2021. The surveys captured demographics and surgeons' self-reported experiences during the pandemic. Participants were recruited from web media and available email lists of orthopaedic societies over a 2-month period. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze results, stratified by the severity of local COVID-19-related measures. RESULTS: A total of 460 responses from 45 countries were collected for initial survey. Of these, 358 (78.5%) respondents reported lockdown measures in their region at time of survey. Most (n=337, 94.4%) reported pausing all elective procedures. Surgeons reported a reduction in the average number of surgeries per week, from 6.89 (SD=4.61) prepandemic to 1.25 (SD=2.26) at time of survey (mean difference=5.64; 95% confidence interval=5.19, 6.10). Average number of elective outpatient appointments per week decreased from 67.89 (SD=45.78) prepandemic to 11.79 (SD=15.83) at time of survey (mean difference=56.10, 95% confidence interval=5.61, 60.58). In total, 177 (39.4%) surgeons reported using virtual modes of outpatient appointments for the first time. Of 290 surgeons with trainees, 223 (84.5%) reported implementation of systems to continue training such as webinars or virtual rounds. Of 192 respondents with research, 149 (82.8%) reported continuing research activities during the pandemic with most reporting either cessation (n=75, 64.15%), or reduction (n=25, 29.9%) in participant recruitment. A total of 111 responses from 28 countries were collected during follow-up. Surgeons described policy and circumstantial changes that facilitated resumption of clinical work. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its related counter measures have had significant impacts on pediatric orthopaedic practice and increased uptake of technology to provide care continuity. Rigorous epidemiological studies are needed to assess impacts of delayed and virtual care on patient outcomes.","Gibbard, Marissa; Ponton, Ethan; Sidhu, Bernita V; Farrell, Sarah; Bone, Jeffrey N; Wu, Luke A; Schaeffer, Emily; Cooper, Anthony; Aroojis, Alaric; Mulpuri, Kishore",J. pediatr. orthop,,428
206944,Prevalence of dry mouth in COVID-19 patients with and without Sicca syndrome in a large hospital center,2021,"BACKGROUND: On the 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness. Novel treatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients. In light of this, there has been growing interest in the use of existing medications, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments of this disease. AIM: To establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of CQ and HCQ in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted on 21 March 2020. A further search was conducted in Google for relevant literature on 28 March 2020. RESULTS: There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway. The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results. Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations. No medium or long-term follow-up data is available. CONCLUSION: At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19. High quality, adequately powered randomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians. These studies should report medium- and long-term follow-up results, and safety data.","Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin",,,428
207669,Treatment of osteosarcoma patients in the Philippine general hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic which continues to impact nearly every person on Earth, having caused over 1.8 million deaths. Two anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 80R and 362 are known to bind to epitopes on the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and neutralize the virus. To investigate this further and hypothesize structures for potentially more effective antibodies, undergraduate students cooperated in teams as part of the CREST (Connecting Researchers, Educators, and STudents) Program with the Center for Biological Modeling. Working collaboratively, students from eight universities nationwide applied their knowledge to build 3-D printed models to explain a particular protein-based molecular story using crystal structures of proteins described in the literature. The Nova Southeastern University (NSU) CREST team modeled and compared the 80R antibody that binds to SARS-CoV-1 and the MAb362 antibody that can bind to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Students developed skills with protein visualization software including Pymol and Jmol to design models which showed the 80R and 362 antibodies binding to the RBD of the corresponding proteins. By studying the point mutation differences between the two antibodies (80R and 362), a potentially more universal antibody (named NSU1 in this study) was modeled. This hypothesized antibody was expected to bind more effectively to future mutations in the SARS spike protein. At the binding interface between these antibodies and the SARS spike protein, MAb362 mutations trend smaller and less polar including: Arg149Ser, Asn151Ser, Asp170Gly, and Trp213Ser. Due to the trend of smaller amino acids appearing in the MAb362 binding interface, it was hypothesized that more space in this area could allow antibodies to be more resistant to future SARS-CoV spike protein structure variations. NSU1 was modeled based on MAb362 with the following four additional mutations: Asp103Gly, Trp104Leu, Gly170Ser, and Arg211Val. All of these except for Gly170 are mutations that decreased size and polarity of amino acid residues within the binding interface. Position 170 is Asp on the 80R structure and thus a mutation to Ser is still expected to maintain this trend of smaller residues in the antibody. Due to the additional space created due to these amino acid substitutions in the binding region between the antibody and RBD of the spike protein, NSU1 was predicted to be more resistant to spike protein mutations. These models allowed for deeper understanding of the impact that mutations in antibodies can have on binding interactions with viral proteins. Additionally, the modeling process also provided insight into the molecular structure of a potentially more universal antibody against variations in SARS-CoV.","Manikkuttiyil, Carol Abbas Feza Abbas Lyla Alzamora Carolina Hunt Matthew Julakanti Pujita Likki Sanjana Manikkuttiyil Christo Schmitt Lavin Emily Sikora Arthur",The FASEB Journal,,428

However, our knowledge and understanding of the virus's complete impact on the nose remains poor. This report describes a unique patient case to demonstrate how COVID-19 may be associated with rhinoplasty complications such as septal perforation. CASE REPORT: This is a case report of a previously healthy patient who underwent septorhinoplasty in 2018. She had frequent follow-up including intranasal examinations without evidence of the septal perforation for the 2 years following her operation. In March 2020, the patient was noted to have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, but testing was not recommended by the pediatrician. Soon after her symptoms resolved, she experienced a sudden onset of whistling and physical examination revealed a perforation in the septum which rapidly enlarged over the ensuing weeks. She tested positive for the COVID-19 antibody. After confirming that she no longer had an active infection via antigen testing, she underwent repair of her septal perforation without complications. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates a septorhinoplasty complication that may be associated with COVID-19. Further study into this virus's impact on vascularity and wound healing, specifically in the nose, is recommended.

209132,The Covid Recovery Unit (CRU): An Interdisciplinary Model for Rehabilitation on Acute Care,2021,"We investigated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in recipients of kidney transplants in the Bronx, New York, one of the epicenters of the pandemic. Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization.","Azzi, Yorg; Parides, Michael; Alani, Omar; Loarte-Campos, Pablo; Bartash, Rachel; Forest, Stefanie; Colovai, Adriana; Ajaimy, Maria; Liriano-Ward, Luz; Pynadath, Cindy; Graham, Jay; Le, Marie; Greenstein, Stuart; Rocca, Juan; Kinkhabwala, Milan; Akalin, Enver",Kidney Int,,428

210535,Evaluation of Gamma glutamyl-transferase (GGT) levels in COVID-19: A retrospective analysis in tertiary care centre,2020,"Background: Past research suggests that knowledge supports- but strong illness expectations thwart- adoption of protective behaviors (e.g., handwashing). Strong illness expectations may place COVID-19 essential workers at risk. It is unclear, however, whether knowledge can moderate the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations on protective behaviors. We test COVID-19 knowledge as a moderator of the effects of (1) pessimistic illness expectations and (2) essential worker status on adherence to protective behaviors. Methods: Participants (n = 350) completed measures of knowledge, illness expectations, and protective behaviors. We used chi-square tests to examine associations between variables and logistic regressions to test the moderation models predicting adherence (low, high) while controlling for demographics. Results: Knowledge, illness expectations, and adherence were significantly associated with each other (p < 0.05). Essential workers had stronger illness expectations and lower knowledge than did non-essential workers (p < 0.001). Logistic regressions showed a non-significant Worker Status × Knowledge interaction (p = 0.59) but a significant Knowledge × Illness Expectations interaction (p < 0.05) indicating that those with strong illness expectations and low knowledge were disproportionately at risk of failing to adhere to recommended behaviors. Conclusions: Knowledge promotes protective behaviors by buffering the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations. Essential workers are more likely to have low levels of knowledge with strong illness expectations, suggesting that educational policies may be warranted.","Miller, Lisa M Soederberg; Gee, Perry M; Katz, Rachael A",Front Public Health,,428

Applying the same technique to aspherical or inhomogeneous particles yields the position, diameter and refractive index of an effective sphere that represents an average over the particle's geometry and composition. This effective-sphere interpretation has been applied successfully to porous, dimpled and coated spheres, as well as to fractal clusters of nanoparticles, all of whose inhomogeneities appear on length scales smaller than the wavelength of light. Here, we combine numerical and experimental studies to investigate effective-sphere characterization of symmetric dimers of micrometer-scale spheres, a class of aspherical objects that appear commonly in real-world dispersions. Our studies demonstrate that the effective-sphere interpretation usefully identifies dimers in holographic characterization studies of monodisperse colloidal spheres. The effective-sphere estimate for a dimer's axial position closely follows the ground truth for its center of mass. Trends in the effective-sphere diameter and refractive index, furthermore, can be used to measure a dimer's three-dimensional orientation. When applied to colloidal dimers transported in a Poiseuille flow, the estimated orientation distribution is consistent with expectations for Brownian particles undergoing Jeffery orbits.","Altman, Lauren E.; Quddus, Rushna; Cheong, Fook Chiong; Grier, David G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13419v1.pdf,428
215158,Cancer Screening in the Coronavirus Pandemic Era: Adjusting to a New Situation,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has spread worldwide via international travel. This study traced its diffusion from the global to national level and identified a few superspreaders that played a central role in the transmission of this disease in India. DATA AND METHODS: We used the travel history of infected patients from January 30 to April 6, 2020, as the primary data source. A total of 1386 cases were assessed, of which 373 were international, and 1013 were national contacts. The networks were generated in Gephi software (version 0.9.2). RESULTS: The maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (degree 144) and the UK (degree 64). Dubai's eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India. Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14, 2020. This was primarily attributed to a gathering at the Delhi Religious Conference (DRC) known as Tabliqui Jamaat. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 got induced into Indian states mainly due to International travels with the very first patient travelling from Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the contacts of positive cases were located, and a significant spread was identified in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka. The COVID-19's spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local.","Azad, Sarita; Devi, Sushma",J. travel med,,428

Afin de modéliser l’activité hospitalière, un DES a été développé pour modéliser la prise en charge des patients et l’utilisation de ressources hospitalières (volumes horaires des blocs chirurgicaux, radiothérapie, chimiothérapie, …) en fonction du type de cancer. Les flux patients ont été simulés à partir de données individuelles anonymisées issues du Programme de médicalisation des systèmes d’information (PMSI) de Gustave-Roussy. Les données historiques du PMSI de janvier 2018 à février 2020 ont permis la modélisation en séries temporelles (modèle ARIMA) des flux patients en l’absence de perturbation épidémique. La différence de ces flux avec les flux observés entre mars et octobre 2020 a informé le modèle sur les patients absents, pour lesquels deux scénarios de retour ont été envisagés : un retour massif à partir de novembre 2020 (retour rapide), ou un retour plus tardif à partir de mars 2021 (retour tardif). Le modèle DES prenant en compte ces flux simulés et la disponibilité attendue des ressources hospitalières a permis le calcul de retards individuels à la prise en charge. Le sur-risque de décès associé au retard de prise en charge par type de cancer, issu de la littérature, a été utilisé pour évaluer la surmortalité par cancer à cinq ans pour tous les patients se présentant à l’hôpital entre le début du premier confinement (mi-mars 2020), et la date à laquelle l’utilisation des ressources hospitalières reviendrait à son niveau habituel. Une analyse de sensibilité sur le taux d’utilisation réel des ressources hospitalières a été conduite. Résultats Le retour à une activité normale (absence de retards dans la venue des patients et dans l’utilisation des ressources) est prévu pour mai 2022 dans le scénario de retour rapide et pour juin 2022 dans le scénario de retour tardif (n∼13 000 patients) ;6 à 8 % des patients présentent un retard à la prise en charge supérieur à deux mois. Le nombre de décès supplémentaires à cinq ans est estimé à 88 pour le retour rapide, et à 145 pour le retour tardif, avec un impact accru pour les sarcomes, les cancers gynécologiques, les leucémies aiguës, les cancers ORL, du sein et du foie. Cela représente une surmortalité à cinq ans de 4 à 6,8 % chez les patients initialement attendus à l’hôpital en 2020, de 0,5 à 1,3 % pour ceux de 2021 et de 0,5 % pour ceux de 2022. Les analyses de sensibilité ont montré que des perturbations sur la disponibilité des ressources pouvaient entraîner une nouvelle hausse de cette surmortalité, de l’ordre de 2 à 18 %. Conclusion Les délais de diagnostic et de traitement des patients atteints de cancer pendant l’épidémie de COVID-19 ont un impact sur la survie des patients. Cet impact important nécessite d’organiser les soins de sorte que les diagnostics et les traitements des cancers restent accessibles et ne soient pas retardés lors de prochains épisodes épidémiques.","Fraslin, A.; Bardet, A.; Marghadi, J.; Borget, I.; Matthieu, F.; Auperin, A.; Michiels, S.; Bonastre, J.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,428

Multivariate linear regression was used to determine factors associated with glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) . A1C was clinically elevated &#8805;8% for 60.3% of the participants. Overall, age and PA levels showed a negative association with A1C, and positively with underweight status, duration of diabetes, and participants' view of fluctuating/unstable blood glucose and blood glucose not improved compared to first diagnosed. A significant negative association with A1C was shown with PA levels and additional blood glucose monitoring (BGM) beyond that received at the public clinic in the urban area. Whilst, in the semi-urban area, there was a significant positive association with A1C with regards to duration of diabetes and insulin regimen. Determinants of A1C in this target group are multifactorial, therefore, interventions aiming to improve diabetes clinical outcomes are needed to reduce the likelihood of serious ramifications. Additionally, a team approach from healthcare professionals is needed in conjunction with active patient engagement as well as the development of more comprehensive diabetes care guidelines and policies.","Mphwanthe, Getrude; Weatherspoon, Dave; Kalimbira, Alexander; Weatherspoon, Lorraine",Soc Work Public Health,,428

224015,The effects of chondroitin sulfate on virulence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) app use is a major concern because of the possible dissemination of misinformation that could harm the users. Particularly, it can be difficult for health care professionals to recommend a suitable app for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) education and self-monitoring purposes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze and evaluate the contents as well as features of COVID-19 mobile apps. The findings are instrumental in helping health care professionals to identify suitable mobile apps for COVID-19 self-monitoring and education. The results of the mobile apps' assessment could potentially help mobile app developers improve or modify their existing mobile app designs to achieve optimal outcomes. METHODS: The search for the mHealth apps available in the android-based Play Store and the iOS-based App Store was conducted between April 18 and May 5, 2020. The region of the App Store where we performed the search was the United States, and a virtual private network app was used to locate and access COVID-19 mobile apps from all countries on the Google Play Store. The inclusion criteria were apps that are related to COVID-19 with no restriction in language type. The basic features assessment criteria used for comparison were the requirement for free subscription, internet connection, education or advisory content, size of the app, ability to export data, and automated data entry. The functionality of the apps was assessed according to knowledge (information on COVID-19), tracing or mapping of COVID-19 cases, home monitoring surveillance, online consultation with a health authority, and official apps run by health authorities. RESULTS: Of the 223 COVID-19-related mobile apps, only 30 (19.9%) found in the App Store and 28 (44.4%) in the Play Store matched the inclusion criteria. In the basic features assessment, most App Store (10/30, 33.3%) and Play Store (10/28, 35.7%) apps scored 4 out of 7 points. Meanwhile, the outcome of the functionality assessment for most App Store apps (13/30, 43.3%) was a score of 3 compared to android-based apps (10/28, 35.7%), which scored 2 (out of the maximum 5 points). Evaluation of the basic functions showed that 75.0% (n=36) of the 48 included mobile apps do not require a subscription, 56.3% (n=27) provide symptom advice, and 41.7% (n=20) have educational content. In terms of the specific functions, more than half of the included mobile apps are official mobile apps maintained by a health authority for COVID-19 information provision. Around 37.5% (n=18) and 31.3% (n=15) of the mobile apps have tracing or mapping and home monitoring surveillance functions, respectively, with only 17% (n=8) of the mobile apps equipped with an online consultation function. CONCLUSIONS: Most iOS-based apps incorporate infographic mapping of COVID-19 cases, while most android-based apps incorporate home monitoring surveillance features instead of providing focused educational content on COVID-19. It is important to evaluate the contents and features of COVID-19 mobile apps to guide users in choosing a suitable mobile app based on their requirements.","Ming, Long Chiau; Untong, Noorazrina; Aliudin, Nur Amalina; Osili, Norliza; Kifli, Nurolaini; Tan, Ching Siang; Goh, Khang Wen; Ng, Pit Wei; Al-Worafi, Yaser Mohammed; Lee, Kah Seng; Goh, Hui Poh",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,428

We wanted to describe the effects of the national lockdown on the well-being of a cohort of Italian patients with cerebral palsy (CP) receiving botulinum toxin (BT) therapy and of their caregivers. Twenty-five patients receiving BT therapy were surveyed using the structuralized questionnaire by Dressler and Adib Saberi, while the caregivers were assessed using the Caregiver Burden Scale. The lockdown delayed BT therapy by 9 ± 2.8 months. Around 44% of the selected patients noticed increased muscle cramps, 24% increased muscle pain, and 32% both of them. Due to the lockdown, the patient's quality of life was reduced by 68.4 ± 21.1%. After the lockdown, 100% of patients perceived BT therapy as more important than before. Around 76% of the patients perceived the lockdown as inadequate and felt that their rights were not respected. The overall score of the Caregiver Burden Scale, as regarded before the lockdown, was 29.12 ± 11.63, while the overall score as regarded after the lockdown was 37.44 ± 14.85. The overall score increased, from before the lockdown to after the lockdown, for 92% of caregivers. The BT outpatient clinic's interruption was seen to significantly worsen the psychophysical condition of subjects with CP and the care burden of their caregivers, exposing them to greater stress than before.

AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, meta-analysis has been performed in determining the efficacy and safety of DZHS combined with conventional treatment (CT) for ACI and GRADE assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the use of DZHS for treating ACI were screened by searching the databases of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science as well as four Chinese databases. Meta-analysis was carried out with RevMan 5.3 and Stata 16.0 software. The quality of research evidence was assessed by the GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro version: 3.6). RESULTS: Forty-three studies (n = 4618) were included. When compared to the control groups, the total effective rate of the national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) was higher in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.28, P < 0.001; RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.38, P < 0.001); clinical symptoms and signs were improved in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.24, P < 0.001; RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.42, P < 0.001); the incidence of adverse reactions was reduced in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.98, P = 0.044); and the NIHSS score was decreased in the experimental group with DZHS (WMD = -3.30, 95% CI = -3.86 to -2.73, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DZHS combined with CT is conditionally recommended to improve the total effective rate of the NIHSS, clinical symptoms, and neurological deficits and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions, and no serious adverse reactions were noted. The GRADE assessment indicates that the overall certainty quality of evidence is low. Further large-scale, well-designed and high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the positive results.

230191,Characteristics and considerations in the medical treatment of COVID-19 in children,2020,"PURPOSE: The capability of lung ultrasound (LUS) to distinguish the different pulmonary patterns of COVID-19 and quantify the disease burden compared to chest CT is still unclear. METHODS: PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent both LUS and chest CT at the Emergency Department were retrospectively analysed. In both modalities, twelve peripheral lung zones were identified and given a Severity Score basing on main lesion pattern. On CT scans the well-aerated lung volume (%WALV) was visually estimated. Per-patient and per-zone assessments of LUS classification performance taking CT findings as reference were performed, further revisioning the images in case of discordant results. Correlations between number of disease-positive lung zones, Severity Score and %WALV on both LUS and CT were assessed. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine LUS performance in detecting %WALVâ¯&#8804;â¯70 %. RESULTS: The study included 219 COVID-19 patients with abnormal chest CT. LUS correctly identified as positive 217 (99 %) patients, but per-zone analysis showed sensitivityâ¯=â¯75 % and specificityâ¯=â¯66 %. The revision of the 121 (55 %) cases with positive LUS and negative CT revealed COVID-compatible lesions in 42 (38 %) CT scans. Number of disease-positive zones, Severity Score and %WALV between LUS and CT showed moderate correlations. The AUCs for LUS Severity Score and number of LUS-positive zones did not differ in detecting %WALVâ¯&#8804;â¯70 %.

PURPOSE: To summarize evidence about the benefits and harms of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment or prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DATA SOURCES: PubMed (via MEDLINE), EMBASE (via Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, Preprints, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry from 1 December 2019 until 8 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies in any language reporting efficacy or safety outcomes from hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use in any setting in adults or children with suspected COVID-19 or at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four randomized controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, and 9 case series assessed treatment effects of the medications, but no studies evaluated prophylaxis. Evidence was conflicting and insufficient regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on such outcomes as all-cause mortality, progression to severe disease, clinical symptoms, and upper respiratory virologic clearance with antigen testing. Several studies found that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine developed a QTc interval of 500 ms or greater, but the proportion of patients with this finding varied among the studies. Two studies assessed the efficacy of chloroquine; 1 trial, which compared higher-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) with lower-dose (450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days) therapy, was stopped owing to concern that the higher dose therapy increased lethality and QTc interval prolongation. An observational study that compared adults with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine phosphate, 500 mg once or twice daily, with patients not receiving chloroquine found minor fever resolution and virologic clearance benefits with chloroquine. LIMITATION: There were few controlled studies, and control for confounding was inadequate in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Evidence on the benefits and harms of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19 is very weak and conflicting.

Pneumonia has an utmost importance in the primary pathomechanism of the development of critical illness in the COVID-19 patients. Thus, imaging techniques are situated in the frontline to aim the diagnostic decision-making, to follow up the progress and to evaluate the possible complications. Reviewing the available literature, so far the common chest CT, chest X-ray and chest wall ultrasound features are presented, and recommendations are pronounced for the indications of the different modalities. At the initial phase, the atypical presentations of the virus infection are multiplex, peripheral ground glass opacities situated in the right lower lobe of the lung evolving rapidly into a bilateral involvement of the middle and basal zones. Along with the progression, the ratio of the consolidation is increasing subsequently deteriorating into fibrosis with reticular pattern.

235218,Ethical issues related to the virtual interviews process faced by applicants and programs,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of worldwide restrictive measures to reduce social contact and viral spread. These measures have been reported to have a negative effect on physical activity (PA). Studies of PA during the pandemic have primarily used self-reported data. The single academic study that used tracked data did not report on demographics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore patterns of smartphone-tracked activity before, during, and immediately after lockdown in the United Kingdom, and examine differences by sociodemographic characteristics and prior levels of PA. METHODS: Tracked longitudinal weekly minutes of PA were captured using the BetterPoints smartphone app between January and June 2020. Data were plotted by week, demographics, and activity levels at baseline. Nonparametric tests of difference were used to assess mean and median weekly minutes of activity at significant points before and during the lockdown, and as the lockdown was eased. Changes over time by demographics (age, gender, Index of Multiple Deprivation, baseline activity levels) were examined using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). RESULTS: There were 5395 users with a mean age of 41 years (SD 12) and 61% (n=3274) were female. At baseline, 26% (n=1422) of users were inactive, 23% (n=1240) were fairly active, and 51% (n=2733) were active. There was a relatively even spread across deprivation deciles (31% [n=1693] in the least deprived deciles and 23% in the most [n=1261]). We found significant changes in PA from the week before the first case of COVID-19 was announced (baseline) to the week that social distancing restrictions were relaxed (Friedman test: &#967;22=2331, P<.001). By the first full week of lockdown, the median change in PA was 57 minutes less than baseline. This represents a 37% reduction in weekly minutes of PA. Overall, 63% of people decreased their level of activity between baseline and the first week of COVID-19 restrictions. Younger people showed more PA before lockdown but the least PA after lockdown. In contrast, those aged >65 years appeared to remain more active throughout and increased their activity levels as soon as lockdown was eased. Levels of PA among those classed as active at baseline showed a larger drop compared with those considered to be fairly active or inactive. Socioeconomic group and gender did not appear to be associated with changes in PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our tracked PA data suggests a significant drop in PA during the United Kingdom's COVID-19 lockdown. Significant differences by age group and prior PA levels suggests that the government's response to COVID-19 needs to be sensitive to these individual differences and the government should react accordingly. Specifically, it should consider the impact on younger age groups, encourage everyone to increase their PA, and not assume that people will recover prior levels of PA on their own.","McCarthy, Hannah; Potts, Henry W W; Fisher, Abigail",J Med Internet Res,,428
235919,Skin changes attributed to protective measures against COVID-19: A compilation,2020,"Among at-risk groups for psychological distress in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pregnant women might be especially vulnerable. Identifying subgroups of pregnant women at high risk of poor adaptation might optimize clinical screening and intervention, which could, in turn, contribute to mitigating the potentially devastating effects of prenatal stress on mothers and fetus. Level of personality functioning may be a good indicator of who may be more vulnerable to distress in challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, as adults with high levels of personality dysfunction may experience significant difficulties in mentalizing threatening situations. The aims of the present study are (a) to determine the impact of level of personality pathology on affective, behavioral, and thought problems in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (b) to test a model where mentalization of trauma mediates the impact of personality pathology on symptomatology. Data from 1,207 French-Canadian pregnant women recruited through social media during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Latent profile analysis, using the Criterion A elements of the alternative model for personality disorders (Identity, Self-Direction, Empathy, Intimacy) as latent indicators, yielded four profiles: Healthy, Mild Self-Impairment, Intimacy Impairment, and Personality Disorder. Profiles showed significant associations with diverse indicators of symptomatology. Mediation models showed both direct and indirect (through mentalization of trauma) significant associations between level of personality functioning and affective/behavioral/thought problems. Results have clinical implications on prophylactic measures for at-risk pregnant women, especially in challenging contexts such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We exploratorily investigated the final diagnosis among non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients who visited the fever clinic. Methods This was a retrospective, observational, and single-centered study conducted in the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), Tokyo, Japan. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who visited the fever clinic in the NCGM from 11 March 2020 to 24 April 2020. Patients Patients who met the following clinical criteria visited the fever clinic in the NCGM: (1) body temperature >37.5°C, (2) any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or (3) referral from local healthcare facilities. In the fever clinic, all patients who met the above criteria had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction test with nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Patients with severe symptoms or an unstable condition were sent to an outpatient clinic for infectious diseases for further evaluation and treatment. Results Among 1,470 patients who visited the fever clinic, 84 patients were hospitalized, and 45 of them were diagnosed as having COVID-19. Among the remaining 39 non-COVID-19 patients, there were nine patients with life-threatening diseases. The life-threatening diseases included acute heart failure, septic shock, pneumocystis pneumonia, peritonsillar abscess, and necrotizing fasciitis. Conclusion Physicians should evaluate each patient carefully while considering other life-threatening conditions even in such a COVID-19 pandemic era.","Akiyama, Yutaro; Morioka, Shinichiro; Wakimoto, Yuji; Kawashima, Akira; Kanda, Kohei; Okuhama, Ayako; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Miyazato, Yusuke; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Ide, Satoshi; Nakamoto, Takato; Nakamura, Keiji; Ota, Masayuki; Moriyama, Yuki; Takaya, Saho; Yamada, Kota; Taguchi, Maho; Sugito, Erika; Izuka, Shinji; Ishiguro, Kenji; Kobayashi, Toshiaki; Miyake, Wataru; Kubota, Shuji; Ishikane, Masahiro; Kinoshita, Noriko; Yamamoto, Kei; Ujiie, Mugen; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Saito, Sho; Ohmagari, Norio",Intern Med,,428

METHODS: An open-label parallel randomized controlled trial was performed among healthy migrant workers quarantined in a large multi-storey dormitory in Singapore. Forty clusters (each defined as individual floors of the dormitory) were randomly assigned to receive a 42-day prophylaxis regimen of either oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once, followed by 200 mg/day), oral ivermectin (12 mg once), povidone-iodine throat spray (3 times/day, 270 µg/day), oral zinc (80 mg/day)/vitamin C (500 mg/day) combination, or oral vitamin C, 500 mg/day. The primary outcome was laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by either: (1) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 42, or (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at any time between baseline and day 42. RESULTS: A total of 3037 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 33.0 years; all men) who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were included in the primary analysis. Follow-up was nearly complete (99.6%). Compared with vitamin C, significant absolute risk reductions (%, 98.75% confidence interval) were observed for oral hydroxychloroquine (21%, 2-42%) and povidone-iodine throat spray (24%, 7-39%). No statistically significant differences were observed with oral zinc/vitamin C combination (23%, -5 to +41%) and ivermectin (5%, -10 to +22%). Interruptions due to side effects were highest among participants who received zinc/vitamin C combination (6.9%), followed by vitamin C (4.7%), povidone-iodine (2.0%), and hydroxychloroquine (0.7%).

236785,Assessing the risk of seizures with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine therapy for COVID-19 in persons with epilepsy,2020,"The risk of transmitting airborne pathogens is an important consideration in dentistry and has acquired special significance in the context of recent respiratory disease epidemics. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to examine (1) what is currently known regarding the physics of aerosol creation, (2) the types of environmental contaminants generated by dental procedures, (3) the nature, quantity, and sources of microbiota in these contaminants and (4) the risk of disease transmission from patients to dental healthcare workers. Most dental procedures that use ultrasonics, handpieces, air-water syringes, and lasers generate sprays, a fraction of which are aerosolized. The vast heterogeneity in the types of airborne samples collected (spatter, settled aerosol, or harvested air), the presence and type of at-source aerosol reduction methods (high-volume evacuators, low volume suction, or none), the methods of microbial sampling (petri dishes with solid media, filter paper discs, air harvesters, and liquid transport media) and assessment of microbial bioload (growth conditions, time of growth, specificity of microbial characterization) are barriers to drawing robust conclusions. For example, although several studies have reported the presence of microorganisms in aerosols generated by ultrasonic scalers and high-speed turbines, the specific types of organisms or their source is not as well studied. This paucity of data does not allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding saliva as a major source of airborne microorganisms during aerosol generating dental procedures. Well-controlled, large-scale, multi center studies using atraumatic air harvesters, open-ended methods for microbial characterization and integrated data modeling are urgently needed to characterize the microbial constituents of aerosols created during dental procedures and to estimate time and extent of spread of these infectious agents.","Kumar, Purnima S; Subramanian, Kumar",J Periodontol,,428

While the actual and potential harm due to COVID-19 is far more severe than influenza, the harms due to the NPIs—that have clearly reduced mortality due to COVID-19—are also significant. With government-ordered “lockdowns” across the globe, many arguments for and against returning to normal social and economic activity have been reported, and in fact, Americans are divided about how and when to “open up.” These arguments seem to fall into two major categories. Utilitarianism suggests that suspension of civil liberties and constitutional rights is a necessary response, while Libertarianism supports individual decision-making and greatly reduced government mandates. Protesters around the country have been vocal about one or the other points of view. First, we consider in detail the potential harms of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-2 if left unchecked by NPIs. Second, we look at harms due to restricted social and economic activity on human morbidity and mortality.

RECENT FINDINGS: Among elderly people, 6.5%, 1.7%, and 1.1% have functional constipation, constipation-predominant IBS, and opioid-induced constipation. In elderly people, the number of colonic enteric neurons and smooth muscle functions is preserved; decreased cholinergic function with unopposed nitrergic relaxation may explain colonic motor dysfunction. Less physical activity or dietary fiber intake and postmenopausal hormonal therapy are risk factors for fecal incontinence in elderly people. Two thirds of patients with fecal incontinence respond to biofeedback therapy. Used in combination, loperamide and biofeedback therapy are more effective than placebo, education, and biofeedback therapy. Vaginal or anal insert devices are another option. In the elderly, constipation and fecal incontinence are common and often distressing symptoms that can often be managed by addressing bowel disturbances. Selected diagnostic tests, prescription medications, and, infrequently, surgical options should be considered when necessary.","Deb, Brototo; Prichard, David O; Bharucha, Adil E",Curr Gastroenterol Rep,,428

Compared to the parent Bi2Se3, the superconducting SrxBi2Se3crystals show obvious phonon softening in the three optical phonon modes A1g1, Eg2, and A1g2. Based on the simulations by the Fano function, we present a compelling evidence of the enhanced electron-phonon coupling in SrxBi2Se3for its smaller asymmetric parameterq. Moreover, an anomalous broadening and intensity antiresonance in the characteristic Raman peaks were observed as the temperature decreased to around 160 K. Thus, the superconducting topological material SrxBi2Se3represents a counterintuitive example where the electron-phonon interaction is strengthened by the accumulation of electron carriers.","Li, Mingtao; Fang, Yifei; Pei, Cuiying; Qi, Yanpeng; Wang, Lin",J. phys. condens. matter,,428

There are still several challenges in COVID-19 diagnoses, such as limited reagents, equipment, and long turnaround times. In this research, we propose to design molecularly imprinted polymers as a novel approach for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we investigated molecular interactions between the target spike protein, receptor-binding domain of the virus, and the common functional monomers used in molecular imprinting by a plethora of computational analyses; sequence analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results demonstrated that AMPS and IA monomers gave promising results on the SARS-CoV-2 specific TEIYQAGST sequence for further analysis. Therefore, we propose an epitope approach-based synthesis route for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by using AMPS and IA as functional monomers and the peptide fragment of the TEIYQAGST sequence as a template molecule.","Cubuk, Hasan; Ozbil, Mehmet; Cakir Hatir, Pinar",Comput Theor Chem,,428

Therapeutics are still needed to treat mild and severe COVID-19. Drug repurposing provides an opportunity to deploy drugs for COVID-19 more rapidly than developing novel therapeutics. Some existing drugs have shown promise for treating COVID-19 in clinical trials. This in silico study uses structural similarity to clinical trial drugs to identify two drugs with potential applications to treat early COVID-19. We apply in silico validation to suggest a possible mechanism of action for both. Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid structurally similar to Dexamethasone. Gallopamil is a calcium channel blocker structurally similar to Verapamil. We propose that both these drugs could be useful to treat early COVID-19 infection due to the proximity of their targets within a SARS-CoV-2-induced protein-protein interaction network to kinases active in early infection, and the APOA1 protein which is linked to the spread of COVID-19.","MacMahon, M'eabh; Hwang, Woochang; Yim, Soorin; MacMahon, Eoghan; Abraham, Alexandre; Barton, Justin; Tharmakulasingam, Mukunthan; Bilokon, Paul; Gaddi, Vasanthi Priyadarshini; Han, Namshik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02905v1.pdf,428

The impact it has had has overwhelmed the entire healthcare system, from the unknown carrier status, poor testing capabilities to hospitals running out of ventilators for severely ill patients. There has been a variety of potential treatment modalities for the various forms of illness ranging from asymptomatic carriers to the ventilated ICU patients. These include anti-inflammatory medications, antibiotics, immune-modulators, convalescent plasma, and others. The cytokine storm that inflicts some patients can be devastating to the vital organs of the human body in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, coagulopathy, and death. Cytosorbents® cytokine filter is a potential treatment methodology aimed at reducing the cytokine storm, thus serving as a bridge for therapy in the acutely ill patients infected with COVID-19. The following case report demonstrates the utility in a critically ill patient who survived the cytokine storm after receiving the cytokine filter via continuous renal replacement therapy bridging him to further definitive therapy.","Rizvi, Saniya; Danic, Michael; Silver, Mark; LaBond, Virginia",Heart lung,,428

Reaching herd immunity status likely necessitates that children, as well as their parents, receive a vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this exploratory study, we investigated the demographic, experiential, and psychological factors associated with the anticipated likelihood and speed of having children receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a sample of 455 Canadian families (858 children; parents' mean age = 38.2 ± 6.82 years). Using linear mixed-effects and proportional odds logistic regression models, we demonstrated that older parental age, living in the Prairies (relative to Central Canada), more complete child vaccination history, and a greater tendency to prioritise the risks of the disease relative to the risks of side effects (i.e. lower omission bias) were associated with higher likelihoods of intention to vaccinate participants' children, with trend-level associations with lower perceived danger of the vaccine and higher psychological avoidance of the pandemic. Faster speed of intended vaccination was predicted by a similar constellation of variables with an additional predictor of a child in the family having a COVID-19 related health risk being associated with slower intended speed. Results are discussed concerning public health knowledge mobilisation and the unique Canadian health landscape.","Lackner, Christine L; Wang, Charles H",Vaccine X,,428

Among these is ISG15, the mechanistic roles of which in innate immunity still remain enigmatic. In the present study, we report that ISG15 conjugation is essential for antiviral IFN responses mediated by the viral RNA sensor MDA5. ISGylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domains of MDA5 promotes its oligomerization and thereby triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses, including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses. The ISG15-dependent activation of MDA5 is antagonized through direct de-ISGylation mediated by the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work demonstrates a crucial role for ISG15 in the MDA5-mediated antiviral response, and also identifies a key immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which may be targeted for the development of new antivirals and vaccines to combat COVID-19.","Liu, GuanQun; Lee, Jung-Hyun; Parker, Zachary M; Acharya, Dhiraj; Chiang, Jessica J; van Gent, Michiel; Riedl, William; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E; Wies, Effi; Chiang, Cindy; Gack, Michaela U",Nat Microbiol,,428

METHODS: From 1 to 22 March 2020, patients with pneumonia symptoms, positive lung CT scan, and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were consecutively enrolled. Clinical data was collected. Outcome was defined as favourable or adverse (i.e., need for mechanical ventilation or death) and registered over a period of 10 days following CT. Volume of disease (VoD) on CT was calculated semi-automatically. Multiple linear regression was used to predict VoD by clinical/laboratory data. To predict outcome, important features were selected using a priori analysis and subsequently used to train 4 different models. RESULTS: A total of 106 consecutive patients were enrolled (median age 63.5 years, range 26-95 years; 41/106 women, 38.7%). Median duration of symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 5 days (range 1-30) and 4.94 mg/L (range 0.1-28.3), respectively. Median VoD was 249.5 cm3 (range 9.9-1505) and was predicted by lymphocyte percentage (p = 0.008) and CRP (p < 0.001). Important variables for outcome prediction included CRP (area under the curve [AUC] 0.77), VoD (AUC 0.75), age (AUC 0.72), lymphocyte percentage (AUC 0.70), coronary calcification (AUC 0.68), and presence of comorbidities (AUC 0.66). Support vector machine had the best performance in outcome prediction, yielding an AUC of 0.92. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the VoD using a simple CT post-processing tool estimates SARS-CoV-2 burden.

It is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates in this group as soon as a vaccine is available. As future healthcare providers, they will be entrusted with providing vaccine recommendations and counseling vaccine-hesitant patients. METHODS: This project used self-report to assess vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among medical students towards the novel COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Nearly all participants had positive attitudes towards vaccines and agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19; however, only 53% indicated they would participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and 23% were unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine immediately upon FDA approval. Students willing to immediately take the vaccine were more likely to trust public health experts, have fewer concerns about side effects and agree with vaccine mandates (P < 0.05). Concern for serious side effects was independently predictive of lower odds of intent to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR = 0.41, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US medical students and highlights the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Lucia, Victoria C; Kelekar, Arati; Afonso, Nelia M",J. public health (Oxf),,428

258666,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 inpatients who underwent psychiatric consultations,2021,"COVID-19, the disease induced by the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has imposed an unpredictable burden on the world. Drug repurposing has been employed to rapidly find a cure; but despite great efforts, no drug or vaccine is presently available for treating or prevention of COVID-19. Apart from antivirals, immunotherapeutic strategies are suggested considering the role of the immune response as the host defense against the virus, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses interferon induction as an immune evasion strategy. Active immunization through vaccines, interferon administration, passive immunotherapy by convalescent plasma or synthesized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, are different immunotherapeutic approaches that will be mentioned in this review. The focus would be on passive immunotherapeutic interventions. Interferons might be helpful in some stages. Vaccine development has been followed with unprecedented speed. Some of these vaccines have been advanced to human clinical trials. Convalescent plasma therapy is already practiced in many countries to help save the lives of severely ill patients. Different antibodies that target various steps of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or the associated immune responses are also proposed. For treating the cytokine storm induced at a late stage of the disease in some patients, immune modulation through JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, and some other cognate classes are evaluated. Given the changing pattern of cytokine induction and immune responses throughout the COVID-19 disease course, different adapted approaches are needed to help patients. Gaining more knowledge about the detailed pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, its interplay with the immune system, and viral-mediated responses are crucial to identify efficient preventive and therapeutic approaches. A systemic approach seems essential in this regard.","Owji, Hajar; Negahdaripour, Manica; Hajighahramani, Nasim",Int Immunopharmacol,,428
258693,Deadly Companions: COVID-19 and Diabetes in Mexico,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Skin care products are often utilized in conjunction with topical treatment for skin disease. However, these appears insufficient body of experimental data to advise the health care worker or patient. Examine penetration effect (hence potential for altering efficacy and toxicity) - dosing with one topical after another and how quickly such a potential phenomenon might occur. METHODS: A marketed moisturizer applied on human skin with an in vitro diffusion system. At 1, 15, and 30 min post application, [14C]-benzoic acid dosed the same skin site for 24 h. Amounts of chemical retained in skin and permeation flux rats were measured to determine penetration effect of the prior moisturizer application. RESULTS: Exposure of a water-enriched moisturizer before a hydrophilic chemical immediate application favors the chemical penetration, especial in 1 and 15 min moisturizer exposure groups. The enhancement effect was expressed as an earlier lag time and a rapid absorption peak when compared to related non-moisturizer control. CONCLUSION: This experiment opens up a large door: what would be the result with many complex topical products and different tracers was used here, of varying hydrophilicity and lipophilicity. We do not wish to overgeneralize until such studies are confirmed in vivo.","Hui, Xiaoying; Maibach, Howard",J Dermatolog Treat,,428

260481,Disparities in the recovery from critical illness due to COVID-19,2020,"A virus that can cause a global pandemic must be highly adaptive to human conditions. Such adaptation is not likely to have emerged suddenly but, instead, may have evolved step by step with each step favored by natural selection. It is thus necessary to develop a theory about the origin in order to guide the search. Here, we propose such a model whereby evolution occurs in both the virus and the hosts (where the evolution is somatic; i.e., in the immune system). The hosts comprise three groups - the wild animal hosts, the nearby human population, and farther-away human populations. The theory suggests that the conditions under which the pandemic has initially evolved are: (i) an abundance of wild animals in the place of origin (PL0); (ii) a nearby human population of low density; (iii) frequent and long-term animal-human contacts to permit step-by-step evolution; and (iv) a level of herd immunity in the animal and human hosts. In this model, the evolving virus may have regularly spread out of PL0 although such invasions often fail, leaving sporadic cases of early infections. The place of the first epidemic (PL1), where humans are immunologically naïve to the virus, is likely a distance away from PL0. Finally, this current model is only a first attempt and more theoretical models can be expected to guide the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.","Ruan, Yongsen; Wen, Haijun; He, Xionglei; Wu, Chung-I",,,428

In the light of few cases recorded so far in West Africa there is tendency for complacency. The region needs to make strategic plans based on available evidence to enable them effectively deal with this rapidly evolving pandemic. At this very moment countries like China, Italy, France, Spain, Iran, UK and many others are witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus and increasing numbers of severe disease and death particularly among elderly patients with other comorbidities. The reality of the seriousness of this pandemic is alarming. Government of member states of ECOWAS need to prepare themselves by building capacity as well as implement evidenced-based steps to mitigate this rapidly evolving pandemic by testing persons presenting with symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath), isolating and treating those found positive, tracing and quarantining contacts, implementing social distancing as well as optimizing human and material endowment to allow healthcare workers offer safe quality clinical care for affected patients to prevent secondary infection among healthcare workers.","Erhabor, O; Erhabor, T; Adias, T C; Okara, G C; Retsky, M",Hum. antibodies,,428

A web-based survey was distributed twice to all Norwegian shelters (N = 46): first during the lockdown in spring 2020 and second during the relaxation of infection control measures in summer 2020. The shelters in Norway remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority saw a reduction in the number of requests during the lockdown, while the rates returned to normal when the strictest infection control measures were lifted. They expressed concern about the decline in requests during the lockdown as well as the well-being of some groups, such as victims from ethnic minority backgrounds, children, and victims with additional challenges. A majority of the shelters did not report changes in the content of the requests. Nevertheless, a third of them had observed instances of the virus and/or infection control measures being used by perpetrators as part of the violence and coercive control strategies. The shelters in Norway, as an integrated part of the welfare state, in general seem to have met the needs of their clients during the pandemic. Yet, the study revealed important inequalities and deficiencies in access to services for some groups, and in the general support and recognition by authorities of the shelters.","Bergman, Solveig; Bjørnholt, Margunn; Helseth, Hannah",J Fam Violence,,428

In a cohort of 100 patients with cancer who were hospitalized for COVID-19, patients with hematologic cancer had higher mortality relative to patients with solid cancer. In two additional cohorts, flow cytometric and serologic analyses demonstrated that patients with solid cancer and patients without cancer had a similar immune phenotype during acute COVID-19, whereas patients with hematologic cancer had impairment of B cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses. Despite the impaired humoral immunity and high mortality in patients with hematologic cancer who also have COVID-19, those with a greater number of CD8 T cells had improved survival, including those treated with anti-CD20 therapy. Furthermore, 77% of patients with hematologic cancer had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. Thus, CD8 T cells might influence recovery from COVID-19 when humoral immunity is deficient. These observations suggest that CD8 T cell responses to vaccination might provide protection in patients with hematologic cancer even in the setting of limited humoral responses.","Bange, Erin M; Han, Nicholas A; Wileyto, Paul; Kim, Justin Y; Gouma, Sigrid; Robinson, James; Greenplate, Allison R; Hwee, Madeline A; Porterfield, Florence; Owoyemi, Olutosin; Naik, Karan; Zheng, Cathy; Galantino, Michael; Weisman, Ariel R; Ittner, Caroline A G; Kugler, Emily M; Baxter, Amy E; Oniyide, Olutwatosin; Agyekum, Roseline S; Dunn, Thomas G; Jones, Tiffanie K; Giannini, Heather M; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Babady, N Esther; Kumar, Anita; Widman, Adam J; DeWolf, Susan; Boutemine, Sawsan R; Roberts, Charlotte; Budzik, Krista R; Tollett, Susan; Wright, Carla; Perloff, Tara; Sun, Lova; Mathew, Divij; Giles, Josephine R; Oldridge, Derek A; Wu, Jennifer E; Alanio, Cécile; Adamski, Sharon; Garfall, Alfred L; Vella, Laura A; Kerr, Samuel J; Cohen, Justine V; Oyer, Randall A; Massa, Ryan; Maillard, Ivan P; Maxwell, Kara N; Reilly, John P",Nat. med,,428
264511,Assessment of burnout among primary teachers in confinement during the covid-19 period in morocco: Case of the kenitra,2020,"Little is known about genetic and epigenetic alterations in autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, the efficiency of DNA repair in autism must be improved to correct these alterations. We examined whether 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) could reverse these alterations. We conducted experiments to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying these ameliorations. An assessment of genetic and epigenetic alterations by a modified comet assay showed elevated levels of oxidative DNA strand breaks and DNA hypermethylation in BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice used as a model of autism. Oxidative DNA strand breaks and DNA methylation were further quantified fluorometrically, and the results showed similar changes. Conversely, 3-AB treated BTBR mice showed a significant reduction in these alterations compared with untreated mice. The expressions of 43 genes involved in DNA repair were altered in BTBR mice. RT2 Profiler PCR Array revealed significantly altered expression of seven genes, which was confirmed by RT-PCR analyses. 3-AB treatment relieved these disturbances and significantly improved Ogg1 and Rad1 up-regulation. Moreover, autism-like behaviors were also mitigated in BTBR animals by 3-AB treatment without alterations in locomotor activities. The simultaneous effects of reduced DNA damage and DNA methylation levels as well as the regulation of repair gene expression indicate the potential of 3-AB as a therapeutic agent to decrease the levels of DNA damage and DNA methylation in autistic patients. The current data may help in the development of therapies that ultimately provide a better quality of life for individuals suffering from autism.","Attia, S M; Ahmad, S F; Nadeem, A; Attia, M S M; Ansari, M A; As Sobeai, H M; Al-Mazroua, H A; Alasmari, A F; Bakheet, S A",Pharmacol Biochem Behav,,428

265953,Covid-19 pandemic and pregnancy,2020,"Inspired by the competition exclusion principle, this work aims at providing a computational framework to explore the theoretical feasibility of viral co-infection as a possible strategy to reduce the spread of a fatal strain in a population. We propose a stochastic-based model-called Co-Wish-to understand how competition between two viruses over a shared niche can affect the spread of each virus in infected tissue. To demonstrate the co-infection of two viruses, we first simulate the characteristics of two virus growth processes separately. Then, we examine their interactions until one can dominate the other. We use Co-Wish to explore how the model varies as the parameters of each virus growth process change when two viruses infect the host simultaneously. We will also investigate the effect of the delayed initiation of each infection. Moreover, Co-Wish not only examines the co-infection at the cell level but also includes the innate immune response during viral infection. The results highlight that the waiting times in the five stages of the viral infection of a cell in the model-namely attachment, penetration, eclipse, replication, and release-play an essential role in the competition between the two viruses. While it could prove challenging to fully understand the therapeutic potentials of viral co-infection, we discuss that our theoretical framework hints at an intriguing research direction in applying co-infection dynamics in controlling any viral outbreak's speed.","Vafadar, Safar; Shahdoust, Maryam; Kalirad, Ata; Zakeri, Pooya; Sadeghi, Mehdi",PLoS One,,428

266721,Clinical characteristics and humoral immune response in Healthcare Workers with COVID-19 in a Teaching Hospital in Belgium,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, clinical efficacy, and safety of nelfinavir in patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: The study is designed as a multicenter, open-label, blinded outcome assessment, parallel group, investigator-initiated, exploratory, randomized (1:1 ratio) controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients will be enrolled in 10 university and teaching hospitals in Japan. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria: (1) Japanese male or female patients aged &#8805; 20 years (2) SARS-CoV-2 detected from a respiratory tract specimen (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab or saliva) using PCR, LAMP, or an antigen test within 3 days before obtaining the informed consent (3) Provide informed consent Exclusion criteria: (1) Symptoms developed &#8805; 8 days prior to enrolment (2) SpO2 < 96 % (room air) (3) Any of the following screening criteria: a) ALT or AST &#8805; 5 × upper limit of the reference range b) Child-Pugh class B or C c) Serum creatinine &#8805; 2 × upper limit of the reference range and creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (4) Poorly controlled diabetes (random blood glucose &#8805; 200 mg/dL or HbA1c &#8805; 7.0%, despite treatment) (5) Unsuitable serious complications based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator (6) Hemophiliac or patients with a marked hemorrhagic tendency (7) Severe diarrhea (8) Hypersensitivity to the investigational drug (9) Breastfeeding or pregnancy (10) With childbearing potential and rejecting contraceptive methods during the study period from the initial administration of the investigational drug (11) Receiving rifampicin within the previous 2 weeks (12) Participated in other clinical trials and received drugs within the previous 12 weeks (13) Undergoing treatment for HIV infection (14) History of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or wishes to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (15) Deemed inappropriate (for miscellaneous reasons) based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group. The nelfinavir group will be administered 750 mg of nelfinavir orally, three times daily for 14 days (treatment period). However, if a participant tests negative on two consecutive PCR tests of saliva samples, administration of the investigational drug for that participant can be discontinued at the discretion of the investigators. The symptomatic treatment group will not be administered the investigational drug, but all other study procedures and conditions will be the same for both groups for the duration of the treatment period. After the treatment period of 14 days, each group will be followed up for 14 days (observational period). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2. During the study period from Day 1 to Day 28, two consecutive negative PCR results of saliva samples will be considered as the negative conversion of the virus. The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: For patients with both asymptomatic and mild disease: area under the curve of viral load, half decay period of viral load, body temperature at each time point, all-cause mortality, incidence rate of pneumonia, percentage of patients with newly developed pneumonia, rate of oxygen administration, and the percentage of patients who require oxygen administration. For asymptomatic patients: incidence of symptomatic COVID-19, incidence of fever (&#8805; 37.0 °C for two consecutive days), incidence of cough For patients with mild disease: incidence of defervescence (< 37.0 °C), incidence of recovery from clinical symptoms, incidence of improvement of each symptom The secondary safety endpoints are adverse events and clinical examinations. RANDOMIZATION: Patients will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group using the electric data capture system (1:1 ratio, dynamic allocation based on severity [asymptomatic], and age [< 60 years]). BLINDING (MASKING): Only the assessors of the primary outcome will be blinded (blinded outcome assessment). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size was determined based on our power analysis to reject the null hypothesis, S (t | z =1) = S (t | z = 0) where S is a survival function, t is time to negative conversion, and z denotes randomization group, by the log-rank test with a two-sided p value of 0.05. We estimated viral dynamic parameters by fitting a nonlinear mixed-effects model to reported viral load data, and simulated our primary endpoint from viral-load time-courses that were realized from sets of viral dynamics parameters sampled from the estimated probability distribution of the parameters (sample size: 2000; 1000 each for randomization group). From this estimation of the hazard ratio between the randomization groups for the event of negative conversion using this simulation dataset, the required number of events for rejecting our null hypothesis with a power of 0.80 felled 97.345 by plugging the estimated hazard ratio, 1.79, in Freedman's equation. Therefore, we decided the required number of randomizations to be 120 after consideration of the frequency of censoring and the anticipated rate of withdrawal caused by factors such as withdrawal of consent. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 6.0 of February 12, 2021. Recruitment started on July 22, 2020 and is anticipated to be completed by March 31, 2022.

The PTEW will use a Check List divided into 3 macro phases: Entry, Activity Context, and Exit, defining each behavior of the work phases with a constant presence of verification of the procedures. The PTEW will be a Leader on the topics of education, training, and persuasion, considering a New Principle that ""transforms the worker as active part in the application and diffusion of the safety measures"".","Wachocka, Malgorzata; Pattavina, Fabio; Palluzzi, Vincenzo; Cerabona, Vito; Laurenti, Patrizia",Front Public Health,,428
267670,COVID-19 versus seasonal influenza 2019-2020: USA,2020,"We investigate the effect of school closure and subsequent reopening on the transmission of COVID-19, by considering Denmark, Norway, Sweden and German states as case studies. By comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalizations or confirmed cases under different interventions, we provide evidence that school closures contribute to a reduction in the growth rate approximately 7 days after implementation. Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. In countries where community transmission is generally low, such as Denmark or Norway, a large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible. However, school reopening can contribute to statistically significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high. In all regions, a combination of low classroom occupancy and robust test-and-trace measures were in place. Our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies.

We take advantage of the increasing mobile phone penetration rate in rural areas to evaluate the feasibility of using cell phones to monitor the provision of key health and nutrition interventions linked to the first 1,000 days of life, a critical period of growth and development. We examine response rates to calendarized text messages (SMS) and phone calls sent to 1,542 households over a period of four months. These households have children under two years old and pregnant women and are located across randomly selected communities in Quiche, Guatemala. We find that the overall (valid) response rate to phone calls is over 5 times higher than to text messages (75.8% versus 14.4%). We also test whether simple SMS reminders improve the timely reception of health services but do not find any effects in this regard. Language, education, and age appear to be major barriers to respond to text messages as opposed to phone calls, and the rate of response is not correlated with a household's geographic location (accessibility). Moreover, response veracity is high, with an 84-91% match between household responses and administrative records. The costs per monitored intervention are around 1.12 US dollars using text messages and 85 cents making phone calls, with the costs per effective answer showing a starker contrast, at 7.76 and 1.12 US dollars, respectively. Our findings indicate that mobile phone calls can be an effective, low-cost tool to collect reliable information remotely and in real time. In the current context, where in-person contact with households is not possible due to the COVID-19 crisis, phone calls can be a valuable instrument for collecting information, monitoring development interventions, or implementing brief surveys.","Ceballos, Francisco; Hernandez, Manuel Alejandro; Olivet, Francisco; Paz, Cynthia",PLoS One,,428

SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease associated with multiple organ damage. Cancer patients have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death. While the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary entry receptor, the recent experimental and clinical findings suggest that some tumor markers, including CD147 (basigin), can provide an additional entry for SARS-CoV-2 infection through binding to the viral spike (S) protein. In the absence of specific viral drugs, blocking of CD147 might be a way to prevent virus invasion. Identifying other target proteins is of high importance as targeting the alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 might open up a promising avenue for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, including those who have cancer.","Xia, Pu; Dubrovska, Anna",FEBS j,,428

Other reasons include the risk of transmission of infections, lack of resources, and the scarcity of anesthesiologists due to their diversion to intensive care units to manage COVID-19 patients. However, ECT is an urgent and life-saving measure for patients diagnosed with depression and other severe mental illnesses who have suicidality, catatonia, or require a rapid therapeutic response. COVID-19 pandemic is a significant source of stress for individuals due to its impact on health, employment, and social support resulting in new-onset psychiatric illnesses and the worsening of a pre-existing disorder. Hence, a continuation of the ECT services during the COVID-19 pandemic is of paramount importance. In this narrative review, the authors from India have compiled the literature on the ECT practice during the COVID-19 pandemic related to the screening and testing protocol, necessity of personal protective equipment, modification in ECT Suite, electrical stmulus settings, and anesthesia technique modification. The authors have also shared their experiences with the ECT services provided at their institute during this pandemic.

After resolution of the respiratory disease, the patient developed focal neurology and was found to have bilateral occipital, thalamic and cerebellar infarcts. A diagnosis of COVID-19 central nervous system vasculopathy was made. He developed a florid neuropsychiatric syndrome, including paranoia, irritability, aggression and disinhibition, requiring treatment with antipsychotics and transfer to neurorehabilitation. Neuropsychometry revealed a wide range of cognitive deficits. The rapid evolution of the illness was matched by fast resolution of the neuropsychiatric picture with mild residual cognitive impairment.","Chia, Kai Xin; Polakhare, Sonali; Bruno, Stefania Dafne",BMJ case reports,,428

OBJECTIVES: To assess the perception and attitudes of medical students about clinical clerkship training during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey with web-based 3-fields/14-items questionnaire was conducted, from April 7 to 14, 2020, to evaluate their self-assessed perception and attitudes on clerkship training of hospital practice under the COVID-19 outbreak and spread among 161 (78 on pre-clerkship course, 83 on clinical clerkship course) medical students at Dankook University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Republic of Korea. RESULTS: Of the 151 medical students who completed the survey, 81 students (53.7%) considered themselves familiar with COVID-19. Although the students were concerned about the spread of the virus during clinical clerkship training, 118 (78.1%) students preferred the clerkship training in a hospital practice. The students in the clinical clerkship program preferred this over those in the pre-clerkship program (85.7% vs. 70.2%, P = 0.03), primarily because a clinical clerkship could not be replaced by an online class during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, their responses indicated, in order of significance, fear of not completing the clerkship course on time, willingness to participate as a preliminary healthcare provider in pandemic, the potential waste of tuition, and belief that a hospital is rather safe. The change in the academic calendar had not a positive impact on the lifestyles of many students. CONCLUSIONS: In circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, educational strategies to clinical clerkship training for medical students should be developed to provide them with the opportunity to be actively involved in hospital practice under strict safety guidance focused on preventing virus infection and transmission.","Kim, So Mi; Park, Seok Gun; Jee, Young Koo; Song, Il Han",Med Educ Online,,428

Since the start of the 2019 pandemic several reverse zoonotic outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred in mink, one of which reinfected humans and caused a cluster of infections in Denmark. Here we investigate the molecular basis of mink and ferret adaptation and demonstrate the spike mutations Y453F, F486L, and N501T all specifically adapt SARS-CoV-2 to use mustelid ACE2. Furthermore, we risk assess these mutations and conclude mink-adapted viruses are unlikely to pose an increased threat to humans, as Y453F attenuates the virus replication in human cells and all 3 mink-adaptations have minimal antigenic impact. Finally, we show that certain SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging from circulation in humans may naturally have a greater propensity to infect mustelid hosts and therefore these species should continue to be surveyed for reverse zoonotic infections.","Zhou, Jie; Peacock, Thomas P; Brown, Jonathan C; Goldhill, Daniel H.; Elrefaey, Ahmed M.E.; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Cowton, Vanessa M.; Lorenzo, Giuditta De; Furnon, Wilhelm; Harvey, William T.; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Frise, Rebecca; Baillon, Laury; Lassauniere, Ria; Thakur, Nazia; Gallo, Giulia; Goldswain, Hannah; Dong, Xiaofeng; Randle, Nadine P.; Sweeney, Fiachra; Glynn, Martha C.; Quantrill, Jessica L.; McKay, Paul F.; Patel, Arvind H.; Palmarini, Massimo; Hiscox, Julian A.; Bailey, Dalan; Barclay, Wendy S.",,,428

Furthermore, particular attention was paid to the existence of any differences between male and female nurses to evaluate whether the variables considered can be influenced by the gender variable. Design: A cohort case-report study was carry out. Sample: All Italian nurses who were at front line in the care of the Covid-19 patients were involved. Measurement: The on line questionnaire collected data as regards: gender and years of work experience;the Maslach Burnout Inventory questionnaire (MBI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Results: Certainly the experience of the pandemic was very emotional for nurses engaged in the front line in the care of Covid-19 patients. However, anxiety and depression levels turned out to be normal, while some nurses experienced them in the dimensions of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization of the burnout rating scale. Conclusion: The practical implication was the implementation of support policies for nurses in tackling the problem of burnout more than that of anxiety or depression.","Vitale, Elsa Casolaro Salvatrice",Journal of Evidence - Based Psychotherapies,,428
275600,"Behind This Face Shield, I See You",2020,"The clinical symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia are similar. Effective predictive markers are needed to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from CAP in the current pandemic conditions. Copeptin, a 39-aminoacid glycopeptide, is a C-terminal part of the precursor pre-provasopressin (pre-proAVP). The activation of the AVP system stimulates copeptin secretion in equimolar amounts with AVP. This study aims to determine serum copeptin levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19 pneumonia and to analyze the power of copeptin in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia. The study consists of 98 patients with COVID-19 and 44 patients with CAP. The basic demographic and clinical data of all patients were recorded, and blood samples were collected. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Serum copeptin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to CAP patients (10.2 ± 4.4 ng/ml and 7.1 ± 3.1 ng/ml; p < .001). Serum copeptin levels were positively correlated with leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet count (r = -.21, p = .012; r = -.21, p = .013; r = -.20, p = .018; respectively). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increased copeptin (odds ratio [OR] = 1.183, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.354; p = .015) and CK-MB (OR = 1.052, 95% CI, 1.013-1.092; p = .008) levels and decreased leukocyte count (OR = 0.829, 95% CI, 0.730-0.940; p = .004) were independent predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia. A cut-off value of 6.83 ng/ml for copeptin predicted COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 73% (AUC: 0.764% 95 Cl: 0.671-0.856, p < .001). Copeptin could be a promising and useful biomarker to be used to distinguish COVID-19 patients from CAP patients.","Kuluöztürk, Mutlu; In, Erdal; Telo, Selda; Karabulut, Ercan; Geçkil, Aysegül Altintop",J Med Virol,,428

Many interventions have been developed to reduce and/or eliminate human foodborne pathogens in poultry products; however, treatments with cold plasma or carnosine or a combination of both interventions have not been extensively investigated. In this communication, the bacterial microflora of poultry meat samples after treatments with cold plasma and carnosine were characterized with EcoPlates &#8482; in the OmniLog ® system. The plates were incubated at 25 o C for seven days in the OmniLog ® chamber, and bacterial growth was monitored by recording formazan production every 30 minutes at OD 590 nm . The kinetics of lag, log and stationary phases of the bacterial growth patterns followed the Gompertz sigmoidal model, but with different inflection times and asymptotes at the log phase and the stationary phase, respectively.

279724,Covid-19 and exacerbation of psoriasis,2020,"The WHO has announced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic. The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature and humidity, that is, similar to the behaviour of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern mid-latitude countries with an average temperature of 5­11°C and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in Europe. Regardless of age, ethnicity and latitude, recent data showed that 40 % of Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/l), and 13 % are severely deficient (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l). A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and mid-latitude countries than the tropical and high-latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia 46 %; Qatar 46 %; Iran 33·4 %; Chile 26·4 %) and mid-latitude (France 27·3 %; Portugal 21·2 %; Austria 19·3 %) regions. Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0 % in some high-latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands). Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.","Kara, Murat; Ekiz, Timur; Ricci, Vincenzo; Kara, Özgür; Chang, Ke-Vin; Özçakar, Levent",Br J Nutr,,428

Recent Findings: Sudan has recently emerged from a 30-year dictatorship to face the COVID-19 pandemic in the midst of the worst economic crisis. Disease control measures that have been used in developed countries have been difficult to implement in Sudan due to economic, social, and structural challenges. There is a need for integration of data into the disease response plan and for community engagement to help with mitigation efforts. Youth-led community organizations were critical in the success of the Sudanese revolution. Their formal involvement in contact tracing and community awareness campaigns can be beneficial. Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the surface many of the challenges facing the healthcare system in Sudan.

A call for action,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly expanded to a global pandemic. However, numbers of infected cases, deaths, and mortality rates related to COVID-19 vary from country to country. Although many studies were conducted, the reasons of these differences have not been clarified. In this study, we comprehensively investigated 12,343 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from patients/individuals in six geographic areas and identified a total of 1234 mutations by comparing with the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Through a hierarchical clustering based on the mutant frequencies, we classified the 28 countries into three clusters showing different fatality rates of COVID-19. In correlation analyses, we identified that ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants, which are in a strong linkage disequilibrium, showed significant positive correlations with fatality rates (r = 0.41, P = 0.029 and r = 0.43, P = 0.022, respectively). We found that BCG-vaccination status significantly associated with the fatality rates as well as number of infected cases. In BCG-vaccinated countries, the frequency of the S 614G variant had a trend of association with the higher fatality rate. We also found that the frequency of several HLA alleles, including HLA-A*11:01, were significantly associated with the fatality rates, although these factors were associated with number of infected cases and not an independent factor to affect fatality rate in each country. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations as well as BCG-vaccination status and a host genetic factor, HLA genotypes might affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity of COVID-19.","Toyoshima, Yujiro; Nemoto, Kensaku; Matsumoto, Saki; Nakamura, Yusuke; Kiyotani, Kazuma",J Hum Genet,,428

One patient presents with hypercoagulability and the other patient with hypocoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown in thromboelastometry. Pathophysiology and potential impact on treatment options are discussed. Conclusions: Combinations of biomarkers and thromboelastometry results can be helpful in the future to decide which therapeutic strategy might be most appropriate in individual critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Considering the crucial role of microorganisms on soil functions, we aimed to study the effects of 10 mg kg-1 soil of Ag2S NPs or AgNO3 on the soil microbiome, using an indoor mesocosm. After 28 days of exposure, Ag2S NPs induced a significant change in the soil microbiome structure, at class, genera and OTU levels. For instance, a significantly higher abundance of Chitinophagia, known for its lignocellulose-degrading activity, was observed in Ag2S NPs-treated soil toward the control. Nevertheless, stronger effects were observed in AgNO3-treated soil, over time, due to its higher silver dissolution rate in porewater. Additionally, only the AgNO3-treated soil stimulates the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing (AOB; amoA gene) and nitrite-oxidizing (NOB; nxrB gene) bacteria, which are involved in the nitrification process. Distinct variants of amoA and nxrB genes emerged in silver-treated soils, suggesting a potential succession of AOB and NOB with different degree of silver-tolerance. Our study highlights the latter effects of Ag2S NPs on the soil microbiome composition, while AgNO3 exerted a stronger effect in both composition and functional parameters.","Peixoto, Sara; Loureiro, Susana; Henriques, Isabel",J Hazard Mater,,428

Horseshoe bats are a speciose group that exhibit a derived form of high-duty cycle echolocation in which the inner ear is finely tuned to echoes of the narrowband call frequency. Here, by focusing on three recently diverged subspecies of the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) that display divergent echolocation call frequencies, we aim to identify candidate loci putatively involved in hearing frequency variation. We used de novo transcriptome sequencing of two mainland taxa (himalayanus and macrurus) and one island taxon (hainanus) to compare expression profiles of thousands of genes. By comparing taxa with divergent call frequencies (around 15 kHz difference), we identified 252 differentially expressed genes, of which six have been shown to be involved in hearing or deafness in human/mouse. To obtain further validation of these results, we applied quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to the candidate gene FBXL15 and found a broad association between the level of expression and call frequency across taxa. The genes identified here represent strong candidate loci associated with hearing frequency variation in bats.","Sun, Haijian; Chen, Wenli; Wang, Jiaying; Zhang, Libiao; Rossiter, Stephen J; Mao, Xiuguang",Proc Biol Sci,,428
282759,Telemedicine after COVID-19: The Israeli Perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, systemic, progressive, and life-threatening disease in which transthyretin proteins misfold and aggregate as insoluble amyloid deposits, disrupting nervous, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and other organ tissues. There are limited available data about the experience of patients living with hATTR amyloidosis. This study used a qualitative, non-interventional design to explore the humanistic burden of hATTR amyloidosis from the patient's perspective. RESULTS: Fourteen adults with hATTR amyloidosis, recruited from a patient advocacy group or an academic clinical center, participated in individual semi-structured interviews either in person or by telephone. Patients were asked to describe their experiences living with the condition, including symptoms and disease-related impacts on functioning and well-being, work, and activities of daily living (ADLs). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for key concepts using a grounded theory approach. Patients described many symptoms of hATTR amyloidosis, particularly those associated with peripheral neuropathy such as pain, numbness, weakness, and paresthesia. Symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction, and symptoms related to cardiac dysfunction were also common. Worsening symptoms, especially those impacting patients' ability to walk or use their hands, often led to a loss of autonomy and an inability to work or perform ADLs. Disease-related disability also interfered with patients' participation in social activities, and contributed to feelings of fear, frustration, or sadness. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of hATTR amyloidosis were profound for the patients interviewed for this study. They described a sense of loss as their condition progressed and impacted them physically, emotionally, and socially. Patients' reports of symptoms and impacts of hATTR amyloidosis illustrate the complex and varied manifestations of this disease. The progression of symptoms and increasing impacts of hATTR amyloidosis also highlight the need for an earlier diagnosis and effective clinical intervention to preserve patients' functioning and well-being.","Lovley, Andrew; Raymond, Kimberly; Guthrie, Spencer D; Pollock, Michael; Sanchorawala, Vaishali; White, Michelle K",J Patient Rep Outcomes,,428

The objective of this study was to assess short-term adverse events (AEs) of HCQ in HCWs. Methods: This cross-sectional study among consenting HCWs taking prophylaxis and working in hospitals with COVID-19 patients used online forms to collect details of HCWs, comorbidities, prophylactic drugs used and AEs after the first dose of HCQ. Verification of dose and AEs was done by personal contact. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine the effect of age, gender and dose of HCQ on AE. Results: Of the 1303 HCWs included, 98.4 per cent (n=1282) took HCQ and 66 per cent (n=861) took 800 mg as first day's dose. Among the 19.9 per cent (n=259) reporting AEs, 1.5 per cent (n=20) took treatment for AE, none were hospitalized and three discontinued HCQ. Gastrointestinal AEs were the most common (172, 13.2%), with less in older [odds ratio (OR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.89], with more in females (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.78-3.38) and in those taking a total dose of 800 mg on day one compared to a lower dose. Hypoglycaemia (1.1%, n=14), cardiovascular events (0.7%, n=9) and other AEs were minimal. Interpretation & conclusions: HCQ prophylaxis first dose was well tolerated among HCWs as evidenced by a low discontinuation. For adverse effects, a small number required treatment, and none required hospitalization. The study had limitations of convenience sampling and lack of laboratory and electrocardiography confirmation of AEs.","Faruqui, Atiya R; Xavier, Denis; Kamat, Sandhya K; Chandy, Sujith J; Medhi, Bikash; Tripathi, Raakhi K; Shetty, Yashashri C; Raj, John Michael; Kaushal, Sandeep; Balakrishnan, S; Atal, Shubham; Tripathi, Santanu K; Badyal, Dinesh K; Dikshit, Harihar; Roy, Sukalyan Saha; Trivedi, Niyati; Chatterjee, Suparna; Desai, Chetna; Tripathi, C D; Rege, Nirmala N; Gupta, Pooja; Raveendran, R; Kaul, Rajni; Kshirsagar, Nilima A",Indian J Med Res,,428

Kits I-IV approved by the State Drug Administration of China were selected, and the detection targets were ORF1ab gene and N gene. Specificity was evaluated by detecting other respiratory viruses. The sensitivity and batch effect of each kit were evaluated by testing 10-fold dilutions of RNA. Clinical application was verified by testing nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens from COVID-19 patients. Among the 78 cases infected by other respiratory viruses, no amplification curve was observed using these four COVID-19 RT-PCR kits. The minimum detection limits of kits I-IV were 10-6 , 10-5 , 10-5 , and 10-6 dilutions, respectively, and concentrations were 10 copies/mL (10-5 dilution) and 1 copies/mL (10-6 dilution). The sensitivities of kits I-IV detected using 142 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients were 91.55%, 81.69%, 80.28%, and 90.85%, respectively, while they were 92.68%, 85.37%, 82.93%, and 93.90%, respectively, for the 82 sputum samples. The specificity of each kit was 100.00% (77/77). The total expected detection rate using sputum samples was 88.59% (691/780) higher than 86.15% (672/780) of nasopharyngeal swabs. Comparison of nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples from the same COVID-19 patient led to the detection of ORF1ab and N genes in 16 (100%) sputum samples; only ORF1ab and N genes were detected in 12 (75%) and 14 (87.5%) nasopharyngeal swab specimens, respectively. In conclusion, comparison of commercial COVID-19 RT-PCR kits should be performed before using a new batch of such kits in routine diagnostics.","Shen, Lingyu; Cui, Shujuan; Zhang, Daitao; Lin, Changying; Chen, Lijuan; Wang, Quanyi",J Clin Lab Anal,,428

COVID-19 cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes.ResultsWe analysed a cohort of 6,746 patients (80% female) with active prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and 13,492 controls. During follow-up, there were 97 (1.4%) COVID-19 cases in the exposed cohort and 183 (1.4%) among controls. The incidence rate was very similar between the two groups (12.05 vs 11.35 cases/100,000 person-days). The exposed cohort was not at lower risk of infection compared with controls (hazard ratio (HR): 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-1.44; p = 0.50). Forty cases (0.6%) were admitted to hospital in the exposed cohort and 50 (0.4%) in the control cohort, suggesting a higher hospitalisation rate in the former, though differences were not confirmed after adjustment (HR: 1·46; 95% CI: 0.91-2.34; p = 0.10).ConclusionsPatients chronically exposed to chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine did not differ in risk of COVID-19 nor hospitalisation, compared with controls.

They are metabolized to the active ribonucleoside triphosphate form and concentrate in the genomes of RNA viruses during viral replication. ß-D-N 4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, the initial metabolite of molnupiravir) is more than 100-fold more active than ribavirin or favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2, with antiviral activity correlated to the level of mutagenesis in virion RNA. However, NHC also displays host mutational activity in an animal cell culture assay, consistent with RNA and DNA precursors sharing a common intermediate of a ribonucleoside diphosphate. These results indicate that highly active mutagenic ribonucleosides may hold risk for the host.","Zhou, Shuntai; Hill, Collin S; Sarkar, Sanjay; Tse, Longping V; Woodburn, Blaide M D; Schinazi, Raymond F; Sheahan, Timothy P; Baric, Ralph S; Heise, Mark T; Swanstrom, Ronald",J. infect. dis,,428
286982,Investigating decreased rates of nulliparous Cesarean deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Human coronaviruses (hCoVs) have become a threat to global health and society, as evident from the SARS outbreak in 2002 caused by SARS-CoV-1 and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite a high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, each strain has a distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein interactions of two hCoV nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43-an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologues from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identify nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response associated proteins, and antiviral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4 interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondria-associated ER membranes suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from SARS strains. Our mass spectrometry workflow enables rapid and robust comparisons of multiple bait proteins, which can be applied to additional viral proteins. Furthermore, the identified common interactions may present new targets for exploration by host-directed antiviral therapeutics.","Davies, Jonathan P; Almasy, Katherine M; McDonald, Eli F; Plate, Lars",ACS Infect Dis,,428

291769,Coping with Dementia in the Middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The surface water resources in the Meriç-Ergene River Basin, especially Ergene River and Çorlu Stream are among the most polluted rivers in Turkey. Despite the action plans for prevention and control of surface water pollution in the basin, the desired results have not been achieved. However, the implementation of a nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 might probably lead to an improvement in the surface water quality. We evaluated the impact of the lockdown on water quality by measuring the levels of physico-chemical variables and metal(loid)s in water samples taken from 25 sampling stations in the basin. BOD, COD, EC, turbidity, TSS and Mn levels did not show significant differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods due to the ongoing domestic wastewater discharges and agricultural activities in the basin during the lockdown period. However, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Pb and Cd concentrations decreased considerably during the lockdown. Similarly, heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index values showed a significant improvement in water quality of almost all stations during the lockdown period. Also, total hazard index values for children and adults reduced by 67% and 69%, respectively during the lockdown period, while total carcinogenic risk values for As and Cr reduced by 60% and 94%, respectively. The limited operational status of most industrial facilities in the basin during the lockdown reduced the amount of industrial effluents, leading to significant improvement in surface water quality for metal(loid)s. The lockdown has shown that the solution for preservation and sustainability of natural water resources lies in our hands, and the efficient management of pollution sources can prevent surface water pollution at a very rapid pace. Finally, we suggest that water management policy needs to be improved and implemented.","Tokatli, Cem; Varol, Memet",Environ Res,,428

In March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 spread to Venezuela and Ecuador. The basic reproduction number (R0 ) is a value that allows measuring the transmission rate of a virus. The SIR model is the simplest compartmental epidemiological model (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered). The SIR model can be used to estimate R0 by fitting the curve of the infected compartment to the experimental curve of infected subjects per day. This work aims to study the projection of the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in Venezuela and Ecuador. For this purpose, five experiments took place by adjusting the SIR model curve of the infected compartment to experimental data at five-time intervals (the first 14, 28, 42, 56, and 178 days for Ecuador data and 165 days for Venezuela data). The R0 fell from 6.923 to 1.003 (between experiments 2 and 3) for Venezuelan data, and from 3.622 to 1.022 (between experiments 1 and 2) for Ecuadorian data. These differences imply that R0 depends on the preventive measures implemented to face the pandemic. On the other hand, the number of infections in Ecuador is higher compared to the infection numbers in Venezuela in each experiment. Venezuela is experiencing a complex economic crisis that limits the ability of its citizens to mobilize due to the lack of gasoline, monetary liquidity, and failures in basics services, suggesting that the economic activity of the countries will also influence the number of infections. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","La Cruz, A.; Severeyn, E.; Velásquez, J.; Herrera, H.; Wong, S.",Adv.

METHODS: the affinity scores of the spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) of B.1.1.7, B. 1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants in interaction with the neutralizing antibody (CV30 isolated from a patient), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor were predicted using the template-based computational modeling. From the Nextstrain global database, we identified prevalent mutations of S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019 to April 2021. Pre- and post-vaccination time series forecasting models were developed based on the prediction of neutralizing antibody affinity scores for S-RBD of the variants. RESULTS: the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant in North America is growing rapidly, but the rate will reduce due to high affinity (~90%) to the neutralizing antibody once herd immunity is reached. Currently, the rates of isolation of B. 1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants are slowly increasing in North America. Herd immunity is able to relatively control these variants due to their low affinity (~70%) to the neutralizing antibody. The S-RBD of B.1.617 has a 110% increased affinity score to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) in comparison to the wild-type structure, making it highly infectious. CONCLUSION: The newly emerged B.1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants escape from vaccine-induced neutralizing immunity and continue circulating in North America in post- herd immunity era. Our study strongly suggests that a third dose of vaccine is urgently needed to cover novel variants with affinity scores (equal or less than 70%) to eliminate developing viral mutations and reduce transmission rates.","Quinonez, Elena; Vahed, Majid; Hashemi Shahraki, Abdolrazagh; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi",Viruses,,428

296376,Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for COVID-19 in Pregnant Women,2021,"To stop the COVID-19 pandemic due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused more than 2.5 million deaths to date, new antiviral molecules are urgently needed. The replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), making RdRp an excellent target for antiviral agents. RdRp is a multi-subunit complex composed of 3 viral proteins named nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 that ensure the ~30 kb RNA genome's transcription and replication. The main strategies employed so far for the overproduction of RdRp consist of expressing and purifying the three subunits separately before assembling the complex in vitro. However, nsp12 shows limited solubility in bacterial expression systems and is often produced in insect cells. Here, we describe an alternative strategy to co-express the full SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in E. coli, using a single plasmid. Characterization of the purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RdRp shows that it forms a complex with the expected (nsp7)(nsp8)2(nsp12) stoichiometry. RNA polymerization activity was measured using primer-extension assays showing that the purified enzyme is functional. The purification protocol can be achieved in one single day, surpassing in speed all other published protocols. Our construct is ideally suited for screening RdRp and its variants against very large chemical compounds libraries and has been made available to the scientific community through the Addgene plasmid depository (Addgene ID: 165451).","Madru, Clément; Tekpinar, Ayten Dizkirici; Rosario, Sandrine; Czernecki, Dariusz; Brûlé, Sébastien; Sauguet, Ludovic; Delarue, Marc",PLoS One,,428

The distribution of thromboembolic events included upper 7 (14%) and lower 35 (71%) extremity ischemia, bowel ischemia 2 (4%), and cerebral ischemia 5 (10%). Six patients (12%) had thrombus in multiple locations. Concomitant deep vein thrombosis was found in 8 patients (16%). Twenty-two (45%) patients presented with signs of acute arterial ischemia and were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The remaining 27 (55%) developed ischemia during hospitalization. Revascularization was performed in 13 (27%) patients, primary amputation in 5 (10%), administration of systemic tissue- plasminogen activator in 3 (6%), and 28 (57%) were treated with systemic anticoagulation only. The rate of limb loss was 18%. Twenty-one patients (46%) died in the hospital. Twenty-five (51%) were successfully discharged, and 3 patients are still in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: While the mechanism of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear, the occurrence of such complication is associated with acute arterial ischemia which results in a high limb loss and mortality.","Etkin, Yana; Conway, Allan M; Silpe, Jeffrey; Qato, Khalil; Carroccio, Alfio; Manvar-Singh, Pallavi; Giangola, Gary; Deitch, Jonathan S; Davila-Santini, Luis; Schor, Jonathan A; Singh, Kuldeep; Mussa, Firas F; Landis, Gregg S",Ann. vasc. surg,,428

297714,Burnout and work-related stressors in gastroenterology: a protocol for a multinational observational study in the ASEAN region,2020,"Octreotide acetate (octreotide) is the most prescribed and most studied somatostatin congener, or analog, for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and carcinoid syndrome, the latter of which may be characterized by debilitating diarrhea and flushing. Approved in the U.S. more than 30 years ago, octreotide is widely used to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and has been shown to demonstrate antiproliferative activity. The two formulations available in the U.S. include a subcutaneous immediate-release (IR) injection introduced in 1989 and a long-acting repeatable (LAR) intramuscular injection approved in 1999. Lanreotide depot (lanreotide), a more recent somatostatin congener, has been available in the U.S. since 2014. Despite widespread use of octreotide LAR, several key challenges exist with the current depot-based treatment paradigm. Studies indicate that LAR formulations are associated with continued unmet patient needs, owing in part to a loss of bioactivity over time that may necessitate progressive supplemental treatment with IR octreotide to adequately control symptoms. Clinicians should understand the key differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of the LAR and IR formulations that may contribute to bioactivity loss and somatostatin receptor desensitization. In addition, there is a need to re-evaluate the role of IR octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms. The purpose of this review is to explore all these issues and to re-establish a rationale for the IR formulation, particularly with respect to novel use cases and its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: There is a need to re-evaluate the role of immediate-release octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms.","Anthony, Lowell B; O039,; Dorisio, Thomas M",Oncologist,,428

Is it still ethically acceptable to use placebo controls during the development of other vaccine options? If two of the most influential international guidelines of biomedical research are consulted, the Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS-guidelines, the answer is ""no"". We discuss the implications for ongoing vaccine research, and how placebo controls might be justified nevertheless. However, the ethical conflict remains highly problematic. We suggest that such ethical dilemmas should be avoided in the future by the introduction of a new system of global governance. Once vaccines are approved, a global regulation should oblige producers to provide the necessary amount of vaccine doses for the control groups of ongoing vaccine research.","Wiesing, Urban; Ehni, Hans-Jörg",Indian J Med Ethics,,428
299979,Providing pharmacy services at cabin hospitals at the coronavirus epicenter in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: The actual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak caused a highly transmissible disease with a tremendous impact on elderly people. So far, few studies focused on very elderly patients (over 80 years old). In this study we examined the clinical presentation and the outcome of the disease in this group of patients, admitted to our Hospital in Rome. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study performed in the Sant'Andrea University Hospital of Rome. We included patients older than 65 years of age with a diagnosis of COVID-19, from March 2020 to May 2020, divided in two groups according to their age (Elderly: 65-80 years old; Very Elderly > 80 years old). Data extracted from the each patient record included age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms at onset, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) to the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) (P/F) on admission, laboratory tests, radiological findings on computer tomography (CT), length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality rate and the viral shedding. The differences between the two groups were analyzed by the Fisher's exact test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. To assess significance among multiple groups of factors, we used the Bonferroni correction. The survival time was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and Log Rank Test. Univariate and Multivariate logistic regression were performed to estimate associations between age, comorbidities, provenance from long-stay residential care homes (LSRCH) s and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found that Very Elderly patients had an increased mortality rate, also due to the frequent occurrence of multiple comorbidities. Moreover, we found that patients coming from LSRCHs appeared to be highly susceptible and vulnerable to develop severe manifestations of the disease. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that there were considerable differences between Elderly and Very Elderly patients in terms of inflammatory activity, severity of disease, adverse clinical outcomes. To establish a correct risk stratification, comorbidities and information about provenience from LSRCHs should be considered.","D039,; ascanio, M; Innammorato, M; Pasquariello, L; Pizzirusso, D; Guerrieri, G; Castelli, S; Pezzuto, A; De Vitis, C; Anibaldi, P; Marcolongo, A; Mancini, R; Ricci, A; Sciacchitano, S",BMC Geriatr,,428

We model the current scenario of closed schools and universities, social distancing of people above sixty years old and voluntary home quarantine to show that it is still not enough to protect the health system by explicitly computing the demand for hospital intensive care units. We also show that an urgent intense quarantine might be the only solution to avoid the collapse of the health system and, consequently, to minimize the quantity of deaths. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the relaxation of the already imposed control measures in the next days would be catastrophic.","Canabarro, Askery; Tenório, Elayne; Martins, Renato; Martins, Laís; Brito, Samuraí; Chaves, Rafael",PLoS One,,428
300953,Review of adverse cutaneous reactions of pharmacologic interventions for COVID-19: A guide for the dermatologist,2020,"Several global policy frameworks focus on managing (risks of) disasters affecting broad populations. In those frameworks resilience is a conceptualisation that possibly has important ideological implications. It is often opposed to fragility, and used to validate the notion of recurring insecurity, promote individual adaptability almost in the form of an obligation, and push the idea that crises/catastrophes are opportunities for profound changes. While effects from the COVID-19 pandemic have brought the protective role of the state to the fore, applying the word resilience to poor people requires clarification, especially in contexts of weak state public services and because assessment of complex poverty situations too often remains oversimplified and error-prone. We argue that to build capacity for resilience poor households need policies that protect and help them out of poverty, and that policy-making processes require engagement with people. Individuals must be asked about their perceptions and management of risks and threats, both in daily life and under exceptional circumstances, especially if the resulting stress factors accumulate and interact. This socially informed, place-specific, and multi-level approach could contribute substantially to identifying interventions, reducing poverty and poverty related risks, enhancing well-being and promoting development and cooperation programmes that meet people’s expectations. © 2021 European Union.","Quétel, C.

301050,Screening of COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction tests using saliva for pregnant women and their partners in Himeji city,2020,"INTRODUCTION: On February 25, 2020, the first 2 patients were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus­2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Tyrol, Austria. Rapid measures were taken to ensure adequate intensive care unit (ICU) preparedness for a surge of critically ill coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This cohort study included all COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU with confirmed or strongly suspected COVID-19 in the State of Tyrol, Austria. Patients were recorded in the Tyrolean COVID-19 intensive care registry. Date of final follow-up was July 17, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 106 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 1 of 13 ICUs in Tyrol from March 9 to July 17, 2020. Median age was 64 years (interquartile range, IQR 54-74 years) and the majority of patients were male (76 patients, 71.7%). Median simplified acute physiology score III (SAPS III) was 56 points (IQR 49-64 points). The median duration from appearance of first symptoms to ICU admission was 8 days (IQR 5-11 days). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 72 patients (67.9%) and 6 patients (5.6%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. Renal replacement therapy was necessary in 21 patients (19.8%). Median ICU length of stay (LOS) was 18 days (IQR 5-31 days), median hospital LOS was 27 days (IQR 13-49 days). The ICU mortality was 21.7% (23 patients), hospital mortality was 22.6%. There was no significant difference in ICU mortality in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and in those not receiving it (18.1% vs. 29.4%, pâ¯= 0.284). As of July 17th, 2020, two patients are still hospitalized, one in an ICU, one on a general ward. CONCLUSION: Critically ill COVID-19 patients in Tyrol showed high severity of disease often requiring complex treatment with increased lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Nevertheless, the mortality was found to be remarkably low, which may be attributed to our adaptive surge response providing sufficient ICU resources.","Klein, Sebastian J; Bellmann, Romuald; Dejaco, Hannes; Eschertzhuber, Stephan; Fries, Dietmar; Furtwängler, Wilhelm; Gasteiger, Lukas; Hasibeder, Walter; Helbok, Raimund; Hochhold, Christoph; Hofer, Stefanie; Kirchmair, Lukas; Krismer, Christoph; Ladner, Eugen; Lehner, Georg F; Mathis, Simon; Mayr, Andreas; Mittermayr, Markus; Peer, Andreas; Preuß Hernández, Christian; Reitter, Bruno; Ströhle, Mathias; Swoboda, Michael; Thomé, Claudius; Joannidis, Michael",Wien Klin Wochenschr,,428

301387,Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Postacute Care Decision Making,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of simple, rapid and accurate diagnostic testing. This study describes the validation of a new rapid SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay for use on extracted RNA or directly from swab offering an alternative diagnostic pathway that does not rely on traditional reagents that are often in short supply during a pandemic. Analytical specificity (ASp) of this new RT-LAMP assay was 100% and analytical sensitivity (ASe) was between 1â¯×â¯101 and 1â¯×â¯102 copies per reaction when using a synthetic DNA target. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of RNA RT-LAMP was 97% and 99% respectively, relative to the standard of care rRT-PCR. When a CT cut-off of 33 was employed, above which increasingly evidence suggests there is a low risk of patients shedding infectious virus, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100%. The DSe and DSp of Direct RT-LAMP (that does not require RNA extraction) was 67% and 97%, respectively. When setting CT cut-offs of &#8804;33 and &#8804;25, the DSe increased to 75% and 100%, respectively, time from swab-to-result, CT < 25, was < 15 minutes. We propose that RNA RT-LAMP could replace rRT-PCR where there is a need for increased sample throughput and Direct RT-LAMP as a near-patient screening tool to rapidly identify highly contagious individuals within emergency departments and a care homes during times of increased disease prevalence ensuring negative results still get laboratory confirmation.","Fowler, Veronica L; Armson, Bryony; Gonzales, Jose L; Wise, Emma L; Howson, Emma L A; Vincent-Mistiaen, Zoe; Fouch, Sarah; Maltby, Connor J; Grippon, Seden; Munro, Simon; Jones, Lisa; Holmes, Tom; Tillyer, Claire; Elwell, Joanne; Sowood, Amy; de Peyer, Oliver; Dixon, Sophie; Hatcher, Thomas; Patrick, Helen; Laxman, Shailen; Walsh, Charlotte; Andreou, Michael; Morant, Nick; Clark, Duncan; Moore, Nathan; Houghton, Rebecca; Cortes, Nicholas; Kidd, Stephen P",J. infect,,428
301388,Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Postacute Care Decision Making,2020,"BACKGROUND: Clinician burnout is an important occupational hazard that may be exacerbated by the novel COVID-19 pandemic. Within Southeast Asia, burnout in gastroenterology is understudied. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of burnout symptoms within gastroenterology, in member states of the Associations of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objective is to identify work-related stressors that contribute to burnout in ASEAN gastroenterologists. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an observational study that will use anonymised online surveys to estimate the prevalence of burnout symptoms at two time points: during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and in 2022 (assumed to be after the pandemic). Gastroenterologists from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Brunei will be invited to participate in the online survey through their national gastroenterology and endoscopy societies. Burnout will be assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey tool. Supplementary questions will collect demographic and qualitative data. Associations between demographic characteristics and burnout will be tested by multiple regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of burnout symptoms in gastroenterology during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the baseline prevalence after COVID-19, will be established in the above-mentioned countries. Work-related stressors commonly associated with burnout will be identified, allowing the introduction of preventative measures to reduce burnout in the future.

302240,The interface of psychiatry and covid-19: Challenges for management of psychiatric patients,2020,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2-causing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), emerged as a public health threat in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Delirium, a dangerous untoward prognostic development, serves as a barometer of systemic injury in critical illness. The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.","Kotfis, Katarzyna; Williams Roberson, Shawniqua; Wilson, Jo Ellen; Dabrowski, Wojciech; Pun, Brenda T; Ely, E Wesley",Crit Care,,428

Because COVID-19 has already begun to precipitate huge increases in mental health problems, clinical psychological science must assert a leadership role in guiding a national response to this secondary crisis. In this article, COVID-19 is conceptualized as a unique, compounding, multidimensional stressor that will create a vast need for intervention and necessitate new paradigms for mental health service delivery and training. Urgent challenge areas across developmental periods are discussed, followed by a review of psychological symptoms that likely will increase in prevalence and require innovative solutions in both science and practice. Implications for new research directions, clinical approaches, and policy issues are discussed to highlight the opportunities for clinical psychological science to emerge as an updated, contemporary field capable of addressing the burden of mental illness and distress in the wake of COVID-19 and beyond.

Since 2015, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has become widely used as an effective therapeutic support for acute respiratory failure, most recently in patients with severe COVID-19. We propose that the Berlin definition of ARDS be broadened to include patients treated with HFNO of at least 30 L/min who fulfil the other criteria for the Berlin definition of ARDS. An expanded definition would make the diagnosis of ARDS more widely applicable, allowing patients at an earlier stage of the syndrome to be recognised, independent of the need for endotracheal intubation or positive-pressure ventilation, with benefits for the testing of early interventions and the study of factors associated with the course of ARDS.

Cardiac arrhythmias are more common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The potential mechanisms that could result in arrhythmogenesis among COVID-19 patients include hypoxia caused by direct viral tissue involvement of lungs, myocarditis, abnormal host immune response, myocardial ischemia, myocardial strain, electrolyte derangements, intravascular volume imbalances, and drug sides effects. To manage these arrhythmias, it is imperative to increase the awareness of potential drug-drug interactions, to monitor QTc prolongation while receiving COVID therapy and provide special considerations for patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. It is also crucial to minimize exposure to COVID-19 infection by stratifying the need for intervention and using telemedicine. As COVID-19 infection continues to prevail with a potential for future surges, more data are required to better understand pathophysiology and to validate management strategies.","Dherange, Parinita; Lang, Joshua; Qian, Pierre; Oberfeld, Blake; Sauer, William H; Koplan, Bruce; Tedrow, Usha",JACC Clin Electrophysiol,,428

306872,Evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews for controlling the dissemination of COVID-19 infection. A narrative review,2020,"Lung transplantation can potentially be a life-saving treatment for patients with non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. Concerns limiting lung transplantation include recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the allograft, technical challenges imposed by viral-mediated injury to the native lung, and the potential risk for allograft infection by pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in the native lung. Importantly, the native lung might recover, resulting in long-term outcomes preferable to those of transplant. Here, we report the results of lung transplantation in three patients with non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. We performed single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) to detect both positive and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in explanted lung tissue from the three patients and in additional control lung tissue samples. We conducted extracellular matrix imaging and single cell RNA sequencing on explanted lung tissue from the three patients who underwent transplantation and on warm post-mortem lung biopsies from two patients who had died from COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Lungs from these five patients with prolonged COVID-19 disease were free of SARS-CoV-2 as detected by smFISH, but pathology showed extensive evidence of injury and fibrosis that resembled end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Using machine learning, we compared single cell RNA sequencing data from the lungs of patients with late stage COVID-19 to that from the lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and identified similarities in gene expression across cell lineages. Our findings suggest that some patients with severe COVID-19 develop fibrotic lung disease for which lung transplantation is their only option for survival.","Bharat, Ankit; Querrey, Melissa; Markov, Nikolay S; Kim, Samuel; Kurihara, Chitaru; Garza-Castillon, Rafael; Manerikar, Adwaiy; Shilatifard, Ali; Tomic, Rade; Politanska, Yuliya; Abdala-Valencia, Hiam; Yeldandi, Anjana V; Lomasney, Jon W; Misharin, Alexander V; Budinger, G R Scott",Sci. transl. med,,428

METHODS: A multi-centre, retrospective observational study was performed among children aged &#8804;12 years with laboratory-proven COVID-19 between 1 February and 31 December 2020. RESULTS: In total, 261 children (48.7% males, 51.3% females) were included in this study. The median age was 6 years [interquartile range (IQR) 3-10 years]. One hundred and fifty-one children (57.9%) were asymptomatic on presentation. Among the symptomatic cases, fever was the most common presenting symptom. Two hundred and forty-one (92.3%) cases were close contacts of infected household or extended family members. Twenty-one (8.4%) cases had abnormal radiological findings. All cases were discharged alive without requiring supplemental oxygen therapy or any specific treatment during hospitalization. The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR 6-10 days). One (2.1%) of the uninfected guardians accompanying a child in quarantine tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) upon discharge. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in children was associated with mild symptoms and a good prognosis. Familial clustering was an important epidemiologic feature in the outbreak in Negeri Sembilan. The risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to guardians in hospital isolation was minimal despite close proximity.","Ng, David Chun-Ern; Tan, Kah Kee; Chin, Ling; Ali, Marlindawati Mohd; Lee, Ming Lee; Mahmood, Fatin Mahirah; Rashid, Mohammad Faid Abd; Rashid, Harlina Abdul; Khoo, Erwin Jiayuan",Int J Infect Dis,,428
310140,Investigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reasons for application to the emergency department in patients with neurological symptoms,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the performance of two galactomannan assays (Platelia Aspergillus EIA, BioRadâ, and Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA, IMMYâ, Norman, OK, USA) in tracheal aspirate (TA) samples of consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included critically ill patients, performed GM-EIA and GM-LFA in TA and followed them until development of CAPA or alternate diagnosis. CAPA was defined according to the modified AspICU criteria in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for GM-EIA, GM-LFA, the combination of both or either positive results for GM-EIA and GM-LFA. We explored accuracy using different breakpoints, through ROC analysis and Youden index to identify the optimal cutoffs. We described antifungal treatment and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We identified 14/144 (9.7%) patients with CAPA, mean age was 50.35 (SD 11.9), the median time from admission to CAPA was eight days; 28.5% received tocilizumab and 30-day mortality was 57%. ROC analysis and Youden index identified 2.0 OD as the best cut-off, resulting in sensitivity and specificity of 57.1% and 81.5% for GM-EIA and 60% and 72.6% for GM-LFA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of galactomannan in tracheal aspirates improved after using a cutoff of 2 OD. Although BAL testing is the ideal test, centers with limited access to bronchoscopy may consider this approach to identify or rule out CAPA.","Roman-Montes, Authors Carla M; Martinez-Gamboa, Areli; Diaz-Lomelí, Paulette; Cervantes-Sanchez, Axel; Rangel-Cordero, Andrea; Sifuentes-Osornio, Jose; Ponce-de-Leon, Alfredo; Gonzalez-Lara, M Fernanda",Mycoses,,428
313362,Vascular surgery in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination poses a serious challenge to achieving adequate vaccine uptake in the general population. Cross-sectional data from the early months of the pandemic indicates that approximately one-third of adults in multiple nations are hesitant or resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19. Using longitudinal data, we tracked changes in attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a quantitative, longitudinal design. METHOD: Nationally representative samples of the adult general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1041) and the United Kingdom (N = 2025) were assessed for their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination at three points from March to August 2020. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in resistance to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in Irish (from 9.5% to 18.1%) and British (from 6.2% to 10%) adults. CONCLUSION: Resistance to vaccination has significantly increased in two European nations as the pandemic has progressed. Growing resistance to COVID-19 vaccination will pose a challenge to public health officials responsible for ensuring sufficient vaccine coverage.","Hyland, P; Vallières, F; Shevlin, M; Bentall, R P; McKay, R; Hartman, T K; McBride, O; Murphy, J",Public Health,,428

A pilot study,2020,"Obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which have reached pandemic proportions significantly increase the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other serious conditions. Recent data with COVID-19 patients indicate that obesity also is a significant risk factor for this novel viral disease and poor outcome of associated critical illness. These findings considerably change the view of obesity as a driver of serious, but slowly-progressing chronic diseases, and emphasize the urgency to explore new therapeutic approaches. Inflammation is a recognized driver of metabolic derangements in obesity and MetS, and a core feature of COVID-19 pathobiology. Recent advances in our understanding of inflammatory regulation have highlighted the role of the nervous system and the vagus nerve-based inflammatory reflex. Current bioelectronic and pharmacological therapeutic explorations centered on the inflammatory reflex offer new approaches for conditions characterized by immune and metabolic dysregulation and for ameliorating the escalating burden of obesity, MetS, and COVID-19.","Pavlov, Valentin A",Pharmacol Ther,,428

Scoping review with a descriptive thematic analysis was carried out. Up to mid-September 2020, seven scientific databases and three preprint servers were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers. Snowballing searches and expert' consultations also took place. Two independent reviewers were used for the screenings and data extractions. Of 1027 references, 58 were included, 15 of which were empirical articles. The thematic analysis showed that: (1) People with disabilities living in residential or long-term care facilities were more likely to have greater infection rates;(2) Intersecting mediators of greater infection risks were multiple (e.g., lack of accessible information);(3) People with disabilities often face greater health problems when infected;and (4) Unethical disadvantages in the rationing of lifesaving and critical care can be experienced by people with disabilities. Conclusions : Beyond any health-related vulnerabilities (e.g., comorbidity rates), multiple yet modifiable environmental factors can provide disproportionate health risks and consequences of a COVID-19 infection for people with disabilities. Public health and policy measures must prevent or reduce modifiable environmental risks.","Kamalakannan, S.; Bhattacharjya, S.; Bogdanova, Y.; Papadimitriou, C.; Arango-Lasprilla, J.

Although SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to persist on surfaces for a number of days, the extent and duration of fomites as a mode of transmission, particularly in healthcare settings, has not been fully characterized. To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable by TCID50 assay within 24 h. These findings underline the importance of appropriate handling of contaminated PPE during and following use in high-risk settings and provide interesting insight into the potential utility of cotton in limiting COVID-19 transmission.","Kasloff, Samantha B; Leung, Anders; Strong, James E; Funk, Duane; Cutts, Todd",Sci Rep,,428

The assessment of leukocytes population and the maturation of both B and T lymphocytes may be important in characterizing the immunological profile of COVID-19 patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate maturation of B and T cells in COVID-19 patients with interstitial lesions on chest X-ray (COVID-19 X-ray (+)), without changes on X-ray (COVID-19 X-ray (-)) and in healthy control. The study group consisted of 23 patients divided on two groups: COVID-19 X-ray (+) n = 14 and COVID-19 X-ray (-) n = 9 and control n = 20. The flow cytometry method was performed. We observed a significantly higher percentage of plasmablasts and lower CD4+ lymphocytes in COVID-19 X-ray (+) patients than in COVID-19 X-ray (-) and control. In the COVID-19 X-ray (+) patients, there was a lower proportion of effector CD4+ T cells, naïve CD8+ T cells and higher central memory CD4+ cells and effector CD8+ T cells than control. The above results showed that the assessment of selected cells of B and T lymphocytes by flow cytometry can distinguish patients with COVID-19 and differentiate patients with and without changes on chest X-ray.","Kwiecien, Iwona; Rutkowska, Elzbieta; Klos, Krzysztof; Wiesik-Szewczyk, Ewa; Jahnz-Rózyk, Karina; Rzepecki, Piotr; Chcialowski, Andrzej",,,428
317817,All-cause excess mortality and COVID-19-related deaths in Iran,2020,"Healthcare workers involved in aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation, may be at elevated risk of acquiring COVID-19. However, the magnitude of this risk is unknown. We conducted a prospective international multicentre cohort study recruiting healthcare workers participating in tracheal intubation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Information on tracheal intubation episodes, personal protective equipment use and subsequent provider health status was collected via self-reporting. The primary endpoint was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or new symptoms requiring self-isolation or hospitalisation after a tracheal intubation episode. Cox regression analysis examined associations between the primary endpoint and healthcare worker characteristics, procedure-related factors and personal protective equipment use. Between 23 March and 2 June 2020, 1718 healthcare workers from 503 hospitals in 17 countries reported 5148 tracheal intubation episodes. The overall incidence of the primary endpoint was 10.7% over a median (IQR [range]) follow-up of 32 (18-48 [0-116]) days. The cumulative incidence within 7, 14 and 21 days of the first tracheal intubation episode was 3.6%, 6.1% and 8.5%, respectively. The risk of the primary endpoint varied by country and was higher in women, but was not associated with other factors. Around 1 in 10 healthcare workers involved in tracheal intubation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 subsequently reported a COVID-19 outcome. This has human resource implications for institutional capacity to deliver essential healthcare services, and wider societal implications for COVID-19 transmission.","El-Boghdadly, K; Wong, D J N; Owen, R; Neuman, M D; Pocock, S; Carlisle, J B; Johnstone, C; Andruszkiewicz, P; Baker, P A; Biccard, B M; Bryson, G L; Chan, M T V; Cheng, M H; Chin, K J; Coburn, M; Jonsson Fagerlund, M; Myatra, S N; Myles, P S; O039,; Sullivan, E; Pasin, L; Shamim, F; van Klei, W A; Ahmad, I",Anaesthesia,,428

To investigate this issue, survey studies with 1000 respondents aged 65+ were conducted. The implementation of the obtained data in the process of redesigning public spaces may facilitate the opening up after the lockdown. Taking into account the requirements of a very large group of citizens being seniors is crucial, as it was found that 55% of respondents will also be afraid to use public spaces after the COVID-19 lockdown.

318717,Vascular surgery department adjustments in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Providing palliative care (PC) at home for advanced cancer patients has become essential during the Covid-19 emergency. Nevertheless, the home PC professionals (PCPs) faced a challenging situation due to increased number of discharged patients, reduced availability of healthcare facilities and physical/relational barriers between them and patients. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on burnout and psychological morbidity among home PCPs in Italy. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eighth PC physicians and nurses working in home assistance in Italy were invited to participate. The results obtained by the investigation conducted during the Covid-19 emergency (COVID2020) were compared with data collected in 2016 in the same setting (BURNOUT2016). The questionnaires (socio-demographics, Maslach Burnout Inventory and General Health Questionnaire-12) were the same for both the surveys. The PCPs participating in COVID2020 survey (n=145) were mostly the same (70%) who participated to the BURNOUT2016 study (n=179). RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five PCPs participated in the study (response rate 73.2%). During the Covid-19 emergency, home PCPs presented a lower burnout frequency (p<.001) and higher level of personal accomplishment than in 2016 (p=.047). Conversely, the risk for psychological morbidity was significantly higher during the pandemic (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the age of Covid-19, the awareness of being at the forefront of containing the pandemic along with the sense of responsibility toward their high-risk patients may arouse PCPs psychological distress, but, on the other hand, this condition may improve their sense of professional satisfaction and personal accomplishment.","Varani, Silvia; Ostan, Rita; Franchini, Luca; Ercolani, Giacomo; Pannuti, Raffaella; Biasco, Guido; Bruera, Eduardo",J. pain symptom manage,,428

China's ethnomedicine has recognized infectious diseases since ancient times, and formed a medical system including theory, therapies, formula and herbal medicines for such diseases. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou have issued the prevention and control programs for COVID-19 using Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, Yi and Miao medicines. These programs reflect the wisdom of ethnomedicine in preventing and treating diseases, which have successfully extracted prescriptions and preventive measures for the outbreak of the epidemic from their own medical theories and traditional experiences. In this paper, we summarized and explained the prescriptions and medicinal materials of ethnomedicine in these programs, and the origin of Tibetan medicine prescriptions and Mongolian medicine prescriptions in ancient books were studied. These become the common characteristics of medical prevention and treatment programs for ethnomedicine to formulate therapeutic programs under the guidance of traditional medicine theories, recommend prescriptions and prevention and treatment methods with characteristics of ethnomedicine, and focus on the conve-nience and standardization. However, strengthening the support of science and technology and the popularization to the public, and improving the participation of ethnomedicine in national public health services and the capacity-building to deal with sudden and critical diseases are key contents in the development of ethnomedicine in the future.","Li, Zhi-Yong; Li, Hai-Tao; He, Jiang; Dong, Guang-Ping; Zhang, Ming-Shuo; Liu, Jian-Qin; Huang, Xiu-Lan; Wang, Xiao-Rong; Bolat, Makabel; Feng, Xin; Zhang, Fang-Bo; Jiang, Feng",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,428

319864,Wins,2021,"BACKGROUND This is a case report of an immunocompromised patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who was seronegative and successfully treated with convalescent plasma. CASE REPORT A 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission while on maintenance therapy with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing over 12 weeks and persistently tested seronegative for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. During this time, the patient experienced waxing and waning of symptoms, which included fever, myalgia, and non-productive cough, but never acquired severe respiratory distress. She was admitted to our hospital on illness day 88, and her symptoms resolved after the administration of convalescent plasma. CONCLUSIONS As the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, we can currently only speculate about the occurrence of chronic infection vs. reinfection. The protective role of antibodies and their longevity against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Since humoral immunity has an integral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, various phase 3 vaccine trials are underway. In the context of this pandemic, the present case demonstrates the challenges in our understanding of testing and treating immunocompromised patients.","Moore, Joanna L; Ganapathiraju, Pavan V; Kurtz, Caroline P; Wainscoat, Booth",Am J Case Rep,,428

To better cope with the pandemic, laypeople need to process information in ways that help guide informed judgments and decisions. Such information processing likely involves the reliance on various evidence types. Extending the Risk Information Seeking and Processing model via a two-wave survey (N = 1284), we examined the predictors and consequences of US-dwelling Chinese's reliance on four evidence types (i.e. scientific, statistical, experiential, and expert) regarding COVID-19 information. Overall, Risk Information Seeking and Processing variables such as information insufficiency and perceived information gathering capacity predicted the use of all four evidence types. However, other Risk Information Seeking and Processing variables (e.g. informational subjective norms) did not emerge as important predictors. In addition, different evidence types had different associations with subsequent disease prevention behaviors and satisfaction with the US government's action to address the pandemic. Finally, discrete emotions varied in their influences on the use of evidence types, behaviors, and satisfaction. The findings provide potentially valuable contributions to science and health communication theory and practice.","Lu, Hang; Chu, Haoran; Ma, Yanni",Public Underst Sci,,428

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Immunology is part of the process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-based protection: (1) why some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic; (2) why delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with severe outcomes; and (3) why positivity in molecular tests does not represent protective antibody IgG. Perhaps T cell responses may be the key to solving those questions. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells persist in peripheral blood and may be capable of providing effective information about protective immunity. The T cells studies can be helpful in elucidating the pathways for development of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for COVID-19 and for filling these immunology knowledge gaps.","Melgaço, Juliana Gil; Azamor, Tamiris; Ano Bom, Ana Paula Dinis",Cell Immunol,,428

327314,Struggling with COVID: Every cancer patient is unique and needs their own plan,2020,"This paper reports a project with the purpose to develop design guidance on urban wind fields for the Chinese city. The project assesses ""super-block"" developments in Wuhan China at first, then redesigns a super-block using Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) guidelines and draws wind performance comparisons. The project addresses wind Patterns for three major criteria: pedestrian comfort, air quality, and building ventilation potential. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software was used to model velocity, PMV comfort, pressure and air age patterns for summer and winter conditions. Super-blocks with isolated towers have poor urban quality on many measures, while residents drive more and use much more energy than in traditional housing. TOD guidelines solve these problems but no discussion of urban wind patterns, air pollution, pedestrian comfort, or building ventilation which have been found important during the period of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan China. Our target was to generate TOD urban form that equaled or exceeded super-block wind performance. Results were inconclusive for pedestrian comfort and other indices and modeling are needed. Other parameters depend significantly on orientation and wind direction. Therefore, sometimes TOD was better than towers and sometimes not. The general method of the project is in six parts: 1) Assess five existing super-block designs for wind performance and characterize three performance metrics;2) Draw conclusions about performance. Select one site for redesign;3) Using TOD guidelines, design a new neighborhood at the same density on the selected site;4) Evaluate wind performance of the new design;5) Select wind design strategies to improve performance and redesign the TOD neighborhood;6) Compare wind performance of TOD neighborhood and super-block. The study indicates the value of wind field analysis for improving urban designs for multi-building sites or for development rules. We were generally able to make performance improvements for development schemes, even during the special period.","Zhu, S.

Pressupõe-se que as políticas de distanciamento social são heterogêneas, apesar da liderança dos governos, ou seja, apresentam certo grau de assimetria nas restrições do funcionamento do comércio e de atividades com potencial de aglomeração de pessoas. Diante disso, foram combinados os debates sobre processo de produção de políticas públicas e sobre autonomia e federalismo, para investigar a influência dos fatores políticos ou técnico-administrativos nas políticas estaduais. Os seguintes procedimentos metodológicos foram utilizados: análise de conteúdo de 134 normativas estaduais; mapeamento do alinhamento político-partidário dos governadores estaduais ao presidente da República; análise dos recursos médico-hospitalares de cada unidade da federação baseada no Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saúde (CNES). O contexto emergencial revelou baixa coordenação interfederativa pelo governo federal, provocando uma competição entre entes federativos e forte liderança estadual na gestão da crise no âmbito local. A pesquisa mostra, por um lado, que as decisões sobre as políticas de distanciamento social não podem ser explicadas por fatores políticos; e por outro, a correspondência entre a capacidade do sistema de saúde local e o nível de rigor das políticas de distanciamento social.

The purpose of our study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 who present to a Military Treatment Facility (MTF) with an emphasis on addressing institutional adaptations to rapidly changing medical evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study conducted on a prospectively maintained cohort. The MTF is a 52-bed hospital within an urban setting. Patients were included in the cohort if they had laboratory-confirmed severe or life-threatening COVID-19 with positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Severe disease was defined as dyspnea, respiratory frequency &#8805;30/min, blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on ambient air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, or lung infiltrates involving >50% of lung fields within 24-48 hours. Life-threatening COVID-19 was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction. The cohort included patients admitted from June 1 through November 13. Data were collected retrospectively via chart review by a resident physician. RESULTS: In total, our MTF saw 14 cases of severe or life-threatening COVID-19 from June 1 to November 13. Patients had a median age of 70.5 years, with 7% being active duty personnel, 21% dependents, and 71% retired military members. The median time to dexamethasone, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma administration was 4.7, 6.3, and 11.2 hours, respectively. The 28-day in-hospital mortality was 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who present to an MTF with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 are largely retirees, with only a small fraction comprising active duty personnel. The institution of order sets and early consultation can help facilitate prompt patient care for COVID-19.","Elliott, Brian P; Buchek, Gregory M; Koroscil, Matthew T",Mil. med,,428
332911,18 Prioritization and triage scoring of gynecologic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,Healthcare is one of the most important aspects of human life. Heart disease is known to be one of the deadliest diseases which is hampering the lives of many people around the world. Heart disease must be detected early so the loss of lives can be prevented. The availability of large-scale data for medical diagnosis has helped developed complex machine learning and deep learning-based models for automated early diagnosis of heart diseases. The classical approaches have been limited in terms of not generalizing well to new data which have not been seen in the training set. This is indicated by a large gap in training and test accuracies. This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture using a 1D convolutional neural network for classification between healthy and non-healthy persons to overcome the limitations of classical approaches. Various clinical parameters are used for assessing the risk profile in the patients which helps in early diagnosis. Various techniques are used to avoid overfitting in the proposed network. The proposed network achieves over 97% training accuracy and 96% test accuracy on the dataset. The accuracy of the model is compared in detail with other classification algorithms using various performance parameters which proves the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.,"Hussain, Shadab; Nanda, Dr. Santosh Kumar; Barigidad, Susmith; Akhtar, Shadab; Suaib, Md",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10816v3.pdf,428

Due largely to the classical pathology of cattle cases, the received wisdom was that bTB was spread by direct inhalation and exchange of bioaerosols containing droplets laden with bacteria Other members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) exhibit differing host ranges, an apparent capacity to persist in environmental fomites, and they favour a range of different transmission routes It is possible, therefore, that infection from environmental sources of M bovis could be a disease transmission risk Recent evidence from GPS-collared cattle and badgers in Britain and Ireland suggests that direct transmission by infectious droplets or aerosols may not be the main mechanism for interspecies transmission, raising the possibility of indirect transmission involving a contaminated, shared environment The possibility that classical pulmonary TB can be simulated and recapitulated in laboratory animal models by ingestion of contaminated feed is a further intriguing indication of potential environmental risk Livestock and wildlife are known to shed M bovis onto pasture, soil, feedstuffs, water, and other fomites;field and laboratory studies have indicated that persistence is possible, but variable, under differing environmental conditions Given the potential infection risk, it is timely to review the available evidence, experimental approaches, and methodologies that could be deployed to address this potential blind spot and control point Although we focus on evidence from Western Europe, the concepts are widely applicable to other multihost bTB episystems","Allen, Adrian R.; Ford, Tom Skuce Robin A.",Veterinary Medicine International,,428

335695,Changing trends in dermatology practice during COVID-19 pandemic: A single tertiary center experience,2020,"PURPOSE: Catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF) were significantly curtailed during the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to conserve healthcare resources and limit exposure. There is little data regarding peri-procedural outcomes of medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. We enacted protocols to safely reboot AF ablation while limiting healthcare resource utilization. We aimed to evaluate acute and subacute outcomes of protocols instituted for reboot of AF ablation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Perioperative healthcare utilization and acute procedural outcomes were analyzed for consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation under COVID-19 protocols (2020 cohort; n=111) and compared to those of patients who underwent AF ablation during the same time period in 2019 (2019 cohort; n=200). Newly implemented practices included preoperative COVID-19 testing, selective transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), utilization of venous closure, and same-day discharge when clinically appropriate. RESULTS: Pre-ablation COVID-19 testing was positive in 1 of 111 patients. There were 0 cases ablation-related COVID-19 transmission and 0 major complications in either cohort. Pre-procedure TEE was performed in significantly fewer 2020 cohort patients compared to the 2019 cohort patients (68.4% vs. 97.5%, p <0.001, respectively) despite greater prevalence of persistent arrhythmia in the 2020 cohort. Same-day discharge was achieved in 68% of patients in the 2020 cohort, compared to 0% of patients in the 2019 cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of safe resumption of complex electrophysiology procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing healthcare utilization and maintaining quality of care.

METHODS: We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) based on a single-center study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness clinics or the emergency department. Data were extracted from the Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse, and split into development (nâ =â 9381, 7 March-2 May) and prospective (nâ =â 2205, 3-14 May) cohorts. Outcomes were hospitalization, critical illness (intensive care unit or ventilation), or death within 7 days. Calibration was assessed using the expected-to-observed event ratio (E/O). Discrimination was assessed by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: In the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5% of patients experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death, respectively. CoVA showed excellent performance in prospective validation for hospitalization (expected-to-observed ratio [E/O]: 1.01; AUC: 0.76), for critical illness (E/O: 1.03; AUC: 0.79), and for death (E/O: 1.63; AUC: 0.93). Among 30 predictors, the top 5 were age, diastolic blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, COVID-19 testing status, and respiratory rate.

336075,COVID-19 serology in nephrology healthcare workers,2021,"BACKGROUND: Aging is a natural life process and with an aging population, age-related diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), atherosclerosis-based cardiovascular diseases) are the primary mortality cause in older adults. Telomerase is often used as an aging biomarker. Detection and characterization of novel biomarkers can help in a more specific and sensitive identification of a person's aging status. Also, this could help in age-related diseases early prevent, ultimately prolonging the population's life span. Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) - a member of the Sirtuins NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases family - is mainly intracellularly expressed, and is reported to be involved in the regulation of aging and aging-related diseases. Whether serum Sirt6 is correlated with aging and could be used as an aging biomarker is unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the age-related Sirt6 changes in the serum of human adults. METHODS: Participants were divided into three groups according to age: 20-30 years (Young); 45-55 years (Middle-aged); and &#8805; 70 years (Old). The Sirt6 and telomerase serum concentrations were determined by ELISA. The Sirt6 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression in vessels from amputated human lower limbs were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining. The relationships between variables were evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: The Sirt6 and telomerase serum levels reduced with an increase in age. A similar tendency was observed for Sirt6 and hTERT in the vessel. Serum levels of Sirt6 were higher in females compared with males. Pearson's regression analysis revealed that the Sirt6 serum level positively correlated with telomerase (r = 0.5743) and both were significantly negatively correlated with age (r = - 0.5830 and r = - 0.5993, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We reported a negative correlation between serum Sirt6 concentration and aging in human beings. Therefore, the Sirt6 serum level is a potential sex-specific aging marker.","Zhao, Ying; Bai, Xiangli; Jia, Xiong; Lu, Yajing; Cheng, Wenzhuo; Shu, Meng; Zhu, Yan; Zhu, Lin; Wang, Li; Shu, Yan; Song, Yi; Jin, Si",BMC Geriatr,,428

Methods: Based on traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology platform (TCMSP), the chemical composition and targets of Arecae Semen, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Tsaoko Fructus, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Scutellariae Radix, and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma were screened. The targets of corresponding gene were searched through UniProt, GeneCards databases, and then Cytoscape3.2.1 was used to build compound-targets (genes) networks. The enrichment of gene ontology (GO) function analysis by DAVID and the pathway enrichment analysis by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were carried out, the mechanism of its action was predicted. Results: The compound-target network contained 141 compounds and 267 corresponding targets, and the key targets involved PTGS2, HSP90AA1, ESR1, AR, NOS2, etc. The function enrichment analysis of GO was 522 (P &lt; 0.05), of which there were 421 biological processes (BP) items, and 38 related items of cell composition (CC),and 63 molecular function (MF) items. There were 25 signal pathways (P &lt; 0.05) in the KEGG pathway enrichment screening, involving small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and T cell receptor signaling pathways, etc. The results of molecular docking showed that the affinity of quercetin, kaempferol, baicalin and other core compounds was similar to recommended drugs recommended in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: The active compounds in Da-Yuan-Yin may regulate multiple signaling pathways by binding angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and acting on targets such as PTGS2, HSP90AA1 and ESR1 to inhibit COVID-19.","Zong, Yang; Ding, Mei-Lin; Jia, Ke-Ke; Ma, Shi-Tang; Ju, Wen-Zheng",Chin.

338358,Shared sanitation and the spread of COVID-19: risks and next steps,2020,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 surface and air contamination during the COVID-19 pandemic in London. METHODS: We performed this prospective cross-sectional observational study in a multi-site London hospital. Air and surface samples were collected from seven clinical areas, occupied by patients with COVID-19, and a public area of the hospital. Three or four 1.0 m3 air samples were collected in each area using an active air sampler. Surface samples were collected by swabbing items in the immediate vicinity of each air sample. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-qPCR and viral culture; the limit of detection for culturing SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces was determined. RESULTS: Viral RNA was detected on 114/218 (52.3%) of surfaces and 14/31 (38.7%) air samples but no virus was cultured. The proportion of surface samples contaminated with viral RNA varied by item sampled and by clinical area. Viral RNA was detected on surfaces and in air in public areas of the hospital but was more likely to be found in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients than in other areas (67/105 (63.8%) vs. 29/64 (45.3%) (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.9, p=0.025, Chi squared test)). The high PCR Ct value for all samples (>30) indicated that the virus would not be culturable. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of extensive viral RNA contamination of surfaces and air across a range of acute healthcare settings in the absence of cultured virus underlines the potential risk from environmental contamination in managing COVID-19, and the need for effective use of PPE, physical distancing, and hand/surface hygiene.","Zhou, Jie; Otter, Jonathan A; Price, James R; Cimpeanu, Cristina; Garcia, Danel Meno; Kinross, James; Boshier, Piers R; Mason, Sam; Bolt, Frances; Holmes, Alison H; Barclay, Wendy S",Clin. infect. dis,,428

340814,Pilot Study Using Telemedicine Video Consultation for Vascular Patients' Care During the COVID-19 Period,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have 30-day hospital readmission rates as high as 43%. A virtual cardiovascular care program, consisting of patient selection, initial televisit, postconsultation care planning, and follow-up televisits, was developed and delivered by Heartbeat Health, Inc., a cardiovascular digital health company, to 11 SNFs (3510 beds) in New York. The impact of this program on the expected SNF 30-day HF readmission rate is unknown, particularly in the COVID-19 era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess whether a virtual cardiovascular care program could reduce the 30-day hospital readmission rate for patients with HF discharged to SNF relative to the expected rate for this population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case review of SNF patients who received a virtual cardiology consultation between August 2020 and February 2021. Virtual cardiologists conducted 1 or more telemedicine visit via smartphone, tablet, or laptop for cardiac patients identified by a SNF care team. Postconsult care plans were communicated to SNF clinical staff. Patients included in this analysis had a preceding index admission for HF. RESULTS: We observed lower hospital readmission among patients who received 1 or more virtual consultations compared with the expected readmission rate for both cardiac (3% vs 10%, respectively) and all-cause etiologies (18% vs 27%, respectively) in a population of 3510 patients admitted to SNF. A total of 185/3510 patients (5.27%) received virtual cardiovascular care via the Heartbeat Health program, and 40 patients met study inclusion criteria and were analyzed, with 26 (65%) requiring 1 televisit and 14 (35%) requiring more than 1. Cost savings associated with this reduction in readmissions are estimated to be as high as US $860 per patient. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation provides initial evidence for the potential effectiveness and efficiency of virtual and digitally enabled virtual cardiovascular care on 30-day hospital readmissions. Further research is warranted to optimize the use of novel virtual care programs to transform delivery of cardiovascular care to high-risk populations.","Friedman, Daniel M; Goldberg, Jana M; Molinsky, Rebecca L; Hanson, Mark A; Castaño, Adam; Raza, Syed-Samar; Janas, Nodar; Celano, Peter; Kapoor, Karen; Telaraja, Jina; Torres, Maria L; Jain, Nayan; Wessler, Jeffrey D",JMIR Cardio,,428

Due to the pace of the pandemic, measures of pandemic-related disruption have not been subject to rigorous empirical validation. To address this gap, a multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%;United States, 19%;Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) of 372 female caregivers and 158 male caregivers of 5-18-year-old children was recruited online. Participants completed a survey including a 25-item scale indexing disruption in finances, basic needs, personal and family welfare, career/education, household responsibilities, and family relationships related to the pandemic. An exploratory factor analysis yielded an optimal three-factor solution: factors included Income Stress (five items related to income, debt, and job loss;loadings ranged from 0.57 to 0.91), Family Stress (seven items related to family altercations and child management;loadings from 0.57 to 0.87), and Chaos Stress (four items related to access to supplies, crowded shopping areas, news coverage;loadings from 0.53 to 0.70). Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated measurement invariance of each factor across female and male caregivers, indicating that factor structure, loadings, and thresholds were equivalent across groups. Composites reflective of each factor were computed, and Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that female caregivers consistently scored higher than male caregivers on COVID-19 stressors related to income, family, and chaos. Finally, concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant bivariate correlations between each scale and caregiver, family, and child outcomes, respectively. This demonstrates the validity of the COVID-19 Family Stressor Scale for use with female and male caregivers in family-based research. The current sample was predominantly White-European, married/common-law, and had at least some post-secondary education. Additional sampling and validation efforts are required across diverse ethnic/racial and socioeconomic groups.","Prime, H.; Wade, M.; May, S. S.; Jenkins, J. M.; Browne, D.

The 13-item CORC (COVID [or coronavirus] Rule-out Criteria) rule had good overall diagnostic accuracy in retrospective derivation and validation. The objective of this study was to prospectively test the inter-rater reliability and diagnostic accuracy of the CORC score and rule (score &#8804; 0 negative, > 0 positive) and compare the CORC rule performance with physician gestalt. METHODS: This noninterventional study was conducted at an urban academic ED from February 2021 to March 2021. Two practitioners were approached by research coordinators and asked to independently complete a form capturing the CORC criteria for their shared patient and their gestalt binary prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 test result and confidence (0%-100%). The criterion standard for SARS-CoV-2 was from reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed on a nasopharyngeal swab. The primary analysis was from weighted Cohen's kappa and likelihood ratios (LRs). RESULTS: For 928 patients, agreement between observers was good for the total CORC score, &#954; = 0.613 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.579-0.646), and for the CORC rule, &#954; = 0.644 (95% CI = 0.591-0.697). The agreement for clinician gestalt binary determination of SARs-CoV-2 status was &#954; = 0.534 (95% CI = 0.437-0.632) with median confidence of 76% (first-third quartile = 66-88.5). For 425 patients who had the criterion standard, a negative CORC rule (both observers scored CORC < 0), the sensitivity was 88%, and specificity was 51%, with a negative LR (LR-) of 0.24 (95% CI = 0.10-0.50). Among patients with a mean CORC score of >4, the prevalence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 58% (95% CI = 28%-85%) and positive LR was 13.1 (95% CI = 4.5-37.2). Clinician gestalt demonstrated a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 86% with a LR- of 0.57 (95% CI = 0.39-0.74). CONCLUSION: In this prospective study, the CORC score and rule demonstrated good inter-rater reliability and reproducible diagnostic accuracy for estimating the pretest probability of SARs-CoV-2 infection.","Nevel, Adam E; Kline, Jeffrey A",Acad Emerg Med,,428

These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.","Ghosh, Ria; Singh, Soumendra; Adhikari, Aniruddha; Mondal, Susmita; Mukherjee, Dipanjan; Bhattacharyya, Neha; Halder, Animesh; Bhattacharyya, Maitree; Pal, Samir Kumar",,,428
344322,COVID-19 pandemic's effects on the quality of pregnant women's emergency treatment: Review of two cases from a medical center in northern Taiwan,2020,"In the context of undirected Gaussian graphical models, we introduce three estimators based on elastic net penalty for the underlying dependence graph. Our goal is to estimate the sparse precision matrix, from which to retrieve both the underlying conditional dependence graph and the partial correlation graph. The first estimator is derived from the direct penalization of the precision matrix in the likelihood function, while the second from using conditional penalized regressions to estimate the precision matrix. Finally, the third estimator relies on a 2-stages procedure that estimates the edge set first and then the precision matrix elements. Through simulations we investigate the performances of the proposed methods on a large set of well-known network structures. Empirical results on simulated data show that the 2-stages procedure outperforms all other estimators both w.r.t. estimating the sparsity pattern in the graph and the edges' weights. Finally, using real-world data on US economic sectors, we estimate dependencies and show the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the network strength.","Bernardini, Davide; Paterlini, Sandra; Taufer, Emanuele",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01053v1.pdf,428

We utilise Fable Data: a real-time source of consumption data that is a highly correlated, leading indicator of Bank of England and Office for National Statistics data. The UK's recovery is heavily weighted towards the""home counties""around outer London and the South. We observe a stark contrast between strong online spending growth while offline spending contracts. The strongest recovery in spending is seen in online spending in the""commuter belt""areas in outer London and the surrounding localities and also in areas of high second home ownership, where working from home (including working from second homes) has significantly displaced the location of spending. Year-on-year spending growth in November 2020 in localities facing the UK's new tighter""Tier 3""restrictions (mostly the midlands and northern areas) was 38.4% lower compared with areas facing the less restrictive""Tier 2""(mostly London and the South).

At present, SARS-CoV-2-infected nonhuman primates are considered the gold standard animal model for COVID-19 research. Here, we showed that northern pig-tailed macaques ( Macaca leonina, NPMs) supported SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, compared with rhesus macaques, NPMs showed rapid viral clearance in lung tissues, nose swabs, throat swabs, and rectal swabs, which may be due to higher expression of interferon (IFN)-&#945; in lung tissue. However, the rapid viral clearance was not associated with good outcome. In the second week post infection, NPMs developed persistent or even more severe inflammation and body injury compared with rhesus macaques. These results suggest that viral clearance may have no relationship with COVID-19 progression and SARS-CoV-2-infected NPMs could be considered as a critically ill animal model in COVID-19 research.","Song, Tian-Zhang; Zheng, Hong-Yi; Han, Jian-Bao; Feng, Xiao-Li; Liu, Feng-Liang; Yang, Xiang; Jin, Lin; Luo, Rong-Hua; Tian, Ren-Rong; Liu, Chao; Li, Ming-Hua; Cai, Hou-Rong; Zheng, Yong-Tang",Zool Res,,428

The purpose of this study is to review a multi-institutional clinical experience in 100 consecutive patients, at 20 hospitals, with confirmed COVID-19 supported with ECMO. This analysis includes our first 100 patients with complete data who had confirmed COVID-19 and were supported with ECMO. The first patient in the cohort was placed on ECMO on March 17, 2020. Differences by the mortality group were assessed using &#967;2 tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests and Welch's analysis of variance for continuous variables. The median time on ECMO was 12.0 days (IQR = 8-22 days). All 100 patients have since been separated from ECMO: 50 patients survived and 50 patients died. The rate of survival with veno-venous ECMO was 49 of 96 patients (51%), whereas that with veno-arterial ECMO was 1 of 4 patients (25%). Of 50 survivors, 49 have been discharged from the hospital and 1 remains hospitalized at the ECMO-providing hospital. Survivors were generally younger, with a lower median age (47 versus 56.5 years, p = 0.014). In the 50 surviving patients, adjunctive therapies while on ECMO included intravenous steroids (26), anti-interleukin-6 receptor blockers (26), convalescent plasma (22), remdesivir (21), hydroxychloroquine (20), and prostaglandin (15). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may facilitate salvage and survival of selected critically ill patients with COVID-19. Survivors tend to be younger.

Although such steps are taken to control the spread of the pandemic, they may also cause various psychological problems. This study attempts to identify individual perceptions of staying home due to the COVID-19 pandemic through metaphors, and examines the relationship between these perceptions and stress, depression, and anxiety. This research utilizes a mixed method design called the embedded design. The analyses were performed on data collected from 96 women and 80 men aged 18-57. Qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis technique, while quantitative data were analyzed through the Kruskal-Wallis test. The findings showed that most of the participants viewed staying home as confinement, experienced boredom/depression because of staying home, and felt helpless. On the other hand, some participants concentrated on the positive sides of staying home and considered it a responsible behavior, an opportunity, and a requirement for feeling safe. The individuals who viewed staying home as confinement and a cause for boredom/depression experienced more psychological problems, whereas those who perceived it as a responsibility or opportunity experienced fewer psychological problems. Considering the literature on the contribution of positive thinking to the well-being of individuals, as well as the lower levels of psychological problems in individuals who maintain their positive perspectives despite the negativities of staying home due to the pandemic, we recommend that mental health professionals focus on the development of positive feelings and thoughts in their interventions.","Bozdag, Faruk",J Gen Psychol,,428

Specifically, this study investigates the effect of multi-tier random failures across different scales, as well as intelligent attacks on the global supply chain of medical equipment, an industry whose supply chain's viability was put under a crucial test during the COVID-19 pandemic. The global supply chain data was mined and analyzed from about 45,000 firms with about 115,000 intertwined relationships spanning across 10 tiers of the backward supply chain of medical equipment. This complex supply chain network was analyzed at four scales, namely: firm, country-industry, industry, and country. A notable contribution of this study is the application of a supply chain tier optimization tool to identify the lowest tier of the supply chain that can provide adequate resolution for the study of the supply chain pattern in the medical equipment sector. We also developed data-driven-tools to identify the thresholds for the breakdown and fragmentation of the medical equipment supply chain when faced with random failures, or different intelligent attack scenarios. The novel network analysis tools utilized in the study can be applied to the study of supply chain reachability and viability in other industries.","Lavassani, Kayvan Miri; Boyd, Zachary M.; Movahedi, Bahar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14046v1.pdf,428

Prior research has focused on perceptions of sexual harassment targeting straight cisgender women. We examined how targets' sexual orientation and gender identity impact these perceptions. In three preregistered studies, straight cisgender participants imagined a coworker confided that a male colleague had sexually harassed her. The target was a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, or a woman whose sexual orientation and gender identity were unspecified. In Study 1 (N = 428), participants reported believing that sexual harassment targeting lesbians and women with unspecified identities was most likely motivated by attraction and power, whereas sexual harassment targeting transgender women was seen as most likely motivated by power and prejudice. Despite these differences in perceived motivation, in Study 2 (N = 421) perceptions of appropriate consequences for the perpetrator did not vary based on the target's identity. Study 3 (N = 473) demonstrated that the specific behavior of which sexual harassment is assumed to consist differs based on the target's identity. Whereas women with unspecified identities and lesbians were assumed to face stereotypical attraction-based harassment, transgender women were assumed to face gender harassment. Stereotypes about sexual harassment can bias third-party assumptions, invalidating experiences that do not match pervasive stereotypes.

356324,COVID-19 can present with a rash and be mistaken for dengue,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coagulopathy and inflammation are hallmarks of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with increased mortality. Clinical and experimental data have revealed a role for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 disease. The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. METHODS: We performed proteomic analysis and immunostaining of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung pathologies. We further compared coagulation factor XII (FXII) and DNase activities in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy control donors and determined NET-induced FXII activation using a chromogenic substrate assay. FINDINGS: FXII expression and activity were increased in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vasculature and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients. In agreement with this, plasmaaac acafajföeFXII activation (FXIIa) was increased in samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, FXIIa colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially due to impaired NET clearance by extracellular DNases as DNase substitution improved NET dissolution and reduced FXII activation in vitro. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, our study supports that the NET/FXII axis contributes to the pathogenic chain of procoagulant and proinflammatory responses in COVID-19. Targeting both NETs and FXIIa may offer a potential novel therapeutic strategy.

356948,Epidemiological Measures in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"AIM: To evaluate incidental findings in major trauma patients, and to explore whether computed tomography (CT) could be used to assess prevalence and estimate disease spread in the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included all patients admitted following major trauma between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020 with CT including the lungs (n=523). Major trauma patients admitted pre-COVID-19 from 1-31 January and 1-31 March 2019 comprised a control group (n=252). The assessing radiologists, blinded to the time period, used double reading with consensus to determine if the patient had CT signs of COVID-19. Lung appearances were classified as no evidence of COVID-19; minor signs; or major signs. The proportion of patients with incidental COVID-19 changes was recorded over the study period, and the percentage of the population who had been affected by COVID-19 by the end of April 2020 estimated. RESULTS: CT appearances consistent with COVID-19 began to exceed a background pre-COVID rate in the second week of February and did not decline until 2 weeks after lockdown. By the end of April 2020, approximately 45% of the population had been infected. CONCLUSIONS: CT of major trauma patients can be used to monitor the spread of COVID-19. This novel technique could be used retrospectively or prospectively anywhere where trauma scans are available, to monitor the disease in the local population.","Adam, E J; Grubnic, S; Jacob, T M; Patel, J H; Blanks, R",Clin Radiol,,428

METHODS: Fifty patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 130 controls without coronavirus infection from the General Hospital of Chongqing were enrolled in the current retrospective study. Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems, including seven IgM/IgG antibody detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM, C_IgG and D_Ab), were employed to detect antibody concentrations. The chi-square test, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden's index were determined to verify the cut-off value of each detection system. RESULTS: The repeatability verification results of the A, B, C and D systems are all qualified. D_Ab performed best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM performed worse than the other systems. Except for the A_IgM and C_IgG systems, the optimal diagnostic thresholds and cut-off values of the other kits and their recommendations are inconsistent with each other. B_IgM had the worst AUC, and C_IgG had the best diagnostic accuracy. More importantly, the B_IgG system had the highest false-positive rate for testing patients with AIDS, tumours and pregnancies. The A_IgM system test showed the highest false-positive rates among elderly individuals over 90 years old. COVID-2019 IgM/IgG antibody test systems exhibit performance differences. CONCLUSIONS: The Innodx Biotech Total Antibody serum diagnosis kit is the most reliable detection system for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which can be used together with nucleic acid tests as an alternative method for SARS-CoV-2 detecting.","Wan, Yafang; Li, Zhijie; Wang, Kun; Li, Tian; Liao, Pu",Ann Clin Biochem,,428

359842,Early pregnancy mood before and during COVID-19 community restrictions among women of low socioeconomic status in New York City: a preliminary study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of Covid-19 and its long-term consequences is not yet fully understood. Sick leave can be seen as an indicator of health in a working age population, and the present study aimed to investigate sick-leave patterns after Covid-19, and potential factors predicting longer sick leave in hospitalised and non-hospitalised people with Covid-19. METHODS: The present study is a comprehensive national registry-based study in Sweden with a 4-month follow-up. All people who started to receive sickness benefits for Covid-19 during March 1 to August 31, 2020, were included. Predictors of sick leave &#8805;1 month and long Covid (&#8805;12 weeks) were analysed with logistic regression in the total population and in separate models depending on inpatient care due to Covid-19. RESULTS: A total of 11,955 people started sick leave for Covid-19 within the inclusion period. The median sick leave was 35 days, 13.3% were on sick leave for long Covid, and 9.0% remained on sick leave for the whole follow-up period. There were 2960 people who received inpatient care due to Covid-19, which was the strongest predictor of longer sick leave. Sick leave the year prior to Covid-19 and older age also predicted longer sick leave. No clear pattern of socioeconomic factors was noted. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of people are on sick leave due to Covid-19. Sick leave may be protracted, and sick leave for long Covid is quite common. The severity of Covid-19 (needing inpatient care), prior sick leave, and age all seem to predict the likelihood of longer sick leave. However, no socioeconomic factor could clearly predict longer sick leave, indicating the complexity of this condition. The group needing long sick leave after Covid-19 seems to be heterogeneous, indicating a knowledge gap.","Westerlind, Emma; Palstam, Annie; Sunnerhagen, Katharina S; Persson, Hanna C",BMC Public Health,,428

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by the Alinity m was compared with that of the cobas 6800 (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ; standard comparator) in a manufacturer-independent clinical evaluation on 2157 consecutive nasopharyngeal swab samples. Valid initial results on Alinity m and cobas 6800 were obtained from 2129 (98.7%) and 2157 (100%) samples, respectively. The overall percent agreement (95% CI) was 98.3% (2092/2129 [97.6%-98.7%]); positive percent agreement, 100% (961/961 [99.6%-100%]); negative percent agreement, 96.8% (1131/1168 [95.7%-97.7%]); and high &#954; value, 0.965 (0.954-0.976). There were 37 discordant results on Alinity m and, based on discordant analyses, including previous and/or follow-up PCR results, 22 could be considered analytically true positive with high probability. Due to a lack of additional information and an inability to perform repeated/further testing, the status of the remaining 15 discordant results remained unresolved. The throughput of the two analyzers was compared using testing on 564 samples in parallel across two 8-hour shifts in clinical practice. The turnaround times were compared using processing of 94 routine samples in parallel on each working day for 5 consecutive days. The two analyzers showed similar performance, with certain differences that have potential importance in some laboratory settings.","Kogoj, Rok; Kmetic, Petra; Ostrbenk Valencak, Anja; Fujs Komlos, Kristina; Seme, Katja; Sagadin, Martin; Korva, Misa; Poljak, Mario",J Mol Diagn,,428

362702,COVID-19: Why Algeria's Case Fatality Rate Seems to be Among the Highest in the World?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Emergency medicine (EM) physicians have been on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other related factors such as resource availability and institutional support on well-being, burnout and job-satisfaction of EM physicians in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study of EM physicians was conducted through the Emergency Medicine Practice Research Network of the ACEP. The survey focused on resource adequacy, institutional support, well-being, and burnout. A total of 890 EM physicians were invited to participate. Both descriptive and risk adjusted, and multivariate regressions were performed with a statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: EM physicians' response rate was 18.7% (166) from 39 states. Burnout was reported by 74.7% (124) since the start of the pandemic. Factors contributing included work-related emotional strain and anxiety, isolation from family and friends, and increased workload. Those reporting inadequate resources felt ignored by their institutions (p < 0.0001). Physicians who felt there was inadequate institutional support, were also dissatisfied with patient care resources (p = 0.001). Physicians expressing job dissatisfaction were more likely to report feelings of burnout (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: EM physicians face greater burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be compounded by resource scarcity, psychological stress, isolation, and job dissatisfaction. Many of the survey respondents reported inadequate mental health services and resources. The findings of this study may help identify solutions to mitigate these issues.","Nguyen, Jackie; Liu, Amy; McKenney, Mark; Liu, Huazhi; Ang, Darwin; Elkbuli, Adel",Am J Emerg Med,,428
362909,Neurological manifestations of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern society. As possible breeding grounds for microbial organisms, these constitute a potential global public health risk for microbial transmission. OBJECTIVE: Scoping review of literature examining microbial's presence on mobile phones in both health care (HC) and community settings. METHODS: A search (PubMed&GoogleScholar) was conducted from January 2005-December 2019 to identify English language studies. Studies were included if samples from mobile phones were tested for bacteria, fungi, and/or viruses; and if the sampling was carried out in any HC setting, and/or within the general community. Any other studies exploring mobile phones that did not identify specific microorganisms were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 56 studies were included (from 24 countries). Most studies identified the presence of bacteria (54/56), while 16 studies reported the presence of fungi. One study focused solely on RNA viruses. Staphylococcus aureus, and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci were the most numerous identified organisms present on mobile phones. These two species and Escherichia coli were present in over a third of studies both in HC and community samples. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter sp., and Bacillus sp. were present in over a third of the studies in HC settings. CONCLUSIONS: While this scoping review of literature regarding microbial identification on mobile phones in HC and community settings did not directly address the issue of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19, this work exposes the possible role of mobile phones as a 'Trojan horse' contributing to the transmission of microbial infections in epidemics and pandemics.","Olsen, Matthew; Campos, Mariana; Lohning, Anna; Jones, Peter; Legget, John; Bannach-Brown, Alexandra; McKirdy, Simon; Alghafri, Rashed; Tajouri, Lotti",Travel Med Infect Dis,,428

363465,Fractures of the proximal radius in children: management and results of 100 consecutive cases,2021,"In March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak was declared as a world pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The only measures for controlling the outbreak are testing and isolation of infected cases. Molecular real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are very sensitive but require highly equipped laboratories and well-trained personnel. In this study, a rapid point-of-need detection method was developed to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 based on the reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay. RdRP, E, and N RT-RPA assays required approximately 15 min to amplify 2, 15, and 15 RNA molecules of molecular standard/reaction, respectively. RdRP and E RT-RPA assays detected SARS-CoV-1 and 2 genomic RNA, whereas the N RT-RPA assay identified only SARS-CoV-2 RNA. All established assays did not cross-react with nucleic acids of other respiratory pathogens. The RT-RPA assay's clinical sensitivity and specificity in comparison to real-time RT-PCR (n = 36) were 94 and 100% for RdRP; 65 and 77% for E; and 83 and 94% for the N RT-RPA assay. The assays were deployed to the field, where the RdRP RT-RPA assays confirmed to produce the most accurate results in three different laboratories in Africa (n = 89). The RPA assays were run in a mobile suitcase laboratory to facilitate the deployment at point of need. The assays can contribute to speed up the control measures as well as assist in the detection of COVID-19 cases in low-resource settings.","El Wahed, Ahmed Abd; Patel, Pranav; Maier, Melanie; Pietsch, Corinna; Rüster, Dana; Böhlken-Fascher, Susanne; Kissenkötter, Jonas; Behrmann, Ole; Frimpong, Michael; Diagne, Moussa Moïse; Faye, Martin; Dia, Ndongo; Shalaby, Mohamed A; Amer, Haitham; Elgamal, Mahmoud; Zaki, Ali; Ismail, Ghada; Kaiser, Marco; Corman, Victor M; Niedrig, Matthias; Landt, Olfert; Faye, Ousmane; Sall, Amadou A; Hufert, Frank T; Truyen, Uwe; Liebert, Uwe G; Weidmann, Manfred",Anal Chem,,428
364068,Management of parenting preparedness at home in COVID-2019 pandemic based on individual and family self-management theory (IFSMT): A Systematic Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the presently prevailing global public health emergency has culminated in international instability in economy. This unprecedented pandemic outbreak pressingly necessitated the trans-disciplinary approach in developing novel/new anti-COVID-19 drugs especially, small molecule inhibitors targeting the seminal proteins of viral etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the traditional medicinal knowledge, we made an attempt through molecular docking analysis to explore the phytochemical constituents of three most commonly used Indian herbs in 'steam inhalation therapy' against well recognized viral receptor proteins. RESULTS: A total of 57 phytochemicals were scrutinized virtually against four structural protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 viz. 3CLpro, ACE-2, spike glycoprotein and RdRp. Providentially, two bioactives from each of the three plants i.e. apigenin-o-7-glucuronide and ellagic acid from Eucalyptus globulus; eudesmol and viridiflorene from Vitex negundo and; vasicolinone and anisotine from Justicia adhatoda were identified to be the best hit lead molecules based on interaction energies, conventional hydrogen bonding numbers and other non-covalent interactions. On comparison with the known SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor -lopinavir and RdRp inhibitor -remdesivir, apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was found to be a phenomenal inhibitor of both protease and polymerase, as it strongly interacts with their active sites and exhibited remarkably high binding affinity. Furthermore, in silico drug-likeness and ADMET prediction analyses clearly evidenced the usability of the identified bioactives to develop as drug against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Overall, the data of the present study exemplifies that the phytochemicals from selected traditional herbs having significance in steam inhalation therapy would be promising in combating COVID-19.","Gowrishankar, Shanmugaraj; Muthumanickam, Sankar; Kamaladevi, Arumugam; Karthika, Chandrasekar; Jothi, Ravi; Boomi, Pandi; Maniazhagu, Dharuman; Pandian, Shunmugiah Karutha",Food Chem Toxicol,,428
364137,Evaluating discharges and readmissions using a COVID Virtual Ward model: a retrospective data study assessing patient outcomes and the likely staffing commitment,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe pneumonia is the most common cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory disease (COVID-19). Due to its rapid outbreak, units for the evaluation of febrile patients in the pre-hospital setting were created. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop a sensitive and simple tool to assess the risk of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and thus select which patients would require a chest imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a cohort of individuals with suspected COVID-19 evaluated in a public academic healthcare center in Buenos Aires city. All adult patients with positive RT-PCR assay for SARS-COV2 between April 24 and May 19 of 2020 were included in the study. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of compatible signs and symptoms with imaging confirmation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. A risk indicator score was developed. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients were included, 71 (48%) received the diagnosis of pneumonia. The final clinical model included four variables: age >- 40 years, cough, absence of sore throat, and respiratory rate >- 22. To create the score, we assigned values to the variables according to their ORs: 2 points for respiratory rate >- 22 and 1 point to the other variables. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.80 (CI 95% 0.73-0.86). A cutoff value of 2 showed a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 43.24%.

365323,Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on hospital admissions and outcome of acute coronary syndromes in a single high-volume centre in southeastern Europe,2021,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We describe a large multi-center experience of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury, examining the prognostic role left ventricular function plays on short-term outcomes. METHODS/MATERIALS: We included adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our health system with evidence of myocardial injury and who underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) during index admission. Patients were dichotomized into those with reduced ejection fraction (EF; <50%) and preserved EF (&#8805;50%). RESULTS: Across our 11-hospital system, 5032 adult patients were admitted with COVID-19 from March-September 2020. Of these, 235 had evidence of myocardial injury (troponin &#8805;1 ng/mL). Included were 134 patients who underwent TTE, of whom 43.3% (n = 58) had reduced EF and 56.7% (n = 76) preserved EF. A subset of 6 patients had newly reduced EF, with 5 demonstrating evidence of stress cardiomyopathy and subsequently dying. Overall, mortality was high in those with reduced EF and preserved EF (in-hospital: 34.5% vs. 28.9%; p = 0.494; 6 months: 63.6% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.167; Kaplan-Meier estimates: p = 0.2886). Readmissions were frequent in both groups (30 days: 22.2% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.162; 6 months: 52.0% vs. 54.5%; p = 0.839). CONCLUSIONS: Many COVID-19 patients admitted with evidence of myocardial injury did not undergo TTE. For those who did, short-term mortality was high. Patients who survived hospitalization had frequent readmissions. In patients with newly reduced EF, most had evidence of stress cardiomyopathy and expired. Larger studies are needed to fully evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with evidence of myocardial injury and left ventricular dysfunction.","Medranda, Giorgio A; Fazlalizadeh, Hooman; Case, Brian C; Yerasi, Charan; Zhang, Cheng; Rappaport, Hank; Shea, Corey; Weintraub, William S; Waksman, Ron",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,428

In the UK there were uncivil tweets to MPs about perceived UK tardiness to go into lockdown. The pandemic has led to increased attention on ministers with a role in the crisis. However, generally this surge has been civil. Prime minister Boris Johnson's severe illness with COVID-19 resulted in an unusual peak of supportive responses on Twitter. Those who receive more COVID-19 mentions in their replies tend to receive less abuse (significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson's recovery, with rising economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential figures, abuse levels began to rise in May. 1,902 replies to MPs within the study period were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence of the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million replies, or 9% of the number of mentions of""stay home save lives""and variants). These have tended to be more abusive. Evidence of some members of the public believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was also found.

It is done to maintain plasma concentration of the drug under therapy within a specific target range for maximum therapeutic efficacy without unnecessary exposure to adverse effects. Objective This study aims to evaluate necessity of therapeutic drug monitoring in Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine therapy among epileptic patients. Method A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of one year at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. After taking detailed history, blood samples were collected from epileptic patients on monotherapy with the selected drugs. Plasma levels of these drugs were analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique (HPLC). Out of total 42 selected patients, 21 were tested for phenytoin, 17 for carbamazepine and four for lamotrigine. The result was categorized into therapeutic, sub-therapeutic and above-therapeutic groups based on reference range. Result Out of total 21 samples tested for phenytoin, 15(71.4%) had plasma drug level within therapeutic range, 5(23.8%) had within subtherapeutic range and 1(4.8%) had above therapeutic range. Analysis of carbamazepine plasma level showed 14(82.3%) at therapeutic level, 1(5.9%) at sub-therapeutic level and 2(11.8%) at above-therapeutic level.

We sought to further characterize host antiviral and cytokine gene expression in COVID-19 patients based on illness severity. METHODS: In this case-control study, we retrospectively analyzed 46 recovered COVID-19 patients and 24 healthy subjects (no history of COVID-19) recruited from the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang City. Blood samples were collected from each study participant for RNA extraction and PCR. We assessed changes in antiviral gene expression between healthy controls and patients with mild/moderate (MM) and severe/critical (SC) disease. RESULTS: We found that type I interferon signaling (IFNA2, TLR8, IFNA1, IFNAR1, TLR9, IRF7, ISG15, APOBEC3G, and MX1) and genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines (IL12B, IL15, IL6, IL12A and IL1B) and chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL11 and CXCL10) were upregulated in patients with MM and SC disease. Moreover, we found that IFNA1, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) were significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) in the SC group compared to the MM group. We also observed that microRNA (miR)-155 and miR-130a levels were markedly higher in the MM group compared to the SC group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with the activation of host antiviral genes. Induction of the IFN system appears to be particularly important in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, as decreased expression of IFNA1, APOBEC3G and FADD genes in SC patients, relative to MM patients, may be associated with disease progression.","Li, Shasha; Duan, Xiaoqiong; Li, Yujia; Li, Ming; Gao, Yong; Li, Tuantuan; Li, Shilin; Tan, Lin; Shao, Tuo; Jeyarajan, Andre J; Chen, Limin; Han, Mingfeng; Lin, Wenyu; Li, Xiuyong",Aging (Albany NY),,428

We develop a model of learning by deregulation, which predicts that lifting stay-at-home orders can signal that going out has become safer. Using restaurant activity data, we find that the implementation of stay-at-home orders initially had a limited impact, but that activity rose quickly after states' reopenings. The results suggest that consumers inferred from reopening that it was safer to eat out. The rational, but mistaken inference that occurs in our model may explain why a sharp rise of COVID-19 cases followed reopening in some states.","Glaeser, Edward L; Jin, Ginger Z; Leyden, Benjamin T; Luca, Michael",Journal of regional science,,428
370474,The Three-Plague Nature of COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Women and Children and Exposure to Violence,2021,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced incidence of many viral and bacterial infections has been reported in children: bronchiolitis, varicella, measles, pertussis, pneumococcal and meningococcal invasive diseases. The purpose of this opinion paper is to discuss various situations that could lead to larger epidemics when the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) imposed by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will no longer be necessary. While NPIs limited the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they also reduced the spread of other pathogens during and after lockdown periods, despite the re-opening of schools since June 2020 in France. This positive collateral effect in the short term is welcome as it prevents additional overload of the healthcare system. The lack of immune stimulation due to the reduced circulation of microbial agents and to the related reduced vaccine uptake induced an ""immunity debt"" which could have negative consequences when the pandemic is under control and NPIs are lifted. The longer these periods of ""viral or bacterial low-exposure"" are, the greater the likelihood of future epidemics. This is due to a growing proportion of ""susceptible"" people and a declined herd immunity in the population. The observed delay in vaccination program without effective catch-up and the decrease in viral and bacterial exposures lead to a rebound risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. With a vaccination schedule that does not include vaccines against rotavirus, varicella, and serogroup B and ACYW Neisseria meningitidis, France could become more vulnerable to some of these rebound effects.","Cohen, Robert; Ashman, Marion; Taha, Muhamed-Kheir; Varon, Emmanuelle; Angoulvant, François; Levy, Corinne; Rybak, Alexis; Ouldali, Naim; Guiso, Nicole; Grimprel, Emmanuel",,,428

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the satisfaction and stress levels of dentistry students in Turkey regarding distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to evaluate their opinions on this matter. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional research study was conducted from October to November 2020 with the use of a web-based questionnaire consisting of 3 sections. The 1st section focused on demographic data. The 2nd section evaluated dentistry students' opinions regarding distance education during the pandemic; it comprised 8 multiple-choice questions and 1 open-ended question. The 3rd section referred to the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), which is intended to assess the stress levels. The data was subjected to the descriptive statistical analysis, the &#967;2 tests and the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 919 dentistry students, reflecting a response rate of 84%. Of the total sample, 81.6% of the participants were studying at state universities and more than half were female. These students' perceived stress levels were significantly increased due to the following factors: education at a state school; insufficient technical opportunities at home/dormitory facilities; decreased support from the academic staff of the universities during distance education; and a low level of knowledge of online document usage (p < 0.05). The evaluation of the responses to the open-ended question indicated that the difficulties encountered by highly stressed students during distance education were mostly adaptationrelated (p = 0.011). The logistic regression analysis showed that gender was significantly associated with high stress levels (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that dentistry students preferred hybrid education and were unsatisfied with their experience with distance education.","Ertürk Avunduk, Ayse Tugba; Delikan, Ebru",Dent.

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) still need to be treated at percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers with relevant safety measures. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the therapeutic outcomes of PCI performed under the safety measures and normal conditions. AMI patients undergoing PCI between January 24 to April 30, 2020 were performed under safety measures for COVID-19. Patients received pulmonary computed tomography (CT) and underwent PCI in negative pressure ICU. Cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) staff and physicians worked with level III personal protection. Demographic and clinical data, such as door-to-balloon (DTB) time, operation time, complications for patients in this period (COVID-19 group) and the same period in 2019 (2019 group) were retrieved and analyzed. COVID-19 and 2019 groups had 37 and 96 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in age, gender, BMI and comorbidity between the two groups. DTB time and operation time were similar between the two groups (60.0 ± 12.39 vs 58.83 ± 12.85 min, p = 0.636; 61.46 ± 9.91 vs 62.55 ± 10.72 min, p = 0.592).

The aims of our study were to investigate levels of resilience in Italian healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to identify potential predictors of resilience. METHODS: We performed a web-based survey of HCPs (n = 1009) working in Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey contained a 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms. Non-HCP individuals (n = 375) from the general population were used for comparison. RESULTS: HCPs showed significantly lower resilience compared to the control group (p = 0.001). No significant differences were observed after stratification for geographical area, work setting, role, or suspected/confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. In a linear regression analysis, RS14 was inversely correlated with depression (R2 = 0.227, p < 0.001) and anxiety (R2 = 0.117, p < 0.001) and directly correlated with age (R2 = 0.012, p < 0.001) but not with body mass index (BMI, R2 = 0.002, p = 0.213). In male HCPs, higher depression score (odds ratio (OR) 1.147, p < 0.001) or BMI (OR 1.136, p = 0.011) significantly predicted having low resilience. In female HCPs, higher depression score (OR 1.111, p < 0.0001) and working in a COVID-19 free setting (OR 2.308, p = 0.002) significantly predicted having low resilience. HCPs satisfied with personal protective equipment had higher levels of resilience (p < 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that resilience was lower in Italian HCPs than in the general population after the first COVID-19 wave.

An estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was achieved by screening an unselected cohort of pregnant women. Of interest was the number of unreported cases. METHODS: Upon admission to hospital, patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by a specific real-time PCR and antibodies determined by a specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence was estimated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method, the group comparison with Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: From 6 April to 13 May 2020, 234 pregnant women were admitted to the Department of Obstetrics. A total of 225 (96.2%) SARS-CoV-2 PCRs were carried out and all remained negative. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in one (0.6%) of 180 (76.9%) antibody tests performed. The interval estimate of the period prevalence thus results in a 95% confidence interval between 0-1.7%. For 96 households with children, the period prevalence is 0-3.8%, which does not differ from the 0-4.8% for 76 households without children (p=1.00). DISCUSSION: This is the first report on the SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence of an unselected sample of pregnant women in Germany. Antibody testing showed no evidence of the feared high number of unreported asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. The seroconversion rate was below 1% (0.6%).","Zöllkau, Janine; Baier, Michael; Scherag, André; Schleußner, Ekkehard; Groten, Tanja",Z Geburtshilfe Neonatol,,428
381984,Socioeconomic and Racial Inequities in Breast Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Washington State,2021,"the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in December 2019 and still remains a major global health issue. Every country in the world has adopted drastic measures to contain the virus, although their stringency varies among countries, ranging from increased surveillance and focused interventions to strict lockdown (1). Italy was the second country where the disease had a major impact early in the pandemic, such that a strict nationwide lockdown was declared from March 9 to May 3, 2020. Nonetheless, between January and May 2020, there were 210,000 COVID-19 cases in Italy and 29,000 deaths were recorded (2). Due to the lockdown, universities (and in general all educational services) shifted to online classes, with students attending lessons and taking their exams from home. On-site activities were reduced to those considered indispensable. Research activities also had to be modified, such as by the adoption of a smart-working model (3). Between May and August 2020, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Italy decreased. In response, the lockdown was loosened and some activities were restarted, albeit with specific safety protocols (social distancing, use of masks, temperature checks at the workplace entry, environmental disinfection, mixed models of smart and in-office work). These actions were accompanied by periodic serological and PCR screening tests (4).","Cupertino, F; Spataro, S; Spinelli, G; Schirinzi, A; Bianchi, F P; Stefanizzi, P; Di Serio, F; Tafuri, S",Ann Ig,,428

383063,The WSES: what do we see in the future?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Given associations linking early life adversity, pubertal timing, and biological aging, we examined the direct and indirect effects of early life trauma on adult biological aging (via age of menarche). METHODS: Participants were premenopausal women (N = 183). Path models evaluated whether early life trauma predicted early pubertal timing and thereby, adult epigenetic age acceleration (indexed via four epigenetic clocks: Horvath DNAm Age, Hannum DNAm Age, DNAm PhenoAge, and DNAm GrimAge). Secondary analyses explored the effects of type of trauma (abuse and neglect) and adult chronic stress status (caregiver of child with autism and non-caregiver). RESULTS: Early life trauma and earlier age at menarche independently predicted accelerated aging based on one of the four epigenetic clocks, DNAm GrimAge, though early life trauma was not associated with age of menarche. Childhood abuse, but not neglect, predicted faster epigenetic aging; results did not differ by chronic stress status. CONCLUSIONS: Early trauma and early menarche appear to exert independent effects on DNAm GrimAge, which has been shown to be the strongest epigenetic predictor of mortality risk. This study identifies a potential correlate or determinant of accelerated epigenetic aging-menarcheal age. Future research should address the limitations of this study by using racially diverse samples.","Hamlat, Elissa J; Prather, Aric A; Horvath, Steve; Belsky, Jay; Epel, Elissa S",Dev. psychobiolDevelop. psychobiol,,428

Methods and ResultsThis is an observational study generated from the first 79 patients admitted to intensive care in Uppsala due to respiratory failure with SARS-CoV-2 infection, during the first wave in 2020, included in the PRONMED study. From this group 34 underwent echocardiographic examination of which 25 were included in the study, and compared to 44 non-echo patients. Demographic analysis compared standard parameters and previous morbidities between the echo and non-echo group. Standard echocardiographic parameters were analysed indicating a reduced left ventricular function as assessed by global longitudinal strain and very discrete increases in wall thickness in the group as a whole. A group comparison between the outcomes survival and death was carried out. Right sided dimensions and functional parameters did not indicate major strain. An increased maximum tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicating increased pulmonary arterial pressure was significantly associated with death, but failed to maintain significance when corrected for multiple comparison. Biochemical cardiac markers and D-dimer correlated to initiation of echocardiography and mortality. Tricuspid regurgitation maximum velocity was positively correlated with maximum troponin I. ConclusionThese results suggests that there is no clear negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are indications that pulmonary pressure elevation carries a negative predictive outcome suggesting pulmonary disease as the major driver of mortality. Cardiac biomarkers as well as D-dimer carry a predictive outcome value.","Isackson, Henrik; Larsson, Anders; Lipcsey, Miklos; Frithiof, Robert; Flachskampf, Frank Arnold; Hultstrom, Michael",,,428

386364,Aortic Valve Endocarditis as a Complication of Tocilizumab Treatment in Covid 19 Patient,2021,"OBJECTIVES: 1. To compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance strategies in detecting COVID-19 within the homeless shelter population. 2. To assess the participant adherence over time for each surveillance method. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective cluster-randomized study to compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance regimens across eight homeless shelters in the city of Hamilton. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will include both residents of, and the staff working within, the homeless shelters. All participants aged 18 or older who consent to the study and are able to collect a swab sample (where relevant) are eligible for the study. The study will take place across eight homeless shelters (four men-only and four women-only) in the City of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR GROUPS: The comparator group will receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing will only be completed in symptomatic participants (i.e. those who fail screening or who seek care for potential COVID-19 related symptoms). The three intervention arms will all receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing of symptomatic participants (as in the comparator group) in addition to one of the following: 1. Once weekly self-collected oral swabs (OS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 2. Once weekly self-collected oral-nares swab (O-NS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 3. Once weekly nurse collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) regardless of symptoms. Participants will follow verbal and written instructions for the collection of OS and O-NS specimens. For OS collection, participants are instructed to first moisten the swab on their tongue, insert the swab between the cheek and the lower gums and rotate the swab three times. This is repeated on the other side. For O-NS collection, after oral collection, the swab is inserted comfortably (about 2-3 cm) into one nostril, parallel to the floor and turned three times, then repeated in the other nostril. NPS specimens were collected by the nurse following standard of care procedure. All swabs were placed into a viral inactivation medium and transported to the laboratory for COVID-19 testing. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from specimens and then amplified by RT-PCR for the UTR and Envelope genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the human RNase P gene, which is used as a sample adequacy marker. MAIN OUTCOMES: 1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: COVID-19 detection rate, i.e. the number of new positive cases over the study period of 8 weeks in each arm of the study. 2. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Qualitative assessment of study enrollment over 8 weeks. Percentage of participants who performed 50% or more of the weekly swabs in the intervention arms in the 8 week study period. RANDOMIZATION: We will use a computer-generated random assignment list to randomize the shelters to one of four interventions. Shelters were stratified by gender, and the simple randomization scheme was applied within each stratum. The randomization scheme was created using WinPEPI. BLINDING: This is an open-label study in which neither participants nor assessors are blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): Since we are including our total sample frame, a sample size estimation at the cluster level is not required. However, if we succeed to enroll 50 participants per shelter from 8 shelters (n=400), and the detection rate is 3 times higher in the intervention groups (0.15) than in the comparator groups (0.05), we will have 90% power to detect a statistically significant and clinically important difference at a type I error rate of alpha=0.05 (one tailed), assuming an intraclass correlation of ~0.008. These computations were done using WinPEPI, and informed by conservative estimates from other studies on respiratory illness in the homeless (see Full protocol). TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number is 3.0. Recruitment began on April 17, 2020 and is ongoing. Due to low numbers of COVID cases in the community and shelter system during the initial study period, the trial was extended. The estimated date for the end of the extended recruitment period is Feb 1, 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on June 18, 2020 with the identifier NCT04438070 .

This study aims to summarize basic reproduction number (R0) data and provide clues for designing prevention and control measures. METHODS: Several databases and preprint platforms were retrieved for literature reporting R0 values of COVID-19. The analysis was stratified by the prespecified modeling method to make the R0 values comparable, and by country/region to explore whether R0 estimates differed across the world. The average R0 values were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified 185 unique articles, yielding 43 articles for analysis. The selected studies covered 5 countries from Asia, 5 countries from Europe, 12 countries from Africa, and 1 from North America, South America, and Australia each. Exponential growth rate model was most favored by researchers. The pooled global R0 was 4.08 (95% CI, 3.09-5.39). The R0 estimates for new and shifting epicenters were comparable or even higher than that for the original epicenter Wuhan, China. CONCLUSIONS: The high R0 values suggest that an extraordinary combination of control measures is needed for halting COVID-19.","Yu, Cheng-Jun; Wang, Zi-Xiao; Xu, Yue; Hu, Ming-Xia; Chen, Kai; Qin, Gang",Medicine (Baltimore),,428

DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N=154). In a smaller follow-up study (N=29), the same files were presented via auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who used English as their first language were recruited through social media links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of assistive listening devices. RESULTS: Auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M=68.9%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M=58.9%) for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had similar performance across all conditions regardless of mask type. Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested that the transparent-mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent mask (M=40.7%) compared to the opaque mask (M=58.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of transparent masks can significantly facilitate speech recognition in noise even for persons with normal hearing and thus may reduce stressful communication challenges experienced in medical, employment, and educational settings during the global pandemic. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate communication, safety-approved transparent masks are strongly encouraged over opaque masks.","Thibodeau, Linda M; Thibodeau-Nielsen, Rachel B; Tran, Chi Mai Quynh; de Souza Jacob, Regina Tangerino",Ear hear,,428

Además, estimar el costo por persona del tratamiento farmacológico para casos leves y severos. Materiales y métodos: estudio transversal con información reportada por establecimientos farmacéuticos públicos y privados. El precio de los medicamentos se presenta en medianas y se compararon usando la prueba no paramétrica de Kruskal-Wallis. Además, se estimó el costo por persona y asequibilidad para el tratamiento de casos leves y severos. Resultados: medicamentos para casos leves como azitromicina, hidroxicloquina, ivermectina y paracetamol tienen medianas de precios entre S/ 0,04 (US$ 0,011) y S/ 23,81 (US$ 6,71) en establecimientos públicos, mientras que los mismos medicamentos en establecimientos privados fluctúan entre S/ 1,00 y S/ 36,00. En promedio, los precios de los medicamentos en el sector privado son 11 veces los precios en el sector público. Los costos de tratamiento por persona en establecimientos públicos son más asequibles que en los privados, especialmente para los medicamentos para casos más severos. Los esquemas de tratamiento para casos leves requieren la inversión de entre uno a cuatro días de salario mínimo. Mientras que los tratamientos de casos severos pueden requerir, hasta 64 días de salario mínimo en establecimientos privados.

A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy.

393721,Toxicity of psychotropic drugs in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review,2021,"Within medical school curricula, anatomy education has faced a reduction in the course contact hours for gross anatomy, noticeably within the laboratory. The Indiana University School of Medicine to combat this have implemented peer teaching with alternate dissections since 2012. Historically this course is an entire semester in duration, however to due COVID-19, the course was truncated into a 10-week course. This resulted in a rapid turn around for dissections and peer-teaching by the next day. Empirically, peer teaching within the gross anatomy laboratory is beneficial to medical students learning anatomical content. Largely, the pedagogy of peer-teaching is assessed as a whole upon completion of the course and through medical students? perceptions. However, explicit episodes of peer teaching that occur within this pedagogy have not been examined thoroughly, which is the aim of this study. Participants were first-year medical students enrolled in a gross anatomy course at Indiana University School of Medicine, Bloomington campus (IUSM-BL). Participants (n=35) were assigned at the beginning of the course into seven groups by the course director that ranged from (5-6) students each. For a given lab two students from each group were dissectors, with one student being responsible for peer-teaching the dissected structures to their group peers at the beginning of their next lab. Peer-teaching episodes were allotted 15 minutes at the start of each lab. Each episode of peer-teaching across all three blocks of content were recorded via iPad by the course instructors. Videos were scored for structures taught per dissection based on the course provided dissection structures to know list per lab. Thematic analysis will be used to better understand the types of structures taught compared to those not taught across the course. Block one comprised upper limb and thorax (labs = 7, total structures = 565), block two covered lower limbs, abdomen, and pelvis (labs = 7, total structures = 373), and block three covered head and neck (labs = 7, total structures = 331). Peer-teaching times per block averaged (6:21, 10:06, and 8:03 minutes and seconds) for blocks 1,2, and 3 respectively. The average number of structures taught during peer-teaching sessions were (22, 32, and 26) for blocks 1,2, and 3 respectively. The average relative percent of structures taught per lab per block were (57, 58, and 64 percent) for blocks 1,2, and 3 respectively. Across the three blocks the lowest taught labs for completeness were brachial plexus (13 structures taught, 42% completeness), anterior lower limb (24 structures taught, 44% completeness), and the pharynx and larynx (26 structures taught, 51% completeness) for blocks 1,2, and 3 respectively. Across all recorded peer teaching episodes, only 59% of the expected gross anatomy structures to know were peer taught by the peer teachers to their group members. This study will provide demonstrable evidence for the impact of the completeness of peer teaching anatomical structures during peer-teaching on student lab exam performance. Additionally, the types of structures that are neglected or troublesome for students during peer teaching can help better inform us as instructors about how to direct our attention to student learning and understanding in the gross anatomy laboratory.","Newman, Steven",The FASEB Journal,,428

395401,Perspective of Oncology Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Observational Study From India,2020,"Understanding the pathophysiology of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection remains a significant challenge of our times. The gingival crevicular fluid being representative of systemic status and having a proven track record of detecting viruses and biomarkers forms a logical basis for evaluating the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The study aimed to assess gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in 33 patients who were deemed to be COVID-19 positive upon nasopharyngeal sampling. An attempt was also made to comparatively evaluate it with saliva in terms of its sensitivity, as a diagnostic fluid for SARS-CoV-2. GCF and saliva samples were collected from 33 COVID-19-confirmed patients. Total RNA was extracted using NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMérieux) and eluted in the elution buffer. Envelope gene (E gene) of SARS-CoV-2 and human RNase P gene as internal control were detected in GCF samples by using the TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 RT qPCR kit V-2.0 (I) in an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time machine. A significant majority of both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients exhibited the presence of the novel coronavirus in their GCF samples. Considering the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab sampling as gold standard, the sensitivity of GCF and saliva, respectively, was 63.64% (confidence interval [CI], 45.1% to 79.60%) and 64.52% (CI, 45.37% to 80.77%). GCF was found to be comparable to saliva in terms of its sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2. Saliva samples tested positive in 3 of the 12 patients whose GCF tested negative, and likewise GCF tested positive for 2 of the 11 patients whose saliva tested negative on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results establish GCF as a possible mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which is the first such report in the literature, and also provide the first quantifiable evidence pointing toward a link between the COVID-19 infection and oral health.","Gupta, S; Mohindra, R; Chauhan, P K; Singla, V; Goyal, K; Sahni, V; Gaur, R; Verma, D K; Ghosh, A; Soni, R K; Suri, V; Bhalla, A; Singh, M P",J Dent Res,,428

Methods &nbsp; &nbsp;The clinical data of 451 patients with chest diseases in the Department of Thoracic Surgery of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 1st to 24th, 2020 were analyzed and followed up. There were 245 surgical patients and 206 non-surgical patients. Results &nbsp; &nbsp;In the department, 7 patients (7/451, 1.55%) were infected with the novel coronavirus and all of them were surgical patients, whose preoperative imaging data did not reveal the imaging changes of novel coronavirus. There were 5 males and 2 females, aged 56 to 68 years. The patients with old age, smoking, surgery, coronary heart disease, chronic liver disease and tumor history were more susceptible to infection. From the spatial distribution of patient beds, it was found that the distance among infected patients was greater than 1 m, and no cross infection was found in the other patients of the same ward. During follow-up, two family members of noninfected patients were found to be infected one week after discharge. However, there was no overlap of spatiotemporal distribution between the family members and the infected patients during the hospitalization period. Conclusion &nbsp; &nbsp;The novel coronavirus pneumonia rate in the department of &nbsp;thoracic surgery is low, which may be opportunistic infection. At the same time, a good control and prevention of epidemic disease can reduce the occurrence of cross infection in the department of thoracic surgery.","Qi, WANG; Wan, KUANG; Wei, PING; Yi, GAO; Zhipeng, HAO; Yixin, CAI; Yangkai, LI; Ni, ZHANG; Xiangning, FU",Chinese Journal of Clinical Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,,428
398523,Mental Health from Medical School to Medical Practice: Finding a Path Forward,2021,"BACKGROUND: Neurological and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 have been reported, but more data are needed to adequately assess the effects of COVID-19 on brain health. We aimed to provide robust estimates of incidence rates and relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in patients in the 6 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we used data obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (with over 81 million patients). Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism. FINDINGS: Among 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 33·62% (95% CI 33·17-34·07), with 12·84% (12·36-13·33) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 46·42% (44·78-48·09) and for a first diagnosis was 25·79% (23·50-28·25). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 0·56% (0·50-0·63) for intracranial haemorrhage, 2·10% (1·97-2·23) for ischaemic stroke, 0·11% (0·08-0·14) for parkinsonism, 0·67% (0·59-0·75) for dementia, 17·39% (17·04-17·74) for anxiety disorder, and 1·40% (1·30-1·51) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 2·66% (2·24-3·16) for intracranial haemorrhage, 6·92% (6·17-7·76) for ischaemic stroke, 0·26% (0·15-0·45) for parkinsonism, 1·74% (1·31-2·30) for dementia, 19·15% (17·90-20·48) for anxiety disorder, and 2·77% (2·31-3·33) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40-1·47, for any diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68-1·89, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14-1·17, for any diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27-1·36, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 1·58, 1·50-1·67, for any diagnosis; 2·87, 2·45-3·35, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.

In the present study, we have evaluated the phytochemical profile, including terpene and terpenophenolic compounds, of the essential oils (EOs) of Futura 75, Carmagnola selezionata and Eletta campana hemp varieties. The EOs were also tested for antifungal properties toward Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, Arthroderma crocatum, Arthroderma quadrifidum, Arthroderma gypseum, Arthroderma curreyi, and Arthroderma insingulare. In parallel, we investigated the inhibitory effects of the EOs against tyrosinase, and the production of prostaglandin E2 in isolated mouse skin exposed to hydrogen peroxide. In human H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells, we also evaluated the influence of the EOs on the gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry in human host. E-caryophyllene and &#945;-pinene were the prominent terpenes in the EOs, whereas the cannabidiolic acid was the terpenophenol present at higher concentration. The EOs inhibited the growth of all tested dermatophytes species. In isolated skin specimens, EOs prevented the hydrogen-peroxide-induced synthesis of prostaglandin E2, consistent with the intrinsic antityrosinase activity. Finally, in H1299 cells, all tested EOs reduced the gene expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, as well. Therefore, the present findings highlight the rationale for the use of the present EOs against infectious diseases.","Orlando, Giustino; Adorisio, Sabrina; Delfino, Domenico; Chiavaroli, Annalisa; Brunetti, Luigi; Recinella, Lucia; Leone, Sheila; D039,; Antonio, Marianna; Zengin, Gokhan; Acquaviva, Alessandra; Antico, Mirko; Angelini, Paola; Angeles Flores, Giancarlo; Venanzoni, Roberto; Tacchini, Massimo; Di Simone, Simonetta Cristina; Menghini, Luigi; Ferrante, Claudio",,,428

Balanced regulation of cell death and inflammatory immune responses is essential to promote protection against coronavirus infection; however, the underlying mechanisms that control these processes remain to be resolved. Here we demonstrate that infection with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cell death in the form of PANoptosis. Deleting NLRP3 inflammasome components or the downstream cell death executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD) led to an initial reduction in cell death followed by a robust increase in the incidence of caspase-8- and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated inflammatory cell deathafter coronavirus infection. Additionally, loss of GSDMD promoted robust NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the amounts of some cytokines released during coronavirus infection were significantly altered in the absence of GSDMD. Altogether, our findings show that inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, is induced by coronavirus infection and that impaired NLRP3 inflammasome function or pyroptosis can lead to negative consequences for the host. These findings may have important implications for studies of coronavirus-induced disease.","Zheng, Min; Williams, Evan Peter; Malireddi, R K Subbarao; Karki, Rajendra; Banoth, Balaji; Burton, Amanda; Webby, Richard; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Jonsson, Colleen Beth; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",J Biol Chem,,428
401326,The Essential Business Conundrum in COVID-19 Hotspots,2020,"Introduction: Background: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can induce an exaggerated inflammatory response. Vitamin D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. Results: we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages. Conclusions: in this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency showed a signal of association with severe COVID-19 infection. A significant interaction with age was noted, suggesting VDD may have a greater impact in younger patients. These findings should be confirmed in larger, prospective, adequately powered studies.","Macaya, Fernando; Espejo Paeres, Carolina; Valls, Adrián; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; González Del Castillo, Juan; Martín-Sánchez, F Javier; Runkle, Isabelle; Rubio Herrera, Miguel Ángel",Nutr Hosp,,428

402165,COVID-19 as the sole cause of death is uncommon in frail home healthcare individuals: a population-based study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In traumatically injured patients, excessive blood loss necessitating the transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) units is common. Indicators of early RBC transfusion in the pre-hospital setting are needed. This study aims to evaluate the association between hypothermia (<36°C) and transfusion risk within the first 24 hours after arrival to hospital for a traumatic injury. METHODS: We completed an audit of all traumatically injured patients who had emergent surgery at a single tertiary care center between 2010 and 2014. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we evaluated the association between pre-hospital hypothermia and transfusion of &#8805;1 unit of RBC within 24 hours of arrival to the trauma bay. RESULTS: Of the 703 patients included to evaluate the association between hypothermia and RBC transfusion, 203 patients (29%) required a transfusion within 24 hours. After controlling for important confounding variables, including age, sex, coagulopathy (platelets and INR), hemoglobin, and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), hypothermia was associated with a 68% increased odds of transfusion in multivariable analysis (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.11-2.56). CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermia is strongly associated with RBC transfusion in a cohort of trauma patients requiring emergent surgery. This finding highlights the importance of early measures of temperature after traumatic injury and the need for intervention trials to determine if strategies to mitigate the risk of hypothermia will decrease the risk of transfusion and other morbidities.","Jivraj, Naheed K; Kaustov, Lilia; Hao, Kennedy Ning; Strauss, Rachel; Callum, Jeannie; Tien, Homer; Alam, Asim Q",CJEM,,428
402866,COVID-19 in Patients With Seizures and Epilepsy: Interpretation of Relevant Knowledge of Presenting Signs and Symptoms,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented response from the sequencing community. Leveraging the sequence data from more than 140,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we study mutation rates and selective pressures affecting the virus. Understanding the processes and effects of mutation and selection has profound implications for the study of viral evolution, for vaccine design, and for the tracking of viral spread. We highlight and address some common genome sequence analysis pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate inference of mutation rates and selection, such as ignoring skews in the genetic code, not accounting for recurrent mutations, and assuming evolutionary equilibrium. We find that two particular mutation rates, G âU and C âU, are similarly elevated and considerably higher than all other mutation rates, causing the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and are possibly the result of APOBEC and ROS activity. These mutations also tend to occur many times at the same genome positions along the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (i.e., they are very homoplasic). We observe an effect of genomic context on mutation rates, but the effect of the context is overall limited. Although previous studies have suggested selection acting to decrease U content at synonymous sites, we bring forward evidence suggesting the opposite.","De Maio, Nicola; Walker, Conor R; Turakhia, Yatish; Lanfear, Robert; Corbett-Detig, Russell; Goldman, Nick",Genome biol. evol,,428

Aim Of The Study: evaluate the preliminary impact of CoVID-19 in three Italian Orthopedics and Traumatology Departments in the first 10 weeks of the national lockdown. We focused on proximal humerus fractures, analyzing data and results in comparison with the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 22nd to May 3rd 2020, 55 patients were admitted to our departments for promixal humerus fractures. Our cohort of patients is composed by 13 males (23.6%) and 42 females (76.4%), with an average age of 73.8 ± 11.7 years (range 44 - 94). Trauma occurred at home in 43 cases (78.2%), by the roadside in 10 cases (18.2%), in a retirement home in 1 case (1.8%), and at work in 1 case (1.8%). We proposed surgical treatment in 15/55 cases, but 4 patients refused hospitalization, mainly because of the risk of contracting n-CoV19 infection. RESULTS: We noticed a decrease in proximal humerus fractures compared to 2019 (-37.5%). Particularly, we observed a significant drop in traumas occurred on the road and at work respectively 23.9% and 3.4%% in 2019, and 18.2% and 1.8% in 2020, probably due to the consequences of the national lockdown. Sports traumas had a reset during the pandemic (6 cases in 2019, 0 in 2020). As consequence, surgical treatment had a decrease due to the reduction in number of fractures, indications and patient's consent. CONCLUSION: The incidence of proximal humerus fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread. We assume that the reasons of this reduction are to be found in the national lockdown (since March 10th, 2020) and Ministerial Decrees that limited the access to the E.R. only in case of severe traumas in order to avoid CoVID-19 spread.","Maniscalco, Pietro; Ciatti, Corrado; Gattoni, Serena; Quattrini, Fabrizio; Puma Pagliarello, Calogero; Patane039,; Caterina, Angela; Capelli, Patrizio; Banchini, Filippo; Rivera, Fabrizio; Sanna, Francesco; Nonne, Daniela; Di Maggio, Bruno; Scaravilli, Gabriele",Acta Biomed,,428

403379,Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in children: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical DNA secondary structures formed through the self-association of guanines, and G4s are distributed widely across the genome. G4 participates in multiple biological processes including gene transcription, and G4-targeted ligands serve as potential therapeutic agents for DNA-targeted therapies. However, genome-wide studies of the exact roles of G4s in transcriptional regulation are still lacking. Here, we establish a sensitive G4-CUT&Tag method for genome-wide profiling of native G4s with high resolution and specificity. We find that native G4 signals are cell type-specific and are associated with transcriptional regulatory elements carrying active epigenetic modifications. Drug-induced promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II pausing promotes nearby G4 formation. In contrast, G4 stabilization by G4-targeted ligands globally reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy at gene promoters as well as nascent RNA synthesis. Moreover, ligand-induced G4 stabilization modulates chromatin states and impedes transcription initiation via inhibition of general transcription factors loading to promoters. Together, our study reveals a reciprocal genome-wide regulation between native G4 dynamics and gene transcription, which will deepen our understanding of G4 biology toward therapeutically targeting G4s in human diseases.","Li, Conghui; Wang, Honghong; Yin, Zhinang; Fang, Pingping; Xiao, Ruijing; Xiang, Ying; Wang, Wen; Li, Qiuzi; Huang, Beili; Huang, Jian; Liang, Kaiwei",Genome res,,428

We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on interns' stress, burnout, emotions, and implications on their training, while exploring their coping mechanisms and resilience levels. Methods: Newly graduated doctors interning in a Paediatric department in Singapore, who experienced escalation of the pandemic from January to April 2020, were invited to participate. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Maslach's Burnout Inventory (MBI), and Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 25-item (CD-RISC 25) pre-pandemic and 4 months into COVID-19. Group interviews were conducted to supplement the quantitative responses to achieve study aims. Results: Response rate was 100% (n=10) for post-exposure questionnaires and group interviews. Despite working through the pandemic, interns' stress levels were not increased, burnout remained low, while resilience remained high. Four themes emerged from the group interviews - the impacts of the pandemic on their psychology, duties, training, as well as protective mechanisms. Their responses, particularly the institutional mechanisms and individual coping strategies, enabled us to understand their unexpected low burnout and high resilience despite the pandemic. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that it is possible to mitigate stress, burnout and preserve resilience of vulnerable healthcare workers such as interns amidst a pandemic. The study also validated a multifaceted approach that targets institutional, faculty as well as individual levels, can ensure the continued wellbeing of healthcare workers even in challenging times.

This cross-sectional, mixed-methods study was conducted in 4 urban and peri-urban districts that included some wards with COVID-19-positive cases and some without. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analytical frameworks were used. Overall, 10% of health facilities (HFs) failed to fully implement COVID-19 risk determination;8.8% failed to fully implement stronger community partnerships with local stakeholders to support public health (PH) preparedness;35% and 2.5% incompletely implemented and did not implement evaluation of PH emergency operations, respectively;10% did not identify communication channels to issue public information, alerts, warnings, and notifications;25% incompletely implemented identification, development of guidance, and standards for information;72.5% had good preventive and treatment collaboration;and 10% did not fully implement procedures for laboratory testing and reporting results. Enablers included sufficient infrastructure and equipment, strong leadership, and good cross-public-sector collaboration with police and military forces. Barriers included workforce constraints, overburdened and inconsistent reporting systems, inappropriate financial mechanisms, ambiguous health governance, and lack of private-sector engagement. Nonetheless, the HS preparedness and response were satisfactory, although further coordinated efforts in evaluation, coordination, communication, and volunteering remain necessary.","Van Hoang, M.; Tran, A.

407601,COVID-19 screening in outpatients with risk factors and healthcare workers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a well-established strategy for the prevention of infectious diseases, in which recently exposed people take a short course of medication to prevent infection. The primary objective of the COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial with lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day course of oral lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP against COVID-19 among individuals with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case. METHODS: This is an open-label, multicenter, 1:1 cluster-randomized trial of LPV/r 800/200 mg twice daily for 14 days (intervention arm) versus no intervention (control arm), using an adaptive approach to sample size calculation. Participants will be individuals aged > 6 months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7 days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35, and 90 includes comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic, and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14 days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. To detect a relative risk reduction of 40% with 80% power at &#945; = 0.05, assuming the secondary attack rate in ring members (p0) = 15%, 5 contacts per case and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.05, we require 110 clusters per arm, or 220 clusters overall and approximately 1220 enrollees after accounting for 10% loss-to-follow-up. We will modify the sample size target after 60 clusters, based on preliminary estimates of p0, ICC, and cluster size and consider switching to an alternative drug after interim analyses and as new data emerges. The primary analysis will be a generalized linear mixed model with logit link to estimate the effect of LPV/r on the probability of infection. Participants who test positive at baseline will be excluded from the primary analysis but will be maintained for additional analyses to examine the impact of LPV/r on early treatment. DISCUSSION: Harnessing safe, existing drugs such as LPV/r as PEP could provide an important tool for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel aspects of our design include the ring-based prevention approach, and the incorporation of remote strategies for conducting study visits and biospecimen collection.

In general, immunosuppressant and antineoplastic agents for dermatologic treatments do not require suspension and do not require special measures, if not those commonly observed.

410184,Safe management of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: a rapid systematic review,2020,"Waterborne pathogens are still considered a threat to human health. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), contain a high populace and diversity of viruses that can significantly affect the aquatic ecosystem. Subsequently, the occurrence and recurrence of viral pathogens are alarming that exist in human populations, which are potentially discharged into sewage systems. This study investigated the distribution and diversity of the viral communities from three WWTPs in Gauteng Province, South Africa using next-generation sequencing technology. The results uncovered that most of the viral populaces in the wastewater plants belong to the families Siphoviridae, Microviridae, and Myoviridae of the order Caudovirales. Other families including Baculoviridae, Partitiviridae, Virgaviridae, and Tymoviridae were likewise recorded. On the other hand, enteric pathogens detected were Astroviridae, Reoviridae, and Coronaviridae. The predicted functional features for the viromes revealed that the DNA metabolism was the major function within the community followed by carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, suggesting that the treatment plants provide a rich biological environment for the growth of diverse viral species and other processes. The overall results in this study highlight the biological significance of WWTPs as a hotspot for some viral agents. The contamination routes of these viral agents are needed for efficient and cost-effective management strategies in water systems. Further, viral metagenomics ought to be considered as a key approach for revealing the diversity and early warning of emerging disease outbreaks.

410185,Safe management of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: a rapid systematic review,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently in epidemic stage. After large-scale interpersonal infection, asymptomatic patients appear. Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts. AREAS COVERED: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers. The patients were treated with four combinations of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, arbidol tablets, Lianhuaqingwen granules, and recombinant human interferon-&#945;2b (IFN-&#945;2b) injection via aerosol. Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed. EXPERT OPINION: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious. They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown. It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients. IFN-&#945;2b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection. Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vivo. The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.","Wang, Ling; Xu, Xiaopeng; Ruan, Junshan; Lin, Saijin; Jiang, Jinhua; Ye, Hong",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,428

We analyze the municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate (MR) of in Mexico. METHODS: We retrieved information from cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and deaths from COVID-19 as of June 20, 2020, and data from most recent census and surveys of Mexico. A negative binomial regression model was adjusted, the dependent variable was the number of COVID-19 deaths, and the independent variables were the quintiles of the distribution of sociodemographic and health characteristics among the 2457 municipalities of Mexico. RESULTS: Factors associated with high MRs from COVID-19, relative to quintile 1, were diabetes and obesity prevalence, diabetes mortality rate, indigenous population, economically active population, density of economic units that operate essential activities, and population density. Among factors inversely associated with lower MRs from COVID-19 were high hypertension prevalence and houses without sewage drainage. We identified 1351 municipalities without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had high and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (mean = 8 and 13.8 deaths per 100,000, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study identified municipalities of Mexico that could lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warns against premature easing of mobility restrictions and to reinforce strategies of prevention and control of outbreaks in communities vulnerable to COVID-19.","Contreras-Manzano, Alejandra; Guerrero-López, Carlos M; Aguerrebere, Mercedes; Sedas, Ana Cristina; Lamadrid-Figueroa, Héctor",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,428

However, toxicological and epidemiological studies focusing on the adverse effects of RCFs were still insufficient, particularly in China. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate comprehensively the associations between occupational exposure to RCFs and respiratory health effects among Chinese workers. We measured and calculated cumulative RCFexposure levels of RCFs workers from the biggest RCFs factory in China. In total, 430 RCF-exposed workers and 121 controls were enrolled in this study. Physical examinations of the respiratory system were performed and serum levels of biomarkers including Clara cell protein 16 (CC16), surfactant protein D (SP-D), transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ß1), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were determined among all subjects. RCF exposure workers showed a higher prevalence rate of respiratory symptoms (cough: 11.9%) and lower levels of small airways function indices (V50 %: 82.71 ± 20.01, maximal mid expiratory flow (MMEF)%: 81.08 ± 19.56) compared with the control group (cough: 5.0%, V50 %: 90.64 ± 24.36, MMEF%: 88.83 ± 24.22). RCFs workers showed higher levels of TGF-ß1 (31.04 ng/mL) and 8-OHdG (130.72 ng/mL) and lower levels of CC16 (3.68 ng/mL) compared with the controls (TGF-ß1: 26.63 ng/mL, 8-OHdG: 106.86 ng/mL, CC16: 5.65 ng/mL). After adjusting for covariates, cumulative RCF exposure levels showed significant positive associations with the levels of TGF-ß1 and 8-OHdG and negative association with the level of CC16. Occupational RCF exposure could induce adverse respiratory health effects, including cough and small airways damage, which may correlate to the altered levels of lung damage markers (CC16 and TGF-ß1) and oxidative markers (8-OHdG).","Gu, Yishuo; He, Wei; Wang, Yanhua; Chen, Juan; Wang, Hongfei; Gao, Panjun; Yang, Siwen; Zhu, Xiaojun; Ma, Wenjun; Li, Tao",J. appl. toxicol,,428

415048,Working conditions and health in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic: Minding the gap,2021,"With the emergence of mandatory remote education and work in universities due to COVID-19, the `zoomification' of higher education, i.e., the migration of universities to the clouds, reached the public discourse. Ongoing discussions reason about how this shift will take control over students' data away from universities, and may ultimately prevent privacy from being an attainable goal for researchers and students alike. However, there has been no comprehensive measurement of universities' use of public clouds and reliance on Software-as-a-Service offerings to assess how far this migration has already progressed. In this paper, we perform a longitudinal study of the migration to public clouds among universities in the U.S. and Europe, as well as institutions listed in the Times Higher Education (THE) Top100 between January 2015 and June 2021. We find that cloud-adoption differs between countries, with one cluster (Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland) showing a limited move to clouds, while the other cluster (U.S., U.K., the Netherlands, THE Top100) frequently migrates universities' core functions and services to public clouds -- starting long before the COVID-19 pandemic. We attribute this clustering to several socio-economic factors in the respective countries, including the general culture of higher education and the administrative paradigm taken towards running universities. We then analyze and interpret our results, finding that the implications reach beyond individuals' privacy towards questions of academic independence and integrity.","Fiebig, Tobias; Gurses, Seda; Gan'an, Carlos H.; Kotkamp, Erna; Kuipers, Fernando; Lindorfer, Martina; Prisse, Menghua; Sari, Taritha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09462v3.pdf,428
415804,Portable Chest Radiography Through Glass During COVID-19 Pandemic-Initial Experience in a Tertiary Care Center,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually more severe and associated with worst outcomes in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular pathologies, including hypertension or atherothrombosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can differentially infect multiple tissues (i.e., lung, vessel, heart, liver) in different stages of disease, and in an age- and sex-dependent manner. In particular, cardiovascular (CV) cells (e.g., endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes) could be directly infected and indirectly disturbed by systemic alterations, leading to hyperinflammatory, apoptotic, thrombotic, and vasoconstrictive responses. Until now, hundreds of clinical trials are testing antivirals and immunomodulators to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection or related systemic anomalies. However, new therapies targeting the CV system might reduce the severity and lethality of disease. In this line, activation of the non-canonical pathway of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) could improve CV homeostasis under COVID-19. In particular, treatments with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) may help to reduce hyperinflammation and viral propagation, while infusion of soluble ACE2 may trap plasma viral particles and increase cardioprotective Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(1-7) peptides. The association of specific ACE2 polymorphisms with increased susceptibility of infection and related CV pathologies suggests potential genetic therapies. Moreover, specific agonists of Ang-(1-7) receptor could counter-regulate the hypertensive, hyperinflammatory, and hypercoagulable responses. Interestingly, sex hormones could also regulate all these RAAS components. Therefore, while waiting for an efficient vaccine, we suggest further investigations on the non-canonical RAAS pathway to reduce cardiovascular damage and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Lumpuy-Castillo, Jairo; Lorenzo-Almorós, Ana; Pello-Lázaro, Ana María; Sánchez-Ferrer, Carlos; Egido, Jesús; Tuñón, José; Peiró, Concepción; Lorenzo, Óscar",,,428
415983,Correlation of national and healthcare workers COVID-19 infection data; implications for large-scale viral testing programs,2021,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of selenium (Se) deficiency on the expression of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction pathway in the spleen of chickens and explore the relationship between the TLR4/TRIF/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway and inflammatory spleen injury. A total of 200 one-day-old healthy broilers were allocated to two groups. The experimental group was fed a self-made low-Se diet (0.004 mg/kg) while the control group was fed a complete formula feed (0.2 mg/kg) for 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 days, respectively. We observed histopathological changes in the chicken spleens. The messenger RNA(mRNA) expression levels of 8 kinds of ChTLRs, myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), toll-interleukine-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-ß (TRIF), nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B), and cytokine (IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IL-2, and IFN-Î³) were detected via quantitative real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression level of TLR4. Then principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the correlation between the ChTLRs, MyD88, TRIF, and NF-&#954;B. The results showed that the boundary between red pulp and white pulp was unclear, the number of lymphocytes decreased, and the nucleus was fragmented and dissolved in the experimental group at 25-55 days. At 15-45 days, the relative expression of TLR4 mRNA was higher than in the control group, and the difference was extremely significant on day 15 (P < 0.01).The relative expression of TRIF mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 25-55 days, and the relative expression of NF-&#954;B mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The relative expression of IL-6 mRNA in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The protein expression level of TLR4 in the experimental group was higher than in the control group at 15-45 days. The PCA results showed that there was a strong correlation between TLR4, TRIF, and component 1. The results suggest that TLR4 plays an important role in regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spleens of Se-deficient chickens, and Se deficiency may cause inflammatory injury through the TLR4/TRIF/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway in chicken spleen.","Zhang, Ruili; Guo, Rong; Liu, Qing; Li, Guangxing; Sun, Bin; Huang, Xiaodan",Biol. trace elem. res,,428

However, little is known about whether coinfection with influenza contributes to severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the optimal therapeutic strategy for these patients. We retrospectively studied 128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients were positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive by nucleic acid detection. Sixty-four cases were coinfected with influenza A/B and the other 64 were influenza negative, matched by age, sex, and days from onset of symptoms. Among the 64 coinfected patients, 54 (84.4%) were coinfected with influenza A, and 10 (15.6%) with influenza B. The median duration of viral shedding time from admission was longer for patients with influenza coinfection (17.0 days) than for those without influenza coinfection (12.0 days) (P < .001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazards ratio of resolution in lung involvement was 1.878 (P = .020) for patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with those not administered lopinavir/ritonavir (95% confidence interval: 1.103-3.196). Among influenza coinfected patients, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited faster pneumonia resolution within 2 weeks after symptom onset (37% vs 1%; P = .001). There was no difference in lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir eliminated the difference of lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19.","Yu, Chong; Zhang, Zhiguo; Guo, Yujiao; Shi, Jing; Pei, Guangchang; Yao, Ying; Liao, Wenhui; Zeng, Rui",J Med Virol,,428

420643,SCAI initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: to examine the factors that, in the context of the current pandemic, have influenced the conduct of a randomized clinical trial on hydroxychloroquine in Italy. DESIGN: the trend of enrolment in the PROTECT study, ""A randomized study with Hydroxychloroquine versus observational support for prevention or early phase treatment of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)"" (Eudract number: 2020-001501-24, NCT04363827), conducted in the period from May to September 2020, was analysed to evaluate the possible association of the enrolment rate with the amount of information published in the national and local press on hydroxychloroquine. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the PROTECT clinical study is an Italian interventional superiority study, open label, with cluster randomization, aimed at evaluating whether treatment with hydroxychloroquine can reduce the percentage of symptomatic subjects compared to observation only in a population of subjects exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus consisting of cohabitants/contacts of COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects diagnosed with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the number of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients and the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Protect study from May to September 2020. RESULTS: from May to September 2020, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the PROTECT clinical trial showed a decrease consistent with the number of news on hydroxychloroquine appearing in the national and local press, starting from the time when the first criticisms of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine were made known; the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients showed a more marked and more timely decrease. CONCLUSIONS: in the context determined by the current COVID-19 pandemic, conducting a controlled clinical trial is strongly influenced by public opinion on scientific issues. Adherence to a clinical study can become highly problematic and invalidate the possibility of answering a scientific question and the validity of a project. In the current pandemic situation, randomized controlled trials may not always be the optimal tool to reach the expected scientific evidence, due to a number of problems. It is preferable to use a sequential or adaptive design. Furthermore, study protocols should implement innovative approaches that also include the involvement of participants in the decision-making process.

RESULTS: Total white blood cell count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients who died of COVID-19 than those who recovered from it (p < 0.05), but the total lymphocyte count, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells and natural killer cells were significantly lower when compared in the same groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased D-dimer, decreased CD4 + T cells and increased neutrophils were risk factors for mortality. Further multiple COX regression demonstrated that neutrophil &#8805; 5.27 × 109/L increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients after adjustment for age and gender. However, CD4 + T cells &#8805; 260/µL appeared to reduce the risk of death. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection led to a significant decrease of lymphocytes, and decreased CD4 + T cell count was a risk factor for COVID-19 patients to develop severe disease and death. METHODS: This study included 190 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from January 30, 2020 to March 4, 2020 in Wuhan, China, of whom 85 died and 105 recovered. Two researchers independently collected the clinical and laboratory data from electronic medical records.","Xiong, Liangkun; Zang, Xin; Feng, Guohe; Zhao, Fangfang; Wang, Shihong; Zeng, Wenhui; Yu, Kaihuan; Zhai, Yongzhen",Aging (Albany NY),,428
420754,Patellar resurfacing has minimal impact on in vitro tibiofemoral kinematics during deep knee flexion in total knee arthroplasty,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm and overwhelmed healthcare institutions even in developed countries. In response, clinical staff and resources have been redeployed to the areas of greatest need, that is, intensive care units and emergency rooms (ER), to reinforce front-line manpower. We introduce the concept of close air support (CAS) to augment ER operations in an efficient, safe and scalable manner. Teams of five comprising two on-site junior ER physicians would be paired with two CAS doctors, who would be off-site but be in constant communication via teleconferencing to render real-time administrative support. They would be supervised by an ER attending. This reduces direct viral exposure to doctors, conserves precious personal protective equipment and allows ER physicians to focus on patient care. Medical students can also be involved in a safe and supervised manner. After 1 month, the average time to patient disposition was halved. General feedback was also positive. CAS improves efficiency and is safe, scalable and sustainable. It has also empowered a previously untapped group of junior clinicians to support front-line medical operations, while simultaneously protecting them from viral exposure. Institutions can consider adopting our novel approach, with modifications made according to their local context.","Low, Tze Yi; Mathews, Ian; Lau, Joel Wen-Liang; Ngiam, Kee Yuan",Emerg Med J,,428
420855,Cytokines storm of COVID-19 and multi systemic organ failure: A review,2020,"(1) Background. The lockdown period due to the COVID−19 pandemic has drastically decreased levels of physical activity in the population. Hemophilia is characterized by hemarthrosis that leads to chronic, progressive and degenerative joint deterioration. (2) Methods. This observational study recruited 27 patients with hemophilia and arthropathy. Knee, ankle and elbow joints were assessed. The frequency of clinical hemarthrosis, pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, and joint ROM were evaluated. (3) Results. Following lockdown, a significant deterioration of joint condition, perceived joint pain and range of motion was noted in all joints. There were no changes in the frequency of knee hemarthrosis, while the frequency of ankle hemarthrosis significantly reduced. However, the frequency of elbow hemarthrosis increased. Depending on the degree of hemophilia severity, there were changes in pressure pain threshold in the elbow and in pain intensity and range of motion of the ankle joint. According to the type of treatment, i.e., prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment, there were differences in the joint condition in elbows and the plantar flexion movement of the ankle. There were no differences in the knee joint based on the severity of the disease, the type of treatment or the development of inhibitors (4). Conclusions. Because of the COVID−19 lockdown, the musculoskeletal status of patients with hemophilia deteriorated. Joint condition, perceived pain, and range of motion were significantly affected. The frequency of clinical hemarthrosis did not increase during this period. A more active therapeutic model could prevent rapid deterioration in patients with hemophilic arthropathy during prolonged sedentary periods.","Cuesta-Barriuso, Rubén Meroño-Gallut Javier Pérez-Llanes Raúl Ucero-Lozano Roberto",Healthcare,,428

Recently, various mathematical models have been used to predict the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide and also in India. In this article we use exponential, logistic, Gompertz growth and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India after the announcement of various unlock phases. The mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error comparative measures were used to check the goodness-of-fit of the growth models and Akaike information criterion for ARIMA model selection. Using COVID-19 pandemic data up to 20 December 2020 from India and its five most affected states (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala), we report 15-days-ahead forecasts for cumulative confirmed cases and the number of deaths. Based on available data, we found that the ARIMA model is the best-fitting model for COVID-19 cases in India and its most affected states.","Mangla, Sherry; Pathak, Ashok Kumar; Arshad, Mohd; Haque, Ubydul",International health (Online),,428

Moreover, situations of this kind are historically cyclical. The symptoms and treatment of infected patients are, for better or worse even for new viruses, always the same: more or less severe flu symptoms, isolation and full hygiene. By now man has learned how to manage epidemic situations, but deaths and negative effects continue to occur. What about technology? What effect has the actual technological progress we have achieved? In this review, we wonder about the role of robotics in the fight against COVID. It presents the analysis of scientific articles, industrial initiatives and project calls for applications from March to now highlighting how much robotics was ready to face this situation, what is expected from robots and what remains to do. RESULTS: The analysis was made by focusing on what research groups offer as a means of support for therapies and prevention actions.

Methods An electronic survey was developed to record the general characteristics of the laboratory, as well as the pre-analytical, analytical, post-analytical and operational practices of biochemistry laboratories that are managing clinical samples of patients with COVID-19. Results A total of 1210 submissions were included in the analysis. The majority of responses came from hospital central/core laboratories that serve hospital patient groups and handle moderate daily sample volumes. There has been a decrease in the use of pneumatic tube transport, increase in hand delivery and increase in number of layers of plastic bags for samples of patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Surgical face masks and gloves are the most commonly used personal protective equipment (PPE). Just >50% of the laboratories did not perform an additional decontamination step on the instrument after analysis of samples from patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A fifth of laboratories disallowed add-on testing on these samples. Less than a quarter of laboratories autoclaved their samples prior to disposal. Conclusions The survey responses showed wide variation in pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical practices in terms of PPE adoption and biosafety processes. It is likely that many of the suboptimal biosafety practices are related to practical local factors, such as limited PPE availability and lack of automated instrumentation.","Loh, Tze Ping; Horvath, Andrea Rita; Wang, Cheng-Bin; Koch, David; Lippi, Giuseppe; Mancini, Nicasio; Ferrari, Maurizio; Hawkins, Robert; Sethi, Sunil; Adeli, Khosrow",Clin. chem. lab. med,,428

421631,"Effect of COVID-19 lockdown on child protection medical assessments: a retrospective observational study in Birmingham, UK",2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a variable clinical course with significant mortality. Early reports suggested higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with type A blood and enrichment of type A individuals among COVID-19 mortalities. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study includes all patients hospitalized or with an emergency department (ED) visit who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 10, 2020 and June 8, 2020 and had a positive test result by nucleic acid test (NAT) performed on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. A total of 4968 patients met the study inclusion criteria, with a subsequent 23.1% (n = 1146/4968) all-cause mortality rate in the study cohort. To estimate overall risk by ABO type and account for the competing risks of in-hospital mortality and discharge, we calculated the cumulative incidence function (CIF) for each event. Cause-specific hazard ratios (csHRs) for in-hospital mortality and discharge were analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Type A blood was associated with the increased cause-specific hazard of death among COVID-19 patients compared to type O (HR = 1.17, 1.02-1.33, p = .02) and type B (HR = 1.32,1.10-1.58, p = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ABO histo-blood group type is associated with the risk of in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients, warranting additional inquiry. Elucidating the mechanism behind this association may reveal insights into the susceptibility and/or immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Szymanski, James; Mohrmann, Laurel; Carter, Jamal; Nelson, Randin; Chekuri, Sweta; Assa, Andrei; Spund, Brian; Reyes-Gil, Morayma; Uehlinger, Joan; Baron, Sarah; Paroder, Monika",Transfusion,,428

It therefore remains unclear up to what stellar mass this occurrence trend continues. The B-star Exoplanet Abundance Study (BEAST) is a direct imaging survey with the extreme adaptive optics instrument SPHERE, targeting 85 B-type stars in the young Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) region with the aim to detect giant planets at wide separations and constrain their occurrence rate and physical properties. The statistical outcome of the survey will help determine if and where an upper stellar mass limit for planet formation occurs. In this work, we describe the selection and characterization of the BEAST target sample. Particular emphasis is placed on the age of each system, which is a central parameter in interpreting direct imaging observations. We implement a novel scheme for age dating based on kinematic sub-structures within Sco-Cen, which complements and expands upon previous age determinations in the literature. We also present initial results from the first epoch observations, including the detections of ten stellar companions, of which six were previously unknown. All planetary candidates in the survey will need follow up in second epoch observations, which are part of the allocated observational programme and will be executed in the near future.","Janson, Markus; Squicciarini, Vito; Delorme, Philippe; Gratton, Raffaele; Bonnefoy, Mickael; Reffert, Sabine; Mamajek, Eric E.; Eriksson, Simon C.; Vigan, Arthur; Langlois, Maud; Engler, Natalia; Chauvin, Gael; Desidera, Silvano; Mayer, Lucio; Marleau, Gabriel-Dominique; Bohn, Alexander J.; Samland, Matthias; Meyer, Michael; d'Orazi, Valentina; Henning, Thomas; Quanz, Sascha; Kenworthy, Matthew; Carson, Joseph C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02043v1.pdf,428
424486,Persistence of viral RNA in stool samples from patients recovering from covid-19,2020,"PURPOSE: Metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) is an investigational treatment option in patients with oligorecurrent prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this retrospective study is to report oncologic outcome and toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) in PCa patients affected by pelvic nodal oligorecurrence. METHODS: 41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients. Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered using tomotherapy. 83% of the patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with ENRT. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. RESULTS: The median at follow-up was 33.6 months. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) were 89%, 92%, and 53%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all survival end-points were correlated with the number of positive pelvic lymph nodes at oligorecurrence (&#8804; 3 vs > 3). Biochemical-PFS was correlated with PSA (p = 0.034) and PSA doubling time (p = 0.004) at oligorecurrence. At multivariate analysis, no independent variable was statistically significant. No patient experienced grade &#8805; 2 late toxicity after radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The number of metastatic lymph nodes and PSA doubling time seems to be important prognostic factors in the pelvic oligorecurrent setting. Salvage radiotherapy combined with short-course ADT might be a valid treatment strategy.","Ingrosso, G; Mariucci, C; Tenti, M V; Bini, V; Alì, E; Saldi, S; Palumbo, I; Bellavita, R; Aristei, C",Clin. transl. oncol.

Owing to the increased co-morbidities and therefore worse COVID-19 outcomes for care home residents, it is important that we understand this increase and its future implications. We demonstrate the use of an SIS model where each nursing home is an infective unit capable of either being susceptible to an outbreak (S) or in an active outbreak (I). We use a generalized additive model to approximate the trend in growth rate of outbreaks in care homes and find the fit to be improved in a model where the growth rate is proportional to the number of current care home outbreaks compared with a model with a constant growth rate. Using parameters found from the outbreak-dependent growth rate, we predict a 73% prevalence of outbreaks in UK care homes without intervention as a reasonable worst-case planning assumption.

A cross-sectional epidemiological surveillance study was carried out in Kenya in 2017 to, 1) estimate MERS-CoV antibody seropositivity in the camel-dense counties of Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, Laikipia and Nakuru to identify, and 2) determine the risk factors associated with seropositivity in camels. Blood samples were collected from a total of 1421 camels selected using a multi-stage sampling method. Data were also collected from camel owners or herders using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. The sera from camel samples were tested for the presence of circulating antibodies to MERS-CoV using the anti-MERS-CoV IgG ELISA test. Univariate and multivariable statistical analysis were used to investigate factors potentially associated with MERS-CoV seropositivity in camels. The overall seropositivity in camel sera was 62.9 %, with the highest seropositivity recorded in Isiolo County (77.7 %), and the lowest seropositivity recorded in Nakuru County (14.0 %). When risk factors for seropositivity were assessed, the ""Type of camel production system"" {(aOR = 5.40(95 %CI: 1.67-17.49)}, ""Age between 1-2 years, 2-3 years and above 3 years"" {(aOR = 1.64 (95 %CI: 1.04-2.59}"", {(aOR = 3.27 (95 %CI: 3.66-5.61)}"" and {(aOR = 6.12 (95 %CI: 4.04-9.30)} respectively and ""Sex of camels"" {(aOR = 1.75 (95 %CI: 1.27-2.41)} were identified as significant predictors of MERS-CoV seropositivity. Our studies indicate a high level of seropositivity to MERS-CoV in camels in the counties surveyed, and highlights the important risk factors associated with MERS-CoV seropositivity in camels. Given that MERS-CoV is a zoonosis, and Kenya possesses the fourth largest camel population in Africa, these findings are important to inform the development of efficient and risk-based prevention and mitigation strategies against MERS-CoV transmission to humans.","Sitawa, Rinah; Folorunso, Fasina; Obonyo, Mark; Apamaku, Michael; Kiambi, Stella; Gikonyo, Stephen; Kiptiness, Joshua; Njagi, Obadiah; Githinji, Jane; Ngoci, James; VonDobschuetz, Sophie; Morzaria, Subhash; Ihab, ElMasry; Gardner, Emma; Wiersma, Lidewij; Makonnen, Yilma",Prev Vet Med,,428

We focused on S100B, a calcium-binding protein present in biological fluids, being a reliable biomarker in disorders having inflammatory processes as common basis and RAGE as main receptor. Since Covid-19 is characterized by a potent inflammatory response also involving RAGE, we tested if S100B serum levels were related to disease severity. Serum samples (n = 74) were collected from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to Covid center. Illness severity was established by admission clinical criteria and Covid risk score. Treatment protocols followed WHO guidelines available at the time. Circulating S100B was determined by ELISA assay. Statistical analysis used Pearson's &#967;2 test, t-Test, and ANOVA, ANCOVA, Linear Regression. S100B was detected in serum from Covid-19 patients, significantly correlating with disease severity as shown both by the level of intensity of care (p < 0.006) as well by the value of Covid score (Multiple R-squared: 0.3751); the correlation between Covid-Score and S100B was 0.61 (p < 0.01). S100B concentration was associated with inflammation markers (Ferritin, C-Reactive Protein, Procalcitonin), and organ damage markers (Alanine Aminotransferase, Creatinine). Serum S100B plays a role in Covid-19 and can represent a marker of clinical severity in Sars-CoV-2 infected patients.","Aceti, Antonio; Margarucci, Lory Marika; Scaramucci, Elena; Orsini, Massimiliano; Salerno, Gerardo; Di Sante, Gabriele; Gianfranceschi, Gianluca; Di Liddo, Rosa; Valeriani, Federica; Ria, Francesco; Simmaco, Maurizio; Parnigotto, Pier Paolo; Vitali, Matteo; Romano Spica, Vincenzo; Michetti, Fabrizio",Sci Rep,,428

Despite continuous reports of clinical trials being launched, no studies have yet systematically summarized and analysed their characteristics. Our objective is to do this by reviewing trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS: We searched the ClinicalTrials.gov database and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 registered up to and including 3 April 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the trials, presenting the results of all trials, all intervention trials and drug intervention (including vaccines and traditional Chinese medicine) trials. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 306 COVID-19-related clinical trials. Seven of the studies had been withdrawn, leaving 299 active trials. Of the trials, 28.8% were planned to be conducted in Asia, 26.8% in Europe and 18.7% in North America. Most (73.0%) proposed trials expected to recruit fewer than 500 people, and only 22.1% of the studies included children (aged <18 years). About two-thirds (67.2%) of the studies were funded by the own resources of medical or research institutions. Of intervention trials, 73.9% used random allocation, and 73.4% used parallel assignment. Only 36.7% of the intervention trials used blinding. In terms of drug trials, 147 trials were drug intervention studies, covering 80 conventional drugs and seven traditional Chinese medicine drugs. Antiviral drugs and antimalarial drugs were the most commonly studied drugs with 52 and 45 trials registered, respectively. Five registered clinical trials were on vaccines. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: A large number of COVID-19-related trials have been registered within the first 4 months since the first infection was reported. These involve a large number of different drugs, the most common being antiviral drugs and antimalarial drugs. More attention should be paid to adequate blinding in future trials.","Wang, Yuhui; Zhou, Qi; Xu, Mengqi; Kang, Jian; Chen, Yaolong",J. clin. pharm. ther,,428
430767,"Reply to: ""Biologics for psoriasis during COVID-19 outbreak""",2020,"Introduction: Clinical trial enrollment has declined globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This underscores the importance of structured methods to continue critical medical research safely and efficiently. Methods: We report the impact of a phased trial reopening strategy, remote research staffing, and telemedicine on cancer trial enrollment at one of the largest Radiation Oncology academic cancer centers. In Phase 1, trials investigating definitive therapeutic benefit were opened, followed by trials not increasing patient exposure or pulmonary toxicity risk in Phase 2. During Phase 2.5, multicenter trials reopened and limited research staff were allowed on-site. Results: Despite initial enrollment declines during the early pandemic, the percentage of new patients enrolling in clinical trials from March to August 2020 was 8.8%, and represented an 10.5% relative increase from 2019. Monthly accrual enrollment from March to August 2019 ranged from 42-71 compared to enrollment during COVID-19 from 23-73 patients (p<0.001). Conclusions: Through a phased approach to trial reopening and adaptive techniques, the Division of Radiation Oncology maintained cancer trial accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The experience may help centers maintain accrual, preserve clinical trial integrity, and minimize risk to patients and staff.","Yeboa, Debra Nana; Akinfenwa, Chidinma Anakwenze; Nguyen, Jonathan; Amaya, Diana; de Gracia, Beth; Ning, Matthew; Cox, Victoria; De, Brian; Smith, Benjamin D; Lin, Lili; Beddar, Sam; Hoang, Hanh; Koong, Albert; Liao, Zhongxing",Adv Radiat Oncol,,428

From March 1, 2020, six COVID-19 hubs and their spokes were designated. An interim analysis of cases occurring in or transferred to these hubs was performed on March 20, 2020 and recommendations were released on March 24, 2020. The vision of this strict organization was to centralize patients in high-risk maternity centers in order to concentrate human resources and personal protective equipment (PPE), dedicate protected areas of these major hospitals, and centralize clinical multidisciplinary experience with this disease. All maternity hospitals were informed to provide a protected labor and delivery room for nontransferable patients in advanced labor. A pre-triage based on temperature and 14 other items was developed in order to screen suspected patients in all hospitals to be tested with nasopharyngeal swabs. Obstetric outpatient facilities were instructed to maintain scheduled pregnancy screening as per Italian guidelines, and to provide pre-triage screening and surgical masks for personnel and patients for pre-triage-negative patients. Forty-two cases were recorded in the first 20 days of hub and spoke organization. The clinical presentation was interstitial pneumonia in 20 women. Of these, seven required respiratory support and eventually recovered. Two premature labors occurred.","Ferrazzi, Enrico M; Frigerio, Luigi; Cetin, Irene; Vergani, Patrizia; Spinillo, Arsenio; Prefumo, Federico; Pellegrini, Edda; Gargantini, Gianluigi",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,428

Infidelity is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for divorce. The increased stress brought on by the pandemic may be putting couples at an increased risk for experiencing infidelity, and data collected during the pandemic have shown that people across the United States are engaging in behaviors that are associated with a high likelihood of experiencing infidelity. The negative consequences of infidelity are also likely to be exacerbated for couples during the pandemic due to the intersection with the social, emotional, and financial consequences of COVID-19. Furthermore, couples are likely to experience disruptions and delays to the affair recovery process during the pandemic, which can negatively impact their ability to heal.

Among them, nucleocapsid protein (NCoV2) is one of the abundant proteins and shows multiple functions including packaging the RNA genome during the infection cycle. It has also emerged as a potential drug target. In this review, the current status of the research of NCoV2 is described in terms of molecular structure and dynamics. NCoV2 consists of two domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) with a disordered region between them. Recent simulation studies have identified several potential drugs that can bind to NTD or CTD with high affinity. Moreover, it was shown that the degree of flexibility in the disordered region has a large effect on drug binding rate, suggesting the importance of molecular flexibility for the NCoV2 function. Molecular flexibility has also been shown to be integral to the formation of droplets, where NCoV2, RNA and/or other viral proteins gather through liquid-liquid phase separation and considered important for viral replication. Finally, as one of the future research directions, a strategy for obtaining the structural and dynamical information on the proteins contained in droplets is presented.","Matsuo, Tatsuhito",Biology,,428

Using the variabilities in CO2 (&#916;CO2) and methane (&#916;CH4) observed at Hateruma Island, Japan during 1997-2020, we show a traceable CO2 emission reduction in China during February-March 2020. The monitoring station at Hateruma Island observes the outflow of Chinese emissions during winter and spring. A systematic increase in the &#916;CO2/&#916;CH4 ratio, governed by synoptic wind variability, well corroborated the increase in China's fossil-fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions during 1997-2019. However, the &#916;CO2/&#916;CH4 ratios showed significant decreases of 29 ± 11 and 16 ± 11 mol mol-1 in February and March 2020, respectively, relative to the 2011-2019 average of 131 ± 11 mol mol-1. By projecting these observed &#916;CO2/&#916;CH4 ratios on transport model simulations, we estimated reductions of 32 ± 12% and 19 ± 15% in the FFCO2 emissions in China for February and March 2020, respectively, compared to the expected emissions. Our data are consistent with the abrupt decrease in the economic activity in February, a slight recovery in March, and return to normal in April, which was calculated based on the COVID-19 lockdowns and mobility restriction datasets.","Tohjima, Yasunori; Patra, Prabir K; Niwa, Yosuke; Mukai, Hitoshi; Sasakawa, Motoki; Machida, Toshinobu",Sci Rep,,428
436909,Survey of AAHKS International Members on the Impact of COVID-19 on Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Practices,2020,"COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a global health issue with more than 2 million fatalities to date. Viral replication is shaped by the cellular microenvironment, and one important factor to consider is oxygen tension, in which hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) regulates transcriptional responses to hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, entering via its spike glycoprotein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We demonstrate that hypoxia and the HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor Roxadustat reduce ACE2 expression and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in lung epithelial cells via an HIF-1&#945;-dependent pathway. Hypoxia and Roxadustat inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are oxygen sensitive. This study highlights the importance of HIF signaling in regulating multiple aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and raises the potential use of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.","Wing, Peter A C; Keeley, Thomas P; Zhuang, Xiaodong; Lee, Jeffrey Y; Prange-Barczynska, Maria; Tsukuda, Senko; Morgan, Sophie B; Harding, Adam C; Argles, Isobel L A; Kurlekar, Samvid; Noerenberg, Marko; Thompson, Craig P; Huang, Kuan-Ying A; Balfe, Peter; Watashi, Koichi; Castello, Alfredo; Hinks, Timothy S C; James, William; Ratcliffe, Peter J; Davis, Ilan; Hodson, Emma J; Bishop, Tammie; McKeating, Jane A",Cell Rep,,428

In this prospective cohort study, 45 adults (19 chronic, 26 acute/subacute TMD) were recruited prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Baseline assessment took place before the outbreak while a follow-up was performed immediately after the lockdown period. Multiple variables were investigated including age, gender, perceived life quality, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, coping strategies, central sensitization, pain intensity, pain-related disability and oral behaviour. COVID Stress Scales (CSS) were applied at follow-up to measure the extent of COVID-related distress. CSS were significantly higher in those with chronic TMDs compared to those with acute/subacute TMDs (p<0.05). In people with chronic TMD, the variation in anxiety and depression from baseline to follow-up was significantly correlated with scores on the CSS (r = 0.72;p = 0.002). Variations of the central sensitization inventory (r = 0.57;p = 0.020) and graded chronic pain scale (r = 0.59;p = 0.017) were significantly correlated with scores on the CSS. These initial findings indicate that people with chronic TMD were more susceptible to COVID-19 distress with deterioration of psychological status, worsening features of central sensitization and increased chronic facial pain severity. These findings reinforce the role of stress as a possible amplifier of central sensitization, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and pain-related disability in people with TMDs.","Asquini, G.; Bianchi, A.

However, diarrhea pathogens have similar clinical symptoms and are difficult to diagnose clinically. Thus, fast and accurate diagnostic methods are of great significance for prevention and accurate treatment. In this study, we developed a one-step multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR for the differential diagnosis of four viruses causing canine diarrhea including, CPV (Canine Parvovirus 2), CCoV (Canine Coronavirus), CAstV (Canine Astrovirus), and CaKoV (Canine Kobuviruses). The limit of detection was up to 102copies/µL and performed well with high sensitivity and specificity. This assay was optimized and used to identify possible antagonistic relationships between viruses. From this, artificial pre-experiments were performed for mixed infections, and a total of 82 canine diarrhea field samples were collected from different animal hospitals in Zhejiang, China to assess the method. The virus prevalence was significantly higher than what previously reported based on RT-PCR(Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction). Taken together, these results suggest that the method can be used as a preferred tool for monitoring laboratory epidemics, timely prevention, and effective monitoring of disease progression.","Wang, Ruyi; Zhang, Wenyan; Ye, Rui; Pan, Zhongzhou; Li, Gairu; Su, Shuo",Mol Cell Probes,,428

OBJECTIVETo assess the effects of dexamethasone 12 mg versus 6 mg daily in patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTSWe conducted a parallel-grouped, stratified, blinded randomized trial including 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 receiving at least 10 l/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation in 26 hospitals in Europe and India from August 2020 to May 2021. INTERVENTIONSPatients were randomized 1:1 to masked intravenous dexamethasone 12 mg or dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support (i.e. invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support or renal replacement therapy) at 28 days. The primary analysis was adjusted for stratification variables (site, age below 70 years and invasive mechanical ventilation). RESULTSAfter exclusion of 18 patients who withdrew consent, there were 982 patients (613 in Europe, 369 in India) in the intention-to-treat population. We had primary outcome data for 971 patients; 491 assigned to dexamethasone 12 mg and 480 assigned to dexamethasone 6 mg. The median number of days alive without life support was 22.0 days (interquartile range 6.0-28.0) in the 12 mg group and 20.5 days (4.0-28.0) in the 6 mg group (adjusted mean difference 1.3 days, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0-2.6; P=0.066). Mortality at 28 days was 27.1% and 32.3% in patients assigned to 12 mg and 6 mg, respectively (adjusted relative risk 0.86, 99% CI, 0.68-1.08). Serious adverse reactions, including septic shock and invasive fungal infections, occurred in 11.3% versus 13.2% of patients in the 12 mg group and 6 mg group, respectively (adjusted relative risk 0.85, 99% CI, 0.55-1.32). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEAmong patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia, dexamethasone 12 mg did not result in statistically significantly more days alive without life support at 28 days than dexamethasone 6 mg.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how high-risk adults' COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, behaviors, and sense of preparedness changed from the onset of the US outbreak (March 13-20, 2020) to the acceleration phase (March 27-April 7, 2020). DESIGN: Longitudinal, two-wave telephone survey. PARTICIPANTS: 588 predominately older adults with &#8805; 1 chronic condition recruited from 4 active, federally funded studies in Chicago. MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention, related beliefs, behaviors, and sense of preparedness. KEY RESULTS: From the onset to the acceleration phase, participants increasingly perceived COVID-19 to be a serious public health threat, reported more changes to their daily routine and plans, and reported greater preparedness. The proportion of respondents who believed they were ""not at all likely"" to get the virus decreased slightly (24.9 to 22.4%; p = 0.04), but there was no significant change in the proportion of those who were unable to accurately identify ways to prevent infection (29.2 to 25.7%; p 0.14). In multivariable analyses, black adults and those with lower health literacy were more likely to report less perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 (black adults: relative risk (RR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-2.44, p = 0.02; marginal health literacy: RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.07, p < 0.01).

In the Capital, the Korean government applied the social distancing policy at level 2.5 for 8 days from August 30 to September 6, 2020. The Central Disease Relief Center explained that the reason the number of newly confirmed cases per day did not fall below 100 was because the infection spread nationwide through sporadic mass infections or asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a subject of constant controversies, as asymptomatic patients can infect other people while not showing any symptoms themselves. Their atypical clinical characteristics in the early stages of the disease make prevention more difficult. Additional studies on the infecting power of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic cases are needed.

441532,Postdischarge symptoms and rehabilitation needs in survivors of COVID-19 infection: A cross-sectional evaluation,2021,"Former studies have revealed intersex variability in immune response to infectious diseases, including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological surveillance of the ongoing pandemic has demonstrated a male vulnerability to morbidity and mortality, despite similar infection rates between the two sexes. Divergence in the frequency of comorbidities between males and females, differences in hormonal profile, chromosomal composition and gender behavior have all been proposed as potential causative factors. Data deriving from the immunization process indirectly support the existence of a sex-specific response to SARS-CoV-2, since females apparently produce higher numbers of antibodies while simultaneously exhibiting higher rates of side effects, indicating a stronger immune reactivity to the vaccine's elements. Interpreting intersex differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 pathophysiology and enable healthcare professionals to conduct a more accurate patient risk assessment and better predict the clinical outcome of the disease. This narrative review aims to discuss the pathophysiological and behavioral basis of the disproportionate male morbidity and mortality observed in COVID-19, in the context of most research findings in the field.","Pegiou, Stavroula; Rentzeperi, Elpiniki; Koufakis, Theocharis; Metallidis, Symeon; Kotsa, Kalliopi",Microbes Infect,,428

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is limited information on COVID-19, and treatment has so far focused on supportive care and use of repurposed drugs. COVID-19 can be transmitted via person-to-person contact through droplet spread. Some of the recommended precautionary measures to reduce the rate of disease spread include social distancing, good hygiene practices, and avoidance of crowded areas. These measures are effective because the droplets are heavy and can only travel approximately 1 meter in the air, settling quickly on fixed surfaces. Promising strategies to combat SARS-CoV-2 include discovery of therapeutic targets/drugs and vaccines. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of COVID-19.

To understand the relationships among these unique features and the transcriptional adaptation of the organism to CO, we performed a transcriptome analysis of C. maritimus KKC1 grown under 100% CO and N2 conditions. Of its 3114 genes, 58 and 32 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated in the presence of CO, respectively. A cooS-ech gene cluster, an ""orphan"" cooS gene, and bidirectional hyd genes were upregulated under CO, whereas hydrogen-uptake hyd genes were downregulated. Transcriptional changes in anaerobic respiratory genes supported the broad usage of electron acceptors in C. maritimus KKC1 under CO metabolism. Overall, the majority of the differentially expressed genes were oxidoreductase-like genes, suggesting metabolic adaptation to the cellular redox change upon CO oxidation. Moreover, our results suggest a transcriptional response mechanism to CO that involves multiple transcription factors, as well as a CO-responsive transcriptional activator (CooA). Our findings shed light on the diverse mechanisms for transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to CO in CO-utilizing and hydrogen-evolving bacteria.","Inoue, Masao; Izumihara, Hikaru; Fukuyama, Yuto; Omae, Kimiho; Yoshida, Takashi; Sako, Yoshihiko","Extremophiles (Tokyo, Print)",,428

Both for physicians and politicians as a base for decisions to treat the disease. The responsible estimation of parameters is a main issue of mathematical pandemic models. Especially a good choice of $\beta$ as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown. As example of the parameter choice serve the data of the USA and the UK. The resulting parameters will be used estimated and used in W.\,O. Kermack and A.\,G. McKendrick's SIR model. Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed. The numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being done with a Runge-Kutta integration method of fourth order. At the end the applicability of the SIR model could be shown essentially.

For a better understanding of the mechanism of attenuation of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), in this study, we assessed whether prM/E is critical neurovirulence determinants of JEV with infectious cDNA clones technique. Substitutions prM/E of vaccine strain with that of WT SA14 did significantly increase the virulence of JEV to the similar level of wild type SA14, and simultaneously, replacement prM/E of JEV WT strain SA14 with that of vaccine strain SA14-14-2 decreased the virulence of JEV significantly to the similar level of vaccine stain.

However, the metabolic response of a non-diabetic cohort to metformin treatment has not been studied. Here, we show in C. elegans and human primary cells that metformin shortens lifespan when provided in late life, contrary to its positive effects in young organisms. We find that metformin exacerbates ageing-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, causing respiratory failure. Age-related failure to induce glycolysis and activate the dietary-restriction-like mobilization of lipid reserves in response to metformin result in lethal ATP exhaustion in metformin-treated aged worms and late-passage human cells, which can be rescued by ectopic stabilization of cellular ATP content. Metformin toxicity is alleviated in worms harbouring disruptions in insulin-receptor signalling, which show enhanced resilience to mitochondrial distortions at old age. Together, our data show that metformin induces deleterious changes of conserved metabolic pathways in late life, which could bring into question its benefits for older individuals without diabetes.","Espada, Lilia; Dakhovnik, Alexander; Chaudhari, Prerana; Martirosyan, Asya; Miek, Laura; Poliezhaieva, Tetiana; Schaub, Yvonne; Nair, Ashish; Döring, Nadia; Rahnis, Norman; Werz, Oliver; Koeberle, Andreas; Kirkpatrick, Joanna; Ori, Alessandro; Ermolaeva, Maria A",Nat Metab,,428

455590,A Survey of Hospitalized Trauma Patients in Hemorrhage Control Education: Are Trauma Victims Willing to Stop the Bleed?,2021,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolutionized the field of immuno-oncology and opened new avenues towards the development of novel assets to achieve durable immune control of cancer. Yet, the presence of tumor immune evasion mechanisms represents a challenge for the development of efficient treatment options. Therefore, combination therapies are taking the center of the stage in immuno-oncology. Such combination therapies should boost anti-tumor immune responses and/or target tumor immune escape mechanisms, especially those created by major players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Natural killer (NK) cells were recently positioned at the forefront of many immunotherapy strategies, and several new approaches are being designed to fully exploit NK cell antitumor potential. One of the most relevant NK cell-activating receptors is NKG2D, a receptor that recognizes 8 different NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), including MICA and MICB. MICA and MICB are poorly expressed on normal cells but become upregulated on the surface of damaged, transformed or infected cells as a result of post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms and intracellular pathways. Their engagement of NKG2D triggers NK cell effector functions. Also, MICA/B are polymorphic and such polymorphism affects functional responses through regulation of their cell-surface expression, intracellular trafficking, shedding of soluble immunosuppressive isoforms, or the affinity of NKG2D interaction. Although immunotherapeutic approaches that target the NKG2D-NKG2DL axis are under investigation, several tumor immune escape mechanisms account for reduced cell surface expression of NKG2DL and contribute to tumor immune escape. Also, NKG2DL polymorphism determines functional NKG2D-dependent responses, thus representing an additional challenge for leveraging NKG2DL in immuno-oncology. In this review, we discuss strategies to boost MICA/B expression and/or inhibit their shedding and propose that combination strategies that target MICA/B with antibodies and strategies aimed at promoting their upregulation on tumor cells or at reprograming TAM into pro-inflammatory macrophages and remodeling of the TME, emerge as frontrunners in immuno-oncology because they may unleash the antitumor effector functions of NK cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL). Pursuing several of these pipelines might lead to innovative modalities of immunotherapy for the treatment of a wide range of cancer patients.","Fuertes, Mercedes Beatriz; Domaica, Carolina Inés; Zwirner, Norberto Walter",Front Immunol,,428

In addition, we find that the negative effect is reduced for firms that report an expectation that an outbreak will increase revenues and for firms with a strong corporate social responsibility practice. We believe our study is the first paper to assess cross-sectional stock price reactions to COVID-19 as a function of the state-level impact of the pandemic outbreak.","Pham, Anh Viet; Adrian, Christofer; Garg, Mukesh; Phang, Soon-Yeow; Truong, Cameron",Financ Res Lett,,428
456555,"Physiotherapist adaptations to cancer, HIV/AIDS, and hospice and palliative care in the COVID-19 Era: A global perspective paper",2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes. METHODS: We identified 197 patients with COVID-19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre-existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44-11.51], p < 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03-0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36-0.49]). INTERPRETATION: This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID-19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

456792,Digital Connectivity: The Sixth Vital Sign,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are closely related. The effect of AKI on the clinical outcomes of these two conditions is unclear. METHODS: This retrospective, territory-wide cohort study used an electronic public healthcare database in Hong Kong to identify patients with SARS or COVID-19 by diagnosis codes, virologic results, or both. The primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death. RESULTS: We identified 1670 patients with SARS and 1040 patients with COVID-19 (median ages, 41 versus 35 years, respectively). Among patients with SARS, 26% met the primary endpoint versus 5.3% of those with COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus, abnormal liver function, and AKI were factors significantly associated with the primary endpoint among patients with either SARS or COVID-19. Among patients with SARS, 7.9%, 2.1%, and 3.7% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively; among those with COVID-19, 6.6%, 0.4%, and 1.1% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively. In both groups, factors significantly associated with AKI included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Among patients with AKI, those with COVID-19 had a lower rate of major adverse clinical outcomes versus patients with SARS. Renal function recovery usually occurred within 30 days after an initial AKI event. CONCLUSIONS: AKI rates were higher among patients with SARS than those with COVID-19. AKI was associated with major adverse clinical outcomes for both diseases. Patients with diabetes mellitus and abnormal liver function were also at risk of developing severe consequences after SARS and COVID-19 infection.","Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Yip, Terry Cheuk-Fung; Lui, Grace Chung-Yan; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Ho, Tracy Hang-Yee; Li, Timothy Chun-Man; Tse, Yee-Kit; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Ng, Chi-Fai; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Chan, Henry Lik-Yuen; Szeto, Cheuk-Chun; Wong, Grace Lai-Hung",J.

Whether active oncologic treatment is an additional risk factor in this population remains unclear. Therefore, here we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence for the effect of active oncologic treatment on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Systematic search of databases (PubMed, Embase) was conducted for studies published from inception to July 1, 2020, with a subsequent search update conducted on 10 October 2020. In addition, abstracts and presentations from major conference proceedings (ASCO, ESMO, AACR) as well as pre-print databases (medxriv, bioxriv) were searched. Retrospective and prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes in cancer patients with laboratory confirmation or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and details of active or recent oncologic treatment were selected. Random-effects model was applied throughout meta-analyses. Summary outcome measure was the pooled odds ratio (OR) of death for active cancer therapy versus no active cancer therapy for each of the following modalities: recent surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy. RESULTS: Sixteen retrospective and prospective studies (3558 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Active chemotherapy was associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.14-2.23). No significant association with risk of death was identified for active targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or recent surgery. Meta-analysis of multivariate adjusted OR of death for active chemotherapy was consistently associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.01-2.01). CONCLUSIONS: Active chemotherapy appears to be associated with higher risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19. Further research is necessary to characterize the complex interactions between active cancer treatment and COVID-19.","Park, Robin; Lee, Sul A; Kim, Seong Yoon; de Melo, Andreia Cristina; Kasi, Anup",Acta Oncol,,428

461259,Does COVID-19 influence sexual behaviors?,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus causing an outbreak in the twenty-first century. It is related to a contagious coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which its high pace of spreading allowed it to lie to the whole world and be turned into a pandemic only a few months after the identification of the first case. Currently, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of throat swap is the gold standard of diagnosis; however, several studies have reported false-negative results with non-ideal sensitivity. Because this pandemic constitutes a significant burden on global healthcare systems and due to the high transmission rate of the virus, an accurate diagnosis algorithm is needed to reduce the missing case number. A comprehensive clinical examination and taking a history of all systems (not just limited to the respiratory system) combined with hematologic laboratory tests and chest imaging can lead to a sensitive diagnosis, severity assessment, and RT-PCT test interpretation. This chapter focuses on clinical characteristics, hematologic laboratory, and chest imaging features in COVID-19.","Eskian, Mahsa; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,428
463940,Past as Prologue: The Effects of the COVID-19 Economic Downturn on Medicaid Coverage for Podiatry Services,2020,"Introduction: On June 2020, the first case of concurrent Covid-19 and Kawasaki disease (KD) was published. After this first description, further works reported new cases of children affected by KD and KD-like syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical and biochemical features of these patients differed from the historical cohorts of KD, suggesting the possibility of a new multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome. Is still unclear if this new clinical entity, often referred as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), could be considered as part of the KD spectrum or is a new disease with different pathogenic mechanisms and uniquely linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors searched the available literature in MedLine (via Pubmed) with the terms ('coronaviruses' OR 'coronavirus') AND ('Kawasaki disease') for English studies without any temporal limit. Areas covered: This review aims to comprehensively describe multisystem inflammatory syndromes affecting children during Coronaviruses outbreak, and to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of human Coronaviridae in KD and KD-like syndromes. Expert opinion: An increased incidence of PIMS-TS, during the Covid-19 pandemic has been reported, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a severe hyper-inflammatory syndrome in childhood. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease are still unclear. Based on these findings, SARS-CoV-2 may be considered another trigger in the complex mosaic about the relationship among infectious agents and the occurrence of systemic hyper-inflammation related syndromes.","Berardicurti, Onorina; Conforti, Alessandro; Ruscitti, Piero; Cipriani, Paola; Giacomelli, Roberto",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,428

464323,Pharmacists' satisfaction with their involvement in the management of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,2021,"In addition to providing life-giving nutrients and other substances to the breastfed infant, human milk can also represent a vehicle of pathogen transfer. As such, when an infectious disease outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic occurs-particularly when it is associated with a novel pathogen-the question will naturally arise as to whether the pathogen can be transmitted through breastfeeding. Until high-quality data are generated to answer this question, abandonment of breastfeeding due to uncertainty can result. The COVID-19 pandemic, which was in full swing at the time this document was written, is an excellent example of this scenario. During these times of uncertainty, it is critical for investigators conducting research to assess the possible transmission of pathogens through milk, whether by transfer through the mammary gland or contamination from respiratory droplets, skin, breast pumps, and milk containers, and/or close contact between mother and infant. To promote the most rigorous science, it is critical to outline optimal methods for milk collection, handling, storage, and analysis in these situations, and investigators should openly share their methods in published materials. Otherwise, the risks of inconsistent test results from preanalytical and analytical variation, false positives, and false negatives are unacceptably high and the ability to provide public health guidance poor.

465085,Effective prevention and management of COVID-19 in outpatient hemodialysis patients,2020,"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities, the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, which allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. By the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.","Kim, Byungwon; Kim, Seonghong; Jang, Woncheol; Jung, Sungkyu; Lim, Johan",PLoS One,,428

The purpose of this report is to describe responses by a sample of chiropractors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used a qualitative-constructivist design to understand chiropractic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, as described by the participants. A sample of chiropractic practitioners (doctors of chiropractic, chiropractors) from various international locations were invited to participate. Each described the public health response to COVID-19 in their location and the actions that they took in their chiropractic practices from April 20 through May 4, 2020. A summary report was created from their responses and common themes were identified. RESULTS: Eighteen chiropractic practitioners representing 17 locations and 11 countries participated. A variety of practice environments were represented in this sample, including, solo practice, mobile practice, private hospital, US Veterans Administration health care, worksite health center, and group practice. They reported that they recognized and abided by changing governmental regulations. They observed their patients experience increased stress and mental health concerns resulting from the pandemic. They adopted innovative strategies, such as telehealth, to do outreach, communicate with, and provide care for patients. They abided by national and World Health Organization recommendations and they adopted creative strategies to maintain connectivity with patients through a people-centered, integrated, and collaborative approach. CONCLUSION: Although the chiropractors in this sample practiced in different cities and countries, their compliance with local regulations, concern for staff and patient safety, and people-centered responses were consistent. This sample covers all 7 World Federation of Chiropractic regions (ie, African, Asian, Eastern Mediterranean, European, Latin American, North American, and Pacific) and provides insights into measures taken by chiropractors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we empirically compared two SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies. METHODS: We used data from a Swiss single-centre, outpatient cohort study (n = 6,331 test results). A ""restricted"" strategy was applied to individuals with respiratory symptoms and/or fever and selected risk factors, or an epidemiological link and an ""extended"" strategy included any clinical symptoms without restriction, irrespective of risk factors and exposure. Data on infection, symptoms, viral load were collected during the first wave (March 11-April 21, 2020) and patients were followed up for clinical complications and hospitalisations until August 31, 2020. FINDINGS: Infection, clinical complications, and hospitalisation rates were lower for those in the extended strategy compared with the restricted strategy (17.2% vs. 25.0%, 12.3% vs. 20.8%, and 0.7% vs. 2.3%). In the whole cohort, participants included in the extended strategy had a lower number of symptoms (3.51 vs. 4.57; p < .001) and visits occurred earlier after symptom onset (0-3 days: 59.2% vs. 44.2%; p < .001). Among positive cases, the viral load was higher for the extended strategy (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlighted the crucial importance to implement a widespread testing strategy to achieve a better understanding of the infection, to mount an effective control response, by capturing people when their viral load is highest. A widespread test strategy should be available without barriers to help break the chains of transmission.","Baggio, Stéphanie; Spechbach, Hervé; Vernaz, Nathalie; Guessous, Idris; Gétaz, Laurent; Kaiser, Laurent; Chappuis, François; Salamun, Julien; Jacquerioz, Frédérique",PLoS One,,428
467940,Urticaria multiforme-like: a COVID-19 infection,2020,"The great majority of globally circulating pathogens go undetected, undermining patient care and hindering outbreak preparedness and response. To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples1-3 while simultaneously testing for many pathogens4-6. Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents7 self-organize in a microwell array8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health9-11.","Ackerman, Cheri M; Myhrvold, Cameron; Thakku, Sri Gowtham; Freije, Catherine A; Metsky, Hayden C; Yang, David K; Ye, Simon H; Boehm, Chloe K; Kosoko-Thoroddsen, Tinna-Sólveig F; Kehe, Jared; Nguyen, Tien G; Carter, Amber; Kulesa, Anthony; Barnes, John R; Dugan, Vivien G; Hung, Deborah T; Blainey, Paul C; Sabeti, Pardis C",Nature,,428

An online survey was administered to PWMDs to elicit what possible flexible opportunities could enable them to gain or stay at work. Interviews were also conducted with human resource managers and financial managers. Our results show that there are currently no flexible working opportunities available for PWMDs, which could enable them work effectively to improve both self and general economic growth. The findings of this study will enable employers to explore the financial benefits of employing PWMDs and also aid the government to create better policies to boost employers' commitment to employing PWMDs and achieve some of the UN SDGs.","Warmate, Zoe Mohamed Khaled Eldaly Elamer Ahmed A.",Business Strategy and the Environment,,428

Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.","Sezgin, Emre; Militello, Lisa K; Huang, Yungui; Lin, Simon",Transl Behav Med,,428
471635,COVID-19 in 3 people living with HIV in the United Kingdom,2020,"Hydration of aromatic molecules is a fundamental chemical process. Herein, microhydration framework of the prototypical neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), naphthalene (naphthalene-(water)n&#8804;3), is investigated by infrared spectroscopy inside helium nanodroplets. The measured data are analyzed by quantum chemical calculations at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. This combined experimental and theoretical approach demonstrates that water binds to the naphthalene ring via &#960; hydrogen bond (H-bond) for n = 1 case. Further addition of the solvent molecules occurs via the formation of a H-bonded water network facilitated by the nonadditive cooperative force. No isomers are observed in which the solvent molecules separately bind to the aromatic ring. For n = 3 case, we observe the formation of a cyclic H-bonded water moiety. Comparison with corresponding cationic and anionic naphthalene±-(water)n clusters demonstrates the charge-induced modification of the hydration motif. Our results are further compared with the prototypical benzene-(water)n complexes to comprehend the effect of an additional phenyl ring on the solvation network.","Chatterjee, Kuntal; Roy, Tarun Kumar; Khatri, Jai; Schwaab, Gerhard; Havenith, Martina",PCCP.

472679,The Relationship between Status at Presentation and Outcomes among Pregnant Women with COVID-19,2020,"The human ß-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It causes Covid-19 disease which has become pandemic. Each of the five-known human ß-coronaviruses has four major structural proteins (E, M, N and S) and 16 non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b together (ORF1ab) that are involved in virus pathogenicity and infectivity. Here, we performed detailed positive selection analyses for those six genes among the four previously known human ß-coronaviruses and within 38 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to assess signatures of adaptive evolution using maximum likelihood approaches. Our results suggest that three genes (E, S and ORF1ab genes) are under strong signatures of positive selection among human ß-coronavirus, influencing codons that are located in functional important protein domains. The E protein-coding gene showed signatures of positive selection in two sites, Asp 66 and Ser 68, located inside a putative transmembrane &#945;-helical domain C-terminal part, which is preferentially composed by hydrophilic residues. Such Asp and Ser sites substitutions (hydrophilic residues) increase the stability of the transmembrane domain in SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, substitutions in the spike (S) protein S1 N-terminal domain have been found, all of them were located on the S protein surface, suggesting their importance in viral transmissibility and survival. Furthermore, evidence of strong positive selection was detected in three of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP16), which are encoded by ORF1ab and play vital roles in suppressing host translation machinery, viral replication and transcription and inhibiting the host immune response. These results are insightful to assess the role of positive selection in the SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins, which will allow to better understand the virulent pathogenicity of the virus and potentially identifying targets for drug or vaccine strategy design.","Emam, Mohamed; Oweda, Mariam; Antunes, Agostinho; El-Hadidi, Mohamed",Virus Res,,428

474771,"COVID-19 vaccine coverage in health-care workers in England and effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against infection (SIREN): a prospective, multicentre, cohort study",2021,"A recent update to the Geneva Declaration's 'Physician Pledge' involves the ethical requirement of physicians to share medical knowledge for the benefit of patients and healthcare. With the spread of COVID-19, pockets exist in every country with different viral expressions. In the Chareidi ('ultra-orthodox') religious community, for example, rates of COVID-19 transmission and dissemination are above average compared with other communities within the same countries. While viral spread in densely populated communities is common during pandemics, several reasons have been suggested to explain the blatant flouting of public health regulations. It is easy to fault the Chareidi population for their proliferation of COVID-19, partly due to their avoidance of social media and internet aversion. However, the question remains: who is to blame for their community crisis? The ethical argument suggests that from a public health perspective, the physician needs to reach out and share medical knowledge with the community. The public's best interests are critical in a pandemic and should supersede any considerations of cultural differences. By all indications, therefore, the physician has an ethical obligation to promote population healthcare and share medical knowledge based on ethical concepts of beneficence, non-maleficence, utilitarian ethics as well as social, procedural and distributive justice. This includes the ethical duty to reduce health disparities and convey the message that individual responsibility for health has repercussions within the context of broader social accountability. Creative channels are clearly demanded for this ethical challenge, including measured medical paternalism with appropriate cultural sensitivity in physician community outreach.","Strous, Rael D; Karni, Tami",J Med Ethics,,428

Face masks are believed to protect people from infection by blocking those droplets. However, current filtration efficiency tests can't evaluate masks under sneeze-like pressure. The goal of this study was to establish a method to evaluate the filtration efficiency of mask materials under extreme conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Efficiency of surgical masks, gauze masks, gauze, cotton, silk, linen and tissue paper on blocking micro-droplet sized starch particles (average 8.2 µm) and latex microspheres (0.75 µm) with a velocity of 44.4 m/s created by centrifugation was qualitatively analyzed by using imaging-based analysis. RESULTS: The 4 layers of silk could block 93.8% of microspheres and 88.9% of starch particles, followed by the gauze mask (78.5% of microspheres and 90.4% of starch particles) and the 2 layers of cotton (74.6% of microspheres and 87.5-89.0% of particles). Other materials also blocked 53.2-66.5% of microspheres and 76.4%-87.9% of particles except the 8 layers of gauze which only blocked 36.7% of particles. The filtration efficiency was improved by the increased layers of materials. CONCLUSION: Centrifugation-based filtration efficiency test not only compensates shortcomings of current tests for masks, but also offers a simple way to explore new mask materials during pandemics. Common mask materials can potentially provide protection against respiratory droplet transmission.","Xiao, L I; Sakagami, Hiroshi; Miwa, Nobuhiko",In Vivo,,428

Why is understanding the incubation period of COVID-19 important? How long is the incubation time, and what are the associating factors? How should the incubation period be modeled given the current pandemic situation? Where should we go from here? As a critical epidemiological metric, the incubation period is of public health and clinical importance. While the incubation time of COVID-19 is generally similar to that of SARS and MERS, recent studies identifying factors that impact the incubation period of COVID-19, travel history, for example, only tell part of the story.

We present a tool focusing on structure-based discovery and display of these groups. RESULTS: Since prediction of buried group pKas is computationally intensive, solvent accessibility of ionizable groups is displayed, from which the user can iteratively select pKa calculation centers. Results are color-coded, with emphasis on buried groups. Utility is demonstrated with benchmarking against known pH sensing sites in influenza virus hemagglutinin and in variants of murine hepatitis virus, a coronavirus. A pair of histidine residues that are conserved in coronavirus spike proteins are predicted to be electrostatically frustrated at acidic pH in both pre- and post-fusion conformations. We suggest that an intermediate expanded conformation at endosomal pH could relax the frustration, allowing histidine protonation, and facilitating conformational conversion of coronavirus spike protein.

However, the extent of this effect requires further investigation. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and the case fatality rate (CFR) of patients with COVID-19. The data on air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, SO2 , NO2 , and O3 from 14 major cities in China in the past 5 years (2015-2020) were collected, and the CRF of COVID-19 patients in these cities was calculated. First, we investigated the correlation between CFR and long-term air quality indicators. Second, we examined the air pollutants affecting CFR and evaluated their predictive values. We found a positive correlation between the CFR and AQI (1, 3, and 5 years), PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years), and PM10 (1, 3, and 5 years). Further analysis indicated the more significant correlation for both AQI (3 and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) with CFR, and moderate predictive values for air pollution indicators such as AQI (1, 3, and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) for CFR. Our results indicate that long-term exposure to severe air pollution is associated with higher CFR of COVID-19 patients. Air pollutants such as PM2.5 may assist with the prediction of CFR for COVID-19 patients.","Hou, Chang-Kai; Qin, Ya-Fei; Wang, Grace; Liu, Quan-Lei; Yang, Xin-Yu; Wang, Hao",J Med Virol,,428

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and tree topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after 4 months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineage formation, despite the low phylogenetic signal since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated as 1.37 × 10-3 and 2.19 × 10-3 substitution/site/year, respectively. In conclusion, results from this study about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential features of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow the first-time characterization of the evolutionary rate of S protein, crucial for vaccine development.","Pereson, Matías J; Mojsiejczuk, Laura; Martínez, Alfredo P; Flichman, Diego M; Garcia, Gabriel H; Di Lello, Federico A",J. med. virol,,428

Its inhibitory activity supersedes that of paromomycin, which is extensively used in treating cryptosporidiosis. Through the per-residue energy decomposition approach, crucial moieties of P131 were identified and subsequently adopted to create a pharmacophore model for virtual screening in the ZINC database. This search generated eight ADMET-compliant hits that were examined thoroughly to fit into the active site of CpIMPDH via molecular docking. Three compounds ZINC46542062, ZINC58646829, and ZINC89780094, with favorable docking scores of - 8.3 kcal/mol, - 8.2 kcal/mol, and - 7.5 kcal/mol, were selected. The potential inhibitory mechanism of these compounds was probed using molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) analyses. Results revealed that one of the hits (ZINC46542062) exhibited a lower binding free energy of - 39.52 kcal/mol than P131, which had - 34.6 kcal/mol. Conformational perturbation induced by the binding of the identified hits to CpIMPDH was similar to P131, suggesting a similarity in inhibitory mechanisms. Also, in silico investigation of the properties of the hit compounds implied superior physicochemical properties with regards to their synthetic accessibility, lipophilicity, and number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in comparison with P131. ZINC46542062 was identified as a promising hit compound with the highest binding affinity to the target protein and favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties relative to P131. The identified compounds can serve as a basis for conducting further experimental investigations toward the development of anticryptosporidials, which can overcome the challenges of existing therapeutic options.

Whereas the policies are similar across countries, country characteristics vary substantially. We examine the effectiveness of such policies using a cross-country variation in socio-economic, environmental and geographic, and health system dimensions. The effectiveness of policies that prescribe closures of schools and workplaces is declining with population density, country surface area, employment rate and proportion of elderly in the population; and increasing with GDP per capita and health expenditure. Cross-country human mobility data reinforce some of these results. We argue that the findings can be explained by behavioural response to risk perceptions and resource constraints. Voluntary practice of social distancing might be less prevalent in communities with lower perceived risk, associated with better access to health care and smaller proportion of elderly population. Higher population density, larger geographical area, and higher employment rate may require more resources to ensure compliance with lockdown policies.","Castex, Gonzalo; Dechter, Evgenia; Lorca, Miguel",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,,428

METHODS: In this parallel-group, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled, single-center trial, patients with PD with positive HP urea breath test and serology were block randomized (1:1) to receive standard eradication triple therapy or identically appearing placebo capsules for 1 week. Prespecified motor (International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], timed tests, and home-based wearable sensor measurements), nonmotor (Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and quality-of-life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39) outcome measures were assessed at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 52. The primary outcome was the baseline-to-week 12 change in ON medication MDS-UPDRS motor scores. Lactulose-hydrogen breath testing for concomitant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was performed at baseline and repeated at week 24, together with the urea breath test. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients were screened for eligibility and 80 were randomly assigned, of whom 67 were included in the full-analysis set (32 treatment group patients, 35 placebo patients). HP eradication did not improve MDS-UPDRS motor scores at week 12 (mean difference 2.6 points in favor of placebo, 95% confidence interval: -0.4 to 5.6, P = 0.089). There was no significant improvement in any motor, nonmotor, or quality-of-life outcome at weeks 12 and 52. Both the full-analysis and per-protocol analyses (based on eradication status) supported these conclusions. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth status did not influence treatment results.

In this setting, however, the role that social and behavioral risk factors play in COVID-19 outcomes is unclear. Objective: To examine whether social and behavioral risk factors were associated with mortality among US veterans with COVID-19 and whether this association might be modified by race/ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study obtained data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to form a cohort of veterans who received a positive COVID-19 test result between March 2 and September 30, 2020, in a VA health care facility. All veterans who met the inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in the study, and participants were followed up for 30 days after the first SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 diagnosis. The final follow-up date was October 31, 2020. Exposures: Social risk factors included housing problems and financial hardship. Behavioral risk factors included current tobacco use, alcohol use, and substance use. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality in the 30-day period after the SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 diagnosis date. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, clustering for health care facilities and adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, clinical factors, and month of COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Among 27â¯640 veterans with COVID-19 who were included in the analysis, 24â¯496 were men (88.6%) and the mean (SD) age was 57.2 (16.6) years. A total of 3090 veterans (11.2%) had housing problems, 4450 (16.1%) had financial hardship, 5358 (19.4%) used alcohol, and 3569 (12.9%) reported substance use. Hospitalization occurred in 7663 veterans (27.7%), and 1230 veterans (4.5%) died. Housing problems (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19; P = .70), financial hardship (AOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.31; P = .11), alcohol use (AOR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.01; P = .06), current tobacco use (AOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68-1.06; P = .14), and substance use (AOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.71-1.15; P = .41) were not associated with higher mortality. Interaction analyses by race/ethnicity did not find associations between mortality and social and behavioral risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study showed that, in an integrated health system such as the VA, social and behavioral risk factors were not associated with mortality from COVID-19. Further research is needed to substantiate the potential of an integrated health system to be a model of support services for households with COVID-19 and populations who are at risk for the disease.","Kelly, J Daniel; Bravata, Dawn M; Bent, Stephen; Wray, Charlie M; Leonard, Samuel J; Boscardin, W John; Myers, Laura J; Keyhani, Salomeh",JAMA Netw Open,,428
481631,Emergency 3-Dimensional-Printed Devices for Splitting Ventilators in Lungs With Different Compliances: An In Vitro Study,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 remains a prominent threat to human lives despite the recent approval of vaccines and antibodies across the world. There is also a growing concern of mutations in the virus that demand effective strategies to combat infection. SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via its surface Spike glycoprotein (SgP), a homo-trimeric assembly of S1 and S2 subunits, that binds to cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thereby gaining viral entry. SgP also utilizes the cell surface bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to enhance the efficiency of viral entry. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit interacts with both the ACE2 receptor as well as the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPGs. HS is a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that has been recognized as a crucial factor in the infectivity of numerous viruses. Our early work suggested that of the numerous structural possibilities, 3-O-sulfated (3-OS) sequences of HS may be involved in better recognition of SgP (bioRxiv (2020) DOI:10.1101/2020.10.08.331751). Large-scale computational analysis based on our in-house developed genetic algorithm-based dual filtering strategy indicated that HS more favorably interacts with the RBD compared to other electropositive regions in the SgP trimer. The results suggested that the RBD of SgP prefers to recognize optimal three-dimensional factors governed by chain length and sulfation pattern of HS sequences. Microarray screening of 24 distinct HS sequences against the S1 and RBD domains resulted in only eight sequences displaying reasonable affinity for the RBD, which were significantly weaker for the S1 subunit. Of these, two containing 3-O?S sequences exhibited some of the highest signals on the array. Competition studies using the same microarray in the presence of fondaparinux (a 3-OS-containing pentasaccharide) and HS06 (a non-3-OS variant of a HS hexasaccharide) led to the observation that HS06 is a more efficient competitor than fondaparinux. Advanced computational experiments indicated that RBD tends to bind more effectively with 3-OS-containing HS chains when more than one 3-OS groups is present. In conclusion, our work provides additional insight into the structural requirements within HS for mediating efficient viral entry, while also offering new avenues for developing potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chittum, John Sankaranarayanan Nehru O039; Hara, Connor Desai Umesh",The FASEB Journal,,428

In addition, Community Engaged Research (CEnR) teams refocused their efforts to address this public health crisis.Methods:To obtain a general understanding of how CTSAs have conducted CE and CEnR during the COVID pandemic, we invited seven CTSA CE leaders to provide brief field reports of their activities during the pandemic. This included how their approaches to CE and CEnR were modified during the COVID-19 pandemic and key lessons learned.Results:We found that despite numerous challenges, all seven CTSAs CE cores were able to successfully carry out CE and CEnR. We also found that the fundamental principles of meaningful and authentic stakeholder engagement were of paramount importance during the pandemic. Through virtual approaches, all sites had considerable success in maintaining CE in during the COVID pandemic.

In this study, the comparative sensitivity of different respiratory specimen types were retrospectively analyzed using 3,552 clinical samples from 410 COVID-19 patients confirmed by Guangdong CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Except for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (73.4%-87.5%), followed by nasal swabs (53.1%-85.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o.). Viral RNA could be detected in all BALF samples collected from the severe group within 14 d.a.o. and lasted up to 46 d.a.o. Moreover, although viral RNA was negative in the upper respiratory samples, it was also positive in BALF samples in most cases from the severe group during treatment. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in BALF samples from the mild group. Despite typical ground-glass opacity observed via computed tomographic scans, no viral RNA was detected in the first three or all upper respiratory tract specimens from some COVID-19 patients.

489789,Management of Acute Appendicitis during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single Tertiary Center Experience,2021,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has catalysed a widespread humanitarian crisis in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, with many African nations significantly impacted. The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the planning and provision of international reconstructive collaborations in Africa. Methods An anonymous, 14-question, multiple choice questionnaire was sent to 27 non-governmental organisations who regularly perform reconstructive surgery in Africa. The survey was open to responses for four weeks, closing on the 7th of March 2021. A single reminder was sent out at 2 weeks. The survey covered four key domains: (1) NGO demographics;(2) the impact of COVID-19 on patient follow-up;(3) barriers to the safe provision of international surgical collaborations during COVID-19;(4) the impact of COVID-19 on NGO funding. Results A total of ten reconstructive NGOs completed the survey (response rate, 37%). Ethiopia (n = 5) and Tanzania (n = 4) were the countries where most collaborations took place. Plastic, reconstructive and burns surgery was the most common sub-speciality (n = 7). For NGOs that did not have a year-round presence in country (n = 8), only one NGO was able to perform reconstructive surgery in Africa during the pandemic. The most common barrier identified was travel restrictions (within country, n = 8 or country entry-exit, n = 7). Pre-pandemic, 1547 to ≥ 1800 patients received reconstructive surgery on international surgical collaborations. After the outbreak, 70% of NGOs surveyed had treated no patients, with approximately 1405 to ≥ 1640 patients left untreated over the last year. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has placed huge pressures on health services and their delivery across the globe. This theme has extended into international surgical collaborations leading to increased unmet surgical needs in low- and middle-income countries. Level of evidence: Not gradable.

493549,The frailty and mortality relationship in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic that has infected more than 31 million people in more than 180 countries worldwide. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic and confirmed cases of cross-species transmission, the question of the extent to which this transmission is possible emerges, as well as what molecular features distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible animal species. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also allow us to predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.","Rodrigues, João P G L M; Barrera-Vilarmau, Susana; M C Teixeira, João; Sorokina, Marija; Seckel, Elizabeth; Kastritis, Panagiotis L; Levitt, Michael",PLoS Comput Biol,,428

494472,COVID-19 testing for providers: Leading by example,2021,"The 5' cap methylation of viral RNA plays important roles in RNA stability, efficient translation, and immune evasion. Thus, RNA cap methylation is an attractive target for antiviral discovery and development of new live attenuated vaccines. For coronaviruses, RNA cap structure is first methylated at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) position by nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), which facilitates and precedes the subsequent ribose 2'-O methylation by the nsp16-nsp10 complex. Using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus, as a model, we showed that G-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) of PEDV nsp14 methylated RNA substrates in a sequence-unspecific manner. PEDV nsp14 can efficiently methylate RNA substrates with various lengths in both neutral and alkaline pH environments and can methylate cap analogs (GpppA and GpppG) and single-nucleotide GTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP. Mutations to the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) binding motif in the nsp14 abolished the G-N-7 MTase activity and were lethal to PEDV. However, recombinant rPEDV-D350A with a single mutation (D350A) in nsp14, which retained 29.0% of G-N-7 MTase activity, was viable. Recombinant rPEDV-D350A formed a significantly smaller plaque and had significant defects in viral protein synthesis and viral replication in Vero CCL-81 cells and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-DQ). Notably, rPEDV-D350A induced significantly higher expression of both type I and III interferons in IPEC-DQ cells than the parental rPEDV. Collectively, our results demonstrate that G-N-7 MTase activity of PEDV modulates viral replication, gene expression, and innate immune responses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) include a wide range of important human and animal pathogens. Examples of human CoVs include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Examples of pig CoVs include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV). There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of these viruses. All known CoVs encode a bifunctional nsp14 protein which possesses ExoN and guanine-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) activities, responsible for replication fidelity and RNA cap G-N-7 methylation, respectively. Here, we biochemically characterized G-N-7 MTase of PEDV nsp14 and found that G-N-7 MTase-deficient PEDV was defective in replication and induced greater responses of type I and III interferons. These findings highlight that CoV G-N-7 MTase may be a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Lu, Yunjian; Cai, Hui; Lu, Mijia; Ma, Yuanmei; Li, Anzhong; Gao, Youling; Zhou, Jiyong; Gu, Howard; Li, Jianrong; Gu, Jinyan",J. virol,,428

However, this trend was already apparent in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, which illustrated the damage that ""defective"" corporate cultures can wreak on stakeholders and communities, trust and corporate reputations. As such, this article focuses on the link between defective culture and unethical conduct and wrongdoing in banks and financial institutions. It examines recent regulatory initiatives that seek to address critical defective culture issues, especially those uncovered by the Banking Royal Commission, with the aim of determining whether they may be used to redirect and improve the culture of an organisation. These include embedding the Australian Securities and Investment Commission specialist staff in the major Australian banks, the BEAR/FAR and the deployment of administrative tools, such as enforceable undertakings.","Comino, V.",Australian Business Law Review,,428

Recently, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) initially found to trigger human severe respiratory illness in Wuhan City of China in 2019, has infected more than six million people worldwide by 21 June 2020, and which has been recognized as a public health emergency of international concern as well. And the virus has spread to more than 200 countries around the world. However, the effective drug has not yet been officially licensed or approved to treat SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov infection. NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, essential for viral replication and transcription, is generally regarded as a potential target to fight against the virus. According to the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex (PDB ID: 7BW4) structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex (PDB ID: 6NUR) structure of SARS-CoV, NSP12-NSP7 interface model, and NSP12-NSP8 interface model were established for virtual screening in the present study. Eight compounds (Nilotinib, Saquinavir, Tipranavir, Lonafarnib, Tegobuvir, Olysio, Filibuvir, and Cepharanthine) were selected for binding free energy calculations based on virtual screening and docking scores. All eight compounds can combine well with NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 in the crystal structure, providing drug candidates for the treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 and SARS.","Ruan, Zijing; Liu, Chao; Guo, Yuting; He, Zhenqing; Huang, Xinhe; Jia, Xu; Yang, Tai",J. med. virol,,428

The COVID-19-related decrease in exercise volume was 49.24% in the sample. The proportion of the risk of exercise addiction was 15.2%. Most (81.7%) of the participants exercised for a health-related reason. These exercisers reported lesser decrease in their exercise volume than those exercising for social reasons. The risk of exercise addiction was inversely related to changes in exercise volume, but after controlling for passion and perfectionism the relationship vanished. The reported effect of COVID-19 on training did not differ between the exercise addiction groups. The findings also confirm that exercise addiction research should control for passion and perfectionism.","de la Vega, Ricardo; Almendros, Lucia Jiménez; Barquín, Roberto Ruíz; Boros, Szilvia; Demetrovics, Zsolt; Szabo, Attila",Int J Ment Health Addict,,428

At each visit, RNA-sequencing was applied to profile patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells in addition to extensive clinical phenotyping. Based on the projection of the RNA-seq data into lower dimensions, we observe that the cases are separated from controls, and almost all cases never return to cluster with the controls over time. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between clusters identifies up-regulation of immune response genes. This observation is also supported by deconvolution analysis to identify the changes in cell type composition due to Lyme disease infection. Importantly, we developed several machine learning classifiers that attempt to perform various Lyme disease classifications. We show that Lyme patients can be distinguished from the controls as well as from COVID-19 patients, but classification was not successful in distinguishing those patients with early Lyme disease cases that would advance to develop post-treatment persistent symptoms.","Clarke, Daniel J B; Rebman, Alison W; Bailey, Allison; Wojciechowicz, Megan L; Jenkins, Sherry L; Evangelista, John E; Danieletto, Matteo; Fan, Jinshui; Eshoo, Mark W; Mosel, Michael R; Robinson, William; Ramadoss, Nitya; Bobe, Jason; Soloski, Mark J; Aucott, John N; Ma039,; ayan, Avi",Front Immunol,,428

Some studies have proposed that cannabidiol (CBD) decreases the motivation for METH seeking, but reports indicate that the therapeutic benefits are only for heroin. Here, we studied the interaction between CBD and METH during the sensitization phase on the rewarding effect of METH, using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to measure possible alterations in sensitivity. Our data showed that i. p. injection of METH created METH-induced CPP at two of the highest applied doses (1 and 2 mg/kg), and injection of METH during the sensitization period caused an establishment of METH-induced CPP at lower doses (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg). Data also revealed that i. c.v. administration of CBD during the sensitization phase, shifted the establishment of METH-induced CPP toward a lower dose (0.5 mg/kg). Concurrent administration of CBD (10 µg/5 µl, i. c.v.) and METH (0.25 mg/kg, i. p.) during sensitization phase established METH-induced CPP with sub-threshold doses of METH (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg). Our results suggest the involvement of CBD and prior exposure to METH in creating sensitization to METH CPP.","Khanegheini, Arash; Khani, Masoumeh; Zarrabian, Shahram; Yousefzadeh-Chabok, Shahrokh; Taleghani, Behrooz Khakpour; Haghparast, Abbas",J Psychiatr Res,,428

The operating conditions comprised 340-500 °C, retention time of 24-453 s and a stoichiometric oxidant ratio (O.C.) between 4 and 64. The transformation of the various species was determined at the outlet and by modeling a segmented non-isothermal reaction system. Four empirical power law kinetic models were established to represent both the pollutants' degradation and TOC removal efficiencies, using nonlinear multiple regression coupled with bootstrapping and K-fold cross-validation. The mineralization and degradation models for both pollutants yielded a R2 of 67-80.5% vs. the experimental results. Discussion on the various model assumptions revealed that attributing full model deviations to the constant oxygen concentration or to the laminar reactor flow, yielded a deviation of 6% and 15% in the removal efficiencies, respectively. However, the expected deviation of the models was lower than 0.32% at conditions leading to (almost) full mineralization (45-60 s, 480-500 °C and O.C.s of 5-10).

Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of lung function anomalies, exercise function impairment, and psychological sequelae among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 4 months after discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study at an academic hospital in Northern Italy was conducted among a consecutive series of patients aged 18 years and older (or their caregivers) who had received a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severe enough to require hospital admission from March 1 to June 29, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, bronchial swab, serological testing, or suggestive computed tomography results. Exposure: Severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of the study was to describe the proportion of patients with a diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco) less than 80% of expected value. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with severe lung function impairment (defined as Dlco <60% expected value); proportion of patients with posttraumatic stress symptoms (measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised total score); proportion of patients with functional impairment (assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score and 2-minute walking test); and identification of factors associated with Dlco reduction and psychological or functional sequelae. Results: Among 767 patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 494 (64.4%) refused to participate, and 35 (4.6%) died during follow-up. A total of 238 patients (31.0%) (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50-71] years; 142 [59.7%] men; median [interquartile range] comorbidities, 2 [1-3]) consented to participate to the study. Of these, 219 patients were able to complete both pulmonary function tests and Dlco measurement. Dlco was reduced to less than 80% of the estimated value in 113 patients (51.6%) and less than 60% in 34 patients (15.5%). The SPPB score was suggested limited mobility (score <11) in 53 patients (22.3%). Patients with SPPB scores within reference range underwent a 2-minute walk test, which was outside reference ranges of expected performance for age and sex in 75 patients (40.5%); thus, a total of 128 patients (53.8%) had functional impairment. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were reported in a total of 41 patients (17.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that at 4 months after discharge, respiratory, physical, and psychological sequelae were common among patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19.","Bellan, Mattia; Soddu, Daniele; Balbo, Piero Emilio; Baricich, Alessio; Zeppegno, Patrizia; Avanzi, Gian Carlo; Baldon, Giulia; Bartolomei, Giuseppe; Battaglia, Marco; Battistini, Sofia; Binda, Valeria; Borg, Margherita; Cantaluppi, Vincenzo; Castello, Luigi Mario; Clivati, Elisa; Cisari, Carlo; Costanzo, Martina; Croce, Alessandro; Cuneo, Daria; De Benedittis, Carla; De Vecchi, Simona; Feggi, Alessandro; Gai, Martina; Gambaro, Eleonora; Gattoni, Eleonora; Gramaglia, Carla; Grisafi, Leonardo; Guerriero, Chiara; Hayden, Eyal; Jona, Amalia; Invernizzi, Marco; Lorenzini, Luca; Loreti, Lucia; Martelli, Maria; Marzullo, Paolo; Matino, Erica; Panero, Antonio; Parachini, Elena; Patrucco, Filippo; Patti, Giuseppe; Pirovano, Alice; Prosperini, Pierluigi; Quaglino, Riccardo; Rigamonti, Cristina; Sainaghi, Pier Paolo; Vecchi, Camilla; Zecca, Erika; Pirisi, Mario",JAMA Netw Open,,428

However, we do not know yet whether the success of firms' research activities exhibits dynamic regularities and some degree of predictability. By inspecting the research lifecycles of 7,440 firms, we find that the economic value of a firm's early patents is an accurate predictor of various dimensions of a firm's future research success. At the same time, a smaller set of future top-performers do not generate early patents of high economic value, but they are detectable via the technological value of their early patents. Importantly, the observed predictability cannot be explained by a cumulative advantage mechanism, and the observed heterogeneity of the firms' temporal success patterns markedly differs from patterns previously observed for individuals' research careers. Our results uncover the dynamical regularities of the research success of firms, and they could inform managerial strategies as well as policies to promote entrepreneurship and accelerate human progress.","Xu, Shuqi; Mariani, Manuel S.; Lu, Linyuan; Napolitano, Lorenzo; Pugliese, Emanuele; Zaccaria, Andrea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00200v1.pdf,428

Targeting of tissues by magnetic particles has tackled several limitations of traditional drug delivery methods for both cancer detection (e.g., using magnetic resonance imaging) and therapy. Delivery of magnetic particles offers the key advantage of high efficiency in the local deposition of drugs in the target tissue with the least harmful effect on other healthy tissues. This review first overviews clinical aspects of lung morphology and pathogenesis as well as clinical features of lung cancer. It is followed by reviewing the advances in using magnetic particles for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers: (i) a combination of magnetic particle targeting with MRI imaging for diagnosis and screening of lung cancers, (ii) magnetic drug targeting (MDT) through either intravenous injection and pulmonary delivery for lung cancer therapy, and (iii) computational simulations that models new and effective approaches for magnetic particle drug delivery to the lung, all supporting improved lung cancer treatment. The review further discusses future opportunities to improve the clinical performance of MDT for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer and highlights clinical therapy application of the MDT as a new horizon to cure with minimal side effects a wide variety of lung diseases and possibly other acute respiratory syndromes (COVID-19, MERS, and SARS).","Saadat, Mahsa; Manshadi, Mohammad K D; Mohammadi, Mehdi; Zare, Mohammad Javad; Zarei, Mohammad; Kamali, Reza; Sanati-Nezhad, Amir",J Control Release,,428

508071,Detection and management of a COVID-19 hotspot within a tertiary care hospital,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to compare the emotional effects of COVID-19 among three different groups, namely: health personnel, medical students, and a sample of the general population. METHODS: 375 participants were recruited for this study, of which 125 were medical students (preclinical studies, 59; clinical studies, 66), 125 were health personnel (COVID-19 frontline personnel, 59; personnel not related with COVID-19, 66), and 125 belonged to the general population. The PHQ-9, GAD-7, and CPDI scales were used to assess the emotional impact. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to measure differences between groups, considering potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Regarding CPDI values, all other groups showed reduced values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. However, the general population, preclinical and clinical medical students showed increased PHQ-9 values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. Finally, confounding factors, gender and age correlated negatively with higher CPDI and PHQ-9 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Being frontline personnel is associated with increased COVID-19-related stress. Depression is associated, however, with other groups not directly involved with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Female gender and younger age correlated with COVID-19-related depression and stress.","Zapata-Ospina, Juan Pablo; Patiño-Lugo, Daniel Felipe; Vélez, Claudia Marcela; Campos-Ortiz, Santiago; Madrid-Martínez, Pablo; Pemberthy-Quintero, Sebastián; Pérez-Gutiérrez, Ana María; Ramírez-Pérez, Paola Andrea; Vélez-Marín, Viviana María",Rev. colomb. psiquiatr,,428
509236,Should biologics for psoriasis be interrupted in the era of COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection has profoundly affected all aspects of human life, with tangible consequences in several contexts, including reproduction. However, evidences on the inter-relation between psychological distress and reproductive medicine are still conflicting. METHODS: The national lockdown imposed in Italy in March-May 2020 and the consequent assisted reproductive techniques (ART) activity blockage allowed to evaluate the conception ability of couples who suffered the postponement of ART cycles. In particular, we collected anamnestic, anthropometrical and demographic data of those women attending ART straddling the lockdown period attending to the Fertility Centre of Reggio Emilia. RESULTS: Among the 431 couples recalled to reschedule ART cycles, 34 couples (7.9%) obtained a spontaneous pregnancy during the lockdown. Comparing spontaneously pregnant to non-pregnant women, the pregnant group resulted younger (P = 0.009) and with a shorter infertility history (P = 0.029). Interestingly, the sexual activity frequency was significantly higher in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant ones (P < 0.001). In a multivariate logistic analysis, number of sexual intercourses per week and the infertility history duration were significantly related to pregnancy (P < 0.001 and P = 0.030, respectively). In addition, the application of neural network technology including data about women age, body mass index, infertility duration, weekly sexual intercourses and infertility causes allowed to correctly classify pregnant women with an accuracy of 92.7%. CONCLUSION: The high pregnancy rate observed in a very short time-frame interval probably revealed an under-explored cause of idiopathic infertility, that is the frequency of sexual intercourses, resulting the best predictive variable on achieving a spontaneous pregnancy. This factor is commonly under-investigated during the anamnestic workup of infertile couples. Clinicians involved in ART should better investigate the sexual habits of infertile couples, with the aim to correctly apply ART to those couples who really need it, avoiding unnecessary over-treatment for those couples able to conceive spontaneously.","Villani, Maria Teresa; Morini, Daria; Spaggiari, Giorgia; Simoni, Manuela; Aguzzoli, Lorenzo; Santi, Daniele",Androl.

510745,Gynecologic oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic at three affiliated New York City hospitals,2020,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has strained the healthcare systems across the world but its impact on acute stroke care is just being elucidated. We hypothesized a major global impact of COVID-19 not only on stroke volumes but also on thrombectomy practice. Methods: A 19-item questionnaire survey aimed to identify the changes in stroke volumes and treatment practices seen during COVID-19 pandemic was designed using Qualtrics software. It was sent to stroke and neuro-interventional physicians around the world who are part of the executive committee of a global coalition, Mission Thrombectomy 2020 (MT2020) between April 5 to May 15 , 2020. Results: There were 113 responses across 25 countries. Globally there was a median 33% decrease in stroke admissions and a 25% decrease in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) procedures during COVID-19 pandemic compared to immediately preceding months (Figure 1A-B). This overall median decrease was despite a median increase in stroke volume in 4 European countries which diverted all stroke patients to only a few selected centers during the pandemic. The intubation policy during the pandemic for patients undergoing MT was highly variable across participating centers: 44% preferred intubating all patients, including 25% centers that changed their policy to preferredintubation (PI) vs 27% centers that switched to preferred-conscious-sedation (PCS). There was no significant difference in rate of COVID-19 infection between PI vs PCS (p=0.6) or if intubation policy was changed in either direction (p=1). Low-volume (&lt;10 stroke/month) compared with high-volume stroke centers (&gt;20 strokes/month) are less likely to have neurointerventional suite specific written personal protective equipment protocols (74% vs 88%) and if present, these centers are more likely to report them to be inadequate (58% vs 92%). Conclusion: Our data provides a comprehensive snapshot of the impact on acute stroke care observed worldwide during the pandemic.(Figure Presented).","Yavagal, D.

The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms. METHODS: We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. FINDINGS: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51 participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia. Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%, compared to 88% for fever cough and anosmia combined. 34 individuals in the cohort were predicted to be Covid-19 positive using the App algorithm, and of those, 18 (52%) were seropositive. INTERPRETATION: Seroprevalence amongst adults from London and South-East England was 12%, and 19% of seropositive individuals with prospective symptom logging were fully asymptomatic throughout the study. Anosmia demonstrated the highest symptom specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody response.

We aimed to describe the 6-month outcomes of PIMS-TS. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised children (aged <18 years) who fulfilled the UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) diagnostic criteria for PIMS-TS and were admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) between April 4 and Sept 1, 2020. Patients were followed up by a multidisciplinary team of specialists at 6 weeks and 6 months after admission. Biochemical and functional outcomes were analysed. FINDINGS: 46 children were included in this study. The median age at presentation was 10·2 years (IQR 8·8-13·3), 30 (65%) patients were male and 16 (35%) were female, 37 (80%) were from minority ethnic groups, and eight (17%) had pre-existing comorbidities. All patients had elevated markers of systemic inflammation at baseline. None of the patients died. By 6 months, systemic inflammation was resolved in all but one patient. 38 (90%) of 42 patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies within 6 weeks of admission remained seropositive at 6 months. Echocardiograms were normal in 44 (96%) of 46 patients by 6 months, and gastrointestinal symptoms that were reported in 45 (98%) of 46 patients at onset were present in six (13%) of 46 patients at 6 months. Renal, haematological, and otolaryngological findings largely resolved by 6 months. Although minor abnormalities were identified on neurological examination in 24 (52%) of 46 patients at 6 weeks and in 18 (39%) of 46 at 6 months, we found minimal functional impairment at 6 months (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 0 [IQR 0-1]). Median manual muscle test-8 scores improved from 53 (IQR 43-64) during hospital admission to 80 (IQR 68-80) at 6 months, but 18 (45%) of 40 patients showed 6-min walk test results below the third centile for their age or sex at 6 months. PedsQL responses revealed severe emotional difficulties at 6 months (seven [18%] of 38 by parental report and eight [22%] of 38 by self report). 45 (98%) of 46 patients were back in full-time education (virtually or face to face) by 6 months. INTERPRETATION: Despite initial severe illness, few organ-specific sequelae were observed at 6 months. Ongoing concerns requiring physical re-conditioning and mental health support remained, and physiotherapy assessments revealed persisting poor exercise tolerance. Longer-term follow-up will help define the extended natural history of PIMS-TS.

Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change. METHODS: We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1st and 31st of March 2020. RESULTS: Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived. Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. CONCLUSIONS: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","Álvarez Gallego, Mario; Gortázar de Las Casas, Sara; Pascual Migueláñez, Isabel; Rubio-Pérez, Inés; Barragán Serrano, Cristina; Álvarez Peña, Estíbaliz; Díaz Domínguez, Joaquín",Cir Esp,,428

The purpose of the current study is to retrieve natural compounds that have obeyed to drug-like properties as potential inhibitors. Computational molecular modelling techniques were employed to discover compounds with potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibition properties. Accordingly, the InterBioScreen (IBS) database was obtained and was prepared by minimizing the compounds. To the resultant compounds, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to yield drug-like compounds. The obtained compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies to evaluate their stabilities. In the current article, we have employed the docking based virtual screening method using InterBioScreen (IBS) natural compound database yielding two compounds has potential hits. These compounds have demonstrated higher binding affinity scores than the reference compound together with good pharmacokinetic properties. Additionally, the identified hits have displayed stable interaction results inferred by molecular dynamics simulation results.

517344,Contagious viral diseases in the operating room: A review of evolving safety protocols at three levels,2021,"Diverse populations worldwide are differentially affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While socioeconomic background has been studied extensively, little is known about the genetic variation underlying this phenomenon. This study is aimed at examining the genetic basis behind the great discrepancies among diverse ethnic groups in terms of COVID-19 susceptibility for viral infection, disease prognosis, and mortality. To this end, in silico analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within regulatory sequences of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-the virus's gateway to host cells-and their plausible implications on expression levels was conducted. We provide indication that the variation in the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulatory sequences is likely to be involved in and contribute to this phenomenon. SNPs that are abundant in the more susceptible populations introduce binding sites (BSs) for transcription factors or they may invalidate BSs for transcription repressor-both may enhance target gene (ACE2 or TMPRSS2) expression in the relevant target tissues. SNPs that are abundant in the more resistant populations may invalidate BSs for a transcriptional repressor or they may introduce BSs for a transcriptional repressor or initiator of mRNA degradation, which may reduce target gene expression levels. This aspect, when added to the socioeconomic factors, can be a cause for the divergent prevalence of the disease and the different mortality rates within diverse populations. This demonstration may call for a shift in the paradigm of searching for COVID-19 biomarkers, such that SNPs within regulatory sequences should be of high importance.","Barash, Ayelet; Machluf, Yossy; Ariel, Ilana; Dekel, Yaron",Front Med (Lausanne),,428

However, the intraocular pressure (IOP) changes caused by face masks remain unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of wearing surgical and FFP2/N95 face masks during a 400-m walking protocol on IOP in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. METHODS: Thirteen subjects diagnosed of POAG (21 eyes) were enrolled in this study. IOP was measured at baseline, during the 400-m walking protocol and after 5 min of passive recovery while POAG patients wore a surgical mask, FFP2/N95 mask and no mask in randomized order. From the 21 POAG eyes, we analyzed the IOP changes caused by physical exercise with two face masks and without wearing any face mask. RESULTS: At rest (baseline and recovery measurements), the use of the different face masks did not affect IOP levels (mean differences ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mmHg). During physical activity, wearing an FFP2/N95 mask caused a small (mean differences ranging from 1 to 2 mmHg), but statistically significant, IOP rise in comparison to both the surgical mask and control conditions (Cohen's d = 0.63 and 0.83, respectively). CONCLUSION: Face masks must be used to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and POAG patients can safely use FFP2/N95 and surgical masks at rest. However, due to the IOP rise observed while walking with the FFP2/N95 mask, when possible, POAG patients should prioritized the use of surgical masks during physical activity.","Janicijevic, Danica; Redondo, Beatríz; Jiménez, Raimundo; Lacorzana, Javier; García-Ramos, Amador; Vera, Jesús",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,428

These moderate NCP patients underwent a plain CT scan before the admission, at the time of discharge, and at re-admission due to the positive result of their COVID-19 nucleic acid retesting. The CT signs of these patients were analyzed in this study and a total of 32 (61.54%) patients presented with 123 lesions with patchy fuzzy shadows. In addition, 24 (75%) and 8 (25%) patients out of the 32 patients, had lesions distributed in both lungs and single lung, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the CT manifestations varied in discharged moderate NCP patients whose COVID-19 nucleic acid retest was positive in the follow-up period. Most patients presented with patchy fuzzy shadows and ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions distributed in the lower lobe of both lungs. The results of the study indicated that some discharged moderate NCP patients with positive COVID-19 nucleic acid retest developed new patchy fuzzy shadows and GGO lesions. Moreover, the recurrence of NCP needs to be verified once patchy fuzzy shadows and GGO lesions appear and are not absorbed during the follow-up period. This study provided a reference for the follow-up NCP evaluation.","Wang, JunDa Deng Xin Zhang Xia Zhu XinPing Ke YongChun Wang Jie Zhou Pan Li Zhi",Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal,,428

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in hemodialysis facilities require specific protocols to be planned and promptly executed for the management of suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 with respect to prevention, protection, screening, and isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our Hemodialysis Unit, we adopted individual protection measures accompanied by measures to minimize contacts among hemodialysis patients with suspicious symptoms as well as other patients and medical staff. We provided our patients detailed instructions to be followed in the event of their having symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection or having contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. Ultimately, four possible scenarios and care paths were developed and implemented in collaboration with the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Units at the Padua University Hospital. RESULTS: The application of this strategy has resulted in the nearly 200 patients treated in our hemodialysis facilities while there were only 2 cases of COVID-19 (1% incidence rate) with no deaths. CONCLUSION: We attribute the low COVID-19 incidence noted so far for patients in our hemodialysis facilities to the early detection and prompt isolation of suspected patients per our specific plan along with the prompt application of preventive measures.","Dian, Silvia; Simeone, Monica; Rossi, Barbara; Scaparrotta, Giuseppe; Fragasso, Antonio; Carretta, Giovanni; Capizzi, Alfio; Donato, Daniele; Cianci, Vito; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Calò, Lorenzo A",Clin. nephrol,,428

523939,Diagnosing and managing childhood absence epilepsy by telemedicine,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) encode multiple interferon (IFN) antagonists that modulate the host response to virus replication. Here, we evaluated the host transcriptional response to infection with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in one of two different viral antagonists, the deubiquitinase (DUB) within nonstructural protein 3 or the endoribonuclease (EndoU) within nonstructural protein 15. We used transcriptomics approaches to compare the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild-type (WT), DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response that predominantly involves type I interferons and interferon-related genes, whereas the WT and DUBmut viruses more broadly stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including networks associated with activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivating a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages.IMPORTANCE Macrophages are an important cell type during coronavirus infections because they ""notice"" the infection and respond by inducing type I interferons, which limits virus replication. In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cell's ability to signal an interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage response to two independent mutant coronaviruses, one with reduced deubiquitinating activity (DUBmut) and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease (EndoUmut). We observed a rapid, robust, and focused response to the EndoUmut virus, which was characterized by enhanced expression of interferon and interferon-related genes. In contrast, wild-type virus and the DUBmut virus elicited a more limited interferon response and ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including players in the unfolded protein response and proinflammatory pathways associated with progression of significant disease. This study reveals that EndoU activity substantially contributes to the ability of coronaviruses to evade the host innate response and to replicate in macrophages.","Volk, Aaron; Hackbart, Matthew; Deng, Xufang; Cruz-Pulido, Yazmin; O039,; Brien, Amornrat; Baker, Susan C",J. virol,,428

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children 0 to 10 years of age (n = 277) presenting to Manhiça District Hospital with clinical pneumonia. Blood samples were collected for HIV and malaria testing, blood culture and full blood counts, and a chest X‐ray was performed. A panel of common respiratory viruses was investigated using two independent multiplex RT‐PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV species and genotypes were identified by seminested PCR assays, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was identified in 206 (74.4%) children hospitalised with clinical pneumonia. RV was the most common virus identified in both HIV‐infected (17 of 38, 44.7%) and HIV‐uninfected (74 of 237, 31.2%; P = 0.100) children.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, uses its spike protein to bind to the human cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which allows the virus to enter the human body. Using our unique cell screening technology, we identified two ACE2-binding peptoid compounds and developed dimeric derivatives (ACE2P1D1 and ACE2P2D1) that effectively blocked spike protein-ACE2 interaction, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into human cells. ACE2P1D1 and ACE2P2D1 also blocked infection by a D614G mutant pseudovirus.

Apparently, there is a great need for rapid detection of bioaerosols, for which air sampling often is the first critical step. However, currently available samplers often either require an external power and/or with low sampling flow rate, thus falling short of providing a practical solution when response time is of great concern. Here, we have designed and evaluated a new portable high volume bioaerosol sampler named as HighBioTrap through optimizing its operating parameters. The sampler was operated at a sampling flow rate of 1200L/min, with an impaction velocity of about 10.2m/s (S/W = 1.5, T/W = 1), while the weight of the sampler is about 1.9kg. The performances of the HighBioTrap sampler were tested both in lab controlled and natural environments (outdoor and indoor environments in a university building) along with the reference sampler-the BioStage impactor using aerosolized Polystyrene (PS) uniform microspheres of various sizes, aerosolized bacteria and also ambient air particles. The microbial community structures of collected culturable bacterial aerosol particles both by the HighBioTrap and the BioStage impactor in the natural environments were analyzed using gene sequence method. Experimental results with PS particles showed the HighBioTrap has a cutoff size of ~ 2µm. The widely used impactor design equation was found to be not applicable for predicting the performance of the HighBioTrap due to its large Reynolds number. When sampling aerosolized individual Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis bacterial particles, the HighBioTrap had physical collection efficiencies of 10% and 20%, respectively. Despite the higher desiccation effects introduced by higher flow rate, the HighBioTrap was shown to obtain a higher microbial diversity than the BioStage impactor for both in outdoor and indoor environments given the same sampling time (p < 0.01). Our data also showed that most of the desiccation effects might have occurred between 3 and 5min of the sampling and an impaction velocity of around 10m/s might be a close-to-optimal impaction velocity for collecting most environmental bacterial aerosols while maximally preserving their culturability. This work contributes to our understanding of microbial sampling stress (impaction velocity and sampling time), while developing a portable high volume sampler. The HighBioTrap sampler could find its great efficiencies in qualitative microbial aerosol detection and analysis, such as investigation of microbial aerosol diversity for a particular environment, or when the low level of pathogens is present and detection time is of great concern.","Chen, Haoxuan; Yao, Maosheng",Journal of Aerosol Science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.11.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002185021730277X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002185021730277X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372770/,428

Using fluorescent aerosol tracers and real time optical sensors, coupled with DNA-tagged tracers for aerosol deposition, we executed ground and inflight testing on Boeing 767 and 777 airframes. Analysis here represents tracer particles released from a simulated infected passenger, in multiple rows and seats, to determine the exposure risk via penetration into breathing zones in that row and numerous rows ahead and behind the index case. We completed over 65 releases of 180,000,000 fluorescent particles from the source, with 40+ Instantaneous Biological Analyzer and Collector sensors placed in passenger breathing zones for real-time measurement of simulated virus particle penetration. Results from both airframes showed a minimum reduction of 99.54% of 1 micron aerosols from the index source to the breathing zone of a typical passenger seated directly next to the source. An average 99.97 to 99.98% reduction was measured for the breathing zones tested in the 767 and 777, respectively.

596337,Neuroplasticity Improves Bipolar Disorder: A Review,2020-10-29,"Work contributes to health and health inequity in complex ways. The traditional exposure-disease framework used in occupational health research is not equipped to address societal contexts in which work is embedded. The political economy approach to public health directly examines macro-level societal contexts, but the attention to work in this literature is mostly on unemployment. As a result, we have limited understanding of work as a social determinant of health and health inequity. To fill this gap, we propose a conceptual framework that facilitates research on work, health, and health equity in institutional contexts. As an illustration of different social institutions creating different work-related health, we present characteristics of work and health in the United States and the European Union using the 2015 Working Conditions Surveys data. The results also highlight limitations of the traditional exposure-disease approach used in occupational health research. Applying the proposed framework, we discuss how work and health could be investigated from a broader perspective that involves multiple social institutions and the sociopolitical values that underpin them. Such investigations would inform policy interventions that are congruent with existing social institutions and thus have the potential for being adopted and effective. Further, we clarify the role of research in generating knowledge that would contribute to institutional change in support of population health and health equity.","Fujishiro, Kaori; Ahonen, Emily Q.; Gimeno Ruiz de Porras, David; Chen, I-Chen; Benavides, Fernando G.",SSM Popul Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898729/,428

Estudiamos los efectos de un programa interdisciplinar dirigido mediante telemedicina tras síndrome coronario agudo en prevención secundaria fase II en periodo de confinamiento por COVID-19. Métodos: Entre el 2 y 11 de marzo de 2020 se incluyeron 37 pacientes predominantemente con cardiopatía isquémica estable (76,4%) y función sistólica preservada sometidos a tratamiento 12 semanas. Se aplicó un programa de entrenamiento de tonificación muscular dinámico con sobrecarga domiciliario, además de asesoramiento nutricional y terapia psicológica y educativa mediante telemedicina. Resultados: De la cohorte inicial finalizaron 30 pacientes. La capacidad funcional aumentó en el test de seis minutos de marcha (47,13m; IC95% 32,82 a 61,45 p<0,001), donde se produjo también un descenso de la sensación subjetiva de disnea inicial (-0,5unidades; IC95% -0,76 a -0,24 p=0,001) en la Escala de Borg modificada y de la tensión arterial sistólica inicial (-6,67mmHg; IC95% -10,98 a -2,35 p=0,004) y final (-7mmHg; IC95% -12,86 a -1,14 p=0,021).

Introduction and objective: Cardiac rehabilitation has the highest level of recognition in medical guideline references. The rise of COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during the first months of strict containment, cause to temporally stop most of the ongoing programs. We studied the effects of an interdisciplinary phase II secondary prevention in patients diagnosed with a recent acute coronary syndrome with the use of new technologies, home-exercise and telemedicine. Methods: Between the 2nd-11th of March 2020, we included 37 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, low-risk and preserved systolic function and underwent a 12-week treatment. A dynamic muscle toning with overload domiciliary training program was applied, in addition to nutritional counselling, as well as psychological and educational therapy. Results: Of the initial cohort, 30 patients finished. At the end of the program, we observed and increased functional capacity over the 6-minute walking test (+47,13m; IC95% 32,82 to 61,45, p<0,001), and improvement to the subjective feeling of dyspnoea on the modified Borg scale (-0,5 units; IC95% -0,76 to -0,24, p=0,001), and an improvement over both initial and final training systolic blood pressure (-6,67mmHg; IC95% -10,98 to -2,35 p=0.004) (-7mmHg; IC95% -12,86 to -1,14 p=0,021).

We aimed to identify an efficient symptom combination to capture most cases using the lowest possible number of tests. METHODS: UK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms between March-September 2020 and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one RT-PCR positive case were calculated for individual symptoms and symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate symptom combinations with good trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. FINDINGS: The UK cohort included 122,305 individuals (1,202 RT-PCR positive). Findings were replicated in the US cohort which included 3,162 individuals (79 RT-PCR positive). Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 RT-PCR tests per case (TPC). The symptom combination with highest sensitivity at three days was fatigue, anosmia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat, identifying 96% of cases and requiring 96 TPC. INTERPRETATION: We confirm the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms widely recommended for triggering RT-PCR. By using the data-driven optimization technique we identified additional symptoms (fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhoea) that enabled many more positive cases to be captured efficiently. By providing a set of solutions with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, we produced a selection of symptom combinations that maximise the capture of cases given different laboratory capacities. This may be of use for COVID-19 vaccine developers across a range of resource settings and have more far-reaching public health implications for detection of symptomatic SARS CoV2 infection.","Antonelli, M; Capdevila, J; Chaudhari, A; Granerod, J; Canas, LS; Graham, MS; Klaser, K; Modat, M; Molteni, E; Murray, B; Sudre, C; Davies, R; May, A; Nguyen, LH; Drew, DA; Joshi, A; Chan, AT; Cramer, JP; Spector, Professor T; Wolf, J; Ourselin, Professor S; Steves, C; Loeliger, AE",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.20237313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269364/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.23.20237313v1?rss=1,428
597924,COVID‐19 and Immunosuppressive therapy in Dermatology,2020-08-07,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has forced many employees to alter both their work style and lifestyle. This study aimed to examine how the combination of changes in overtime working hours and social interaction affects the full‐time employees’ mental well‐being, focusing on the difference in household composition. METHODS: In November 2020, we conducted a cross‐sectional Internet survey that included 4388 Japanese men and women aged 25–64 years, who continued the same full‐time job during the pandemic. We performed a logistic regression analysis using a combination of the changes in overtime working hours and social interaction as an independent variable, and the presence/absence of deterioration of mental well‐being as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Overall, 44% of participants reported the deterioration of mental well‐being compared to before the outbreak. The multivariate analysis revealed that the participants coded as “increased overtime/decreased interaction” were significantly associated with the deterioration of mental well‐being compared to those with “unchanged overtime/unchanged interaction” (odds ratio [OR] 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59–2.89). Moreover, this association was relatively stronger among single‐person households (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.50–4.69). CONCLUSIONS: The negative combination of increasing overtime working hours and decreasing social interaction may have an impact on the deterioration of mental well‐being during the COVID‐19 pandemic, and this association was comparably strong among single‐person households. In the pandemic, it is necessary to pay close attention to both overtime working hours and the presence of social interaction to address the mental well‐being among employees.","Tomono, Misa; Yamauchi, Takashi; Suka, Machi; Yanagisawa, Hiroyuki",J Occup Health,https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302306/,428

Currently there is great uncertainty as to the future intensity and duration of the pandemic. In addition, the lessons we have been able to learn from previous economic downturns may be of limited applicability to the current situation, which differs in a number of significant respects. Experience nevertheless suggests that the potential consequences for drug users' health and well-being may be severe. The ongoing uncertainty serves to underline the importance of close monitoring of the drug situation and preparing flexible and innovative solutions to be able to meet new challenges which may arise.","Costa Storti, Claudia; Bretteville-Jensen, Anne Line; De Grauwe, Paul; Moeller, Kim; Mounteney, Jane; Stevens, Alex",Eur Addict Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477135/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000513883,428
599682,Factors associated with anxiety and depression among patients with Covid-19,2021-06-18,"Despite the available antibiotics, tuberculosis (TB) has made its return since the 90’s of the last century as a global threat mostly due to co-infection with HIV, to the emergence of drug resistant strains and the lack of an effective vaccine. Host-directed strategies could be exploited to improve treatment efficacy, contain drug-resistant strains, improve immune responses and reduce disease severity. Macrophages in the lungs are often found infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and/or with HIV. The long-term survival of lung macrophages infected with Mtb or with HIV, together with their ability to produce viral particles, especially during TB, makes these niches major contributors to the pathogenicity of the infection. Among the available drugs to control HIV infection, protease inhibitors (PIs), acting at post-integrational stages of virus replication cycle, are the only drugs able to interfere with virus production and release from macrophages during chronic infection. For Mtb we recently found that the pathogen induces a general down-regulation of lysosomal proteases, helping bacteria to establish an intracellular niche in macrophages. Here we found that the PI saquinavir, contrary to ritonavir, is able to induce an increase of endolysosomal proteases activity especially of cathepsin S in Mtb infected macrophages and during co-infection with HIV. Our results indicate that saquinavir treatment of infected macrophages led not only to a significant intracellular killing of Mtb but also: (i) to an improved expression of the HLA class II antigen presentation machinery at the cell surface; (ii) to increased T-lymphocyte priming and proliferation; and (iii) to increased secretion of IFN-γ. All together the results indicate saquinavir as a potential host directed therapy for tuberculosis.","Pires, David; Valente, Sofia; Calado, Marta; Mandal, Manoj; Azevedo-Pereira, José Miguel; Anes, Elsa",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.647728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841429/,428

The propagation from asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive individuals represents a complicating factor in the efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the course of PCR assays and duration of viral shedding in 23 asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients from the cruise ship who were admitted to our hospital. Among these 23 cases, the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days (range, 6-37 days) from initial viral detection. Eight cases (35%) had another positive PCR result after testing negative once. Although the duration of viral shedding was approximately 3 weeks, the infectivity and transmissibility period from asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine how long such asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases have the infectivity.","Miyamae, Yuka; Hayashi, Toshiya; Yonezawa, Hitoshi; Fujihara, Jin; Matsumoto, Yousuke; Ito, Takafumi; Tsubota, Takaya; Ishii, Koji",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32535295/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220304562?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220304562,428
600762,A novel approach to the psychiatric assessment of family members of ICU patients with COVID-19,2021-01-20,"Aim: To examine changes in smoking, drinking, and quitting/reduction behaviour following the Covid-19 lockdown in England. Design/setting: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019 through February 2020) versus after (April 2020) the lockdown. Participants: 20,558 adults ([â¥]16y). Measurements: The independent variable was the timing of the Covid-19 lockdown in England (before vs. after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking; past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers); past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers); and use of evidence-based (e.g., prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support (telephone support/websites/apps) for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region, and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). Findings: The Covid-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence (17.0% (after) vs. 15.9% (before), OR=1.09[95%CI 0.95-1.24]), but was associated with increases in the rate of quit attempts (39.6% vs. 29.1%, ORadj=1.56[1.23-1.98]) and cessation (8.8% vs. 4.1%, ORadj=2.63[1.69-4.09]) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0% vs. 51.5%, ORadj=1.10[0.72-1.68]) but use of remote support increased (10.9% vs. 2.7%, ORadj=3.59[1.56-8.23]). Lockdown was associated with increases in the prevalence of high-risk drinking (38.3% vs. 25.1%, OR=1.85[1.67-2.06]) but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5% vs. 15.3%, ORadj=2.16[1.77-2.64]). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2% vs. 4.0%, ORadj=0.23[0.05-0.97]) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9% vs. 6.1%, ORadj=1.32[0.64-2.75]). Conclusions: In England, prevalence of high-risk drinking but not smoking has increased since the Covid-19 lockdown. Smokers and high-risk drinkers are more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce their alcohol consumption, and rates of smoking cessation are higher. Smokers are no less likely than before lockdown to use cessation support, with increased uptake of remote support. However, use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers has decreased, with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","Jackson, Sarah E; Garnett, Claire; Shahab, Lion; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.25.20112656v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112656,428

METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. Data, including sociodemographic features, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data, and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were recorded for each study participant. Patients were stratified into different vitamin D groups; Normal (Serum 25(OH) vitamin D level >30 ng/mL), Vitamin D insufficiency (21–29 ng/mL), and deficiency (<20 ng/ mL). The severity of COVID was classified according to the Chinese Clinical Guideline for classification of COVID-19 severity. Mortality data were determined for participants. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 149 COVID-19 patients (females 45.6%, mean age 63.5 ± 15.3 (range 24–90 years) years) were included. Forty-seven patients (31.5%) had moderate COVID-19, whereas 102 patients (68.5%) had severe-critical COVID-19. The mean 25(OH) vitamin D level was 15.2 ± 10.3 ng/mL.

In a few months, the pathogen has infected millions of people in the world. Primarily SARS-CoV-2 infects the pulmonary system which ultimately leads to ARDS and lung failure. The majority of patients develop milder symptoms but the infection turns severe in a huge number of people, which ultimately results in enhanced mortality in COVID-19 patients. Co-morbid conditions, primarily cardiovascular complications and diabetes, have been reported to show a strong correlation with COVID-19 severity. Further, the onset of myocardial injury secondary to pulmonary damage has been observed in critically ill patients who have never reported heart-related ailments before. Due to drastic health risks associated with virus infection, the unprecedented disruption in normal business throughout the world has caused economic misery. Apparently, newer treatments are urgently needed to combat the virus particularly to reduce the severity burden. Therefore, understanding the crosstalk between lung and heart during COVID-19 might give us better clarity for early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment in patients with the likelihood of developing severe symptoms. Accordingly, the present review highlights the potential mechanisms that may explain the crosstalk between lung and heart so that effective treatment/management strategies can be evolved swiftly in this direction.","Puri, Gayatri; Singh, Vikram P; Naura, Amarjit S",Curr Cardiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305712/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1573403x16999201210200614,428

The need for investment in critical social infrastructure—including explicitly articulated plans—became a priority for managing future pandemics. Over the past 15 years, pandemic planning has evolved with the adoption of a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction. There is recognition of the social gradient of risk, which emerges from the interaction between social determinants of health, risk of exposure, and adverse impacts from a pandemic. Additionally, there is better understanding of the benefits of planning according to functional needs, rather than deficit-oriented labelling. In this paper, we reflect on how the framing of vulnerable or high-risk populations has evolved since SARS. Looking to the future, we present the imperative for the creation of institutional space for engagement of high-risk populations in pandemic planning processes, including participatory governance.

Although monocytes and protein levels in CSF were only marginally increased, and our patient never experienced a hyperinflammatory state, her neurologic function deteriorated into coma. MRI of the brain showed pathologic signal symmetrically in central thalami, subinsular regions, medial temporal lobes, and brain stem. Extremely high concentrations of the neuronal injury markers neurofilament light and tau, as well as an astrocytic activation marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were measured in CSF. Neuronal rescue proteins and other pathways were elevated in the in-depth proteomics analysis. The patient received IV immunoglobulins and plasma exchange. Her neurologic status improved, and she was extubated 4 weeks after symptom onset. This case report highlights the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 in selected patients and emphasizes the importance of repeated lumbar punctures and CSF analyses in patients with suspected COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms.","Virhammar, Johan; Kumlien, Eva; Fällmar, David; Frithiof, Robert; Jackmann, Sven; Sköld, Mattias K.; Kadir, Mohamed; Frick, Jens; Lindeberg, Jonas; Olivero-Reinius, Henrik; Ryttlefors, Mats; Cunningham, Janet L.; Wikström, Johan; Grabowska, Anna; Bondeson, Kåre; Bergquist, Jonas; Zetterberg, Henrik; Rostami, Elham",Neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32586897/; https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010250,428
601929,COVID‐19 era: A chance to learn something new about monitoring psoriatic patients in biological therapy,2020-06-10,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi complex prior to exocytosis. The small CoV envelope (E) protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which require residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E in a recombinant virus background results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV spike (S) protein on the plasma membrane compared to wild-type (WT) IBV-infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with an increased Golgi luminal pH. Infection with IBV or expression of IBV E induces neutralization of Golgi pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cell factors, protecting IBV S from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells. This is the first demonstration of a coronavirus-induced alteration in the microenvironment of the secretory pathway. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV E protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics exist. Understanding the role of the CoV E protein in virus assembly and release is thus an important prerequisite for potential vaccines as well as in identifying novel antiviral therapeutics.","Westerbeck, Jason W.; Machamer, Carolyn E.",Journal of Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867314/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00015-19; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/11/e00015-19.full.pdf,428
602129,Effects of a large-scale social media advertising campaign on holiday travel and COVID-19 infections: a cluster randomized controlled trial,2021-08-19,"The announcement of efficacious vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 has been met with worldwide acclaim and relief. Many countries already have detailed plans for vaccine targeting based on minimising severe illness, death and healthcare burdens. Normally, relatively simple relationships between epidemiological parameters, vaccine efficacy and vaccine uptake predict the success of any immunisation programme. However, the dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is made more complex by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection and the potential relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines. In this study we use an age-structured mathematical model, matched to a range of epidemiological data, to consider the interaction between the UK vaccination programme and future relaxation (or removal) of NPIs. Our predictions highlight the population-level risks of early relaxation leading to a pronounced wave of infections, and the individual-level risk relative to vaccine status. While the novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for this outbreak, this is highly contingent on the transmission blocking action of the vaccine and the population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored as vaccine programmes are rolled out in the UK and other countries.","Moore, S.; Hill, E.

602423,Psychoactive compounds as multifactorial protection factors against COVID-19,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND: Adamantane-based compounds have been identified to interfere with the ion-channel activity of viroporins and thereby inhibit viral infection. To better understand the difference in the inhibition mechanism of viroporins, we synthesized symmetric dimeric adamantane analogs of various alkyl-spacer lengths. METHODS: Symmetric dimeric adamantane derivatives were synthesized where two amantadine or rimantadine molecules were linked by various alkyl-spacers. The inhibitory activity of the compounds was studied on two viroporins: the influenza virus M2 protein, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 channels for five different genotypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a) expressed in HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques. RESULTS: Upon testing on M2 protein, dimeric compounds showed significantly lower inhibitory activity relative to the monomeric amantadine. The lack of channel blockage of the dimeric amantadine and rimantadine analogs against M2 wild type and M2-S31N mutant was consistent with previously proposed drug-binding mechanisms and further confirmed that the pore-binding model is the pharmacologically relevant drug-binding model. On the other hand, these dimers showed similar potency to their respective monomeric analogs when tested on p7 protein in HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4a while being 700-fold and 150-fold more potent than amantadine in genotypes 2a and 3a, respectively. An amino group appears to be important for inhibiting the ion-channel activity of p7 protein in genotype 2a, while its importance was minimal in all other genotypes. CONCLUSION: Symmetric dimeric adamantanes can be considered a prospective class of p7 inhibitors that are able to address the differences in adamantane sensitivity among the various genotypes of HCV.","Mandour, Yasmine M; Breitinger, Ulrike; Ma, Chunlong; Wang, Jun; Boeckler, Frank M; Breitinger, Hans-Georg; Zlotos, Darius P",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750015/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s157104,428
602565,Asthma in children during the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from lockdown and future directions for management,2020-06-25,"Contact tracing is one of several strategies employed in many countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Digital contact tracing (DCT) uses tools such as cell-phone applications to improve tracing speed and reach. We model the impact of DCT on the spread of the virus for a large epidemiological parameter space consistent with current literature on SARS-CoV-2. We also model DCT in combination with random testing (RT) and social distancing (SD). Modelling is done with two independently developed individual-based (stochastic) models that use the Monte Carlo technique, benchmarked against each other and against two types of deterministic models. For current best estimates of the number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers (approximately 40%), their contagiousness (similar to that of symptomatic carriers), the reproductive number before interventions (R0 at least 3) we find that DCT must be combined with other interventions such as SD and/or RT to push the reproductive number below one. At least 60% of the population would have to use the DCT system for its effect to become significant. On its own, DCT cannot bring the reproductive number below 1 unless nearly the entire population uses the DCT system and follows quarantining and testing protocols strictly. For lower uptake of the DCT system, DCT still reduces the number of people that become infected. When DCT is deployed in a population with an ongoing outbreak where O(0.1%) of the population have already been infected, the gains of the DCT intervention come at the cost of requiring up to 15% of the population to be quarantined (in response to being traced) on average each day for the duration of the epidemic, even when there is sufficient testing capability to test every traced person.","Pollmann, Tina R; Pollmann, Julia; Wiesinger, Christoph; Haack, Christian; Shtembari, Lolian; Turcati, Andrea; Neumair, Birgit; Meighen-Berger, Stephan; Zattera, Giovanni; Neumair, Matthias; Apel, Uljana; Okolie, Augustine; Mueller, Johannes; Schoenert, Stefan; Resconi, Elisa",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.20192682; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20192682v1?rss=1,428
602780,Acute appendicitis management during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective cohort study from a large UK centre,2021-01-16,"The novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, which in humans leads to the disease COVID‐19, has caused global disruption and more than 2 million fatalities since it first emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary target of SARS‐CoV‐2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and endangered aye‐aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID‐19 to their health should be a conservation priority. All feasible actions should be taken to limit their exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2.","Melin, Amanda D.; Orkin, Joseph D.; Janiak, Mareike C.; Valenzuela, Alejandro; Kuderna, Lukas; Marrone, Frank; Ramangason, Hasinala; Horvath, Julie E.; Roos, Christian; Kitchener, Andrew C.; Khor, Chiea Chuen; Lim, Weng Khong; Lee, Jessica G.

We report in vitro efficacy of Artemisia annua extracts as well as artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether against SARS-CoV-2. The latter two are approved active pharmaceutical ingredients of anti-malarial drugs. Proof-of-concept for prophylactic efficacy of the extracts was obtained using a plaque-reduction assay in VeroE6 cells. Subsequent concentration-response studies using a high-throughput antiviral assay, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed that pretreatment and treatment with extracts, artemisinin, and artesunate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. In treatment assays, artesunate (50% effective concentration (EC50): 7 μg/mL) was more potent than the tested plant extracts (128-260 μg/mL) or artemisinin (151 μg/mL) and artemether (>179 μg/mL), while generally EC50 in pretreatment assays were slightly higher. The selectivity index (SI), calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, was highest for artemisinin (54), and roughly equal for the extracts (5-10), artesunate (6) and artemether (<7). Similar results were obtained in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. Peak plasma concentrations of artesunate exceeding EC50 values can be achieved.

Value of care, community expectations, legal obligations, professional and codes of practice may compel health professionals to put themselves at risks in emergency situations. The bioethical principles of autonomy, justice, beneficence and non‐maleficence, as well as public health ethics, guide nurses to justify their decisions as to whether they are entitled to refuse to treat COVID‐19 patients during the pandemic.

Design The presence of AGP on circulating leucocytes was investigated in both clinically healthy cats and cats with different diseases. A group of feline coronavirus (FCoV)‐positive cats, comprising cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and cats not affected by FIP but seropositive for FCoV, were included in this study because the serum concentration of AGP increases during FCoV infection. Procedure Flow cytometry (using an anti‐feline AGP antibody), serum protein electrophoresis, routine haematology and measurement of the serum AGP concentration were performed using blood samples from 32 healthy cats (19 FCoV‐seropositive), 13 cats with FIP and 12 with other diseases (6 FCoV‐seropositive). The proportion of cats with AGP‐positive leucocytes in the different groups (e.g. controls vs sick; FIP vs other diseases, etc.) or in cats with different intensities of inflammatory response was compared using a Chi‐square test. Results AGP‐positive leucocytes were found in 23% of cats. Compared with controls, the proportion of patients with positive granulocytes and monocytes was higher among sick cats (especially cats with diseases other than FIP) and cats with high serum AGP concentration, but not in cats with leucocytosis or that were FCoV‐seropositive. Conclusion AGP‐positive leucocytes can be found in feline blood, especially during inflammation. Conversely, no association between AGP‐positive leucocytes and FIP was found.

Stressful situations are known to alter eating habits and increase the risk for obesity. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the lockdown measures on nutrition behavior among young adults. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 1964 voluntary participants from Bavarian universities. All participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire, semi-quantitatively evaluating the amount and type of food before and during pandemic lockdown. Study subjects were inquired to give information about acquisition and food procurement. The primary outcome was the change in food amount, secondary outcomes included alterations of food composition and procurement. RESULTS: Our study cohort (mean age 23.3 ± 4.0 years, 28.5% male) had a mean body mass index of 22.1 ± 4.5 kg/m(2). The overall food amount increased in 31.2% of participants (n = 610) during lockdown and decreased in 16.8% (n = 328). A multinominal regression model revealed that an increased food intake was less likely in male participants (OR, 0.7 [CI 0.6–0.9]) and more likely with increasing BMI (OR, 1.4 [CI 1.3–2.0]), increased sports activity (OR, 1.3 [CI 1.2–1.8]), augmented mental stress (OR 1.4 [1.1–1.7]), and an alteration of alcohol consumption (reduced alcohol amount, OR, 1.4 [CI 1.1–1.7], increased alcohol, OR, 1.9 [CI 1.4–2.5]). Increase in food intake was mainly triggered by consumption of bread (increased in 46.8%, n = 284) and confectionary (increased in 64.4%, n = 389).

605895,"Occupational infection and needle stick injury among clinical laboratory workers in Al-Madinah city, Saudi Arabia",2018-05-21,"Summary Background Respiratory virus infection is a common cause of hospitalisation in adults. Rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) for respiratory viruses might improve clinical care by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, shortening length of hospital stay, improving influenza detection and treatment, and rationalising isolation facility use; however, insufficient evidence exists to support its use over standard clinical care. We aimed to assess the effect of routine POCT on a broad range of clinical outcomes including antibiotic use. Methods In this pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) within 24 h of presenting to the emergency department or acute medical unit of a large UK hospital with acute respiratory illness or fever higher than 37·5°C (≤7 days duration), or both, over two winter seasons. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based allocation sequence with random permuted blocks, to have a molecular POC test for respiratory viruses or routine clinical care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received antibiotics while hospitalised (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included duration of antibiotics, proportion of patients receiving single doses or brief courses of antibiotics, length of stay, antiviral use, isolation facility use, and safety. Analysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding patients who declined intervention or were withdrawn for protocol violations. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 90211642, and has been completed. Findings Between Jan 15, 2015, and April 30, 2015, and between Oct 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, we enrolled 720 patients (362 assigned to POCT and 358 to routine care). Six patients withdrew or had protocol violations. 301 (84%) of 360 patients in the POCT group received antibiotics compared with 294 (83%) of 354 controls (difference 0·6%, 95% CI −4·9 to 6·0; p=0·84). Mean duration of antibiotics did not differ between groups (7·2 days [SD 5·1] in the POCT group vs 7·7 days [4·9] in the control group; difference −0·4, 95% CI −1·2 to 0·4; p=0·32). 50 (17%) of 301 patients treated with antibiotics in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics (<48 h) compared with 26 (9%) of 294 patients in the control group (difference 7·8%, 95% CI 2·5 to 13·1; p=0·0047; number needed to test=13). Mean length of stay was shorter in the POCT group (5·7 days [SD 6·3]) than in the control group (6·8 days [7·7]; difference −1·1, 95% CI −2·2 to −0·3; p=0·0443). Appropriate antiviral treatment of influenza-positive patients was more common in the POCT group (52 [91%] of 57 patients) than in the control group (24 [65%] of 37 patients; difference 26·4%, 95% CI 9·6 to 43·2; p=0·0026; number needed to test=4). We found no differences in adverse outcomes between the groups (77 [21%] of 360 patients in the POCT group vs 88 [25%] of 354 patients in the control group; −3·5%, −9·7 to 2·7; p=0·29). Interpretation Routine use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses did not reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. However, the primary outcome measure failed to capture differences in antibiotic use because many patients were started on antibiotics before the results of POCT could be made available. Although POCT was not associated with a reduction in the duration of antibiotics overall, more patients in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than did patients in the control group. POCT was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use, and appeared to be safe.

The available options for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection are detection of viral RNA by qRT-PCR, Antigen or Antibody testing by serological methods. Even though many kits available commercially but none of them are rapid, sensitive and high throughput. OnCovid total antibody assay is a diagnostic method developed by us uses the principle of bio-layer Interferometry to detect IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This method overcomes many of the limitations normally faced in antibody detection by other methods and offers a superior platform for a rapid, sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The test is economical, and the results can be obtained in as short as 30 seconds per test. In addition to its standalone use in early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, OnCovid total antibody assay can be used to therapeutic monitoring of antiviral therapies used in clinical management and to estimate the antibody titers during convalescent plasma donation.","Lokireddy, S.

CLRs have many diverse functions depending on the signalling motifs in their cytoplasmic domains, and can induce endocytic, phagocytic, antimicrobial, pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses which are either protective or not during an infection. Understanding the role of CLRs in shaping anti-microbial immunity offers great potential for the future development of therapeutics for disease intervention. In this review we will focus on the recognition of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens by CLRs, and how these receptors influence the outcome of infection. We will also provide a brief update on the role of CLRs in antifungal immunity.","Hoving, J Claire; Wilson, Gillian J; Brown, Gordon D",Cell Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24330199/,428

There is an urgent need for researching many aspects of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) due to the widespread of the virus among SCD patients in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study is to determine how COVID-19 affects SCD patients in order to reach the best strategy for their management protocols. Methods This is a retrospective chart review study from a multi-center in Saudi Arabia that evaluated a total of 33 patients with sickle cell anemia/disease who were confirmed to have COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests based on the nasopharyngeal swabs of the included patients. Results The mean age of patients was 10.75+9.11 years, and nearly all patients (n= 32; 96.9%) were Saudi, and 48.4% of them were females. Twenty-two patients were admitted (59.5%); the main reasons for admission included vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) only (n= 6; 27.3%), fever (n= 6; 27.3%), acute chest syndrome (n= 5; 22.7%), and VOC combined with other conditions (n= 4; 18.2%). During hospitalization, 54.1% of the patients received at least one medication, while antibiotics (54.1%), analgesia (32.4%), anticoagulants (16.2%), and steroids (16.2%) were the most commonly administered drugs. The mean length of hospitalization was 7.6±4.5 days, with only one patient (2.7%) requiring intensive care unit admission and assisted ventilation. Conclusion The overall prognosis was good since only one patient has passed away, while all others recovered and, subsequently, were discharged.

The restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have created a setting that allows us to investigate the importance of greenness exposure on mental health during a period of increased isolation and worry. Based on 2060 responses from an online survey in Stockholm County, Sweden, we investigated: (1) whether the COVID-19 pandemic changed peoples’ lifestyle and nature-related habits, and (2) if peoples’ mental health differed depending on their exposure to greenness. Neighborhood greenness levels were quantified by using the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within 50 m, 100 m, 300 m, and 500 m buffers surrounding the participant’s place of residence. We found that the number of individuals that reported that they visited natural areas “often” was significantly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic. Higher levels of greenness surrounding one’s location of residence were in general associated with higher mental health/well-being and vitality scores, and less symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived and cognitive stress, after adjustments for demographic variables and walkability. In conclusion, the results from the present study provided support to the suggestion that contact with nature may be important for mental health in extreme circumstances.","Lõhmus, Mare; Stenfors, Cecilia U.

BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 has caused disruption to contemporary health service delivery, including alcohol and other drug treatment. Provisional research on drug and alcohol consumption patterns shows changes attributable to the pandemic, with implications for service delivery. Research also indicates the impact of the pandemic on healthcare staff is significant, leading to workforce challenges that threaten care provision. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study design. METHODS: Data were collected using semi‐structured, individual telephone interviews with practising alcohol and other drug nurses from Australia and New Zealand (n = 19). COREQ reporting guidelines were used. RESULTS: After thematic analysis, three key themes emerged: ‘No room at the inn: Changes to service delivery due to COVID‐19’, ‘We are providing care to a very vulnerable group of people: Consumer factors during COVID‐19’ and ‘Personally, we were very, very stressed: Workforce factors due to COVID‐19’. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicate that the impact of the pandemic was felt by alcohol and other drug nurses, services and healthcare consumers alike. The experiences of alcohol and other drug nurses through the COVID‐19 pandemic need further exploration both to ensure workforce sustainability and that disruptions to alcohol and other drug services do not occur in future outbreaks of communicable disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: COVID‐19 has had a profound effect on nurses in all settings, and these effects are likely to be felt for some time after the pandemic: nursing specialties require support to ensure ongoing workforce sustainability and well‐being of nursing staff. All nurses need to be aware of changes to alcohol and other drug use during the pandemic and screen healthcare consumers accordingly.","Searby, Adam; Burr, Dianna",J Clin Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656227/,428

This Viral infection is known to induce worldwide pandemic in short period of time. Emerging evidence suggested that the transmission control and drug therapy may influence the preventive measures extensively as the host surrounding environment and pathogenic mechanism may contribute to the pandemic condition earlier in COVID-19 disease. Although, several animals identified as reservoir to date, however human-to-human transmission is well documented. Human beings are sustaining the virus in the communities and act as an amplifier of the virus. Human activities i.e., living with the patient, touching patient waste etc. in the surrounding of active patients or asymptomatic persons cause significant risk factors for transmission. On the other hand, drug target and mechanism to destroy the virus or virus inhibition is depends on diversified approaches of drugs and different target for virus life cycle. This article describes the sustainable chemical preventive models understanding, requirements, technology adaptation and the implementation strategies in these pandemic-like situations. As the outbreak progresses, healthcare models focused on transmission control through disinfections and sanitization based on risk calculations. Identification of the most suitable target of drugs and regional control model of transmission are of high priority. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of epidemiological information is important to encourage preventive measures efforts by public health authorities and provide robust evidence to guide interventions. Here, we have discussed the level of adaptations in technology that research professionals display toward their public health preventive models. We should compile a representative data set of adaptations that humans can consider for transmission control and adopt for viruses and their hosts. Overall, there are many aspects of the chemical science and technology in virus preventive measures. Herein, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the sustainable preventive model are presented. This kind of sustainable preventive model having adaptation and implementation with green chemistry system will reduce the shedding of the virus into the community by eco-friendly methods, and thus the risk of transmission and infection progression can be mitigated.","Mishra, Abhishek; Meenakshi,; Das, Trupti R.; Saren, Pupulata; Bhattacherjee, Prama; Thakur, Nitika; Tripathi, Sunil Kumar; Upadhaya, Shashank; Kim, Heui-Soo; Murugan, Arul Natarajan; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Patra, Santanu; Hussain, Chaudhery Mustansar; Mishra, Anshuman; Shukla, Sudheesh K.; Joshi, Girish M.",Journal of the Indian Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jics.2021.100164; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019452221001643?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019452221001643,428

Protein subunit vaccines represent a promising approach but often lack the immunogenicity required for strong immune stimulation. To overcome this challenge, we first demonstrate that advanced biomaterials can be leveraged to boost the effectiveness of SARS‐CoV‐2 protein subunit vaccines. Additionally, we report that oxygen is a powerful immunological co‐adjuvant and has an ability to further potentiate vaccine potency. In preclinical studies, mice immunized with an oxygen‐generating COVID‐19 cryogel‐based vaccine (O(2)‐Cryogel(VAX)) exhibited a robust Th1 and Th2 immune response, leading to a sustained production of highly effective neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Even with a single immunization, O(2)‐Cryogel(VAX) achieved high antibody titers within 21 days, and both binding and neutralizing antibody levels were further increased after a second dose. Engineering a potent vaccine system that generates sufficient neutralizing antibodies after one dose is a preferred strategy amid vaccine shortage. Our data suggest that this platform is a promising technology to reinforce vaccine‐driven immunostimulation and is applicable to current and emerging infectious diseases.

Two previously described species, T.australis (Castelnau) and T.montana (Castelnau), are distributed in the mountains of Victoria. The third previously described species, T.convexa (Sloane) is found in Tasmania. A lectotype is designated for T.convexa because the various syntypes are ambiguously labelled. Cladistic analysis based on morphological characters establishes monophyly of Theprisa relative to the Australian genera Sitaphe Moore and Spherita Liebherr. This and a second clade of Australian genera (Pterogmus Sloane, Thayerella Baehr, and Neonomius Moore) do not form a natural group, but are cladistically interdigitated among two monophyletic New Zealand lineages (Tarastethus Sharp, and Trichopsida Larochelle and Larivière) suggesting substantial trans-Tasman diversification among these groups. Hypothesized relationships within Theprisa are consistent with two bouts of speciation involving the Bass Strait; an initial event establishing T.convexa as adelphotaxon to the other four species, and a more recent event establishing the sister species T.darlingtoni and T.montana. Geographic restriction of T.otway to the Otway Ranges is paralleled by Otway endemics in several other carabid beetle genera, as well as by endemics in numerous other terrestrial arthropod taxa. Whereas these numerous Otway endemics support the distinctive nature of the Otway Range fauna, their biogeographic relationships are extremely varied, illustrating that the Otways have accrued their distinctive biodiversity via various means.","Liebherr, James K.; Porch, Nick; Shaw, Matthew; Sinclair, Bronte E.; Maddison, David R.",Zookeys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512089/; https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1044.62335,428

The extent of MERS-CoV in nature can be traced to its adaptable cell entry steps. The virus can bind host-cell carbohydrates as well as proteinaceous receptors. Following receptor interaction, the virus can utilize diverse host proteases for cleavage activation of virus-host cell membrane fusion and subsequent genome delivery. The fusion and genome delivery steps can be completed at variable times and places, either at or near cell surfaces or deep within endosomes. Investigators focusing on the CoVs have developed several methodologies that effectively distinguish these different cell entry pathways. Here we describe these methods, highlighting virus-cell entry factors, entry inhibitors, and viral determinants that specify the cell entry routes.

The extraordinary containment measures have had a dramatic impact on the undertaking and follow-up of ophthalmic outpatients. OBJECTIVE: In order to guarantee proper monitoring and routine care, the Pediatric Ophthalmology equipe of Rovereto Hospital (North-East of Italy) supported by the Competence Center on Digital Health TrentinoSalute4.0, designed and implemented a digital platform, TreC Oculistica, enabling teleophthalmology. We report our innovative—albeit restricted—experience aiming at testing and maximizing the efficacy of remote ophthalmic and orthoptic visits. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team created the TreC Oculistica platform and defined a teleophthalmology protocol. The system consists of a clinician web interface and a patient mobile application. Clinicians can prescribe outpatients with the App and some preliminary measurements to be self-collected before the televisit. The App conveys the clinician’s requests (i.e. measurements) and eases the share of the collected information in a secure digital environment, promoting a new health care workflow. RESULTS: Four clinicians took part in the testing phase (2 ophthalmologists and 2 orthoptists) and recruited 37 patients (mostly pediatric) in 3 months. Thanks to a continuous feedback between the testing and the technical implementation, it has been possible to identify pros and cons of the implemented functionalities, considering possible improvements. Digital solutions such as TreC Oculistica advance the digitalization of the Italian health care system, promoting a structured and effective reorganization of the workload supported by digital systems. CONCLUSIONS: The study tested an innovative digital solution in the teleophthalmology context and represented the first experience within the Italian healthcare system.

The sample consisted of 109 caregivers with older adult care recipient parents (average caregivers' age = 57.67, SD = 8.49). Caregivers were divided into three groups: 20 OHS who reported that at least one care recipient had PTSD, 60 OHS who reported that their care recipients did not have PTSD, and 29 comparison caregivers (whose care recipients did not undergo the Holocaust). Caregivers completed questionnaires about SARS-CoV-2 exposure, COVID-19 concerns, helping their care recipients, their experiences of caregiver burden, and perceived changes to their caregiver burden during the pandemic. The caregivers also reported PTSD symptoms-in themselves as well as in their care recipients. Relative to comparisons, OHS with parental PTSD reported higher caregiver burden in four aspects: time-dependent burden, developmental burden, physical burden, and social burden. Furthermore, OHS reported a greater perceived increase in caregiver burden during the pandemic than the comparisons. The study findings illuminate the difficulties OHS caregivers, especially those whose care recipients have PTSD, face during the COVID-19 pandemic. This group of caregivers is at risk of experiencing more distress and may need help and support.

613645,Diabetes and COVID-19,2020-05-15,"Abstract So far, available evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection. In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20 mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The drugs can be restarted once the infectious process is resolved.","de León-Rendón, J. L.; Hurtado-Salazar, C.; Yamamoto-Furusho, J.

The literature was analyzed to understand ocular transmission as well as molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 enters cells and replicates. Analysis of gene expression profiles from available datasets, published immunohistochemistry, as well as current literature was reviewed, to assess the likelihood that ocular inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 results in systemic infection. Recent findings: The ocular surface and retina have the necessary proteins, Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), CD147, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL) necessary to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In addition to direct ocular infection, virus carried by tears through the nasolacrimal duct to nasal epithelium represent a means of ocular inoculation. Summary: There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may either directly infect cells on the ocular surface, or virus can be carried by tears through the nasolacrimal duct to infect the nasal or gastrointestinal epithelium.","Barnett, Brad P.; Wahlin, Karl; Krawczyk, Michal; Spencer, Doran; Welsbie, Derek; Afshari, Natalie; Chao, Daniel",Vision (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vision4030040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883010/,428

Although significant methodological advances have been made in the field of viral detection/diagnosis with 251 in vitro diagnostic tests receiving emergency use approval by the US‐FDA, little progress has been made in identifying curative or preventive therapies. This review discusses the current trends and potential future approaches for developing COVID‐19 therapeutics, including repurposed drugs, vaccine candidates, immune‐modulators, convalescent plasma therapy, and antiviral nanoparticles/nanovaccines/combinatorial nanotherapeutics to surmount the pandemic viral strain. Many potent therapeutic candidates emerging via drug‐repurposing could significantly reduce the cost and duration of anti‐COVID‐19 drug development.

614275,Opportunity cost and COVID-19: A perspective from health economics,2020-12-29,"INTRODUCTION: Critical illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is associated with a high burden of pulmonary embolism (PE) and thromboembolic events despite standard thromboprophylaxis. Available guidance is discordant, ranging from standard care to the use of therapeutic anticoagulation for enhanced thromboprophylaxis (ET). Local ET protocols have been empirically determined and are generally intermediate between standard prophylaxis and full anticoagulation. Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential risk of haemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation. This report describes the prevalence and safety of ET strategies in European Intensive Care Unit (ICUs) and their association with outcomes during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, with particular focus on haemorrhagic complications and ICU mortality. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, multi-centre study including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients. Anonymised data included demographics, clinical characteristics, thromboprophylaxis and/or anticoagulation treatment. Critical haemorrhage was defined as intracranial haemorrhage or bleeding requiring red blood cells transfusion. Survival was collected at ICU discharge. A multivariable mixed effects generalised linear model analysis matched for the propensity for receiving ET was constructed for both ICU mortality and critical haemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 852 (79% male, age 66 [37–85] years) patients were included from 28 ICUs. Median body mass index and ICU length of stay were 27.7 (25.1–30.7) Kg/m(2) and 13 (7–22) days, respectively. Thromboembolic events were reported in 146 patients (17.1%), of those 78 (9.2%) were PE. ICU mortality occurred in 335/852 (39.3%) patients. ET was used in 274 (32.1%) patients, and it was independently associated with significant reduction in ICU mortality (log odds = 0.64 [95% CIs 0.18–1.1; p = 0.0069]) but not an increased risk of critical haemorrhage (log odds = 0.187 [95%CI − 0.591 to − 0.964; p = 0.64]). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of critically ill patients with a high prevalence of thromboembolic events, ET was associated with reduced ICU mortality without an increased burden of haemorrhagic complications. This study suggests ET strategies are safe and associated with favourable outcomes. Whilst full anticoagulation has been questioned for prophylaxis in these patients, our results suggest that there may nevertheless be a role for enhanced / intermediate levels of prophylaxis. Clinical trials investigating causal relationship between intermediate thromboprophylaxis and clinical outcomes are urgently needed.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of all travelers hospitalized during a 12-month period in our department with pneumonia after returning home. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (nine men, eight women, mean age 44 years, range 26 to 67 years) were included in this study. The etiology of pneumonia was established in 13 patients. Bacterial pneumonia was documented in 10 cases and was due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 2), Legionella pneumophila (n = 1), Coxiella burnetti (n = 1), Leptospira sp.

615210,“The Most Dangerous Strain”,2020-06-26,"Agricultural drainage tiles are primary contributors to NO(3)-N export from Iowa croplands. Saturated buffers are a relatively new conservation practice that diverts tile water into a distribution tile installed in a riparian buffer parallel to a stream with the intent of enhancing NO(3)-N processing within the buffer. In this study, tile NO(3)-N concentration reductions were characterized through two different saturated buffers at a working farm site in eastern Iowa. Study objectives were to (1) evaluate the hydrogeology and water quality patterns in the saturated buffer and (2) quantify the reduction in tile NO(3)-N concentration from the saturated buffer installation. Results showed that the two saturated buffers are reducing NO(3)-N concentrations in tile drainage water from input concentrations of approximately 15 mg/l to levels < 1.5 mg/l at the streamside well locations. The reduction occurs rapidly in the fine-textured and organic-rich alluvial soils with most of the reduction occurring within 1.5 m of the distribution line. Denitrification is hypothesized as being primarily responsible for the concentration reductions based on soil and water chemistry conditions, completion of a geophysical survey (quantifying low potential for N loss to deeper aquifers), and comparisons to other similar Iowa sites. The study provides more assurance to new adopters that this practice can be installed in many areas throughout the Midwestern Cornbelt region.

Here, we aimed to understand the longevity and strength of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses in a small community (n = 283) six months following local SARS-COV-2 outbreak in March 2020. Three serological assays were compared and neutralisation capability was also determined. Overall 16.6% (47/283) of the participants were seropositive and 89.4% (42/47) of the IgG positives had neutralising antibodies. Most of the symptomatic individuals confirmed as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive during the outbreak were seropositive (30/32, 93.8%) and 33.3% of the individuals who quarantined with a PCR confirmed patient had antibodies. Serological assays comparison revealed that Architect (Abbott) targeting the N protein LIASON(®) (DiaSorin) targeting the S protein and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting receptor binding domain detected 9.5% (27/283), 17.3% (49/283) and 17% (48/283), respectively, as IgG positives. The latter two assays highly agreed (kappa = 0.89) between each other. In addition, 95%, (19/20, by ELISA) and 90.9% (20/22, with LIASON) and only 71.4% (15/21, by Architect) of individuals that were seropositive in May 2020 were found positive also in September. The unexpected low rate of overall immunity indicates the absence of un-noticed, asymptomatic infections. Lack of overall high correlation between the assays is attributed mainly to target-mediated antibody responses and suggests that using a single serological assay may be misleading.","Gozlan, Yael; Reingold, Stephen; Koren, Ravit; Halpern, Osnat; Regev-Yochay, Gili; Cohen, Carmit; Biber, Asaf; Picard, Orit; Mendelson, Ella; Lustig, Yaniv; Mor, Orna",Epidemiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268821001369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372950/,428

616700,Lessons Learned – Outbreaks of COVID-19 in Nursing Homes,2020-07-31,"Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity1–3. However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons—evolutionarily expanded in humans4—show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive function, schizophrenia, and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework and new opportunities to understand COVID-19 related neurological disease.","Yang, Andrew C.; Kern, Fabian; Losada, Patricia M.; Maat, Christina A.; Schmartz, Georges; Fehlmann, Tobias; Schaum, Nicholas; Lee, Davis P.; Calcuttawala, Kruti; Vest, Ryan T.; Gate, David; Berdnik, Daniela; McNerney, M.

However, limitations of the resources, risk of disease transmission and redirection of medical attention to a more severe infective health problem during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period have affected the quality of care even in a surgical emergency. AIM: To compare the 30-d mortality rate and complications of hip fracture patients treated during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times. METHODS: The search of electronic databases on 1(st) August 2020 revealed 45 studies related to mortality of hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times. After careful screening, eight studies were eligible for quantitative and qualitative analysis of data. RESULTS: The pooled data of eight studies (n = 1586) revealed no significant difference in 30-d mortality rate between the hip fracture patients treated during the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods [9.63% vs 6.33%; odds ratio (OR), 0.62; 95%CI, 0.33, 1.17; P = 0.14]. Even the 30-d mortality rate was not different between COVID-19 non-infected patients who were treated during the pandemic time, and all hip fracture patients treated during the pre-pandemic period (OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.61, 1.75; P = 0.91). A significant difference in mortality rate was observed between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients (OR, 6.99; 95%CI, 3.45, 14.16; P < 0.00001). There was no difference in the duration of hospital stay (OR, -1.52, 95%CI, -3.85, 0.81; P = 0.20), overall complications (OR, 1.62; P = 0.15) and incidence of pulmonary complications (OR, 1.46; P = 0.38) in these two-time frames. Nevertheless, the preoperative morbidity was more severe, and there was less use of general anesthesia during the pandemic time. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in 30-d mortality rate between hip fracture patients treated during the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods.

619981,Exploring patients’ pharmacy stories: an analysis of online feedback,2021-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Poor hygiene of housing induces a systemic inflammatory response. Because inflammation and oxidative stress are processes that can sustain each other, the ways pigs are able to activate their antioxidant defenses are critical for production performance and health during periods when the immune system is solicited. Selection for production performance can also influence reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and expression levels of genes involved in cellular response to oxidative stress in different tissues. To establish the extent by which poor hygiene and selection for feed efficiency affected redox status, pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were housed in poor or good hygiene during 6 weeks. At the end, blood was collected in all pigs, and half of them were killed for tissue sampling. The remaining pigs were reared in good hygiene conditions during a recovery period of 7–8 weeks. RESULTS: At week 6, poor hygiene was associated with a lower total antioxidant capacity assessed by plasma ferric reducing ability in all pigs, and with greater plasma levels of hydrogen peroxides in the high RFI pigs (less efficient). Adipose tissue of high RFI pigs exhibited higher activities of catalase and glutathione reductase, and greater thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations when compared with the low RFI pigs (more efficient). Poor hygiene conditions activated the antioxidant enzymes activities (glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in adipose tissue of both lines, but led to higher ROS production by mature adipocytes isolated from the high RFI pigs only. In liver and muscle, there were only minor changes in antioxidant molecules due to genetics and hygiene conditions. After the resilience period, adipose tissue of pigs previously challenged by poor hygiene maintained higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and for the high RFI line, displayed higher TBARS concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Pigs selected for improved feed efficiency showed a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions. This could led to a lower inflammatory response and less impaired growth when these pigs are facing sanitary challenges during the production period.","Sierżant, K.; Perruchot, M-H.; Merlot, E.; Le Floc’h, N.; Gondret, F.",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619228/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2107-2,428

623176,Good deeds and cheap marketing—The food industry in the times of COVID‐19,2020-05-22,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has infected millions of people around the world, which is leading to the global emergency. In the event of the virus outbreak, it is crucial to get the carriers of the virus timely and precisely, then the animal origins can be isolated for further infection. Traditional identifications rely on fields and laboratory researches that lag the responses to emerging epidemic prevention. With the development of machine learning, the efficiency of predicting the viral hosts has been demonstrated by recent researchers. However, the problems of the limited annotated virus data and imbalanced hosts information restrict these approaches to obtain a better result. To assure the high reliability of predicting the animal origins on COVID-19, we extend transfer learning and ensemble learning to present a hybrid transfer learning model. When predicting the hosts of newly discovered virus, our model provides a novel solution to utilize the related virus domain as auxiliary to help building a robust model for target virus domain. The simulation results on several UCI benchmarks and viral genome datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the general classical methods under the condition of limited target training sets and class-imbalance problems. By setting the coronavirus as target domain and other related virus as source domain, the feasibility of our approach is evaluated.

624020,Carving out a place for internal medicine during COVID‐19 epidemic in Italy,2020-05-04,"Background: Understanding resource use for COVID-19 is critical. We conducted a population-based cohort study using public health data to describe COVID-19 associated age- and sex-specific acute care use, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. Methods: We used Ontario Case and Contact Management (CCM) Plus database of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in Ontario from March 1 to September 30, 2020 to determine age- and sex-specific hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use, LOS, and mortality. We stratified analyses by month of infection to study temporal trends and conducted subgroup analyses by long-term care residency. Results: During the observation period, 56,476 COVID-19 cases were reported (72% < 60 years, 52% female). The proportion of cases shifted from older populations (> 60 years) to younger populations (10-39 years) over time. Overall, 10% of individuals were hospitalized, of those 22% were admitted to ICU, and 60% of those used IMV. Mean LOS for individuals in the ward, ICU without IMV, and ICU with IMV was 12.8, 8.5, 20.5 days, respectively. Mortality for individuals receiving care in the ward, ICU without IMV, and ICU with IMV was 24%, 30%, and 45%, respectively. All outcomes varied by age and decreased over time, overall and within age groups. Interpretation: This descriptive study shows acute care use and mortality varying by age, and decreasing between March and September in Ontario. Improvements in clinical practice and changing risk distributions among those infected may contribute to fewer severe outcomes among those infected with COVID-19.","Mac, S.; Barrett, K.; Khan, Y.

624728,A swaying between successive pandemic waves and pandemic fatigue: Where does Jordan stand?,2021-04-16,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is predominantly a respiratory disease. However, its significant impact on the gastrointestinal (GI) system is now well-known. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is abundantly expressed on lung cells, but also on enterocytes. Several etiopathogenetic mechanisms have been postulated to explain the GI involvement in COVID-19, including loss in intestinal absorption, microscopic mucosal inflammation and impaired ACE-2 function, which plays a significant role in maintaining gut homeostasis. In children the GI manifestations include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, which may represent the earliest presenting symptoms of the disease. However, although rare, a significant GI mucosal inflammation, such as terminal ileitis mimicking an atypical appendicitis, and other GI manifestations have been reported. COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant challenge in healthcare provision in term of ability in providing safe diagnostic procedures, face-to-face consultations, and offering comprehensive care. For instance, changes in health services have raised the risk of empirical or sub-optimal management of chronic GI disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to delayed endoscopic and clinical assessment. This review will discuss the acute GI involvement in COVID-19 in children and reflect on challenges and major changes observed in clinical practice during COVID-19 pandemic by sharing both the published literature and personal experience. We also suggest potential strategies for providing optimal gastroenterology care during this unprecedented era.","Puoti, Maria Giovanna; Rybak, Anna; Kiparissi, Fevronia; Gaynor, Edward; Borrelli, Osvaldo",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692973/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.617980,428

625465,Immunotherapies for COVID-19: lessons learned from sepsis,2020-04-28,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a global testing supply shortage. In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert(®) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert(®) Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert(®) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","Becker, Michael G.; Taylor, Tracy; Kiazyk, Sandra; Cabiles, Dana R.; Meyers, Adrienne F.

626147,COVID-19 in patients hospitalized and healthcare workers: what have changed after the first wave in a university hospital,2021-05-11,"[Image: see text] The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing to enable the efficient treatment and mitigation of COVID-19. The primary diagnostic tool currently employed is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which can have good sensitivity and excellent specificity. Unfortunately, implementation costs and logistical problems with reagents during the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have hindered its universal on demand adoption. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) represent a class of diagnostic that, if sufficiently clinically sensitive, may fill many of the gaps in the current RT-PCR testing regime, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To date, many serology LFAs have been developed, though none meet the performance requirements necessary for diagnostic use cases, primarily due to the relatively long delay between infection and seroconversion. However, on the basis of previously reported results from SARS-CoV-1, antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 assays may have significantly better clinical sensitivity than serology assays. To date, only a very small number of antigen-detecting LFAs have been developed. Development of a half-strip LFA is a useful first step in the development of any LFA format. In this work, we present a half-strip LFA using commercially available antibodies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We have tested this LFA in buffer and measured an LOD of 0.65 ng/mL (95% CI of 0.53 to 0.77 ng/mL) ng/mL with recombinant antigen using an optical reader with sensitivity equivalent to a visual read. Further development, including evaluating the appropriate sample matrix, will be required for this assay approach to be made useful in a point of care setting, though this half-strip LFA may serve as a useful starting point for others developing similar tests.","Grant, Benjamin D.; Anderson, Caitlin E.; Williford, John R.; Alonzo, Luis F.; Glukhova, Veronika A.; Boyle, David S.; Weigl, Bernhard H.; Nichols, Kevin P.",Anal Chem,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605363/,428

626507,A hybrid model of acute unscheduled cancer care provided by a hospital-based acute care clinic and the emergency department: a descriptive study,2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza (AI) is a public health challenge because of ongoing spread and pandemic potential. Non-pharmaceutical measures are important to prevent the spread of AI and to contain a pandemic. The effectiveness of such measures is largely dependent on the behaviour of the population. Risk perception is a central element in changing behaviour. This study aimed to investigate perceived vulnerability, severity and precautionary behaviour related to AI in the Netherlands during seven consecutive surveys in 2006 - 2007 as well as possible trends in risk perception and self-reported precautionary behaviours. METHODS: Seven web-based surveys were conducted including 3,840 respondents over a one-year period. Time trends were analyzed with linear regression analyses. Multivariate analysis was used to study determinants of precautionary behaviour. RESULTS: While infection with AI was considered a very severe health problem with mean score of 4.57 (scale 1 - 5); perceived vulnerability was much lower, with a mean score of 1.69. While perceived severity remained high, perceived vulnerability decreased slightly during a one-year period covering part of 2006 and 2007. Almost half of the respondents (46%) reported taking one or more preventive measures, with 36% reporting to have stayed away from (wild) birds or poultry. In multivariate logistic regression analysis the following factors were significantly associated with taking preventive measures: time of the survey, higher age, lower level of education, non-Dutch ethnicity, vaccinated against influenza, higher perceived severity, higher perceived vulnerability, higher self efficacy, lower level of knowledge, more information about AI, and thinking more about AI. Self efficacy was a stronger predictor of precautionary behaviour for those who never or seldom think about AI (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9 - 2.7), compared to those who think about AI more often (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 - 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that perceived severity of AI appears to be high and remains so over time offers a good point of departure for more specific risk communications to promote precautionary actions. Such communications should aim at improving knowledge about the disease and preventive actions, and focus on perceived personal vulnerability and self efficacy in taking preventive measures.","de Zwart, Onno; Veldhuijzen, Irene K; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Brug, Johannes",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20462419/,428
626756,Caring for cancer patients during COVID‐19 global pandemic: Risk factors and precautionary principle,2021-03-14,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a challenge for nursing homes in China. Nursing homes are particularly dangerous places in terms of the spread of COVID-19 given that they house vulnerable, high-risk populations. As such, several useful guidelines for coping with COVID-19 in nursing homes have been provided. However, the actual implementation rates of such guidelines are unknown. This study aims to document the adherence of nursing homes to the Ministry of Civil Affairs guidelines for COVID-19 prevention and control in nursing homes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 484 nursing homes in 136 cities of 28 provinces in China. A self-report questionnaire was created based on the Ministry of Civil Affairs guidelines for COVID-19 prevention and control in nursing homes (first edition). The questionnaire and the Transformational Leadership in the Public Sector Scale were sent to nursing home managers via the Wenjuanxing app online from February 7 to 29, 2020. Ultimately, 461 of 960 nursing homes participated, for a response rate of 48.0%. RESULTS: The average overall implementation rate of COVID-19 prevention and control measures was 80.0% (143.97/180). The average implementation rates for hygienic behaviour management and access management were lower, at 75.3 and 78.7%, respectively. Number of medical staff and transformational leadership score of nursing home’s manager were associated with total implementation score (p < 0.05). A total of 69.8% (322/461) of the nursing home managers had serious resource problems, and inadequate protective supplies (72.0%) and staff shortages (47.7%) were the two primary problems. The nursing homes that located in urban, with large nursing home size, had hospital-nursing home cooperation and the transformational leadership score of manager> 60, had a lower risk of having serious resource problems. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the implementation of prevention and control measures by nursing homes are insufficient during the epidemic in China. More medical staff, adequate resource, cooperation with hospitals, and higher transformational leadership of manager are required to improve the implementation rate. It is urgent for nursing homes to maintain the safety of residents and staff.

627322,Endocrine and metabolic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-09,"Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in mortality and complications following STEMI. The rarity of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) in the age of primary percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in a lack of expertise in its management. Our strategy has been to stabilize patients with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) then evaluate for surgical repair with revascularization as well as advanced options, such as heart transplantation. Here we present two cases. Case 1 A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. He was found to have acute occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) through which a wire was not able to be passed. He also had severe disease in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCx). An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed. On hospital day 6, hemodynamics worsened and he was found to have a large VSR of the basal inferoseptum and biventricular dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10-15%. He was placed emergently on VA ECMO. Ten days later, he underwent repair of VSR and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to LAD, and saphenous vein graft to an obtuse marginal. He underwent ECMO decannulation on post operative day 6. He was discharged home on post operative day 23 on medical therapy with an LVEF of 35%. He remains on medical therapy at 6 months. Case 2 A 43-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes suffered an inferoposterior STEMI. Coronary angiography showed acute occlusion of the RCA. He underwent thrombectomy and placement of two bare metal stents with no reflow, and placement of an IABP. He also had chronic occlusion of the LCx and 80% stenosis in the proximal LAD. A post procedure echocardiogram showed LVEF of 35-40%, severe right ventricular dysfunction, and VSR in the mid inferoseptum. He had worsening cardiogenic shock and underwent VA ECMO placement. On hospital day 9, he underwent VSR repair and single vessel CABG with LIMA to LAD. Due to inability to wean off bypass, he required placement of dual-pump biventricular support with Centrimag pumps after which he had persistent ventricular tachycardia. He was listed status 1A and underwent successful heart transplantation on hospital day 20. He is doing well at follow up. Summary We presented two cases of ventricular septal rupture complicating myocardial infarction, both with successful outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians will need to maintain a high index of suspicion of mechanical complications of late presenting STEMI.","Hussain, Sheraz; Pillarella, Jessica; Pauwaa, Sunil; Macaluso, Gregory; Joshi, Anjali; Sciamanna, Christopher; Narang, Nikhil; Tatooles, Antone; Pappas, Patroklos; Cotts, William; Andrade, Ambar",Journal of Cardiac Failure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420312550; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420312550,428

627927,Development of minimal basic data set to report COVID-19,2020-09-01,"Animal shelters provide an ideal environment for the spread of disease. Dogs are often housed in close quarters with others of unknown vaccine histories, and experience high levels of sustained stress. As a result, Canine Infection Respiratory Disease (CIRD) is often prevalent and difficult to control. The aims of this study were to (1) identify specific pathogens responsible for CIRD in a city shelter in West Texas, USA, and (2) determine whether intake vaccinations decrease proportion of dogs exhibiting signs of CIRD even during an outbreak. A laboratory analysis of conjunctival, pharyngeal, and nasal swabs (n = 15 dogs) and fecal samples (n = 6 kennels) showed prevalence of various CIRD pathogens (e.g., canine adenovirus-2, canine parainfluenza virus, canine distemper virus). All fifteen dogs tested positive for at least one pathogen, with the most prevalent pathogen being Canine Distemper Virus (CDV; n = 12). All of the kennels (n=6) tested positive for Canine Distemper Virus. Health data on dogs (n = 1,258) over the age of 6 weeks were assessed from May to August 2017. Beginning in July, both stray and owner-surrendered dogs were vaccinated with Nobivac(®) Canine 1-DAPPv 5 Way and Nobivac(®) Intra-Trac(®) 3 upon intake, which differed from the previous policy. For each day in the study, we calculated the proportion of dogs in each nasal discharge category, the proportion of dogs observed coughing, and the mean fecal score across all dogs. We conducted a linear regression between the proportion of the shelter vaccinated and the proportion of dogs coughing. At the beginning of the vaccination phase, ~25% of the dogs were coughing. However, as the proportion of the dogs vaccinated increased, the proportion of dogs coughing decreased. There was a significant decrease of 7% of the proportion of dogs coughing when vaccination was at least at 90% compared to when it was <90%. These data suggest that the shelter in this study was experiencing a CIRD outbreak, with CDV being primary pathogen, and that it is possible to substantially reduce illness by implementing a vaccination on intake protocol. The current study provides support for the importance of vaccination in animal shelter welfare.","Andrukonis, Allison; Brown, Kelsea M.; Hall, Nathaniel J.; Protopopova, Alexandra",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.627580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614767/,428

Data were retrospectively collected from seven males (age 37–61 years) who were referred for inpatient rehabilitation following the stay in the ICU (14–22 days). On admission, six patients were still supported by mechanical ventilation. All patients were first placed in isolation in a special COVID unit for 6–22 days. Patients attended 11–24 treatment sessions for the duration of rehabilitation stay (13–27 days), including 6–20 sessions in the COVID unit. The treatment included pulmonary and physical rehabilitation. The initially nonventilated patient was discharged prematurely due to gallbladder problems, whereas all six mechanically ventilated patients were successfully weaned off before transfer to a COVID-free unit where they stayed for 7–19 days.

We apply our technique to coupled ordinary and partial differential equation models of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics operating on different scales, that is, within a single organism and between several hosts. The structure of a model is assessed by the theory of chemical organizations, not requiring quantitative kinetic information. We present the Hasse diagrams of organizations for the twelve virus models analyzed within this study. For comparing models, each organization is characterized by the types of species it contains. For this, each species is mapped to one out of four types, representing uninfected, infected, immune system, and bacterial species, respectively. Subsequently, we can integrate these results with those of our former work on Influenza-A virus resulting in a single joint hierarchy of 24 models. It appears that the SARS-CoV-2 models are simpler with respect to their long term behavior and thus display a simpler hierarchy with little dependencies compared to the Influenza-A models. Our results can support further development towards more complex SARS-CoV-2 models targeting the higher levels of the hierarchy.","Peter, Stephan; Dittrich, Peter; Ibrahim, Bashar",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374824/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13010014,428

Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths. A 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19.","Wu, Yu; Jing, Wenzhan; Liu, Jue; Ma, Qiuyue; Yuan, Jie; Wang, Yaping; Du, Min; Liu, Min",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361460/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325687?v=s5,428

To better understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and its adaptation to the host, it is therefore crucial to investigate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating lately in the epidemic. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs have been analyzed for viral load in the early (March 2020) and late (May 2020) phases of epidemic in Brescia, Italy. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from 2 high viral load specimens identified on March 9 (AP66) and on May 8 (GZ69) was performed on Vero E6 cells. Amount of virus released was assessed by quantitative PCR. Genotypic characterization of AP66 and GZ69 was performed by next generation sequencing followed by an in-depth in silico analysis of nucleotide mutations. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 strain, isolated in May from an asymptomatic healthcare worker, showed an unprecedented capability of replication in Vero E6 cells in the absence of any evident cytopathic effect. Vero E6 subculturing, up to passage 4, showed that SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 infection was as productive as the one sustained by the cytopathic strain AP66. Whole genome sequencing of the persistently replicating SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 has shown that this strain differs from the early AP66 variant in 9 nucleotide positions (C2939T; C3828T; G21784T; T21846C; T24631C; G28881A; G28882A; G28883C; G29810T) which lead to 6 non-synonymous substitutions spanning on ORF1ab (P892S; S1188L), S (K74N; I95T) and N (R203K, G204R) proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the peculiar SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 strain in the late Italian epidemic highlights the need to better characterize viral variants circulating among asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals. The current approach could unravel the ways for future studies aimed at analyzing the selection process which favours viral mutations in the human host.","Caccuri, Francesca; Zani, Alberto; Messali, Serena; Giovanetti, Marta; Bugatti, Antonella; Campisi, Giovanni; Filippini, Federica; Scaltriti, Erika; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Fiorentini, Simona; Caruso, Arnaldo",J Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02535-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967693/,428

In absence of specific drugs to COVID-19, there is an urgent need to look for alternative approaches. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to review the roles of micronutrients and bioactive substances as potential alternative approaches in combating COVID-19. METHODS: This review was based on literature identified using electronic searches in different databases. RESULTS: Vitamins (A, B, C, D and E), minerals (selenium and zinc) and bioactive substances from curcumin, echinacea, propolis, garlic, soybean, green tea, and other polyphenols were identified for having potential roles in interfering with spike glycoproteins, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) at the entry site; and inhibiting activities of Papain-Like protease (PLpro), 3 Chymotrypsin-Like protease (3CLpro) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Having immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral properties, such micronutrients and bioactive substances are consequently the promising alterative nutritional approaches to combat COVID-19. CONCLUSION: To put in nutshell, the roles of micronutrients and bioactive substances in COVID-19 are exciting research areas and thus, this review may guide researchers to undertake further studies.","Keflie, Tibebeselassie Seyoum; Biesalski, Hans Konrad",Nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450678/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900720303865?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.111103; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900720303865,428

We assessed the effect of TM (AirView Online System, ResMed) during the CPAP habituation phase on 3-month and 1-year treatment adherence and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: At CPAP initiation, 120 patients diagnosed with OSA were randomized to either usual care (UC) or TM during the habituation phase (clinical registration: ISRCTN12865936). Both groups received a first face-to-face appointment with a sleep care giver at CPAP initiation. Within the following month, 2 other physical visits were scheduled in the UC group whereas two phone consultations were planned in the TM group, in which CPAP parameters were remotely adapted. Additional physical visits were programmed at the patient's request. Face-to-face consultations were scheduled at 3 and 12 months after CPAP initiation. The primary outcome was the mean CPAP daily use over the course of 12 months. Results: Twenty of 60 patients stopped CPAP therapy in the UC group vs. 14 of 60 in the TM group (p = 0.24). In per protocol analysis, mean [95% CI] daily CPAP use among 86 patients still using CPAP at 12 months was 279 [237; 321] min in the 38 patients on UC and 279 [247; 311] min in the 43 patients on TM, mean difference [95% CI]: 0 [−52; 52] min, P = 0.99. Total consultation time per patient was not different between groups, TM: 163 [147; 178] min, UC: 178 [159; 197] min, difference: −15 [−39; 9] min, p = 0.22. Conclusions: Telemedicine during the CPAP habituation phase did not alter daily CPAP use or treatment adherence and did not require more healthcare time. Telemedicine may support clinic attendance for CPAP titration.

Dies stellt Kliniker und Krankenhäuser vor große Herausforderungen und belastet die Gesundheitssysteme vieler Länder in einem nie dagewesenen Ausmaß. Die Mehrheit der Patienten zeigt lediglich milde Symptome der sogenannten Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Dennoch benötigen etwa 5–8 % eine intensivmedizinische Behandlung. Die akute hypoxämische respiratorische Insuffizienz mit Dyspnoe und hoher Atemfrequenz (>30/Min) führt in der Regel zur Aufnahme auf die Intensivstation. Oft finden sich dann bereits bilaterale pulmonale Infiltrate/Konsolidierungen oder auch Lungenembolien in der Bildgebung. Im weiteren Verlauf entwickeln viele Patienten ein Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Eine klinische Wirksamkeit einer medikamentösen Therapie bei schwerer COVID-Erkrankung (hospitalisierte Patienten) ist bisher für Remdesivir und Dexamethason nachgewiesen. Das Hauptziel der supportiven Therapie ist es eine ausreichende Oxygenierung sicherzustellen. Die invasive Beatmung und wiederholte Bauchlagerung sind dabei wichtige Elemente in der Behandlung von schwer hypoxämischen COVID-19 Patienten. Die strikte Einhaltung der Basishygiene, einschließlich der Händehygiene, sowie das korrekte Tragen von adäquater persönlicher Schutzausrüstung sind im Umgang mit den Patienten unabdingbar.

While the RT-PCR kits are available in sufficient quantity in several countries, others are facing challenges with limited availability of testing kits and processing centers in remote areas. This has motivated researchers to find alternate methods of testing which are reliable, easily accessible and faster. Chest X-Ray is one of the modalities that is gaining acceptance as a screening modality. Towards this direction, the paper has two primary contributions. Firstly, we present the COVID-19 Multi-Task Network (COMiT-Net) which is an automated end-to-end network for COVID-19 screening. The proposed network not only predicts whether the CXR has COVID-19 features present or not, it also performs semantic segmentation of the regions of interest to make the model explainable. Secondly, with the help of medical professionals, we manually annotate the lung regions and semantic segmentation of COVID19 symptoms in CXRs taken from the ChestXray-14, CheXpert, and a consolidated COVID-19 dataset. These annotations will be released to the research community. Experiments performed with more than 2500 frontal CXR images show that at 90% specificity, the proposed COMiT-Net yields 96.80% sensitivity.","Malhotra, Aakarsh; Mittal, Surbhi; Majumdar, Puspita; Chhabra, Saheb; Thakral, Kartik; Vatsa, Mayank; Singh, Richa; Chaudhury, Santanu; Pudrod, Ashwin; Agrawal, Anjali",Pattern Recognit,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321004246?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321004246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456368/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108243,428

The causal agent of this disease is a coronavirus whose onset of symptoms to death range from 6 to 41 days with a median of 14 days. This period is dependent on several factors such as the presence of comorbidities, age and the efficiency of the innate or adaptive immune responses. The effectors mechanisms of both types of immune responses depend on the pathogen involved. In the case of a viral infection, the innate immune response may approach the harmful virus through pattern recognition receptors inducing an antiviral state. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response activates antibody production to neutralize or eliminate the virus. Phenolics are plant secondary metabolites with many biological activities for plants and humans against infection. Chemical modification of proteins may enhance their biological properties; thus, a protein of medical interest, for instance, a viral protein can be used as scaffold to build a biopharmaceutical conjugated or complexated with phenolics exhibiting structural complexity or biological activities to achieve effective phenolic-protein-based therapeutics like vaccine adjuvant complexes, immunogen conjugates, and antiviral conjugates. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical biotechnology applies the principles of biotechnology to develop biopharmaceuticals for protein-based therapeutics; such as adjuvants, recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals. As neither a vaccine nor a treatment for COVID-19 is currently available, this manuscript focuses on insights from pharmaceutical biotechnology into phenolic biopharmaceuticals against COVID-19.","Cabral-Hipólito, Nidia; Molina-Ramírez, Brenda; Sevilla-González, María-de-la-Luz; MezaVelázquez, Rocío; García-Garza, Rubén; Velázquez Gauna, Sergio-Everardo; Castillo-Maldonado, Irais; Delgadillo-Guzmán, Dealmy; Rivera-Guillén, Mario-Alberto; Serrano-Gallardo, Luis-Benjamín; Vega-Menchaca, María-Del-Carmen; Ramírez-Moreno, Agustina; Pedroza-Escobar, David",Curr pharm. biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201021666201104144509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148151/,428

Since the accessibility of live virus microneutralisation (MN) assays with SARS-CoV-2 is limited and requires enhanced bio-containment, the approach based on “pseudotyping” can be considered a useful complement to other serological assays. After fully characterising lentiviral pseudotypes bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we employed them in pseudotype-based neutralisation assays in order to profile the neutralising activity of human serum samples from an Italian sero-epidemiological study. The results obtained with pseudotype-based neutralisation assays mirrored those obtained when the same panel of sera was tested against the wild type virus, showing an evident convergence of the pseudotype-based neutralisation and MN results. The overall results lead to the conclusion that the pseudotype-based neutralisation assay is a valid alternative to using the wild-type strain, and although this system needs to be optimised and standardised, it can not only complement the classical serological methods, but also allows serological assessments to be made when other methods cannot be employed, especially in a human pandemic context.","Hyseni, Inesa; Molesti, Eleonora; Benincasa, Linda; Piu, Pietro; Casa, Elisa; Temperton, Nigel J; Manenti, Alessandro; Montomoli, Emanuele",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32927639/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12091011,428

This study developed and subsequently applied a simulation program based on clinical reasoning for AML to improve the learning outcomes and describe the learning experience for nursing students. Following a mixed-methods framework, the program’s effects on students’ knowledge were quantitatively measured, while their learning experience was qualitatively measured using self-reflection through journal writing. Differences in the pre- and post-scores between the experimental and control groups were statistically significant for theoretical knowledge and clinical performance. In addition, content analysis of both groups’ journals revealed three themes: (1) transformation into a self-directed learner for understanding the clinical situation, (2) increased awareness of clinical reasoning ability, and (3) embodiment of the clinical reasoning process. Standardizing the developed program’s scenarios prompted the participants’ compliance and engagement, and effectively achieved the learning outcomes. This simulation program aided the assessment of nursing intervention’s effectiveness and suggested objective criteria according to clinical reasoning.

METHODS: To evaluate CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 as cancer biomarkers, it was generated and characterised several novel specific polyclonal antibodies (PAb), monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and soluble Fab fragments (sFabs) against recombinant CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins, which were obtained from different sources, including a human antibody library and immunised animals. The antibodies and Fab fragments were tested for recognition of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins by immunoblotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in colorectal cell lines derived from tumour and cancer tissues. RESULTS: Both, antibodies and a Fab fragment showed high specificity since they recognised only their corresponding recombinant antigens, but not a panel of different unrelated- and related proteins. In Western blot analysis of CTHRC1, a monoclonal antibody designated CH21D7 was able to detect a band of the apparent molecular weight of a full-length CTHRC1 in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29. This result was confirmed by a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) with the monoclonal antibodies CH21D7 and CH24G2, detecting CTHRC1 in HT29 and in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW620. Similar experiments were performed with PAb, MAbs, and sFab against NFE2L3. The immunoblot analysis showed that the monoclonal antibody 41HF8 recognised NFE2L3 in HT29, and leukocytes. These results were verified by DAS-ELISA assay using the pairs PAb/sFab E5 and MAb 41HF8/sFab E5. Furthermore, an immunoassay for simultaneous detection of the two cancer biomarkers was developed using a Dissociation-Enhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay technology (DELFIA). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the antibodies obtained in this study are specific for CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 since they do not cross-react with unrelated- and related proteins and are useful for specific measurement of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins. The antibodies and immunoassays may be useful for the analysis of CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 in clinical samples and for screening of therapeutic compounds in CRC.","Palma, Marco; Lopez, Lissett; García, Margarita; de Roja, Nuria; Ruiz, Tamara; García, Julita; Rosell, Elisabet; Vela, Carmen; Rueda, Paloma; Rodriguez, María-Jose",BMC Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6890-12-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22321245/,428
639179,A cloth mask for under-resourced healthcare settings in the COVID19 pandemic,2020-05-12,"Background Few large, cohort studies report data on individuals maternal, fetal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. We report outcomes from a collaboration formed early during the pandemic between the investigators of two registries, the UK and global Pregnancy and Neonatal outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study and the US American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine (AAP SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry. Methods PAN-COVID (suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage in pregnancy) and the AAP SONPM registry (positive maternal testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 14 days before delivery to 3 days after delivery) studies collected data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. PAN-COVID results are presented as all inclusions and those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection only. Results We report 4004 women in pregnancy affected by suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (1606 from PAN-COVID and 2398 from the AAP SONPM) from January 1st 2020 to July 25th 2020 (PAN-COVID) and August 8th (AAP SONPM). For obstetric outcomes in PAN-COVID and AAP SONPM, respectively, maternal death occurred in 0.5% and 0.17%, early neonatal death in 0.2% and 0.3%, and stillbirth in 0.50% and 0.65% of women. Delivery was pre-term (<37 weeks gestation) in 12% of all women in PAN-COVID, in 16.2% of those women with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and 16.2% of women in AAP SONPM. Very preterm delivery (< 27 weeks gestation) occurred in 0.6% in PAN-COVID and 0.7% in AAP SONPM. Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 0.8% of PAN-COVID all inclusions, 2.0% in PAN-COVID confirmed infections and 1.8% in the AAP SONPM study; the proportions of babies tested were 9.5%, 20.7% and 87.2% respectively. The proportion of SGA babies was 8.2% in PAN-COVID all inclusions, 9.7% in PAN-COVID confirmed infection and 9.6% in AAP SONPM. Gestational age adjusted mean z-scores were -0.03 for PAN-COVID and -0.18 for AAP SONPM. Conclusions The findings from the UK and US SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy registries were remarkably concordant. Pre-term delivery affected a higher proportion of women in pregnancy than expected from historical and contemporaneous national data. The proportions of women affected by stillbirth, small for gestational age infants and early neonatal death were comparable to historical and contemporaneous UK and US data. Although maternal death was uncommon, the proportion was higher than expected from UK and US population data, likely explained by under-ascertainment of women affected by milder and asymptomatic infection in pregnancy. The data presented support strong guidance for enhanced precautions to prevent SARS-COV-2 infection in pregnancy, particularly in the context of increased risks of preterm delivery and maternal mortality, and for priority vaccination of women planning pregnancy.","Mullins, E.; Hudak, M.; Banerjee, J.; Getzlaff, T.; Townson, J.; Barnette, K.; Playle, R.; Bourne, T.; PAN-COVID-investigators,; National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry Study Group,; Lees, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249325v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.21249325,428

However, this test takes considerable time before test results become available, thereby delaying patients from being diagnosed, treated, and isolated immediately. Rapid antigen tests could overcome this problem. In the first study, clinical performances of five rapid antigen tests were compared to RT-qPCR in upper respiratory specimens from 40 patients with positive and 40 with negative RTq-PCR results. In the second study, the rapid antigen test with one of the best test characteristics (Romed) was evaluated in a large prospective collection of upper respiratory specimens from 900 different COVID-19-suspected patients (300 emergency room patients, 300 nursing home patients, and 300 health care workers). Test specificities ranged from 87.5 to 100.0%, and test sensitivities from 55.0 to 80.0%. The clinical specificity of the Romed test was 99.8% (95% CI 98.9–100). Overall clinical sensitivity in the study population was 73.3% (95% CI 67.9–78.2), whereas sensitivity in the different patient groups varied from 65.3 to 86.7%. Sensitivity was 83.0 to 86.7% in patients with short duration of symptoms. In a population with a COVID-19 prevalence of 1%, the negative predictive value in all patients was 99.7%. There is a large variability in diagnostic performance between rapid antigen tests. The Romed rapid antigen test showed a good clinical performance in patients with high viral loads (RT-qPCR cycle threshold ≤30), which makes this antigen test suitable for rapid identification of COVID-19-infected health care workers and patients.","Koeleman, Johannes G.

We interviewed fourteen people working at different organizations, that develop IVT applications in the Nordic region. We used thematic analysis to derive themes from the interviews. The results showed an insufficient knowledge and application of HF in IVT development, due to the lack of awareness of both scope and significance of HF, resource allocation strategy, market inertia, stakeholder's involvement, standardization of HF application and IVT uses, and technology maturity. This situation could be improved by allocating experts, adjusting organizational strategy to balance resource allocation, training developers and user organizations to raise awareness and to encourage co-creative design and knowledge sharing, create a sense of ownership amongst stakeholders, and ensure the usefulness of the technology to the user's work.","Saghafian, Mina; Sitompul, Taufik Akbar; Laumann, Karin; Sundnes, Kristina; Lindell, Rikard",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732195/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.634352,428
640760,Letter From the Editor: COVID and Biologics,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND: In North America the opioid poisoning crisis currently faces the unprecedented challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, further straining people and communities already facing structural and individual vulnerabilities. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in response to COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best practices (e.g., physical distancing) if they’re financially insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that if a carry was possible during the pandemic, then the carry could continue post COVID-19 to address a gap in our approach to individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present the first case of a patient in Canada with long-term OUD that received take home injectable diacetylmorphine to self-isolate in an approved site after being diagnosed with COVID-19 during a visit to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with cellulitis and admitted to receive antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In the present case we demonstrated that it is feasible to provide iOAT outside the community clinic with no apparent negative consequences. Improving upon and making permanent these recently introduced risk mitigating guidance during COVID-19, have the potential not just to protect during the pandemic, but also to address long-overdue barriers to access evidence-based care in addiction treatment.","Oviedo-Joekes, Eugenia; MacDonald, Scott; Boissonneault, Charles; Harper, Kelli",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-021-00358-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673847/,428
641501,"Impact of COVID-19 and other infectious conditions requiring isolation on the provision of and adaptations to fundamental nursing care in hospital in terms of overall patient experience, care quality, functional ability, and treatment outcomes: systematic review",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many countries oscillating between various states of lock-down as they seek to balance keeping the economy and essential services running and minimizing the risk of further transmission. Decisions are made about which activities to keep open across a range of social settings and venues guided only by ad hoc heuristics regarding social distancing and personal hygiene. Hence, we propose the dual use of computational fluid dynamic simulations and surrogate aerosol measurements for location-specific assessment of risk of infection across different real-world settings. We propose a 3-tiered risk assessment scheme to facilitate classification of scenarios into risk levels based on simulations and experiments. Threshold values of <54 and >840 viral copies and <5% and >40% of original aerosol concentration are chosen to stratify low, medium, and high risk. This can help prioritize allowable activities and guide implementation of phased lockdowns or re-opening. Using a public bus in Singapore as a case study, we evaluate the relative risk of infection across scenarios such as different activities and passenger positions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk assessment methodology as a simple and easily interpretable framework. For example, this study revealed that the bus's air-conditioning greatly influences dispersion and increases the risk of certain seats and that talking can result in similar relative risk to coughing for passengers around an infected person. Both numerical and experimental approaches show similar relative risk levels with a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.74 despite differing observables, demonstrating applicability of this risk assessment methodology to other scenarios.","Ooi, Chin Chun; Suwardi, Ady; Ou Yang, Zhong Liang; Xu, George; Tan, Chee Kiang Ivan; Daniel, Dan; Li, Hongying; Ge, Zhengwei; Leong, Fong Yew; Marimuthu, Kalisvar; Ng, Oon Tek; Lim, Shin Bin; Lim, Peter; Mak, Wai Siong; Cheong, Wun Chet Davy; Loh, Xian Jun; Kang, Chang Wei; Lim, Keng Hui",Phys Fluids (1994),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552314/; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0055547,428

However, one of the major limitations of nucleoside analogues is the development of antiviral resistance. In that regard, flexible nucleoside analogues known as “fleximers” have garnered attention over the years due to their ability to survey different amino acids in enzyme binding sites, thus overcoming the potential development of antiviral resistance. Acyclic fleximers have previously demonstrated antiviral activity against numerous viruses including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and, most recently, flaviviruses such as Dengue (DENV) and Yellow Fever Virus (YFV).

644760,“A Divine Infection”: A Systematic Review on the Roles of Religious Communities During the Early Stage of COVID-19,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Telehealth plays a key role in supporting health care systems and influencing methods of health care delivery. Government laws and medical operating protocols have been largely modified to provide remote care to reduce social contact and ensure a safer patient environment. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the Ministry of Health (MOH) introduced several forms of telemedicine as alternatives to face-to-face consultations in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the awareness and utilization of telehealth services before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in the KSA. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we compared the awareness and utilization of 937-telephone health services (ie, a toll-free telephone service to provide medical and administrative health care services at any time for the population) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in the KSA. Using a convenience sampling technique, a validated web-based questionnaire was distributed on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) at 2 timepoints: before (February 2019) and during (May 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The study sample comprised a total of 1961 participants who completed the questionnaire before (n=1303, 66%) and during (n=658, 33%) the COVID-19 pandemic. Both awareness (before=46% vs during=78%) and utilization (before=42% vs during=48%) of the 937-telephone health services increased significantly during the pandemic (P<.001). No significant association of the awareness or utilization of 937-telephone health services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was found with respect to the participants’ age, education level, having children, or having any chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate significant increases in the awareness and utilization of 937-telephone health services during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting an increase in public acceptance of the service and providing evidence of an equitable telemedicine service for the population. Further studies are needed to provide a deeper understanding of the barriers and facilitators to the use of 937-telephone health services for different groups of the population.","Al-Rayes, Saja A; Alumran, Arwa; Aljabri, Duaa; Aljaffary, Afnan; Aldoukhi, Ethar; Alahmedalyousif, Zainab; Al Madani, Reem",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156963/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27618,428

Cell-free supernatants (CFS) and live LAB were evaluated for antiviral activities by co-incubation on Vero cells and challenged with a pandemic strain of PEDV isolated from pigs in Thailand. Cell survival and viral inhibition were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay and confirmed by immunofluorescence. At 1:16, CFS dilution (pH 6.3–6.8) showed no cytotoxicity in Vero cells and was therefore used as the dilution for antiviral assays. The diluted CFS of all Lact. plantarum showed the antiviral effect against PEDV; however, the same antiviral effect could not be observed in Ent. faecium and Pediococcus strains. In competitive experiment, only live Lact. plantarum 25F and Ped. pentosaceus 77F showed CPE reduction in the viral infected cells to <50% observed field area. This study concluded that the CFS of all tested lactobacilli, and live Lact. plantarum (22F and 25F) and Pediococcus strains 72N and 77F could reduce infectivity of the pandemic strain of PEDV from pigs in Thailand on the target Vero cells.

645609,Utilization of health services for skin disorders during military operations. A population- based study,2020-12-22,"PURPOSE: Chest imaging modalities play a key role for the management of patient with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the optimal chest imaging approach in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and radiology departments tend to use different approaches. Thus, the main objective of this survey was to assess how chest imaging modalities have been used during the different phases of the first COVID-19 wave in Italy, and which diagnostic technique and reporting system would have been preferred based on the experience gained during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The questionnaire of the survey consisted of 26 questions. The link to participate in the survey was sent to all members of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM). RESULTS: The survey gathered responses from 716 SIRM members. The most notable result was that the most used and preferred chest imaging modality to assess/exclude/monitor COVID-19 pneumonia during the different phases of the first COVID-19 wave was computed tomography (51.8% to 77.1% of participants). Additionally, while the narrative report was the most used reporting system (55.6% of respondents), one-third of participants would have preferred to utilize structured reporting systems. CONCLUSION: This survey shows that the participants’ responses did not properly align with the imaging guidelines for managing COVID-19 that have been made by several scientific, including SIRM. Therefore, there is a need for continuing education to keep radiologists up to date and aware of the advantages and limitations of the chest imaging modalities and reporting systems.","Borghesi, Andrea; Sverzellati, Nicola; Polverosi, Roberta; Balbi, Maurizio; Baratella, Elisa; Busso, Marco; Calandriello, Lucio; Cortese, Giancarlo; Farchione, Alessandra; Iezzi, Roberto; Palmucci, Stefano; Pulzato, Ilaria; Rampinelli, Cristiano; Romei, Chiara; Valentini, Adele; Grassi, Roberto; Larici, Anna Rita",Radiol Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-021-01385-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196908/,428

However, this positive trend has led to an increase in the number of older people with a growing need for a sustainable system for the long-term care of this part of the population, which includes social and health services that are essential for a high quality of life. Longevity also brings challenges in the form of a polymorbid geriatric population that places financial pressure on healthcare systems. Regardless, one disease dominates the debate about financial sustainability due to the increasing numbers of people diagnosed, and that is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The presented paper aims to demonstrate the economic burden of social and healthcare services. Data from two regions in the Czech Republic were selected to demonstrate the potential scope of the problem. The future costs connected with AD are calculated by a prediction model, which is based on a population model for predicting the number of people with AD between 2020 and 2070. Based on the presented data from the two regions in the Czech Republic and the prediction model, several trends emerged. There appears to be a significant difference in the annual direct costs per person diagnosed with AD depending on the region in which they reside. This may lead to a significant inequality of the services a person can acquire followed by subsequent social issues that can manifest as a lower quality of life. Furthermore, given the prediction of the growing AD population, the costs expressed in constant prices based on the year 2020 will increase almost threefold during the period 2020–2070. The predicted threefold increase will place additional financial pressure on all stakeholders responsible for social and healthcare services, as the current situation is already challenging.","Maresova, Petra; Komarkova, Lenka; Kuhnova, Jitka; Cimler, Richard; Pazitny, Peter; Kandilaki, Daniela; Musilek, Kamil; Truhlarova, Zuzana; Zemek, Filip; Kuca, Kamil",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33114626/,428

Its collection involves close contact between patients and health care workers, requiring a significant amount of workforce and putting them at risk of infection. We evaluated self-collection of alternative specimens and compared their sensitivity and cycle threshold (CT) values to those of NPS. We visited acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outpatients to collect concomitant NPS and gargle specimens and had patients self-collect gargle and either sputum or spit specimens the next morning. We included 40 patients and collected 40 concomitant NPS and gargle specimens, as well as 40 gargle, 22 spit, and 16 sputum specimens the next day (2 patients could not produce sputum). All specimens were as sensitive as NPS. Gargle specimens had a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.00), whether collected concomitantly with NPS or the next morning. Next-morning spit and sputum specimens showed sensitivities of 1.00 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.00) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.00]), respectively. The gargle specimens had significantly higher mean CT values of 29.89 (standard deviation [SD], 4.63; P < 0.001) and 29.25 (SD, 3.99; P < 0.001) when collected concomitantly and the next morning, respectively, compared to NPS (22.07 [SD, 4.63]). CT values obtained with spit (23.51 [SD, 4.57]; P = 0.11) and sputum (25.82 [SD, 9.21]; P = 0.28) specimens were close to those of NPS. All alternative specimen collection methods were as sensitive as NPS, but spit collection appeared more promising, with a low CT value and ease of collection. Our findings warrant further investigation. IMPORTANCE Control of the COVID-19 pandemic relies heavily on a test-trace-isolate strategy. The most commonly used specimen for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a nasopharyngeal swab. However, this method is quite uncomfortable for the patient, requires specific equipment (nose swabs and containers), and requires close proximity to health care workers, putting them at risk of infection. Developing alternative sampling strategies could decrease the burden for health care workers, help overcome potential shortages of equipment, and improve acceptability of testing by reducing patient discomfort.","Poukka, Eero; Mäkelä, Henna; Hagberg, Lotta; Vo, Thuan; Nohynek, Hanna; Ikonen, Niina; Liitsola, Kirsi; Helve, Otto; Savolainen-Kopra, Carita; Dub, Timothée",Microbiol Spectr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431686/; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00035-21,428

648461,Dental Practice Infection Control Measurements: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreaks,2020,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is accelerated by the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and the environment. In 2015, the World Health Organization recognised AMR as one of the top ten global health threats, due to its potential to neutralise humanity’s advancements in western medicine by enabling the emergence of new strains of existing pathogens, many of which have no available treatments. Over the past decade, several countries, including those in low- and middle-income contexts, have started implementing interventions to tackle AMR. However, economic evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of these interventions remains weak. To address this evidence gap, we will conduct a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive summary on the value for money of different AMR interventions. METHODS: We aim to conduct a systematic literature review of all available economic evaluations on interventions addressing AMR and will provide a narrative synthesis of our findings. Systematic searches for relevant studies will be performed across all suitable databases as well as in grey literature sources such as unpublished studies, reports, and other relevant documents. All economic evaluation studies will be included as long as they report an economic outcome and have stated that the analysed intervention will reduce antimicrobial resistance or antimicrobial use in the abstract. Those studies reporting clinical endpoints alone will be excluded. Selection for final inclusion and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers. DISCUSSION: The review will be one of the first of its kind, and the most recent, to systematically review literature on the cost-effectiveness of AMR interventions, an important evidence gap in the economics of AMR. The findings will enable policy and decision-makers, particularly in resource-constrained settings, to better use available resources when selecting interventions to address AMR burdens, SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020190310 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13643-021-01794-3.","Ananthakrishnan, Aparna; Painter, Chris; Teerawattananon, Yot",Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34488879/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01794-3,428

650387,Nipping Adipocyte Inflammation in the Bud,2021-02-14,"Together with the universally recognized SIR model, several approaches have been employed to understand the contagion dynamics of interacting particles. Here, Active Brownian particles (ABP) are introduced to model the contagion dynamics of living agents that perform a horizontal transmission of an infectious disease in space and time. By performing an ensemble average description of the ABP simulations, we statistically describe susceptible, infected, and recovered groups in terms of particle densities, activity, contagious rates, and random recovery times. Our results show that ABP reproduces the time dependence observed in traditional compartmental models such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovery (SIR) models and allows us to explore the critical densities and the contagious radius that facilitates the virus spread. Furthermore, we derive a first-principles analytical expression for the contagion rate in terms of microscopic parameters, without considering free parameters as the classical SIR-based models. This approach offers a novel alternative to incorporate microscopic processes into analyzing SIR-based models with applications in a wide range of biological systems.","Norambuena, Ariel; Valencia, Felipe J.; Guzmán-Lastra, Francisca",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77860-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257706/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13220v1.pdf,428

651202,A protocol for a systematic literature review of economic evaluation studies of interventions to address antimicrobial resistance,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza are often treated in intensive care units (ICUs), representing significant risk of nosocomial transmission to critical care clinicians and other patients. Despite a large body of literature and guidelines recommending infection control practices, numerous barriers have been identified in ICUs, leading to poor compliance to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The use of PPE among critical care clinicians has not been extensively evaluated, especially during the pandemic influenza. This study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors, and barriers to compliance with the use of PPE among ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) during the pandemic influenza. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A survey instrument consisting of 36 questions was developed and mailed to all HCWs in 21 ICUs in 17 provinces in China. A total of 733 physicians, nurses, and other professionals were surveyed, and 650 (88.7%) were included in the analysis. Fifty-six percent of respondents reported having received training program of pandemic influenza before they cared for H1N1 patients, while 77% reported to have adequate knowledge of self and patient protection. Only 18% of respondents were able to correctly identify all components of PPE, and 55% reported high compliance (>80%) with PPE use during patient care. In multivariate analysis, vaccination for 2009 H1N1 influenza, positive attitudes towards PPE use, organizational factors such as availability of PPE in ICU, and patient information of influenza precautions, as well as reprimand for noncompliance by the supervisors were associated with high compliance, whereas negative attitudes towards PPE use and violation of PPE use were independent predictors of low compliance. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge and self-reported compliance to recommended PPE use among Chinese critical care clinicians is suboptimal. The perceived barriers should be addressed in order to close the significant gap between perception and knowledge or behavior.","Hu, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Zhidan; Li, Na; Liu, Dexin; Zhang, Li; He, Wei; Zhang, Wei; Li, Yuexia; Zhu, Cheng; Zhu, Guijun; Zhang, Lipeng; Xu, Fang; Wang, Shouhong; Cao, Xiangyuan; Zhao, Huiying; Li, Qian; Zhang, Xijing; Lin, Jiandong; Zhao, Shuangping; Li, Chen; Du, Bin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22957101/,428

Examination of 9,550 adult blood donor volunteers for serum IgG antibody positivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein showed an overall prevalence of 8.40%, measured as 7.56% in the first 58 days and 9.24% in the last 58 days, and 12.86% in December 2020, which we extrapolated to ~20% as of March, 2021. Males and females showed similar rates of past infection, and rates among Hispanic or Latinos, African Americans and Whites were also investigated. Donors under 30 years of age had the highest rates of past infection, while those over 60 had the lowest. Geographic analysis showed higher rates of infectivity on the West side of Cincinnati compared with the East side (split by I-75) and the lowest rates in the adjoining region of Kentucky (across the Ohio river).

An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020. Participants completed a modified validated questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and mental health-related lifestyle changes. A total of 263 participants (106 males and 157 females) completed the study. The mean age of the participants was 37.7 ± 14.0 years, and 74.9% had a high level of education. The mean IES score in the participants was 13.6 ± 7.7, reflecting a mild stressful impact. Only 7.6% of participants had an IES score ≥26. The majority of participants (53.3%) did not feel helpless due to the pandemic. On the other hand, 52.1% of participants felt horrified and apprehensive due to the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of participants (57.8–77.9%) received increased support from friends and family members, increased shared feeling and caring with family members and others.

Specifically, we investigated how the perceived privacy risks and benefits of information disclosure affect the public's willingness to opt in and adopt contact-tracing technologies and how social and contextual factors influence their decision-making process. Four hundred eighteen adults in the United States participated in the study via Amazon Mechanical Turk in August 2020. A percentile bootstrap method with 5,000 resamples and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals in structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. The participants' privacy concerns and perceived benefits significantly influenced their opt-in and adoption intentions, which suggests that the privacy calculus framework applies to the context of COVID-19 contact-tracing technologies. Perceived social, personal, and reciprocal benefits were identified as crucial mediators that link contextual variables to both opt-in and adoption intentions. Although this study was based on a hypothetical AI-based contact-tracing app, our findings provide meaningful theoretical and practical implications for future research investigating the public's technology adoption in contexts where tradeoffs between privacy risks and public health coexist.","Hong, Soo Jung; Cho, Hichang",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1981565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555998/,428

Pharmacologically, it is crucial to understand the diverse mechanism of mutations for stable vaccine or anti-viral drug design. Our current study concentrates on all the constituent proteins of 469 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples, derived from Indian patients. However, the study may easily be extended to the samples across the globe. We perform clustering analysis towards identifying unique variants in each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A total of 536 mutated positions within the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are detected among the identified variants from Indian isolates. We quantify mutations by focusing on the unique variants of each SARS-CoV-2 protein. We report the average number of mutation per variant, percentage of mutated positions, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, mutations occurring in three codon positions and so on. Our study reveals the most susceptible six (06) proteins, which are ORF1ab, Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), ORF3a, ORF7a, and ORF8. Several non-synonymous substitutions are observed to be unique in different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A total of 57 possible deleterious amino acid substitutions are predicted, which may impact on the protein functions. Several mutations show a large decrease in protein stability and are observed in putative functional domains of the proteins that might have some role in disease pathogenesis. We observe a good number of physicochemical property change during above deleterious substitutions.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Sengupta, Antara; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Roy, Swarup",Gene Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452014421000297?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623833/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452014421000297; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genrep.2021.101044,428

As witnessed by the psychiatric and medical literature in the last decades, in fact, the Holocaust survivors (HS) appear to suffer from several Shoah-related late-onset diseases impacting their survival, such as internal illnesses and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cancer represents a further severe pathology which seems to be connected with the Holocaust experience. Our aim was to review the existing knowledge of Holocaust-related cancer in HS in order to assess its real incidence and clinicoprognostic significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We systematically reviewed the literature dealing with Israeli Jewish and non-Jewish non-Israeli HS developing cancer. We also reviewed and analyzed the cancer data of noted Jewish HS not resident or having resided in Israel available as public information. RESULTS We found 16 and 15 studies on Israeli Jews and non-Jewish non-Israeli survivors, respectively. A statistically significant association between the Holocaust and development of late-onset cancer in HS was seen in most studies with cancer adversely impacting the survival. We also selected 330 noted Jewish non-Israeli HS: genocide-related late-onset cancer resulted to be a significant and independent risk factor of poor prognosis (p<0.0001) imparting shorter survival in affected versus non-cancer subjects (57 versus 64 years, respectively, p=0.0001). CONCLUSION Although 76 years have passed, our review shows how the Holocaust keeps on burdening its survivors. Moreover, we offered the first analysis of Jewish HS not resident or having resided in Israel in terms of genocide-related late-onset diseases focusing on cancer. Further studies on Jewish non-Israeli HS are needed in order to corroborate our findings on late-onset cancer occurring in this targeted population.","Virgilio, Edoardo; Camilli, Daniele; Gili, Giorgia; Montali, Filippo; Salvemini, Carlo; Annicchiarico, Alfredo; Pagliai, Lorenzo; Morini, Andrea; Romboli, Andrea; Costi, Renato",Anticancer research,https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.15056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083265/,428

This is probably the first time that global aviation contributed to the planet-wide spread of a pandemic, with casualties in over two hundred countries. As of August 23rd, 2020, the number of infected cases has topped 23 million, reportedly relating to more than 800,000 deaths worldwide. However, there is also a second side of the pandemic: it has led to an unmatched singularity in the global air transportation system. In what could be considered a highly uncoordinated, almost chaotic manner, countries have closed their borders, and people are reluctant/unable to travel due to country-specific lock-down measures. Accordingly, aviation is one of the industries that has been suffering most due to the consequences of the pandemic outbreak, despite probably being one of its largest initial drivers. In this study, we investigate the impact of COVID-19 on global air transportation at different scales, ranging from worldwide airport networks where airports are nodes and links between airports exist when direct flights exist, to international country networks where countries are contracted as nodes, and to domestic airport networks for representative countries/regions. We focus on the spatial-temporal evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19 in air transportation networks.

654541,Impact of Structured and Scheduled Family Meetings on Satisfaction in Patients Admitted to Hospitalist Service,2021-03-23,"The term cytokine storm syndromes describes conditions characterised by a life-threatening, fulminant hypercytokinaemia with high mortality. Cytokine storm syndromes can be genetic or a secondary complication of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders, infections, and haematological malignancies. These syndromes represent a key area of interface between rheumatology and general medicine. Rheumatologists often lead in management, in view of their experience using intensive immunosuppressive regimens and managing cytokine storm syndromes in the context of rheumatic disorders or infection (known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome [sHLH/MAS]). Interleukin (IL)-1 is pivotal in hyperinflammation. Anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is licenced at a dose of 100 mg once daily by subcutaneous injection for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. In cytokine storm syndromes, the subcutaneous route is often problematic, as absorption can be unreliable in patients with critical illness, and multiple injections are needed to achieve the high doses required. As a result, intravenous anakinra is used in clinical practice for sHLH/MAS, despite this being an off-licence indication and route of administration. Among 46 patients admitted to our three international, tertiary centres for sHLH/MAS and treated with anakinra over 12 months, the intravenous route of delivery was used in 18 (39%) patients. In this Viewpoint, we describe current challenges in the management of cytokine storm syndromes and review the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of intravenous anakinra. There is accumulating evidence to support the rationale for, and safety of, intravenous anakinra as a first-line treatment in patients with sHLH/MAS. Intravenous anakinra has important clinical relevance when high doses of drug are required or if patients have subcutaneous oedema, severe thrombocytopenia, or neurological involvement. Cross-speciality management and collaboration, with the generation of international, multi-centre registries and biobanks, are needed to better understand the aetiopathogenesis and improve the poor prognosis of cytokine storm syndromes.","Mehta, Puja; Cron, Randy Q; Hartwell, James; Manson, Jessica J; Tattersall, Rachel S",Lancet Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373790/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2665-9913(20)30096-5; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665991320300965; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2665991320300965,428

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies that reported fatalities in COVID-19 patients with cancer. A comprehensive meta-analysis that assessed the overall case fatality rate and associated risk factors was performed. Using individual patient data, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for each variable with outcomes. RESULTS: We included 15 studies with 3019 patients, of which 1628 were men; 41.0% were from the UK and Europe, followed by the USA and Canada (35.7%) and Asia (China, 23.3%). The overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with cancer measured 22.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17.3% to 28.0%). Univariate analysis revealed age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.57; 95% CI = 1.80 to 7.06), male (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.07 to 4.13), and comorbidity (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.04 to 3.85) were associated with increased risk of severe events (defined as the individuals being admitted to the intensive care unit, or requiring invasive ventilation, or death).

He was discharged with a satisfactory pulmonary function and a complete resolution of radiological and clinical findings. However, at discharge SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA could still be detected in the nasopharyngeal swab and in the stools. The second patient required mechanical ventilation, had a progressive deterioration of his clinical conditions and had a fatal outcome. Further insight into SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is eagerly awaited to improve the outcome transplant recipients affected by COVID‐19 pneumonia.","Cozzi, Emanuele; Faccioli, Eleonora; Marinello, Serena; Loy, Monica; Congedi, Sabrina; Calabrese, Fiorella; Romagnoli, Micaela; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Rea, Federico",Am J Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32400074/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15993,428

There is much the nurse practitioner (NP) can do to prevent and manage this illness. DATA SOURCES: Review of current literature, medical/nursing references, and data from the healthcare utilization project (HCUP). CONCLUSIONS: The use of health promotion, risk stratification, and current evidence‐based treatment guidelines can help to decrease hospitalization rates for CAP for adults. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: NPs are experts at health promotion and evidence‐based practice. Adhering to these practices and using risk stratification, NPs can help to further decrease hospitalization rates for CAP lowering healthcare costs related to this serious illness.","Severson, Cherese; Renstrom, Collette; Fitzhugh, Meg",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24170698/; https://doi.org/10.1002/2327-6924.12072,428
655424,Improving Patient Experience Scores in a Pediatric Emergency Department,2021-06-23,"BACKGROUND: Surgical and respirator masks are worn to reduce the risk of droplet and airborne transmission of viral respiratory disease. As a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic, mask wearing has been designated mandatory for healthcare professionals working in UK hospitals for the foreseeable future. It is thus timely to consider the long‐term implications of mask wearing on communication within healthcare settings, from both a patient and a clinician perspective. AIMS: The primary objective is to identify research evidence that corresponds to the mask‐wearing experiences of healthcare professionals working on the ground. By drawing together a summary of the literature illustrating the potential challenges associated with mask wearing, it is possible to make an application to various clinical cohorts and to formulate a set of preliminary, evidence‐based support strategies. The paper additionally explores the role for the Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) in supporting communication in the context of mask wearing. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Through a scoping review of the relevant literature, this paper reflects holistically on the prospective challenges associated with mask wearing across a variety of healthcare settings and patient populations. The subsequent conclusions have been used to inform the proposed clinical guidelines for safe and effective practice. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: There is a current research gap with regards to mask wearing in non‐medical and non‐clinical healthcare workers, and the impact this may have on both a professional and a personal basis. In the absence of preliminary data, the development of associated communication support strategies is hindered. This paper draws upon a variety of clinically conceivable issues faced by healthcare professionals, outlines important practical and ethical considerations, and proposes evidence‐based solutions to some of the challenges identified. Future research is required to gather evidence with regards to actual clinical experiences of mask wearing to substantiate hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Although undoubtedly essential in protecting the health of staff and patients, there are numerous logistical, physiological, psychological, social and economic complications associated with the wearing of masks. The ability of healthcare staff to successfully communicate with patients and with colleagues is jeopardized, which may adversely affect the efficiency, effectiveness, equitability and, most notably, safety of therapeutic intervention. The SLT has a distinct role in facilitating communication in order to safeguard the provision, accessibility and efficacy of services. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT: Existing research explores the impact of mask wearing on medical doctors, surgeons and dentists, and upon the corresponding patient cohorts. Little is known about how mask wearing may affect Allied Health Professionals and their ability to deliver therapeutic interventions safely and effectively. With mandatory face covering potentially a long‐term requirement for UK healthcare staff, it is both timely and relevant to consider the consequences of mask wearing on communication across acute and community settings. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: This paper identifies a range of prospective key issues associated with mask wearing across a variety of clinical and non‐clinical populations, with application specifically to vulnerable patient cohorts. Through evidence synthesis, this paper provides a summary of fundamental issues supported by relevant literature, and draws upon these in order to propose a preliminary set of evidence‐based clinical guidelines setting out potential solutions to the challenges faced. This review additionally assists in quantifying the role of the SLT within these extraordinary circumstances, with the aim of prompting unified practice, building upon professional guidance and increasing skill recognition. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK? In addition to their role in facilitating the development of individualised communication strategies for patients, SLTs should actively seek to provide widely accessible multidisciplinary education opportunities focusing on supporting communication; with specific reference to mask wearing and the associated communicative challenges. At a commissioning and managerial level, leaders within healthcare should acknowledge mask wearing as just one of the complexities associated with frontline working in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic, and aim to support their workforce by delivering resources and protocols which maximize and promote staff safety, efficiency, resilience and well‐being in concurrence with positive patient outcomes.","Marler, Hollyanna; Ditton, Annabel",Int J Lang Commun Disord,https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038046/,428

656425,Increased risk of COVID-19 in haemodialysis healthcare workers in a tertiary centre in the North West of England,2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically affected global health. Despite several studies, there is yet a dearth of data regarding the mechanisms of cardiac injury, clinical presentation, risk factors, and treatment of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular disease. This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at defining the clinical, electrocardiographic, and pathologic spectrum of cardiovascular disease (CVD), frequency of elevated cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, and their frequency and relationship with severity of the disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients and to develop a triage risk stratification tool (TRST) that can serve as a guide for the timely recognition of the high-risk patients and mechanism-targeted therapy. We conducted an online search in databases of PubMed and Embase to identify relevant studies. Data selection was in concordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results were presented as pooled frequencies, odds ratio, standardized mean difference (SMD), and forest and funnel plots. RESULTS: We gathered a total of 54 studies and included 35 of them in our meta-analysis. Acute cardiac injury occurred in more than 25% of cases, mortality was 20 times higher, and admission to intensive care unit increased by 13.5 times. Hypertension was the most common pre-existing comorbidity with a frequency of 29.2%, followed by diabetes mellitus (13.5%). The deceased group of patients had higher cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, with statistically significant SMD, compared with survivors. Pediatric patients were predominantly mildly affected. However, less frequently, the presentation was very similar to Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki shock syndrome. This latter presentation hass been called as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide spectrum of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients, and hence a Triage Risk Stratification Tool can serve as a guide for the timely recognition of the high-risk patients and mechanism-targeted therapy.","Momtazmanesh, Sara; Shobeiri, Parnian; Hanaei, Sara; Mahmoud-Elsayed, Hani; Dalvi, Bharat; Malakan Rad, Elaheh",Egypt Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661796/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-020-00075-z,428
656808,Vascular Surgery Triage During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-11-27,"Durant la crise du coronavirus, le quotidien des français a été bouleversé par ces huit semaines de confinement. Ce chamboulement a demandé une adaptation aussi bien au niveau de la vie professionnelle que de la vie personnelle pour l’ensemble de la population. Mais qu’en est-il au niveau de la vie sexuelle des français pendant cette période de confinement ? La sexualité a-t-elle été à son apogée pour les personnes confinées en couple ? Les pratiques auto-érotique ont-elles été accentuées pour les individus confinés sans partenaire sexuel ? Pour répondre à ces questions, nous avons réalisé une enquête prospective par l’intermédiaire de deux questionnaires anonymes auto-administrés – un pour les personnes confinées en couples et un autre pour les personnes confinées seules, sans partenaire sexuel – via internet. Puis nous avons analysé les 844 questionnaires – 437 pour les individus confinés en couple et 407 pour les individus confinés seuls – réalisés chez 554 femmes et 291 hommes. Les résultats de cette étude mettent en évidence des modifications des habitudes sexuelles aussi bien chez les individus étant en couple ou que chez les sujets sans partenaire durant cette période. Nous remarquons également un impact du vécu psychologique de la situation sur la sexualité. Que le confinement soit vécu positivement ou négativement par les sujets, les répercussions sur la sexualité sont différentes. Nous aurions pu croire, au début du confinement, que la sexualité des couples allait se décupler, que les personnes confinées seules augmenteraient leurs pratiques masturbatoires mais ce contexte sanitaire si particulier a également des répercussions non prévues sur la sexualité. During the coronavirus crisis, French people daily life was upset by eight weeks of lockdown. This upheaval required adaptation to both the professional and personal standards of the whole population. What about the level of sexual life during this period of lockdown? Was sexuality at his peak for people confined in couple? Have auto-erotic practices been accentuated for individuals confined without sexual partner? To investigate these issues, we conducted a prospective survey using two online anonymous self-administered questionnaires - one for people living in couples and one for people living alone, without sexual partner. 844 questionnaires were analyzed - 437 for individuals confined in couple and 407 for individuals confined alone - carried out in 554 women and 291 men. Results of this study highlight changes in sexual habits in both couples and those without partners during this period. We also note an impact of the psychological experience link to the situation on sexuality. Whether the confinement is experienced positively or negatively by the subjects, repercussions on sexuality are different. We could have believed, at the beginning of the lockdown, that couples’sexuality would increase tenfold, and that people confined alone would increase their masturbatory practices but this particular health context has unexpected repercussions on sexuality.","Landry, Sébastien; Chartogne, Martin; Landry, Alexandra",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1158136020300797; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136020300797?v=s5,428

Cardiovascular diseases are common in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe forms of infection, and these are associated with higher mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause cardiovascular disease and worsen preexisting disease by direct invasion, hypoxia associated with pneumonia, and immunologic mechanisms. Because prompt detection and proper treatment can be critical to COVID-19 patients, echocardiographic examinations are essential diagnostic tools in the diagnosis and determination of treatment options. However, because there is an increased risk of infection during echocardiographic examinations, healthcare providers should pay attention to mitigate the risk of infection during the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Choi, Jung Hyun; Park, Jae-Hyeong",J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511797/; https://doi.org/10.4250/jcvi.2020.0128,428
657163,COVID-19-Induced Left Sciatic Neuropathy Requiring Prolonged Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,2021-06-21,"Abstract The emergence of new pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for methods to rapidly identify and characterize potential therapeutic or prevention options, such as neutralizing antibodies. Spike (S) proteins are present on the surface of MERS-CoV virions and mediate viral entry. S is the primary target for MERS-CoV vaccine and antibody development, and it has become increasingly important to understand MERS-CoV antibody binding specificity and function. Commonly used serological methods like ELISA, biolayer interferometry, and flow cytometry are informative, but limited. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput protein binding inhibition assay using image cytometry. The image cytometry-based high-throughput screening method was developed by selecting a cell type with high DPP4 expression and defining optimal seeding density and protein binding conditions. The ability of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit MERS-CoV S binding was then tested. Binding inhibition results were comparable with those described in previous literature for MERS-CoV spike monomer and showed similar patterns as neutralization results. The coefficient of variation (CV) of our cell-based assay was <10%. The proposed image cytometry method provides an efficient approach for characterizing potential therapeutic antibodies for combating MERS-CoV that compares favorably with current methods. The ability to rapidly determine direct antibody binding to host cells in a high-throughput manner can be applied to study other pathogen-antibody interactions and thus can impact future research on viral pathogens.","Rosen, Osnat; Chan, Leo Li-Ying; Abiona, Olubukola M.; Gough, Portia; Wang, Lingshu; Shi, Wei; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Nianshuang; Kong, Wing-Pui; McLellan, Jason S.; Graham, Barney S.; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.",Journal of Virological Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418303185; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.11.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468747/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418303185,428

The aim of the study was to evaluate the spectrum of cardiopulmonary pathology of COVID-19 based on (non-minimal invasive) autopsies performed on 14 COVID-19 decedents. Bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was found in all patients. Superimposed acute bronchopneumonia was present in 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients and was considered the major cause of death in 2 patients. A key finding was the presence of thrombotic/thromboembolic vascular occlusions. We classified 5 types of pulmonary thrombi: 1. capillary microthrombi (11/14, 78.6%); 2. partially organized thrombi in mid-sized pulmonary arteries with complete vessel occlusion; 3. non-organized thrombi in mid-sized pulmonary arteries that did not completely fill out the vessel lumen and probably represented thromboemboli rather than thrombosis; 4. bone marrow emboli (1/14, 7.1%); and 5. septic pulmonary thromboemboli (1/14, 7.1%). Pulmonary thrombi in mid-sized arteries were noted in 5 of 14 (35.7%) patients, causing pulmonary infarction and/or pulmonary hemorrhage. All patients had evidence of chronic cardiac disease, including myocardial hypertrophy (13/14, 92.9%), mild to marked coronary artery atherosclerosis (14/14, 100%) and focal myocardial fibrosis (3/14, 21.4%). Acute myocardial infarction was found as concurrent cause of death in 3 (21.4%) patients, and significant cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight 750 g) was present in 1 (7.1%) patient with ATTR-positive cardiac amyloidosis. The autopsy findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, with major involvement of the lungs, that increases the risk of cardiac and vascular complications including acute myocardial injury and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. Secondary acute bronchopneumonia is a common complication in patients with COVID-19 and may be the major cause of death.","Grosse, Claudia; Grosse, Alexandra; Salzer, Helmut J.F.; Dünser, Martin W.; Motz, Reinhard; Langer, Rupert",Cardiovasc Pathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054880720300673?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784110/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107263; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054880720300673,428

However, this assumption has not been generally subject to rigorous econometric approach in the existing literature. To fill this gap, we assess the impact of the accreditation World Heritage status on the “Historic Centre of Macau” in 2005 on visitor numbers to the territory to identify the real effect of WHL on fostering tourism. In doing so, because of the policy restrictions on the mainland Chinese tourists, such tourists have been excluded from the analysis. The empirical results indicate that there is no significant effect of WHL on promoting tourism other than possibly a short-run tourism-enhancing impact.

It is important for any vital information to be written unambiguously, and at a level that can be understood by all people regardless of education levels. The purpose of this study was to assess the readability of 50 sources of COVID19 testing information online. Only 6 websites out of 50 received an appropriate readability score on more than one assessment. One-sample, one-tailed t-tests (α = 0.05, df = 49) were used to see if the websites with information on COVID-19 testing are being written at appropriate reading levels. The resulting p-values indicate that each p-value recorded is substantially below 0.05, it is very unlikely that websites on this topic are being written at the recommended levels. Even the optimal messages on COVID-19 reflect a confusing and rapidly changing public health crisis, however if messages are kept simple and clear, individuals will have the best possible chance of optimizing behavioral mitigation strategies. These are compelling reasons for informational hosts to take necessary steps to ensure that messages are written in as simple terms as possible. To this end, it is suggested that internet sites dispersing COVID-19 testing information build in text analysis methods for all published messages, particularly those meant to inform best health practices in the time of a pandemic.","Garcia, Philip; Fera, Joseph; Mohlman, Jan; Basch, Corey H.",J Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-00973-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33638806/,428

Material and Methods. A retrospective data of COVID-19 in KTRs was collected and analyzed. The mortality rate, risk factors, and antibody response were primary objectives, while the clinical presentation, laboratory indicators, and pharmacological management were secondary objectives. RESULTS: The 67 KTRs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between 1 May 2020 and 31 December 2020; 61.2% of patients were hospitalized; and 20.9% needed ventilation. The overall mortality was 26.9%, while blood group A had 50% mortality. The treatment options and used were steroids (100%), convalescent plasma (32.8%), ivermectin (58.2%), doxycycline (55.2%), remdesivir (34.3%), tocilizumab (10.4%), antibiotics (61.2%), anti-fungals (26.9%), low molecular weight heparin (45.3%), and oral anti-coagulants (26.9%). Anti-nucleosides (mycophenolate or azathioprine) were discontinued in 76.1% and calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 26.9%. Significant mortality (p < 0.001) was observed in patients presenting with SpO(2) <94 needing ICU care, ventilation, dialysis/acute kidney injury (AKI), and empirical therapies like convalescent plasma and remdesivir. The age of survivors versus nonsurvivors was not significantly different (p=0.02).

A single center prospective experience during the pandemic,2021-06-22,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was discovered in 2019 and spread around the world in a short time. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to clinical testing of COVID-19. Aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of four NAAT assays. METHODS: Limit of detection (LOD), precision, accuracy, analytical specificity and analytical interference studies on four NAATs (Daan, Sansure, Hybribio, and Bioperfectus) were performed according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute protocols and guidelines. The four NAATs were compared using 46 clinical samples. RESULTS: The LOD of the N gene for Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio was 500 copies/mL, and that for Bioperfectus was 1,000 copies/mL. The LOD of the ORF1ab gene for Daan, Bioperfectus, and Hybribio was 3,000 copies/mL, and that for Sansure was 2,000 copies/mL. A good precision was shown at the concentration above 20% of the LOD for all four NAATs, with all individual coefficients of variation below 3.6%. Satisfactory results were also observed in the accuracy, analytical specificity, and analytical interference tests. The results of the comparison test showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 100% (16/16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 81.25% (13/16). However, no significant difference in sensitivity was found between Bioperfectus NAAT and the three other NAATs (p > 0.05).

The objective of this overview of systematic reviews is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current evidence on prognosis of COVID‐19 in pregnant women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used Living OVerview of Evidence (L·OVE) platform for COVID‐19, which continually retrieves studies from 46 data sources (including Pubmed/MEDLINE, Embase, other electronic databases, clinical trials registries, preprint repositories, among other sources relevant to COVID‐19), mapping them into PICO questions. The search covered the period from the inception date of each database to September 13, 2020. We included systematic reviews assessing outcomes of pregnant women with COVID‐19 and/or their newborns. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, assessed full‐texts to select the studies that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias of each included systematic review. We measured the overlap of primary studies included among the selected systematic reviews by building a matrix of evidence, calculating the corrected covered area, and assessing the level of overlapping for every pair of systematic reviews. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1132 references. 52 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria and were included in this overview. Only one review had a low risk of bias, three had an unclear risk of bias, and 48 had a high risk of bias. Most of the included reviews were highly overlapped among each other. In the included reviews, rates of maternal death varied from 0% to 11.1%, admission to intensive care from 2.1% to 28.5%, preterm deliveries before 37 weeks from 14.3% to 61.2%, and cesarean delivery from 48.3% to 100%. Regarding neonatal outcomes, neonatal death varied from 0% to 11.7% while the estimated infection status of the newborn varied between 0% and 11.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Only one of 52 systematic reviews had a low risk of bias. Results were heterogenous and the overlap of primary studies was frequently very high between pairs of systematic reviews. High quality evidence syntheses of comparative studies are needed to guide future clinical decisions.","Vergara‐Merino, Laura; Meza, Nicolás; Couve‐Pérez, Constanza; Carrasco, Cynthia; Ortiz‐Muñoz, Luis; Madrid, Eva; Bohorquez‐Blanco, Sandra; Pérez‐Bracchiglione, Javier",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560530/; https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14118,428
660815,Clinical Features and Outcome of Low and High Corticosteroids in Admitted COVID-19 Patients,2021-09-11,"This paper studies the vulnerability of the worldwide air transportation network (WATN) during a global catastrophe such as COVID-19. Considering the WATN as a weighted network, many airport connections could be completely or partially disrupted during such extreme events. However, it is found that existing weighted metrics cannot reflect the impact of connection capacity reduction on network connectivity. Therein, this work proposes a novel network efficiency metric termed as layered weighted network efficiency (LWNE) metric to measure the connectivity of the air transportation networks (ATNs) and study their vulnerability in response to different levels of disruptions, including airport level, country level, and global level. The most critical airport connections and their impact on network connectivity are identified. It is found that the critical connections are mostly between so-called bridge airports but not core airports in the WATN. By examining the impact of partial link disruptions, it is found that some connections mainly serve local travel demand and are very robust to partial disruptions, while the others connecting global hubs are sensitive to partial disruptions. Further, the WATN is robust to the individual disconnection of most countries; however, it is vulnerable to the simultaneous disconnection of countries that serve international transfers. Interestingly, the WATN is insensitive to the disconnection between any two countries, even those with sizeable domestic ATNs. Concerning global disconnections, as long as all the international connections hold 10% of their original flights, the WATN can still expect 40% of its pre-disruption performance. This paper deepens the understanding of ATNs under extreme events and provides a method for studying transportation networks’ vulnerability facing global disruptions.","Zhou, Yaoming; Kundu, Tanmoy; Qin, Wei; Goh, Mark; Sheu, Jiuh-Biing",Transp Res E Logist Transp Rev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1366554521002325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493925/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554521002325; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2021.102469,428

Without the need for commuting and with the flexibility of homeworking, weekday time spent outdoors was higher in the 2020 lockdown than in the same period in 2017. The weekday erythema effective radiant exposure was higher in 2020 due to an additional 45 min outdoors in the late afternoon that was not observed in 2017 and high UV levels due to extremely sunny weather in spring. The lockdown did not impact the frequency of time spent outdoors around midday, which was still governed by work commitments, and at the weekends, no difference between 2020 and 2017 was observed.

Studies are warranted that examine socio-ecological factors associated with these outcomes to inform interventions that support healthcare workers during future disease outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study of healthcare workers during May 2020 to assess the socio-ecological predictors of mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed factors at four socio-ecological levels: individual (e.g., gender), interpersonal (e.g., social support), institutional (e.g., personal protective equipment availability), and community (e.g., healthcare worker stigma). The Personal Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise scales assessed probable major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess unadjusted and adjusted associations between socio-ecological factors and mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,092 participants, 72.0% were female, 51.9% were frontline workers, and the mean age was 40.4 years (standard deviation = 11.5). Based on cut-off scores, 13.9%, 15.6%, 22.8%, and 42.8% had probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD, respectively. In the multivariable adjusted models, needing more social support was associated with significantly higher odds of probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD. The significance of other factors varied across the outcomes. For example, at the individual level, female gender was associated with probable PTSD. At the institutional level, lower team cohesion was associated with probable PTSD, and difficulty following hospital policies with probable MD. At the community level, higher healthcare worker stigma was associated with probable PTSD and AUD, decreased satisfaction with the national government response with probable GAD, and higher media exposure with probable GAD and PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can inform targeted interventions that promote healthcare workers’ psychological resilience during disease outbreaks.","Hennein, Rachel; Mew, Emma J.; Lowe, Sarah R.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544761/,428

Individuals paid a heavy cost in terms of disruption in their attachment to the labor force. Children could not go to school and parents were forced to provide extra childcare and spend significant amounts of time helping children continue to learn, while possibly working from home. Domestic violence became more common. These changes have often been traumatic, to the detriment of the well-being and mental health of large numbers of people.

665121,Worrying decrease in hospital admissions for myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-25,"Background Since the first case of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Pakistan was reported in February 2020, the medical and paramedical staff has been working on the frontlines to deal with this disease. They have been facing significant strain and stress due to the pandemic, affecting their social, mental, and personal life. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, etiology, personal coping mechanisms, and the strategies that are being adopted to reduce stress by the healthcare workers (HCWs) working in COVID-19 dedicated wards (group 2) and compare it with staff working in other departments but not in COVID-19 wards amid this pandemic (group 1) in various hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. Methods The comparative cross-sectional study was designed which included doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals from various hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A questionnaire was designed which consisted of five sections, and 51 questions. A Chi-square test was used to compare the responses between these two groups. Results The study questionnaire was submitted by 200 participants, 100 responses for each group (see the Appendix). In group 1, HCWs not working in COVID-19 dedicated floors were afraid of getting infected, transmitting the infection to their families and concerned about using personal protective equipment (PPE) improperly. They reported a lack of concentration and tense muscles. The coping mechanisms of this group were exercise, strict precautions at work, and social distancing measures. While HCWs serving in COVID-19 dedicated wards were concerned and afraid of putting their families at risk by working in the high-risk environment; the major stresses in this group were: lack of knowledge about proper strategies for treatment, they faced insecurity due to physical and verbal violence by caretakers of COVID-19 patients, and lack of concentration. The coping mechanism was the support of their families and taking strict precautions, with self-isolation if required, to avoid any disease transmission to their families. The proposed strategies to be implemented included teaching skills for self-rescue as well as the implementation of policies at the administrative level to reduce working hours and frequent shift rotation. Conclusion The COVID-19 outbreak posed a great deal of mental stress among HCWs working on the COVID-19 floor as well as those serving in other departments of the hospital. The HCWs from group 1 were most afraid of getting infected and putting family members at risk, experienced tense muscles and lack of concentration, coped their stress by exercise and being more vigilant, and suggested the strategies of teaching skills for self-rescue and better community awareness. While the staff from the second group were most afraid of being the source of infection and violence from the caretakers of patients, experienced tense muscles, used family support, and strict isolation measures as coping mechanisms and suggested the strategies of self-rescue and increase in wages of directly exposed healthcare workers to deal with such pandemics in future in a better way.","Shahid, Hafsa; Haider, Mobeen Z; Taqi, Muhammad; Gulzar, Adnan; Zamani, Zarlakhta; Fatima, Tehreem; Khalid, Yousra; Ahmed, Zahoor; Nadeem, Hafiza A; Anwer, Faiz",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403183/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11753,428

To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon β and tumor necrosis factor-α compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis. This compendium of transcriptome data provides a molecular foundation for understanding the cell identities, functions and cellular receptor characteristics for viral reservoirs and zoonotic transmission.","Ren, Lili; Wu, Chao; Guo, Li; Yao, Jiacheng; Wang, Conghui; Xiao, Yan; Pisco, Angela Oliveira; Wu, Zhiqiang; Lei, Xiaobo; Liu, Yiwei; Shi, Leisheng; Han, Lianlian; Zhang, Hu; Xiao, Xia; Zhong, Jingchuan; Wu, Hongping; Li, Mingkun; Quake, Stephen R.; Huang, Yanyi; Wang, Jianbin; Wang, Jianwei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.175778,428

Methods Trainees of the Taiwan Association of Nurse Anesthetists from northern Taiwan and junior residents from our department were enrolled into the training program. A 4-hour renewal curriculum in the management of airway emergen-cies was developed, which consisted of a 2-hour general lecture (including 4 divided sections) and a 2-hour instructor-based real-time multimedia medical simulation of 4 specific techniques. After detailed explanation of each specific instrument at the beginning of each simulation, the instructors demonstrated accurate and successful management of 4 airway crises from clinical experience by using a standardized human patient simulator situated on the stage of the conference room. Meanwhile, real-time display of instructors’ performance, responsive physical parameters and images from specific instruments were conducted by video camera and video processor, and projected on a 3-frame screen. Brief summary and feedback were performed after each simulation. Trainees completed a questionnaire 6 months after they participated in the training program. Results Two hundred and forty-two nurse anesthetists and 13 young residents were trained with this protocol. The questionnaire revealed that the renewal training program was useful. Participants updated their knowledge of difficult airway management, gained more confidence, improved performance, and provided effective assistance in handling airway crises. Conclusion Renewing practice guidelines and teaching airway management skills, especially for difficult airway crises and protection of personnel, continues to be an important issue. Instructor-based real-time multimedia simulation is a fast, useful and systematic renewal educational method for many participants with extensive experience of airway management to update their knowledge about difficult airway management, and acquire improved decision-making and communication capabilities, skills of specific airway management.

This study aims to assay the inhibitory potentials of Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD, a Chinese medicine compound formula recommended for combating COVID-19 in China) against human drug-metabolizing enzymes and to assess the pharmacokinetic interactions in vivo. The results demonstrated that QPD dose-dependently inhibited CYPs1A, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 but inhibited CYP3A in a time- and NADPH-dependent manner. In vivo test showed that QPD prolonged the half-life of lopinavir (a CYP3A substrate-drug) by 1.40-fold and increased the AUC of lopinavir by 2.04-fold, when QPD (6 g/kg) was co-administrated with lopinavir (160 mg/kg) to rats. Further investigation revealed that Fructus Aurantii Immaturus (Zhishi) in QPD caused significant loss of CYP3A activity in NADPH-generating system. Collectively, our findings revealed that QPD potently inactivated CYP3A and significantly modulated the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A substrate-drugs, which would be very helpful for the patients and clinicians to avoid potential drug-interaction risks in COVID-19 treatment.","Zhang, Feng; Huang, Jian; Liu, Wei; Wang, Chao-Ran; Liu, Yan-Fang; Tu, Dong-Zhu; Liang, Xin-Miao; Yang, Ling; Zhang, Wei-Dong; Chen, Hong-Zhuan; Ge, Guang-Bo",Food Chem Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.111998; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691521000326; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691521000326?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476691/,428

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. METHODS：We established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients. CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","Dong, Lianhua; Zhou, Junbo; Niu, Chunyan; Wang, Quanyi; Pan, Yang; Sheng, Sitong; Wang, Xia; Zhang, Yongzhuo; Yang, Jiayi; Liu, Manqing; Zhao, Yang; Zhang, Xiaoying; Zhu, Tao; Peng, Tao; Xie, Jie; Gao, Yunhua; Wang, Di; Zhao, Yun; Dai, Xinhua; Fang, Xiang",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129,428
669206,Recovery from COVID-19 among older adults in post-acute skilled nursing facilities Post-acute COVID-19 functional recovery,2021-04-12,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression interferes with maternal engagement in interventions that are effective in improving infant social-emotional and social-communication outcomes. There is an absence of integrated interventions with demonstrated effectiveness in both reducing maternal depression and promoting parent-mediated practices that optimize infant social-emotional and social-communication competencies. Interventions targeting maternal depression are often separate from parent-mediated interventions. To address the life course needs of depressed mothers and their infants, we need brief, accessible, and integrated interventions that target both maternal depression and specific parent practices shown to improve infant social-emotional and social-communication trajectories. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile internet intervention, Mom and Baby Net, with remote coaching to improve maternal mood and promote parent practices that optimize infant social-emotional and social-communication development. METHODS: This is a two-arm, randomized controlled intent-to-treat trial. Primary outcomes include maternal depression symptoms and observed parent and infant behaviors. Outcomes are measured via direct observational assessments and standardized questionnaires. The sample is being recruited from the urban core of a large southern city in the United States. Study enrollment was initiated in 2017 and concluded in 2020. Participants are biological mothers with elevated depression symptoms, aged 18 years or older, and who have custody of an infant less than 12 months of age. Exclusion criteria at the time of screening include maternal homelessness or shelter residence, inpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment, or maternal or infant treatment of a major mental or physical illness that would hinder meaningful study participation. RESULTS: The start date of this grant-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was September 1, 2016. Data collection is ongoing. Following the institutional review board (IRB)–approved pilot work, the RCT was approved by the IRB on November 17, 2017. Recruitment was initiated immediately following IRB approval. Between February 15, 2018, and March 11, 2021, we successfully recruited a sample of 184 women and their infants into the RCT. The sample is predominantly African American and socioeconomically disadvantaged. CONCLUSIONS: Data collection is scheduled to be concluded in March 2022. We anticipate that relative to the attention control condition, which is focused on education around maternal depression and infant developmental milestones with matching technology and coaching structure, mothers in the Mom and Baby Net intervention will experience greater reductions in depression and gains in sensitive and responsive parent practices and that their infants will demonstrate greater gains in social-emotional and social-communication behavior.

Mucormycosis is a rare and opportunistic fungal infection that mainly affects diabetic and immunocompromised patients. An increase has been observed in the number of rhino‐orbital mucormycosis in patients with COVID‐19 admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital, Kermanshah, Iran, since October 2020. This is a report of the frequency, risk factors, clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis of COVID‐19 associated with mucormycosis infection. METHODS: The medical records of COVID‐19 patients with rhino‐orbital mucormycosis who were diagnosed in an educational therapeutic hospital in Kermanshah, west of Iran were surveyed. Several parameters were analysed including demographic, clinical, therapeutic and laboratory characteristics. RESULTS: Twelve patients with COVID‐19–associated rhino‐orbital mucormycosis were identified from 12 October to 18 November 2020. All cases reported as proven mucormycosis had a history of hospitalisation due to COVID‐19. Comorbidities mainly included diabetes mellitus (83.33%) and hypertension (58.33%). Seventy‐five per cent of patients received corticosteroids for COVID‐ 19 treatment. The sites of involvement were rhino‐sino‐orbital (83%) and rhino‐sino (17%). Amphotericin B/liposomal amphotericin B alone or in combination with surgical debridement or orbital exenteration was used as the first‐line therapy. The overall mortality rate was 66.7% (8/12). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high incidence of mucormycosis among COVID‐19 patients. Diabetes mellitus and corticosteroid use were the dominant predisposing factor of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a life‐threatening and opportunistic infection; therefore, physicians should know the signs and symptoms of the disease so that a timely diagnosis and therapy can be performed.","Avatef Fazeli, Manouchehr; Rezaei, Leila; Javadirad, Etrat; Iranfar, Khosro; Khosravi, Abbas; Amini Saman, Javad; Poursabbagh, Pardis; Ghadami, Mohammad Rasoul; Parandin, Mohammad Mehdi; Dehghani, Amrollah; Ahmadi Jouybari, Touraj; Mahdavian, Behzad; Eivazi, Nastaran; rezaei, Sohbat; Rezaei, Alireza; Emami, Bashir; Haqgou, Mohadeseh; Bozorgomid, Arezoo; Sayad, Babak",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252988/,428

The residential smoking cessation program (2017–2018) recruited smokers with a smoking duration ≥ 20 years and who have attempted to quit smoking more than twice and/or smokers with chronic morbidities. Participants underwent an intensive intervention, including individual psychological therapy, group therapy, medical counseling, and pharmacotherapy. The 6-month continuous abstinence rate (CAR) was assessed via self-reports, the urine cotinine levels, and/or expired-air carbon monoxide levels. Logistic regression was used to analyze the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to assess factors related to smoking cessation. Overall, 484 participants who completed the residential program and questionnaire were evaluated. The 3- and 6-month CAR were 81.82% and 63.22%, respectively. The aOR of 6-month continuous abstinence was lower among participants with severe nicotine dependence (aOR: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26–0.81) and higher among participants with combination therapy of varenicline with short-term nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (aOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.07–2.51), with higher self-efficacy (aOR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.15–3.37).

Scotland introduced a new GP contract in April 2018, intended to better support GPs. This study compares the career intentions and working lives of GPs in Scotland with GPs in England, shortly after the new Scotland contract was introduced. DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of cross-sectional analysis of survey responses of GPs in England and Scotland in 2017 and 2018, respectively, using linear regression to adjust the differences for gender, age, ethnicity, urbanicity and deprivation. PARTICIPANTS: 2048 GPs in Scotland and 879 GPs in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four intentions to reduce work participation (5-point scales: 1=‘none’, 5=‘high’): reducing working hours; leaving medical work entirely; leaving direct patient care; or continuing medical work but outside the UK. Four domains of working life: job satisfaction (7-point scale: 1=‘extremely dissatisfied’, 7=‘extremely satisfied’); job stressors (5-point-scale: 1=‘no pressure’, 5=‘high pressure); positive and negative job attributes (5-point scales: 1=‘strongly disagree’, 5=‘strongly agree’). RESULTS: Compared with England, GPs in Scotland had lower intention to reduce work participation, including a lower likelihood of reducing work hours (2.78 vs 3.54; adjusted difference=−0.52; 95% CI −0.64 to −0.41), a lower likelihood of leaving medical work entirely (2.11 vs 2.76; adjusted difference=−0.32; 95% CI −0.42 to −0.22), a lower likelihood of leaving direct patient care (2.23 vs 2.93; adjusted difference=−0.37; 95% CI −0.47 to −0.27), and a lower likelihood of continuing medical work but outside of the UK (1.41 vs 1.61; adjusted difference=−0.2; 95% CI −0.28 to −0.12). GPs in Scotland reported higher job satisfaction, lower job stressors, similar positive job attributes and lower negative job attributes. CONCLUSION: Following the introduction of the new contract in Scotland, GPs in Scotland reported significantly better working lives and lower intention to reduce work participation than England.","Hayes, Helen; Gibson, Jonathan; Fitzpatrick, Bridie; Checkland, Kath; Guthrie, Bruce; Sutton, Matt; Gillies, John; Mercer, Stewart W",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33127639/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042236,428
676141,Changing mortality trends in countries and cities of the UK: a population-based trend analysis,2020-11-05,"SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple amino acid mutations in the spike protein are emerging in different parts of the world, raising concerns regarding their possible impact on human immune response and vaccine efficacy against the virus. Recently, a variant named lineage B.1.1.7 was detected and shown to be rapidly spreading across the UK since November 2020. As surveillance for these SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) becomes critical, we have investigated the use of environmental surveillance (ES) for the rapid detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 viruses in sewage as a way of monitoring its expansion that is independent on the investigation of identified clinical cases. Next-generation sequencing analysis of amplicons synthesized from sewage concentrates revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences, first identified in a sample collected in London on 10 November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs becoming prevalent in the population and that, as well as B.1.1.7, our method can detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1, first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and other viruses carrying critical spike mutation E484K, known to have an effect on virus antigenicity. Although we did not detect such mutation in viral RNAs from sewage, we did detect mutations at amino acids 478, 490, and 494, located close to amino acid 484 in the spike protein structure and known to also have an effect on antigenicity. IMPORTANCE The recent appearance and growth of new SARS-CoV-2 variants represent a major challenge for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants of concern contain mutations affecting antigenicity, which raises concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. Here, we show how environmental surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can be used to help us understand virus transmission patterns and provide an early warning of variants becoming prevalent in the population. We describe the detection and quantification of variant B.1.1.7, first identified in southeast England in sewage samples from London (UK) before widespread transmission of this variant was obvious from clinical cases. Variant B.1.1.7 was first detected in a sample from early November 2020, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 mutations detected in sewage rapidly increasing to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with increasing SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with B.1.1.7 viruses.","Wilton, Thomas; Bujaki, Erika; Klapsa, Dimitra; Majumdar, Manasi; Zambon, Maria; Fritzsche, Martin; Mate, Ryan; Martin, Javier",mSystems,https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00353-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128696/,428

A number of open and crowdsourcing initiatives have sought to address this shortfall by producing equipment such as protective face shields using additive manufacturing techniques such as fused filament fabrication (FFF). This paper reports the process of designing and manufacturing protective face shields using large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM) to produce the major thermoplastic components of the face shield. LSAM offers significant advantages over other additive manufacturing technologies in bridge manufacturing scenarios as a true transition between prototypes and mass production techniques such as injection molding. In the context of production of COVID-19 face shields, the ability to produce the optimized components in under 5 min compared to what would typically take 1 – 2 h using another additive manufacturing technologies meant that significant production volume could be achieved rapidly with minimal staffing.","Bishop, Elizabeth G.; Leigh, Simon J.",Int J Bioprint,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33088995/; https://doi.org/10.18063/ijb.v6i4.281,428
676460,Hiccups and psychosis: two atypical presentations of COVID-19,2021-01-20,"Among the biomedical efforts in response to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, pharmacological strategies to reduce viral load in patients with severe forms of the disease are being studied intensively. One of the main drug target proteins proposed so far is the SARS-CoV-2 viral protease 3CLpro (also called Mpro), an essential component for viral replication. Ongoing ligand- and receptor-based computational screening efforts would be facilitated by an improved understanding of the electrostatic, hydrophobic and steric features that characterize small molecule inhibitors binding stably to 3CLpro, as well as by an extended collection of known binders. Here, we present combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, machine learning and in vitro experimental validation analyses which have led to the identification of small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro with micromolar activity, and to a pharmacophore model that describes functional chemical groups associated with the molecular recognition of ligands by the 3CLpro binding pocket. Experimentally validated inhibitors using a ligand activity assay include natural compounds with available prior knowledge on safety and bioavailability properties, such as the natural compound rottlerin (IC50 = 37 µM), and synthetic compounds previously not characterized (e.g. compound CID 46897844, IC50 = 31 µM). In combination with the developed pharmacophore model, these and other confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors may provide a basis for further similarity-based screening in independent compound databases and structural design optimization efforts, to identify 3CLpro ligands with improved potency and selectivity. Overall, this study suggests that the integration of virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning can facilitate 3CLpro-targeted small molecule screening investigations. Different receptor-, ligand- and machine learning-based screening strategies provided complementary information, helping to increase the number and diversity of identified active compounds. Finally, the resulting pharmacophore model and experimentally validated small molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro provide resources to support follow-up computational screening efforts for this drug target.","Glaab, Enrico; Manoharan, Ganesh Babu; Abankwa, Daniel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.02.433618,428

The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October, 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P1, P2 and B.1.1.33) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.","Ferrareze, Patrícia Aline Gröhs; Franceschi, Vinícius Bonetti; de Menezes Mayer, Amanda; Caldana, Gabriel Dickin; Zimerman, Ricardo Ariel; Thompson, Claudia Elizabeth",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.426895,428

This study aimed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum at admission correlated with clinical outcome in COVID-19. METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases department of a tertiary level Swedish hospital, and sampled for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum at admission, April 10 to June 30 2020 were included in a cohort. Primary outcomes were day 28 all-cause mortality and progress to critical disease. RESULTS: The cohort (N=167) consisted of 106 SARS-CoV-2 RNA serum negative and 61 positive patients. Median sampling time for initial SARS-CoV-2 in serum was 1 (IQR 1-2) day after admission corresponding to day 10 (IQR 8-12) after symptom onset. Median ages were 53 (IQR 44-67) and 63 (IQR 52-74) years for the PCR-negative and positive patients, respectively. In the serum PCR negative and positive groups 3/106 and 15/61 patients died, respectively. The hazard ratios for critical disease and all-cause mortality were 7.2 (95% CI 3.0-17) and 8.6 (95% CI 2.4-30), respectively for patients that were serum PCR positive compared to serum PCR negative.

Testing for a broad panel of respiratory viruses has been advocated as a useful tool for antibiotic stewardship. We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the impact of rapid viral test results on antimicrobial prescriptions and clinical outcomes among hospitalized adults. METHODS: Eight hundred patients admitted with respiratory symptoms were tested by a 12-virus respiratory panel (RVP) during 3 consecutive winters in Montreal, Canada. The primary outcome measure was change in antimicrobial prescriptions (ie, de-escalation of empirical antimicrobial therapy or commencement of new antimicrobial therapy) after RVP results were available. Clinical outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: Influenza virus was identified in 53% of individuals in the study population, and other viruses were identified in 10%. Influenza virus positivity was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization and appropriate antiviral management. Antibiotic management was most significantly correlated with radiographic suspicion of pneumonia and less so with results of the RVP. Positivity for viruses other than influenza virus was not correlated with significantly different outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians respond to results of testing for influenza virus when managing hospitalized adult patients but respond less to test results for other viruses.

However, the folding and modification requirements of complex proteins place a severe constraint on the type of protein that can be successfully displayed using this strategy, a restriction that could be resolved by similarly engineering a eukaryotic virus for display purposes. The quite recently established eukaryotic molecular biology tool, the baculovirus display vector system (BDVS), allows combination of genotype with phenotype and thereby enables presentation of eukaryotic proteins on the viral envelope or capsid. Data have shown that the baculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), is a versatile tool for eukaryotic virus display. Insertion of heterologous peptides and/or proteins into the viral surface by utilizing the major envelope glycoprotein gp64, or foreign membrane‐derived counterparts, allows incorporation of the sequence of interest onto the surface of infected cells and virus particles. A number of strategies are being investigated in order to further develop the display capabilities of AcMNPV and improve the complexity of a library that may be accommodated. Numerous expression vectors for various approaches of surface display have already been developed. Further improvement of both insertion and selection strategies toward development of a refined tool for use in the creation of useful eukaryotic libraries is, however, needed.

The cell culture-derived subunit influenza vaccine (OPTAFLU(®), Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics) is produced using Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to propagate seasonal viral strains, as an alternative to embryonated chicken-eggs. As only a limited range of mammalian viruses can grow in MDCK cells, similar to embryonated eggs, MDCK cells can act as an effective filter for a wide range of adventitious agents that might be introduced during vaccine production. However, the introduction of an alternative cell substrate (for example, MDCK cells) into a vaccine manufacturing process requires thorough investigations to assess the potential for adventitious agent risk in the final product, in the unlikely event that contamination should occur. The risk assessment takes into account the entire manufacturing process, from initial influenza virus isolation, through to blending of the trivalent subunit vaccine and worst-case residual titres for the final vaccine formulation have been calculated for >20 viruses or virus families. Maximum residual titres for all viruses tested were in the range of 10(−6) to 10(−16) infectious units per vaccine dose. Thus, the new cell culture-based vaccine manufacturing process can reduce any adventitious agent to a level that is unable to cause infection.","Gregersen, Jens-Peter",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18485545/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08004118; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08004118; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.03.075,428

In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes relational learning based on a heterogeneous graph model (HGM) for predicting mortality at different time windows in COVID-19 patients within the intensive care unit (ICU). We utilize the EHRs of one of the largest and most diverse patient populations across five hospitals in major health system in New York City. In our model, we use an LSTM for processing time varying patient data and apply our proposed relational learning strategy in the final output layer along with other static features. Here, we replace the traditional softmax layer with a Skip-Gram relational learning strategy to compare the similarity between a patient and outcome embedding representation. We demonstrate that the construction of a HGM can robustly learn the patterns classifying patient representations of outcomes through leveraging patterns within the embeddings of similar patients. Our experimental results show that our relational learning-based HGM model achieves higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) than both comparator models in all prediction time windows, with dramatic improvements to recall.","Wanyan, Tingyi; Vaid, Akhil; De Freitas, Jessica K; Somani, Sulaiman; Miotto, Riccardo; Nadkarni, Girish N.; Azad, Ariful; Ding, Ying; Glicksberg, Benjamin S.",IEEE Trans Big Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768136/; https://doi.org/10.1109/tbdata.2020.3048644,428

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized trials. PATIENTS: Databases of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL were systematically searched from its inception until March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: COVID-19 patients being positioned in the prone position either whilst awake or mechanically ventilated. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were oxygenation parameters (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio, PaCO₂, SpO₂). Secondary outcomes included the rate of intubation and mortality rate. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (n = 1712 patients) were included in this review. In comparison to the supine group, prone position significantly improved the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio (study = 13, patients = 1002, Mean difference, MD 52.15, 95% CI 37.08 to 67.22; p < 0.00001) and SpO₂ (study = 11, patients = 998, MD 4.17, 95% CI 2.53 to 5.81; p ≤0.00001). Patients received prone position were associated with lower incidence of mortality (study = 5, patients = 688, Odd ratio, OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80; p = 0.007). No significant difference was noted in the incidence of intubation rate (study = 5, patients = 626, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.86; p = 0.42) between the supine and prone groups. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that prone position improved PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio with better SpO₂ than supine position in COVID-19 patients. Given the limited number of studies with small sample size and substantial heterogeneity of measured outcomes, further studies are warranted to standardize the regime of prone position to improve the certainty of evidence.

This study aimed at describing the psychological intervention to address the psychological difficulties and issues encountered by the hospitalized post-acute COVID-19 patients in a rehabilitation setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients’ demographics, medical diagnosis, and neuro-psychological information were collected from March 2(nd) to May 12(th), 2020. The main psychological issues and intervention strategies were collected. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients were hospitalized during this period. Among them, the 47.5% underwent psychological assessment (N=86; age: 74.58±13.39; 54.7% females). The most common psychological issues were acute stress disorders (18.6%), anxious and demoralization symptoms (26.7%), depression (10.5%%), and troublesome grief (8.1%). Once recovered from COVID-19, many patients were discharged home (38.4%), some received further rehabilitation in non-COVID-19 wards (41.9%), mostly due to pre-existent diseases (72.2%) rather than to COVID-19 complications (27.8%). CONCLUSION: A great number of the hospitalized post-acute COVID-19 patients showed psychological issues requiring psychological intervention, the most common were anxiety, demoralization, acute stress, depression, and grief. The proposed psychological treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted in a Cognitive Behavioral framework. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological intervention is an important part of rehabilitation in the post-acute phase of the illness to reduce distress symptoms and improve psychological health.","Rossi Ferrario, Silvia; Panzeri, Anna; Cerutti, Paola; Sacco, Daniela",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s283558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603379/,428

Oral administration of chicken egg yolk antibody (IgY) is a promising nutritional strategy to control pathogen infections. The objective of this study was to produce an A. actinomycetemcomitans- and P. gingivalis-specific IgY and evaluate its effects on bacterial agglutination and biofilm formation. Thirty laying hens were immunized with a complex of lysate containing typical molecular weights of membrane proteins of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis. IgY was isolated by polyethylene glycol 6000 and ammonium sulfate and purified by dialysis. The results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the obtained IgY were specific to both A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy scanning and crystal violet staining showed that the IgY could bind to cell wall of the pathogens and efficiently accelerate agglutination and inhibit biofilm formation. Furthermore, the activity of the IgY remained stable at different temperature, pH, and storage period. This is the first report that a novel two-in-one IgY was produced to modulate the agglutination and biofilm formation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, suggesting the potential of IgY to control periodontitis caused by oral pathogens.","Li, Xiangguang; He, Pan; Yu, Linjin; He, Qiyi; Jia, Chenggang; Yang, Huiyi; Lu, Minglei; Wei, Xiuting; Zhao, Suqing",Journal of oral microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/20002297.2020.1831374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144924/,428

Here we analyzed the histopathology of intestinal detachment tissue from a patient with COVID-19. METHODS: The enteric tissue was examined by hematoxylin & eosin stain, PAS (Periodic acid–Schiff) staining, Gram staining, Ziehl–Neelsen stain and Grocott’s Methenamine Silver (GMS) Stain. The distribution of CD3, CD4, CK20 and CD68, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) antigen were determined by immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization (ISH) of SARS-CoV-2 and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) were also performed. RESULTS: We observed mucosal epithelium shedding, intestinal mucosal erosion, focal inflammatory necrosis with hemorrhage, massive neutrophil infiltration, macrophage proliferation accompanied by minor lymphocyte infiltration. Fungal spores and gram positive cocci but not mycobacteria tuberculosis were identified. Immunohistochemistry staining showed abundant CD68(+) macrophages but few lymphocytes infiltration. HSV, CMV and EBV were negative. ISH of SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed positive signal which mostly overlapped with CD68 positivity.

While there are many measures to assess stress and other stress-related conditions, there are no systematic reviews to date to assess whether the current measures of generalized stress are valid or reliable in Latinos in the United States. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the current state of the literature assessing the psychometric properties in stress measures in this population. Methods: We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to review the literature from January 1990 to May 2020 for studies, which measured the psychometric properties of scales measuring generalized stress in Latinos in the United States. Results: Twelve studies measured the psychometric properties of eight scales of generalized stress. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Hispanic Stress Inventory, the Hispanic Women's Social Stressor Scale, and the Family Obligation Stress Scale show the strongest reliability and validity for measuring stress in Latinos in the United States. Most studies were done in traditional immigration destinations in the United States. Conclusion: While four scales which show acceptable reliability and validity for measuring stress in Latinos in the United States, continuing to develop and further validate these scales within Latino communities will be critical to understand and address Latino stress more comprehensively.

This provoked the Korean government and the general public to recognize the importance of having a well-established system against infectious diseases. Although epidemiologic investigation is one of the most important aspects of prevention, it has been pointed out that much needs to be improved in Korea. We review here the current status of the Korean epidemiologic service and suggest possible supplementation measures. We examine the current national preventive infrastructure, including human resources such as Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, its governmental management, and related policies. In addition, we describe the practical application of these resources to the recent MERS outbreak and the progress in preventive measures. The spread of MERS demonstrated that the general readiness for emerging infectious diseases in Korea is considerably low. We believe that it is essential to increase society’s investment in disease prevention. Fostering public health personnel, legislating management policies, and establishing research centers for emerging infectious diseases are potential solutions. Evaluating international preventive systems, developing cooperative measures, and initiating improvements are necessary. We evaluated the Korean epidemiologic investigation system and the public preventive measures against infectious diseases in light of the recent MERS outbreak. We suggest that governmental authorities in Korea enforce preventive policies, foster the development of highly qualified personnel, and increase investment in the public health domain of infectious disease prevention.","Lee, Changhwan; Ki, Moran",Epidemiol Health,https://doi.org/10.4178/epih/e2015040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26493654/,428
684915,Incidental COVID-19 Pneumonia on (18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT,2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological diseases. At present, because the exact cause is still unclear, accurate diagnosis and progression monitoring remain challenging. In recent years, exploring the relationship between PD and speech impairment has attracted widespread attention in the academic world. Most of the studies successfully validated the effectiveness of some vocal features. Moreover, the noninvasive nature of speech signal–based testing has pioneered a new way for telediagnosis and telemonitoring. In particular, there is an increasing demand for artificial intelligence–powered tools in the digital health era. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build a real-time speech signal analysis tool for PD diagnosis and severity assessment. Further, the underlying system should be flexible enough to integrate any machine learning or deep learning algorithm. METHODS: At its core, the system we built consists of two parts: (1) speech signal processing: both traditional and novel speech signal processing technologies have been employed for feature engineering, which can automatically extract a few linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, and (2) application of machine learning algorithms: some classical regression and classification algorithms from the machine learning field have been tested; we then chose the most efficient algorithms and relevant features. RESULTS: Experimental results showed that our system had an outstanding ability to both diagnose and assess severity of PD. By using both linear and nonlinear dysphonia features, the accuracy reached 88.74% and recall reached 97.03% in the diagnosis task. Meanwhile, mean absolute error was 3.7699 in the assessment task. The system has already been deployed within a mobile app called No Pa. CONCLUSIONS: This study performed diagnosis and severity assessment of PD from the perspective of speech order detection. The efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms indirectly validated the practicality of the system. In particular, the system reflects the necessity of a publicly accessible PD diagnosis and assessment system that can perform telediagnosis and telemonitoring of PD. This system can also optimize doctors’ decision-making processes regarding treatments.","Zhang, Liang; Qu, Yue; Jin, Bo; Jing, Lu; Gao, Zhan; Liang, Zhanhua",JMIR Med Inform,https://doi.org/10.2196/18689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936086/,428

While several studies suggest that immune dysregulation plays a central role, the key mediators of this process are yet to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that plasma from a high proportion (77%) of critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not healthy controls, contains broadly auto-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM), and only infrequently auto-reactive IgG or IgA. Importantly, these auto-IgM preferentially recognize primary human lung cells in vitro, including pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. By using a combination of flow cytometry, LDH-release assays, and analytical proteome microarray technology, we identified high-affinity, complement-fixing, auto-reactive IgM directed against 263 candidate auto-antigens, including numerous molecules preferentially expressed on cellular membranes in pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, and renal tissues. These findings suggest that broad IgM-mediated autoimmune reactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, thereby identifying a potential target for novel therapeutic interventions.","Maier, Cheryl; Wong, Andrew; Woodhouse, Isaac; Schneider, Frank; Kulpa, Deanna; Silvestri, Guido",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398261/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-128348/v1,428

The scaled data of infected people in most of the analyzed countries are found to collapse onto a common scaling function fG(x) with x={gamma}(t-t0) in the range of fG(x) {+/-} 0.05. The recently proposed indicator so-called the K value, the increasing rate of infected people in one week, is also found to show universal behavior.

This project was undertaken to model and estimate the magnitude of cross‐contamination in the domestic environment. Scientific information from the relevant literature was collected and analyzed, to define the cross‐contamination routes, to describe the variability sources and to extract and harmonise the transfer fractions to be included as model parameters. The model was used to estimate the relative impact of the cross‐contamination routes for different scenarios. In addition, the effectiveness of several interventions in reducing the risk of food‐borne diseases due to cross‐contamination was investigated. The outputs of the model showed that the cutting board route presents a higher impact compared to other routes and replacement of the kitchen utensils is more effective than other interventions investigated; the transfer to other surfaces and objects, which can house bacteria in the environment, is also described. Laboratory cross‐contamination trials have been performed to estimate bacterial transfer via cutting, from the external surface of the meat to the cutting surfaces and to the knife. The results, obtained from the laboratory trials, show magnitudes of and differences in the bacterial transfer fraction to the knife and the cutting surface in relation to which side of the meat is contaminated. Despite the complexity of factors which influence bacterial transfer, the combination of laboratory work with mathematical modelling enhanced scientific understanding and appreciation of the uncertainty of the estimates.

METHODS: The patients’ clinical symptoms and test results were collected from their medical records. The caregivers of patients were identified by phone calls. RESULTS: After patient zero (case #1) was admitted to Pyeongtaek St. Mary’s Hospital (May 15-May 17), an outbreak occurred, with 36 cases between May 18 and June 4, 2015. Six patients died (fatality rate, 16.7%). Twenty-six cases occurred in the first-generation, and 10 in the second-generation. The median incubation period was five days, while the median period from symptom onset to death was 12.5 days. While the total attack rate was 3.9%, the attack rate among inpatients was 7.6%, and the inpatients on the eighth floor, where patient zero was hospitalized, had an 18.6% attack rate. In contrast, caregivers and medical staff showed attack rates of 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The attack rates were higher than those of the previous outbreaks in other countries.

686829,Safety Measures in Dermatology Help Minimize Spread of COVID‐19,2020-06-07,"Background: National immunisation programmes globally are at risk of suspension due to the severe health system constraints and physical distancing measures in place to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa against the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. Methods: We used two scenarios to approximate the child deaths that may be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. First, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever (DTP3, HepB3, Hib3, PCV3, RotaC, MCV1, MCV2, MenA, RCV, YFV) to approximate the future deaths averted before completing five years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month Covid-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. Second, we analysed an alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the Covid-19 risk period. The excess number of infections due to additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure during immunisation visits assumes that contact reducing interventions flatten the outbreak curve during the Covid-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport and that upon child infection the whole household would be infected. Country specific household age structure estimates and age dependent infection fatality rates are then applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation alongside 95% uncertainty range estimates from probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Findings: For every one excess Covid-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, there could be 143 (38 - 576) deaths in children prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children, siblings, parents or adult care-givers, and older adults in the households of vaccinated children are 58,000 (3,200 - 21,350,000), 52,000 (2,800 - 18,884,000), 2,000 (393 - 12,000), and 157 (41 - 652) respectively. In the alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 5 (1 - 21) under these highly conservative assumptions and if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 2,000 (131 - 839,000). Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that the health benefits of deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa far outweighs the excess risk of Covid-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits. However, there are other factors that must be considered for strategic decision making to sustain routine childhood immunisation in African countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. These include logistical constraints of vaccine supply chain problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, reallocation of immunisation providers to other prioritised health services, healthcare staff shortages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections among the staff, decreased demand for vaccination arising from community reluctance to visit vaccination clinics for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections, and infection risk to healthcare staff providing immunisation services as well as to their households and onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission into the wider community.","Abbas, K.

However, inconsistency and ambiguity in instructions show a lack of definitive knowledge on best spray use techniques. In this study, we have identified a new usage strategy for nasal sprays available over-the-counter, that registers an average 8-fold improvement in topical delivery of drugs at diseased sites, when compared to prevalent spray techniques. The protocol involves re-orienting the spray axis to harness inertial motion of particulates and has been developed using computational fluid dynamics simulations of respiratory airflow and droplet transport in medical imaging-based digital models. Simulated dose in representative models is validated through in vitro spray measurements in 3D-printed anatomic replicas using the gamma scintigraphy technique. This work breaks new ground in proposing an alternative user-friendly strategy that can significantly enhance topical delivery inside human nose. While these findings can eventually translate into personalized spray usage instructions and hence merit a change in nasal standard-of-care, this study also demonstrates how relatively simple engineering analysis tools can revolutionize everyday healthcare. Finally, with respiratory mucosa as the initial coronavirus infection site, our findings are relevant to intra-nasal vaccines that are in-development, to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.","Basu, Saikat; Holbrook, Landon T.; Kudlaty, Kathryn; Fasanmade, Olulade; Wu, Jihong; Burke, Alyssa; Langworthy, Benjamin W.; Farzal, Zainab; Mamdani, Mohammed; Bennett, William D.; Fine, Jason P.; Senior, Brent A.; Zanation, Adam M.; Ebert, Charles S.; Kimple, Adam J.; Thorp, Brian D.; Frank-Ito, Dennis O.; Garcia, Guilherme J.

Our data suggest that older adult patients shed lower titers of viruses, necessitating a highly sensitive assay such as RT-PCR to reliably detect respiratory viral pathogens.","She, Rosemary C.; Polage, Christopher R.; Caram, Lauren B.; Taggart, Edward W.; Hymas, Weston C.; Woods, Christopher W.; Schmader, Kenneth; Petti, Cathy A.",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2010.02.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542205/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889310000568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889310000568,428
687985,Expanded Role of a Dietitian in Monitoring a Gluten-Free Diet in Patients with Celiac Disease: Implications for Clinical Practice,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Despite progress towards increasing global vaccination coverage, measles continues to be one of the leading, preventable causes of death among children worldwide. Whether and how to target sub-national areas for vaccination campaigns continues to remain a question. We analyzed three metrics for prioritizing target areas: vaccination coverage, susceptible birth cohort, and the effective reproductive ratio (R(E)) in the context of the 2010 measles epidemic in Malawi. METHODS: Using case-based surveillance data from the 2010 measles outbreak in Malawi, we estimated vaccination coverage from the proportion of cases reporting with a history of prior vaccination at the district and health facility catchment scale. Health facility catchments were defined as the set of locations closer to a given health facility than to any other. We combined these estimates with regional birth rates to estimate the size of the annual susceptible birth cohort. We also estimated the effective reproductive ratio, R(E), at the health facility polygon scale based on the observed rate of exponential increase of the epidemic. We combined these estimates to identify spatial regions that would be of high priority for supplemental vaccination activities. RESULTS: The estimated vaccination coverage across all districts was 84%, but ranged from 61 to 99%. We found that 8 districts and 354 health facility catchments had estimated vaccination coverage below 80%. Areas that had highest birth cohort size were frequently large urban centers that had high vaccination coverage. The estimated R(E) ranged between 1 and 2.56. The ranking of districts and health facility catchments as priority areas varied depending on the measure used. CONCLUSIONS: Each metric for prioritization may result in discrete target areas for vaccination campaigns; thus, there are tradeoffs to choosing one metric over another. However, in some cases, certain areas may be prioritized by all three metrics. These areas should be treated with particular concern. Furthermore, the spatial scale at which each metric is calculated impacts the resulting prioritization and should also be considered when prioritizing areas for vaccination campaigns. These methods may be used to allocate effort for prophylactic campaigns or to prioritize response for outbreak response vaccination.","Kundrick, Avery; Huang, Zhuojie; Carran, Spencer; Kagoli, Matthew; Grais, Rebecca Freeman; Hurtado, Northan; Ferrari, Matthew",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5628-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902976/,428

An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors. In this study, we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politically relevant variables. We discuss these data in relation to the potentially functional nature of fear in global health crises.","Harper, Craig A.; Satchell, Liam P.; Fido, Dean; Latzman, Robert D.",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00281-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346359/,428

Gut bacteria influence behavior, and both depression and anxiety symptoms are directly associated with alterations in the microbiota. Psychobiotics are defined as probiotics that confer mental health benefits to the host when ingested in a particular quantity through interaction with commensal gut bacteria. The action mechanisms by which bacteria exert their psychobiotic potential has not been completely elucidated. However, it has been found that these bacteria provide their benefits mostly through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the immune response and inflammation, and through the production of neurohormones and neurotransmitters. This review aims to explore the different approaches to evaluate the psychobiotic potential of several bacterial strains and fermented products. The reviewed literature suggests that the consumption of psychobiotics could be considered as a viable option to both look after and restore mental health, without undesired secondary effects, and presenting a lower risk of allergies and less dependence compared to psychotropic drugs.","Del Toro-Barbosa, Mariano; Hurtado-Romero, Alejandra; Garcia-Amezquita, Luis Eduardo; García-Cayuela, Tomás",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352789/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123896,428

A clinical vignettes comparison to GPs,2020-12-16,One of the objectives that the scientific community is setting itself is to understand whether acquired immunity and the presence of antibodies against acute coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies protect against reinfection. Although there are many published papers describing how the re-positivization of nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction real time (RT-PCR) test and clinical healing of the subject can be justified by numerous reasons and random situations. Our aim is to highlight how there are certain populations more susceptible to re-infection than others. This article is protected by copyright.
