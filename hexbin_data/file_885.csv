70243,Finding the Nidus: Detection and Workup of Non-Central Nervous System Arteriovenous Malformations.,2016,"OBJECTIVE To compare the results of Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (LTEPR) and the open prolene hernia system repair (OPHSR), in terms of complications, postoperative pain and quality of life. Background: Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequent surgeries made by general surgeons. Although, with the technological development and scientific advances even today it is not possible to define which is the gold standard procedure to hernia repair. Material and Methods: For this observational study, all 577 consecutive patients who underwent hernia repair were included in the study, 293 LTEPR, and 284 OPHSR. The average age for OPHSR was 62.49 years and for LTEPR 55.35 years. The average follow-up of 38.10 months, the mean operative time for OPHSR was 55.58 minutes and for LTEPR was 45.46 minutes, with a hospital stay of 1.1 and 1.08 respectively. Results: Each type of hernia was classified according to Gilbert/Rutcow-Robbins criteria, resulting in the OPHSR, 80.28 % were assigned to class 1 to 3 and only 19.72% in class 4 to 7. In the LTEPR, 52.22% of the patients are classified in degree 1 to 3 and 47.78% were class 4 to 7. In the LTEPR group there was more complications with 9 cases of bleeding controlled at the same time, one tear of the bladder, no other visceral complications; in the OPHSR group, there were fewer complications with significant differences (p= .014). The postoperative complications, principally hematoma, and seroma were the most common complication without statistic differences. The postoperative pain was in the OPHSR group, 77.46% of patients reported suffering from mild or pain-free pain, 21.47% reported moderate pain, and 1.05% reported severe pain, in the LTEPR group 74.4% of patients reported mild pain, 25.25% reported moderate pain and only one patient reported severe pain, without significant differences. In both groups, the patients reported a high index of satisfaction, and in the LTEPR group scare results were better than OPHSR (p .001). CONCLUSION The outcomes of LTEPR are similar to OPHSR. However, LTEPR has shorter operative time, more intraoperative complications and better scar satisfaction.","Susmallian, Sergio; Barnea, Royi; Ponomarenko, Oleg",Chirurgia,https://doi.org/10.21614/chirurgia.116.3.271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191708/,885
84360,A New Normal in Radiology Resident Education: Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021,"BACKGROUND Recent studies have reported trocar site hernia (TSH) rates after bariatric surgery ranging from 0 to 45.2% based on imaging assessment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH rate after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) comprising routine 12 mm epigastric trocar site closure (TSC). MATERIAL Prospective observational study with retrospective control cohort of a group of patients undergoing primary SG with routine 12 mm epigastric TSC. The ""before"" group (control group) was a previously published group of patients without 12 mm epigastric TSC and the ""after"" group (closure group) concerned patients with routine 12 mm epigastric TSC. Primary endpoint was the TSH rate after routine epigastric TSC. Secondary endpoints were comparison of the TSH rate, TSC feasibility and causes of failure, TSC-related morbidity, evaluation of TSC time and its course, and identification of risk factors for TSH. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients were analyzed during the study period. Feasibility of epigastric TSC was 97.3% without related morbidity. Mean epigastric TSC time was 44.2 s (18-150). Epigastric TSC time was always less than 60 s after 10-15 procedures. At 1 year, 10 patients presented TSH (8.1%): epigastric in 6.5% (n = 8) cases and after open laparoscopy in 1.6% (n = 2) cases. Comparison of the two groups revealed a lower TSH rate in the closure group (8.1% vs. 17.0%; p = 0.02), due to a lower epigastric TSH rate (6.5% vs. 14.8%; p = 0.02). Routine epigastric TSC was a protective factor for TSH (p = 0.03; relative risk of 0.43). CONCLUSION Routine epigastric TSC during SG is rapid and provides effective prevention of TSH.","Rebibo, Lionel; Demouron, Marion; Dembinski, Jeanne; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Yzet, Thierry; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-019-03971-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168720/,885
104062,RadioGraphics Update: Contrast-enhanced US Approach to the Diagnosis of Focal Liver Masses.,2020,"Adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) have lower rates of virologic suppression and higher rates of immunologic decline compared to their older counterparts, potentially placing them at high-risk for developing severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. ALWH who are transitioning to adult care face additional challenges to remaining in care and adhering to treatment. In this special section we report the experiences of ALWH in the process of transitioning to adult HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic. In first place, the government-mandated stay-at-home order has substantially limited access to full HIV care by restricting public transportation, HIV medication stock-outs, and the suspension of routine medical and laboratory appointments. In addition, financial hardship, uncertainty about their future plans, emotional stressors, lifestyle disruptions, and concerns of involuntary disclosure have further challenged continuity in care for this adolescent population.","Errea, Renato A; Wong, Milagros; Senador, Liz; Ramos, Alicia; Ramos, Karen; Galea, Jerome T; Lecca, Leonid; SÃ¡nchez, Hugo; Benites, Carlos; Franke, Molly F",Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,https://doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2021.381.6296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34190908/,885
138488,Biceps pulley: normal anatomy and associated lesions at MR arthrography.,2011,"The Covid-19 pandemic launched the use of online courses in Chinese medical schools during February 2020. To evaluate the state of gross anatomy education in China during the pandemic, a nationwide survey was conducted through convenience sampling by email or respondent invitations on social media. A total of 359 questionnaires were received from the respondents. The first response from a given school was included in the study to represent that school, thus, 77 questionnaires were used for analyses. Schools represented were from all provinces in mainland China as well as Hong Kong and Macao. The survey found that before the pandemic, 74.0% and 33.8% of the 77 schools conducted online theoretical and practical sessions, respectively, on gross anatomy, and 36 (46.8% of 77) had temporarily suspended practical sessions at the time the survey. Body donation programs were also affected with 26.0% and 27.3% of the 77 schools having suspended donation programs or saw a decreased number of donations. During the pandemic, 40.3% of the 77 schools kept or initiated the implementation of active learning, and online assessment was continued in 49.4% of the 77 medical schools. Another 26 (33.8%) schools initiated online assessment during the pandemic. A total of 359 answers were included for the analysis of the ""teachers' perception of the online teaching experience"". Nearly half (46.2%) of the 359 responded teachers were satisfied with the effectiveness of online teaching during the pandemic. A total of 36.2% of these respondents preferred to implement online teaching of theoretical sessions after the pandemic, and 89 (24.8%) teachers were keen to return to traditional face-to-face anatomy education.","Cheng, Xin; Chan, Lap Ki; Pan, San-Qiang; Hongmei, Cai; Li, Yun-Qing; Yang, Xuesong",Anatomical sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217164/,885

This is attributed in part to the suboptimal and short-lived immunity elicited by acellular pertussis vaccines and to their inability to prevent nasal colonization and transmission of the etiologic agent Bordetella pertussis In response to this escalating public health concern, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases held the workshop ""Overcoming Waning Immunity in Pertussis Vaccines"" in September 2019 to identify issues and possible solutions for the defects in immunity stimulated by acellular pertussis vaccines. Discussions covered aspects of the current problem, gaps in knowledge and possible paths forward. This review summarizes presentations and discussions of some of the key points that were raised by the workshop.","Damron, F Heath; Barbier, Mariette; Dubey, Purnima; Edwards, Kathryn M; Gu, Xin-Xing; Klein, Nicola P; Lu, Kristina; Mills, Kingston H G; Pasetti, Marcela F; Read, Robert C; Rohani, Pejman; Sebo, Peter; Harvill, Eric T",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769142/,885

184954,[Codon Bias Analysis in the Coding Genes of Structural and Accessory Proteins of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus].,2016,This paper suggested integrating podcast application to improve Islamic education storytelling sessions during pandemic COVID-19 disruption in Indonesia. The findings of a study about learning in schools and madrasahs believe that learning during a pandemic disturbance can be overcome with a remote learning system with the help of learning media with various digital applications. For this reason we have reviewed various literature and online-based learning applications and scientific publications of the latest findings on how to deal with learning disabilities during COVID-19 to deepen new understanding to prove the assumption that many learning applications can help students learn during temporary shelters but open classrooms at a long distance. With the evidence of existing studies from various literature and scientific publications on online learning and pandemic disruption we can say that the effectiveness of integrating the podcast application has become an alternative superiority of distance learning media among students in Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia. Therefore we highly recommend pesantrens academics especially students in the Islamic education environment and teachers outside the Islamic boarding school to integrate digital media podcasts as an alternative distance learning solution during disruption and the new normal learning period because of the advantages and effectiveness of podcasts application for learning in Indonesia.,"Mohamad, Suhaidi; Ismail, Ismail; Selvi, Handayani Eka; Tauhid, Tauhid",Nidhomul Haq : Jurnal Manajemen Pendidikan Islam,https://doi.org/10.31538/ndh.v5i2.1063,885

It is characterized by a heightened inflammatory and prothrombotic state that are known to cause various cardiovascular manifestations such as thromboembolism, acute coronary syndrome and stroke. We here present a 72-year-old woman with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and COVI 19 pneumonia who presented with acute ischemic stroke. She was also noted to have ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on the electrocardiogram however the imaging and clinical presentation was consistent with apical takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We here discuss the various pathophysiologic mechanisms by which COVID-19 can result in acute stroke. The patient likely developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy because of stroke and acute COVID-19 induced sympathetic stimulation and catecholamine surge. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of apical variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a COVID-19 report.","Kariyanna, Pramod Theetha; Chandrakumar, Harshith Priyan; Jayarangaiah, Apoorva; Khan, Abdullah; Vulkanov, Volodymyr; Ashamalla, Michael; Salifu, Moro O; McFarlane, Samy I",American journal of medical case reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32704530/,885

AIM The aim of the study was to conduct a preliminary analysis of the effects of a break in implementing rehabilitation programs in patients with Alzheimer's disease with symptoms of dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS The analysis included data obtained from qualification tests of 19 patients (14 women, 5 men) aged 76 to 91 years (mean 81.2 +/- 9.9 years) qualified in 2021 to return to groups at the Alzheimer Center in Warsaw. The obtained results of the performed Katz, Lawton tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were compared with the results from 2020. RESULTS The initial assessment showed a deterioration of the general and mental condition of patients qualified for the planned activities. The Katz test for the assessment of basic activities of everyday life did not reveal any significant changes in relation to the results obtained one year ago, while the Lawton test for the assessment of complex activities of daily life showed that 13 (68%) of the subjects significantly deteriorated compared to the previous year's study. On the other hand, in the MMSE, deterioration was noted in 12 (63%) analyzed compared to their state from a year ago. CONCLUSIONS During the year of forced isolation due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was a significant deterioration in the daily activities and cognitive functions of patients with symptoms of dementia in the elderly.","Witkowska-Plusa, Urszula",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464365/,885

METHODS: We undertook an additional follow-up of two existing UK registers involving people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and participants in a trial in the UK who had regional pain and were identified at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. Participants completed the study questionnaire between July and December 2020, throughout which time there were public health restrictions in place. RESULTS: 1054 people took part in the study (596 axSpA, 162 PsA, 296 regional pain). In comparison to their previous (pre-pandemic) assessment, there was an age-adjusted significant, small, decrease in quality of life measured by EQ-5D (-0.020 95% CI (-0.030, -0.009)) overall and across all population groups examined. This was primarily related to poorer mental health and pain. There was a small increase in fibromyalgia symptoms, but a small decrease in sleep problems. There was a small deterioration in axSpA disease activity, and disease-specific quality of life and anxiety in PsA participants. Predictors of poor quality of life were similar pre- and during the pandemic. The effect of lockdown on activity differed according to age, gender, and deprivation. CONCLUSION: Important lessons include focussing on addressing anxiety and providing enhanced support for self-management in the absence of normal health care being available, and awareness that all population groups are likely to be affected.","Macfarlane, Gary J; Hollick, Rosemary J; Morton, LaKrista; Heddle, Maureen; Bachmair, Eva-Maria; Anderson, R Stuart; Whibley, Daniel; Keenan, Karen Forrest; Murchie, Peter; Stelfox, Kevin; Beasley, Marcus J; Jones, Gareth T",Rheumatology (Oxford),,885

289313,"[COVID-toes, a cutaneous sign of innate resistance to SARS-CoV-2]",2021,"OBJECTIVE: To generate rankings of 35 countries from all continents (except Africa) on performance against COVID-19. DESIGN: International time series, cross-sectional analysis. SELECTED COUNTRIES: Countries having 5500 or more cases (collectively including 85% of the world's cases) as of 16 April 2020 and that had reached 135 days into their pandemic by 30 July. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The initial severity and late-pandemic performance of countries can reasonably be ranked by COVID-19 cases or deaths per million population. For guiding policy and informing public accountability during the pandemic, we propose mid-pandemic performance rankings based on doubling time in days of the total number of cases and deaths in a country. Rank orderings then follow. RESULTS: At day 25 into a country's pandemic, cross-country performance variation was modest: in most countries, cumulative deaths doubled in fewer than 5 days. By day 65, and even more so by day 135, great cross-country variation emerged. By day 135, 9 of the 10 top-performing countries on deaths were European, although they were initially hard hit by the pandemic. Thus, rankings change rapidly enough to point to the value of a dynamic indicator. Five countries-Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia and Israel-were among the seven poorest performers at day 135 on both cases and deaths. Doubling times for cases and for deaths are positively correlated, but differ sufficiently to point to the value of both indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Readily available data support transparently generated rankings of countries' performance against COVID-19 based on doubling times of cases and deaths. It is premature to judge the value of these rankings in practice, but the potential and early experience suggest they might help facilitate identification of good policies and inform judgements on national leadership.","Jamison, Dean T; Lau, Lawrence J; Wu, Kin Bing; Xiong, Yanyan",,,885

Standards such as the World Health Organization (WHO) IPC minimum requirements offer a basis, but robust evidence on effective IPC implementation strategies in low-resource settings remains limited. We aimed to qualitatively assess IPC implementation themes in these settings. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with IPC experts from low-resource settings, guided by a standardised questionnaire. Applying a qualitative inductive thematic analysis, IPC implementation examples from interview transcripts were coded, collated into sub-themes, grouped again into broad themes, and finally reviewed to ensure validity. Sub-themes appearing â¥ 3 times in data were highlighted as frequent IPC implementation themes and all findings were summarised descriptively. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with IPC experts from 29 countries in six WHO regions. Frequent IPC implementation themes including the related critical actions to achieve the WHO IPC core components included: (1) To develop IPC programmes: continuous advocacy with leadership, initial external technical assistance, stepwise approach to build resources, use of catalysts, linkages with other programmes, role of national IPC associations and normative legal actions; (2) To develop guidelines: early planning for their operationalization, initial external technical assistance and local guideline adaption; (3) To establish training: attention to methods, fostering local leadership, and sustainable health system linkages such as developing an IPC career path; (4) To establish health care-associated (HAI) surveillance: feasible but high-impact pilots, multidisciplinary collaboration, mentorship, careful consideration of definitions and data quality, and âdata for actionâ; (5) To implement multimodal strategies: clear communication to explain multimodal strategies, attention to certain elements, and feasible but high-impact pilots; (6) To develop monitoring, audit and feedback: feasible but high-impact pilots, attention to methods such as positive (not punitive) incentives and âdata for actionâ; (7) To improve staffing and bed occupancy: participation of national actors to set standards and attention to methods such as use of data; and (8) To promote built environment: involvement of IPC professionals in facility construction, attention to multimodal strategy elements, and long-term advocacy.

The study finds the 2019-nCoV prefusion spike to adopt a unique strategy by undertaking a dynamic conformational asymmetry that results in two prevalent asymmetric structures of spike where one or two spike heads rotate up to provide better exposure to the host-cell receptor. A few unique interchain interactions are identified at the interface of closely associated N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD) playing a crucial role in the thermodynamic stabilization of the up conformation of the RBD in the case of the 2019-nCoV spike.
