To evaluate genotypic diversity and identify forces shaping picornavirus evolution, we screened persons with respiratory illnesses by using rhinovirus-specific or generic real-time PCR assays. We then sequenced the 5′ untranslated region, capsid protein VP1, and protease precursor 3CD regions of virus-positive samples. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis identified the large genotypic diversity of rhinoviruses circulating in humans. We identified and completed the genome sequence of a new enterovirus genotype associated with respiratory symptoms and acute otitis media, confirming the close relationship between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses and the need to detect both viruses in respiratory specimens. Finally, we identified recombinants among circulating rhinoviruses and mapped their recombination sites, thereby demonstrating that rhinoviruses can recombine in their natural host. This study clarifies the diversity and explains the reasons for evolution of these viruses.","Tapparel, Caroline; Junier, Thomas; Gerlach, Daniel; Van Belle, Sandra; Turin, Lara; Cordey, Samuel; Mühlemann, Kathrin; Regamey, Nicolas; Aubert, John-David; Soccal, Paola M.; Eigenmann, Philippe; Zdobnov, Evgeny; Kaiser, Laurent",Emerg Infect Dis,120,3

At that time, epidemic was the name given to a collection of clinical syndromes, such as coughs or diarrheas, occurring and propagating in a given period at a given location. Over centuries, the form and meaning of the term have changed. Successive epidemics of plague in the Middle Ages contributed to the definition of an epidemic as the propagation of a single, well-defined disease. The meaning of the term continued to evolve in the 19th-century era of microbiology.

The presence of bacterial metabolites in the breath, intestinal bullae (hydrogen) and urine (D-lactate) during the course of the illness is further confirmatory evidence. The presence of bacteria or bacterial products (such as exo- and endotoxin) in the circulation will lead to ischaemia of the intestine and other organs either directly or via mediators such as cytokines or platelet activating factor.

We examined extant epidemiological records from South African mining operations and other related activities to determine if mortality risk factors could be measured. During October 1918 when pandemic influenza struck in South Africa, the mortality rates in Kimberley diamond miners (22.4%, n = 11 445) were >35 times that of Rand gold miners (0.6%, n = 200 000). There were no differences discernable between diamond and gold miners regarding their recruitment, working conditions, housing or medical care that would explain the great variance in mortality rates. Reports of influenza-like illness in Natal Province some weeks prior to the main pandemic suggest infection from a mild version of influenza and thus protection of the gold miners from mortality whereas the more isolated diamond miners only experienced the second, more lethal, wave. The huge mortality difference between South African diamond and gold miners in 1918 is most likely explained by the circulation of a related but not identical virus to the A/H1N1 pandemic strain which reached Johannesburg prior to October 1918 because of its better transportation connections.","Shanks, G.

We hypothesised that increased physiological dead space (V(d,phys)) caused decreased minute alveolar ventilation (V(A); alveolar ventilation (V(A)) × respiratory rate) in well-ventilated infants with hypercapnia. We investigated the relationship between dead space and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) and assessed V(A). Intubated infants (n = 33; mean birth weight, 2257 ± 641 g; mean gestational age, 35.0 ± 3.3 weeks) were enrolled. We performed volumetric capnography (V(cap)), and calculated V(d,phys) and V(A) when arterial blood sampling was necessary. PaCO(2) was positively correlated with alveolar dead space (V(d,alv)) (r = 0.54, p < 0.001) and V(d,phys) (r = 0.48, p < 0.001), but not Fowler dead space (r = 0.14, p = 0.12). Normocapnia (82 measurements; 35 mmHg ≤ PaCO(2) < 45 mmHg) and hypercapnia groups (57 measurements; 45 mmHg ≤ PaCO(2)) were classified.

Humans, like mice, may engage in enhanced exploratory and social behaviour following isolation, which may protect against subsequent cognitive decline and psychological distress. Understanding how these effects may impact behaviour in older adults is particularly relevant, as this population is likely to experience periods of late-life social isolation. We report that late-life social isolation in female mice did not lead to robust depressive-like symptomology, altered social interaction behaviour, sensitivity to context fear acquisition and memory, or alterations in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, Tnf-α) or microglial activation (Itgam) within the hippocampus. Rather, isolation increased hyperactivity and exploration behaviours. These findings have translational value as the first female mouse model of late-life social isolation, and provide evidence to inform the development of interventions aimed at promoting functional recovery following isolation in late-life.","Sullens, D.

Methods: HCT116 cells were treated with TS essential oil alone or with TRAIL, and then its anticancer effect was determined by using MTT assay, live dead assay, caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Further mechanisms of its anticancer effects was determined by analyzing expression of death receptor signaling pathway using Western blotting. A mouse model was also used to assess the antitumor potential of thyme essential oil. Results: TS oily fraction showed tumor growth inhibitory effect even at lower concentration. TS induces apoptotic cell death as indicated by cleavage of PARP, and activation of the initiator and effector caspases (caspase-3, -8 and -9). Further, results showed that TS increases the expression of death receptors (DRs) and reduces the expression of TRAIL decoy receptors (DcRs). In addition, upregulation of signaling molecules of MAPK pathway (p38 kinase, ERK, JNK), down-regulation of c-FLIP, and overexpression of SP1 and CHOP were observed by TS. Further in animal model, intragastric administration of TS (12.5 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml) prevented colorectal carcinogenesis by blocking multi-steps in carcinoma. Conclusion: Overall, these results indicate that thymus essential oil promotes apoptosis in HCT116 cells and impedes tumorigenesis in animal model. Moreover, thyme potentiates TRAIL-induced cell death through upregulation of DRs, CHOP and SP1 as well as downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins in HCT116 cells. However, therapeutic potential of TS needs to be further explored.","Guesmi, Fatma; Prasad, Sahdeo; Ali, Manel Ben; Ismail, Ismail A.; Landoulsi, Ahmed",Aging (Albany NY),120,3

Beware of Luxury (c. 1665).,13.139385,12.128609,2003-08-11,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Preclinical 3D in vitro coculture models are known to be more complex systems than monolayer cell culture and mimic the physiological environment more closely. Three-dimensional dermal equivalents provide a relevant environment for cutaneous metastatic melanoma cells and are capable of modulating a cancer cell’s response to drugs. We showed that a combined targeted therapy (vemurafenib and cobimetinib) efficiently inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, especially in the 3D coculture model. A cancer-associated fibroblast population isolated from a cutaneous melanoma was also sensitive to the treatment but with no detectable induction of apoptosis. To better understand the complex crosstalk between melanoma cells and their microenvironment, we compared the influence of conditioned media obtained from healthy or cancer-associated fibroblasts on the response of metastatic melanomas to the drugs. Our data indicate that normal fibroblast supernatants potentialize the therapy’s efficiency, whereas cancer-associated fibroblast secretomes favor melanoma cell survival. ABSTRACT: The sensitivity of melanoma cells to targeted therapy compounds depends on the tumor microenvironment. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro coculture systems better reflect the native structural architecture of tissues and are ideal for investigating cellular interactions modulating cell sensitivity to drugs. Metastatic melanoma (MM) cells (SK-MEL-28 BRAF V600E mutant and SK-MEL-2 BRAF wt) were cultured as a monolayer (2D) or cocultured on 3D dermal equivalents (with fibroblasts) and treated with a BRAFi (vemurafenib) combined with a MEK inhibitor (MEKi, cobimetinib). The drug combination efficiently inhibited 2D and 3D MM cell proliferation and survival regardless of their BRAF status. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), isolated from a cutaneous MM biopsy, were also sensitive to the targeted therapy. Conditioned media obtained from healthy dermal fibroblasts or CAFs modulated the MM cell’s response differently to the treatment: while supernatants from healthy fibroblasts potentialized the efficiency of drugs on MM, those from CAFs tended to increase cell survival. Our data indicate that the secretory profiles of fibroblasts influence MM sensitivity to the combined vemurafenib and cobimetinib treatment and highlight the need for 3D in vitro cocultures representing the complex crosstalk between melanoma and CAFs during preclinical studies of drugs.","Morales, Delphine; Vigneron, Pascale; Ferreira, Ines; Hamitou, Warda; Magnano, Mikael; Mahenthiran, Laxsika; Lok, Catherine; Vayssade, Muriel",Cancers (Basel),120,3

More severe symptoms of anxiety were especially related to lower QOL (physical health, psychological and environmental domains) in patients. Statistically higher trait anxiety in lower social QOL domain scores was observed. Our findings show that high state and trait anxiety were associated with higher depression scores and lower quality of life in the elderly.

Each survey consisted of an observation of the volunteers’ practices and individual interviews (70 in all) in order to understand these citizen-sensors motivations and experiences, and characterize how they fulfilled their role. We concluded that, for citizen sensing, the scope and role of ambassador should be reconsidered insofar as these citizens serve as peer leaders and mediators. In this respect, we try to define the success factors for citizen-sensing-based ambassadors programmes.","Dardier, Guilhem; Jabot, Françoise; Pouliquen, Flora",Int J Environ Res Public Health,120,3

Method: Fifty-seven subjects aged between 7 and 12 years old were recruited in this study, and the experiment was divided into two stages. The first stage consisted of a case history inquiry, a refraction state, and a visual function examination. In the second stage, the subjects gazed at an object at distances of 0.4 m, 2.285 m, and through a DMS, respectively, and their accommodative responses were measured using an open-field autorefractor. Results: There was no significant difference in the schoolchildren’s accommodative response between subjects gazing at an object at 2.285 m (0.14 ± 0.35 D, p > 0.05) and those gazing at it through a DMS (0.20 ± 0.35 D). However, their accommodative response showed a significant difference between subjects gazing at an object at 0.4 m and 2.285 m and those gazing at it at 0.4 m and through a DMS. Conclusion: In this experiment, the results of the children’s accommodative response measured at 2.285 m or through a DMS are very similar. The viewing distance can be extended by a DMS, resulting in accommodative relaxation. This result may have potential applications in myopia control.","Yeh, Shang-Min; Lo, Chen-Cheng; Lee, Chi-Hung; Chen, Yu-Jung; Lin, Feng-Chi; Huang, Shuan-Yu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,120,3

The aim of the study was to examine the association between birth satisfaction and the risk of postpartum depression (PPD). A 30-item version of the Birth Satisfaction Scale (BSS) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used, as well as the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The study included 584 women (mean age 30.6 ± 4.9), 2 to 4 days postpartum. In the regression model, the negative effect of birth satisfaction on the risk of postpartum depression was shown: a lower level of satisfaction with childbirth was a significant predictor of a higher risk of PPD (β = −0.18, 95% CI = −0.08; −0.03). The regression model was controlled for the effect of the sociodemographic factors (such as education or marital status) and clinical variables (such as parity, type of delivery, psychiatric history, levels of prenatal stress). Levels of prenatal stress (β = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.27; 0.39), psychiatric history (β = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.01; 3.09), parity (β = −0.12, 95% CI = −1.82; −0.32) and type of delivery (β = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.20; 1.94) were also significantly associated with the levels of postnatal depression. The current study confirmed the association between the level of birth satisfaction and the risk of developing PPD, i.e., a lower satisfaction with childbirth may increase the risk of developing PPD.","Urbanová, Eva; Škodová, Zuzana; Bašková, Martina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,120,3

Data of patients with rheumatic diseases who had undergone the QFT-GIT or QFT-PLUS test were used, and information regarding patient demographics, primary diagnosis, laboratory results, and medications was collected. Furthermore, indeterminate result rates of the patient cohort and healthy controls were also compared. A total of 177 (43.4%) and 231 (56.6%) patients had undergone QFT-GIT and QFT-PLUS tests, respectively. Among them, four (2.3%) and seven (3.0%) patients had indeterminate results, which did not differ between the QFT-GIT and QFT-PLUS groups. Indeterminate results were significantly higher among patients with rheumatic diseases than in healthy controls (2.7% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the lymphocyte count (hazard ratio (HR) 0.998, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.997, 1.000; p = 0.012) and albumin level (HR 0.366, 95% CI 0.150, 0.890; p = 0.027) were predictive of indeterminate results. A lymphocyte count of ≤810/mm(3) and an albumin level of ≤3.7 mg/dL were capable of discriminating between indeterminate and determinate results. The QFT-GIT and QFT-PLUS tests have comparable diagnostic performances in patients with rheumatic diseases. Decreased lymphocyte and albumin levels contribute to indeterminate results.","Ahn, Sung Soo; Kim, Hyung Woo; Park, Younhee",J Clin Med,120,3

Additionally, the in vivo oral and topical anti-inflammatory effect against carrageenan-induced models, as well as antipyretic potentiality of ABSEO and its nanoemulsion were evaluated. Forty-three terpenoid components were identified and categorized as mono- (42.94%), sesqui- (31.66%), and diterpenes (23.74%). The main compounds of the ABSEO were beyerene (20.81%), α-pinene (16.21%), D-limonene (14.22%), germacrene D (6.69%), β-humulene (4.14%), and sabinene (4.12%). The ABSEO and its nanoemulsion exhibited significant inflammation suppression in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model, in both oral (50 and 100 mg/kg) and topical (5% in soyabean oil) routes, compared to the control and reference drugs groups. All the results demonstrated the significant inflammation reduction via the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL8), nitrosative (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) supported by the histopathological studies and immunohistochemical assessment of MMP-9 and NF-κβ levels in paw tissues. Moreover, the oral administration of ABSEO and its nanoemulsion (50 and 100 mg/kg) exhibited antipyretic activity in rats, demonstrated by the inhibition of hyperthermia induced by intramuscular injection of brewer’s yeast.

The microporosity, nanofiber morphology, and mechanical strength of the scaffolds were adjusted by varying the fabrication parameters, such as the polymer concentration and solvent composition. The influence of these parameters on the structure and morphology of PHB organogels and scaffolds was elucidated using small-angle neutron scattering and scanning electron microscopy. The organogels and scaffolds in this study have a complex hierarchical structure, extending over a wide range of length scales. In vitro viability assays were performed using the human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), and all PHB scaffolds demonstrated the excellent cell viability. Microporosity had the greatest impact on HaCaT cell proliferation on PHB scaffolds, which was determined after a 3-day incubation period with scaffolds of different morphologies and mechanical properties. The superior cell viability and the controlled scaffold properties and morphologies suggested PHB scaffolds fabricated by non-solvent-induced phase separation using chloroform and tetrahydrofuran as promising biomaterials for the applications of tissue engineering, particularly of epidermal engineering.

As we all know, EBV can encode some proteins to inhibit the production of IFN-I, but it’s not clear whether other proteins also take part in this progress. EBV early lytic protein BFRF1 is shown to be involved in viral maturation, however, whether BFRF1 participates in the host innate immune response is still not well known. In this study, we found BFRF1 could down-regulate sendai virus-induced IFN-β promoter activity and mRNA expression of IFN-β and ISG54 during BFRF1 plasmid transfection and EBV lytic infection, but BFRF1 could not affect the promoter activity of NF-κB or IRF7. Specifically, BFRF1 could co-localize and interact with IKKi. Although BFRF1 did not interfere the interaction between IKKi and IRF3, it could block the kinase activity of IKKi, which finally inhibited the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Taken together, BFRF1 may play a critical role in disrupting the host innate immunity by suppressing IFN-β activity during EBV lytic cycle.","Wang, Ping; Deng, Yangxi; Guo, Yingjie; Xu, Zuo; Li, Yiwen; Ou, Xiaowen; Xie, Li; Lu, Manjiao; Zhong, Jiayi; Li, Bolin; Hu, Li; Deng, Shenyu; Peng, Tao; Cai, Mingsheng; Li, Meili",Front Immunol,120,3

India as the second most populous nation of the world has also running with a serious health crisis, where more than 8,300,500 people have been infected and 123,500 deaths due to this deadly pandemic. Therefore, it is urgent to highlight the spatial vulnerability to identify the area under risk. Taking India as a study area, a geospatial analysis was conducted to identify the hotspot areas of the COVID-19. In the present study, four factors naming total population, population density, foreign tourist arrivals to India and reported confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were taken as responsible factors for detecting hotspot of the novel coronavirus. The result of spatial autocorrelation showed that all four factors considered for hotspot analysis were clustered and the results were statistically significant (p value < 0.01). The result of Getis-Ord Gi* statistics revealed that the total population and reported COVID-19 cases have got high priority for considering hotspot with greater z-score (> 3 and > 0.7295 respectively). The present analysis reveals that the reported cases of COVID-19 are higher in Maharashtra, followed by Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The spatial result and geospatial methodology adopted for detecting COVID-19 hotspot in the Indian subcontinent can help implement strategies both at the macro and micro level.

The existence of Hopf bifurcation and consequent occurrence of bifurcating periodic orbits around the humoral immune activated equilibrium are illustrated. The findings show that Hopf bifurcation and stability switches occur under certain conditions as the bifurcation parameter crosses the critical values. Furthermore, the dynamical effect of the development rate of B cells is investigated numerically. The results obtained show that the system becomes unstable from stable and regains stability from instability depending on the development rate of B cells for a fixed delay value.

Basic Military Training at Joint Base-San Antonio is the entrance to the US Air Force and has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in the past. A two-week arrival quarantine was implemented in March 2020. Effects on subsequent testing for COVID-19 after an arrival quarantine is unknown. METHODS: The first four weekly cohorts of trainees who underwent an arrival quarantine between March 16-April 13 were monitored during their 7 week training for COVID-19 symptoms. Symptoms, medical testing, and days removed from training were collected on every patient with possible COVID-19 symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, or fever. Testing during the two-week arrival quarantine were compared to the subsequent five weeks of training. Nominal variables were compared by chi squared or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U Test. RESULTS: A total of 2,573 started training during study period, 89 (3.4%) had symptoms concerning for COVID-19 and were tested. 5 (6%) patients tested positive, all of whom in the arrival quarantine. Compared to patients who completed quarantine (n=29), patients in the arrival quarantine who tested negative for COVID-19 (n=54) were tested more often (26 trainees a week vs. 5.8 later in training, p=< 0.0001), and received more rapid flu tests (74% vs. 38%, p=0.001) and multiplex respiratory PCR (15% vs. 0%, p=0.05). Trainees in quarantine were isolated longer for symptoms than patients who completed quarantine (median 3 vs. 2, p=0.01). There was no difference in presenting symptoms for trainees in quarantine or after quarantine. CONCLUSION: Arrival quarantine appears to be an effective NPI, which in conjunction with other interventions prevented any COVID-19 transmission after quarantine completion. For those who went through arrival quarantine, there was more intense initial testing and initial longer symptomatic patient isolation, this was balanced by fewer symptomatic patients, less testing, and shorter isolations later in training.

There is limited research evaluating the consequence of diverting resources from patient safety initiatives to COVID-19 crisis efforts. In an attempt to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on quality of patient care, we compared rates of blood culture contamination and central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) during COVID-19 to those before the pandemic. METHODS: A comparative retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze blood culture contamination and CLABSI rate per 1,000 line days in a tertiary care hospital in Detroit within a “pre- COVID-19” timeframe, January - May 2019, and “COVID-19” timeframe, January - May 2020. The CLABSI rate data was obtained through Infection Control Surveillance System TheraDoc®. Blood culture contamination report was obtained through the Microbiology Department. Chi-square and t-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The blood culture contamination rate increased from 3.1% during pre COVID-19 timeframe to 4.0% during COVID-19 (p-value < 0.01) (Figure 1) with the highest rate in March and April 2020 correlating with the peak of COVID-19 (Figure 2). The CLABSI rate per 1,000 line days increased from 0.71 in pre-COVID-19 time frame to 2.70 during COVID-19 (p-value < 0.01) (Figure 1). Of the 33 CLABSIs identified during the COVID-19 time frame, 18 (54%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. When comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients; average length of stay was 28.1 days shorter in the positive group (p-value < 0.01). COVID-19 positive patient had higher mortality (p-value < 0.01) (Table1). Refer to Table 1 for comparison of variables between pre COVID-19 and COVID-19 cohort and COVID-19 positive and negative cohort. Figure 1.

Despite no increase in length of stay in COVID-19 positive patient, higher mortality and CLABSIs were noted in these patients. During a pandemic, healthcare systems should be allocated additional resources to accommodate the increased patient load without affecting quality of care.

Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor for the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, is effective in suppressing pathological inflammation in several rheumatological diseases. After administering TCZ to COVID-19 patients with suspected CRS, we observed a sharp fall in inflammatory indices. We analyzed this effect using results from the first 19 COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ at our hospital. METHODS: Data for all patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received TCZ at our center, a 200 bed community hospital in New England, were extracted from the Electronic Medical Record, including demographics, body temperature, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), IL-6 levels, clinical severity on the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI), and clinical outcome (recovery/discharge home, partial recovery/discharge rehab, death). Results were tabulated and statistical significance of changes in indices pre- and post- TCZ assessed by Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. RESULTS: 19 patients received TCZ: 16 got 400mg x1, 2 got 400 mg x2, 1 got 660 mg x1. Median age was 64 years (range: 44–94), 68% male.

The impact of the pandemic on HIV primary care in a Boston community health center (CHC) that has specialized HIV, sexual and gender minority care is analyzed here. METHODS: The CHC has used the Centricity Practice Solution(TM) electronic medical record (EMR) system since 1997. The current analyses used data abstracted from the EMR, testing for significant differences in HIV care utilization using the Student t-test for means and chi-square tests for proportions. RESULTS: There were 2,016 HIV+ patients among 25,606 patients (7.9%) engaged in primary care in 2019. In 2019, HIV+ patients had between 563 and 689 in-person visits per month. On average, monthly visits for HIV care increased (p< 0.0001) in the first two months of 2020 (mean=626, sd=60.1) compared to 2019 (mean=617, sd=40.6), but dropped to 370 and 36 in person visits by HIV+ patients in March and April 2020 respectively (mean=203, sd=236.2; p< 0.0001), when statewide stay-at-home policies were recommended. There were 263 telemedicine visits by HIV+ patients in March and 751 in April, 2020. When telemedicine and in-person visits were combined, mean number of visits per month by HIV+ patients were higher compared to the same two-month period in 2019 (p< .0001). The mean number of plasma HIV RNA viral load (VL) tests performed each month was 279 in 2019 (range 257–312, sd=18.3), versus 219 in March and 274 in April 2020 (mean=246.5, sd=38.9; p< 0.0001). Among those tested, monthly rates of virological suppression ranged from 71–81% in 2019, with 11–20% having VL < 100 copies/ml. Eighty percent had an undetectable VL as their last measurement in 2019; an additional 14% had last VL detectable but < 100 copies/ml. In March and April, 2020, the rates of VL suppression were 77% and 74% and 14% and 18% had VL detectable but < 100 copies/ml, respectively (p=0.209). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant decrease in in-person visits by HIV+ and other patients at a Boston CHC, but with a rapid migration to the use of telemedicine, patient engagement, as expressed by visits and VL suppression does not appear to be adversely affected DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","Mayer, Kenneth H; Levine, Kenneth; Grasso, Chris; Multani, Ami; Gonzalez, Alex; Biello, Katie",Open Forum Infect Dis,120,3

Moreover, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus Disease 2), has developed into an unprecedented pandemic, posing enormous pressure on health-care providers around the world. CASE PRESENTATION: Four and half years after right hip arthroplasty, the patient came back to our attention with pain at the same hip. The instrumental examinations showed signs of cup detachment. After carefully analyzing the case, we decided to perform a sterile aspiration of the hip in the operating room under C-arm fluoroscopy. Microbiological examinations showed positivity for E. coli. The patient underwent surgery by which the prosthesis was removed and a spacer was implanted. A therapy with Cefotaxim 2 g three times a day for 6 weeks was then set, and then a total arthroplasty was performed. During this period, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and therefore the patient received nasal-throat swabbing two times, and both yielded negative results. However, 1 week after the final surgery, his respiratory conditions deteriorated and chest X-ray and CT scan showed images of ground-glass opacification patterns (GGO). Due to the clinical symptoms and the characteristic images of the instrumental examinations, the patient was transferred to an observation ward. Thereafter, two more swab tests gave negative results. The patient was then transferred to the ward for patients with typical symptoms of COVID-19 but with negative swab tests for 2 weeks and was subsequently discharged home. CONCLUSION: The purpose of this case report was to point out the correct treatment of a PJI after the outbreak of COVID-19. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the guidelines in the case of periprosthetic hip infection further confirmed the correct management of the patient.","Cosentino, A.; Odorizzi, G.; Berger, W.",Arthroplasty,120,1

In this context, this research aims to study the effect of mechanical pre-treatment on the pyrolysis behaviour of GFRC and its pyrolysis kinetic. The experiments were started with the fabrication of GFRC panels using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer method followed by crushing the prepared panels using ball milling, thus preparing the milled GFRC with uniform shape and size. The elemental, proximate, and morphology properties of the panels and milled GFRC were studied. The thermal and chemical decomposition of the milled GFRC was studied using thermogravimetric coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) at different heating rates. Meanwhile, the volatile products were examined using TG coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The TG-FTIR and TG-GC-MS experiments were performed separately. Linear (Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), and Friedman) and nonlinear (Vyazovkin and Cai) isoconversional methods were used to determine the pyrolysis kinetic of the milled GFRC based on thermogravimetry and differential thermal gravimetry (TG/DTG). In addition, the TG/DTG data of the milled GFRC were fitting using the distributed activation energy model and the independent parallel reactions kinetic model. The TG results showed that GFRC can decompose in three stages, and the main decomposition is located in the range 256–500 °C. On the other hand, aromatic benzene and a C-H bond were the major functional groups in the released volatile components in FTIR spectra, while phenol (27%), phenol,4-(1-methylethyl) (40%), and p-isopropenylphenol (34%) were the major compounds in GC-MS analysis. Whereas, the kinetic results showed that both isoconversional methods can be used to determine activation energies, which were estimated 165 KJ/mol (KAS), 193 KJ/mol (FWO), 180 KJ/mol (Friedman), 177 KJ/mol (Vyazovkin), and 174 KJ/mol (Cai).","Yousef, Samy; Eimontas, Justas; Striūgas, Nerijus; Praspaliauskas, Marius; Abdelnaby, Mohammed Ali",Polymers (Basel),120,5

In uninfected cells GBF1 activates small GTPases of the Arf family and coordinates multiple steps of membrane metabolism, including functioning of the cellular secretory pathway. A non-structural protein 3A of poliovirus and related viruses has been shown to directly interact with GBF1, likely mediating its recruitment to the replication complexes. Surprisingly, viral mutants with severely reduced level of 3A-GBF1 interaction demonstrate minimal replication defects in cell culture. Here we systematically investigated the conserved elements of GBF1 to understand what determinants are important to support poliovirus replication. We demonstrate that multiple GBF1 mutants inactive in cellular metabolism could still be fully functional in the replication complexes. Our results show that Arf activating property, but not the primary structure of the Sec7 domain is indispensable for viral replication. They also suggest a redundant mechanism of recruitment of GBF1 to the replication sites, dependent not only on direct interaction of the protein with the viral protein 3A, but also on determinants located in the non-catalytic C-terminal domains of GBF1. Such double targeting mechanism explains the previous observations of remarkable tolerance of different levels of GBF1-3A interaction by the virus, and likely constitutes an important element of resilience of viral replication.Importance. Enteroviruses are a vast group of viruses associated with diverse human diseases but only two of them could be controlled with vaccines, and effective anti-viral therapeutics are lacking. Here we investigated in details the contribution of a cellular protein GBF1 in the replication of poliovirus, a representative enterovirus. GBF1 supports functioning of cellular membrane metabolism and is recruited to viral replication complexes upon infection. Our resuts demonstrate that the virus requires a limited subset of the normal GBF1 functions, and reveal the elements of GBF1 essential to support viral replication under different conditions. Since diverse viruses often rely on the same cellular proteins for replication, understanding the mechanisms by which these proteins support infection is essential for the development of broad spectrum anti-viral therapeutics.","Viktorova, Ekaterina G; Gabaglio, Samuel; Meissner, Justyna M; Lee, Eunjoo; Moghimi, Seyedehmahsa; Sztul, Elizabeth; Belov, George A",Journal of virology,120,33

In the present study, we asked whether and if so to what extent melatonin and meloxicam can improve subjective and objective sleep and reduce pain among women with primary dysmenorrhea (PD). To this end, we conducted a double-blind cross-over clinical trial lasting for three menstrual cycles. A total of 14 women (mean age M = 27.5 years) with primary dysmenorrhea took part in the study. At baseline, that is, during the first menstruation, they completed a visual analogue scale to rate pain; sleep continuity was assessed via actigraphs, and overall sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Next, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either melatonin during the second, and meloxicam during the third menstruation, or meloxicam during the second, and melatonin during the third menstruation. Neither participants nor investigators were aware of participants' study assignment. During the second and third menstruations, the assessments described above were repeated. At baseline, sleep assessed both objectively and subjectively was impaired, and pain was high. Subjective sleep improved and pain decreased during the second and third menstruations irrespective of whether melatonin or meloxicam was administered first or second. Likewise, objective sleep efficiency increased and objective sleep latency shortened. The efficacy of melatonin was superior to that of meloxicam. The present pattern of results suggests that both melatonin and meloxicam are suitable to treat pain and PD-related sleep complaints among women with primary dysmenorrhea.","Keshavarzi, Farahnaz; Mahmoudzadeh, Fariba; Brand, Serge; Sadeghi Bahmani, Dena; Akbari, Fariba; Khazaie, Habibolah; Ghadami, Mohammad Rasoul",Archives of women's mental health,120,27

The main source of blue light is sunlight, but digital screens, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and fluorescent lighting serve as additional sources. Concerns about the negative effects of blue light on the skin have rapidly increased over the past 15 years, and consequently, the urge to learn more about this topic is increasing as well. AIMS Part I of this article provides up-to-date information on the definition of blue light and the negative and positive effects of blue light on the skin. METHODS An Internet search was completed using the Google scholar database for relevant literature. RESULTS Blue light can be both harmful and beneficial to the skin, depending on intensity and wavelength. Short-term safety information is more readily available from clinical studies; however, the biological effects of repeated and/or longer-term exposure are not fully understood yet. CONCLUSIONS Low-energy and low exposure times to high-energy blue light can help prevent skin diseases, while studies have revealed that longer exposure to high-energy blue light can increase the amount of DNA damage, cell and tissue death, and injury, eye damage, skin barrier damage, and photoaging.","Coats, Jahnna G; Maktabi, Briana; Abou-Dahech, Mariam S; Baki, Gabriella",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,120,1

Others with a rather devastating history and high fatality rates such as plague, cholera, or typhus seem less threatening today but have not been eradicated, and with a declining efficacy of current antibiotics they ought to be watched carefully. Another emerging issue in this context is health-care associated infection. About 100,000 hospitalized patients in the USA ( www.cdc.gov ) and 33,000 in Europe ( https://www.ecdc.europa.eu ) die each year as a direct consequence of an infection caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Among viral infections, influenza is responsible for about 3-5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually ( www.who.int ). About 37 million people are currently living with HIV infection and about one million die from it each year. Coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, but in particular the recent outbreak of Covid-19 (caused by SARS-CoV2) have resulted in large numbers of infections worldwide with an estimated several hundred thousand deaths (anticipated fatality rate: <5%). With a comparatively low mortality rate dengue virus causes between 50 and 100 million infections every year, leading to 50,000 deaths. In contrast, Ebola virus is the causative agent for one of the deadliest viral diseases. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 is considered the largest outbreak in history with more than 11,000 deaths. Many of the deadliest pathogens such as Ebola virus, influenza virus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, dengue virus, and cholera exploit the endo-lysosomal trafficking system of host cells for penetration into the cytosol and replication. Defects in endo-lysosomal maturation, trafficking, fusion, or pH homeostasis can efficiently reduce the cytotoxicity caused by these pathogens. Most of these functions critically depend on endo-lysosomal membrane proteins such as transporters and ion channels. In particular, cation channels such as the mucolipins (TRPMLs) or the two-pore channels (TPCs) are involved in all of these aspects of endo-lysosomal integrity. In this review we will discuss the correlations between pathogen toxicity and endo-lysosomal cation channel function, and their potential as drug targets for infectious disease therapy.","Chao, Yu-Kai; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Grimm, Christian","Reviews of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology",120,11

The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical outcomes of standard intraperitoneal onlay mesh (sIPOM) versus fascial defect closure with intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM-Plus) for large incisional hernia repair. METHODS Of 49 patients who underwent laparoscopic incisional hernia repair between November 2005 and December 2016, 26 cases with large incisional hernia (transverse diameter ≥10 cm) were examined to compare surgical outcomes between sIPOM (n = 12) and IPOM-Plus (n = 14). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS We compared sIPOM with IPOM-Plus for similar hernia types during median follow-up periods of 53 and 21 months, respectively. The operation time was 150 min for sIPOM and 148 min for IPOM-Plus (P = 0.6220). Early postoperative complications including seroma formation were observed in four sIPOM patients (33%) and three IPOM-Plus patients (21%) (P = 0.6652). Significantly more mesh bulged with sIPOM than with IPOM-Plus (50% vs 0%; P = 0.0082). Chronic pain lasting 3 months after the operation was found in two cases of IPOM-Plus (14%), but this was not statistically significant. Postoperative hospital stay was longer for sIPOM patients than for IPOM-Plus patients. Only one recurrence was observed in the sIPOM group (8%), but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION For large incisional hernia repair, IPOM-Plus seems to be more effective than sIPOM in terms of reducing mesh bulging.","Suwa, Katsuhito; Okamoto, Tomoyoshi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,120,19

Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has been investigated as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy, a known effective treatment for suicidality, in the management of treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, with promising findings. Yet, there are very limited data on the association of MST with suicidality directly. It is important to explore the potential of MST as a viable treatment alternative to electroconvulsive therapy for suicidality. Objective To determine the association of MST with suicidality in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants This nonrandomized controlled trial took place at a single tertiary care psychiatric facility in Canada. It followed an open-label study design with consecutive treatment cohorts. Consecutive groupings of 67 patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and with baseline suicidality present were treated for up to 24 treatments. The study was run from February 2012 through June 2019. Patients were followed up for 6 months at the end of the treatment period. This post hoc secondary analysis of the trial was performed from January to November 2019. Interventions MST was delivered at 100% stimulator output over the prefrontal cortex with low (25 Hz), moderate (50 or 60 Hz), or high (100 Hz) frequency, for a maximum of 24 sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures Remission from suicidality was measured as an end point score of 0 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. A linear mixed model was used to assess the trajectory of Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores. Results A total of 67 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.3 [13.6] years; 40 women [60.0%]) received a mean (SD) of 19.5 (5.1) MST treatments. The overall number of patients achieving remission was 32 (47.8%). Sixteen patients (55.2%) receiving low-frequency MST achieved remission, as well as 12 patients (54.5%) in the moderate-frequency group, and 4 patients (25.0%) in the high-frequency group. The linear mixed model revealed an association of time with Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores (F8,293.95 = 5.73; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that MST may be an effective treatment for suicidality, and sensitivity analysis shows this may be particularly so at low and moderate frequencies. Future studies should directly compare MST with electroconvulsive therapy for treating suicidality and should evaluate MST as a treatment for suicidality across mental disorders.

All flavonoids contain a common 2-phenyl chromone structure (C6-C3-C6) as a scaffold. Hence, in using such a scaffold, plenty of high-value-added flavonoids can be synthesized by chemical or biological catalyzation approaches. (2S)-Naringenin is one of the most commonly used flavonoid scaffolds. However, biosynthesizing (2S)-naringenin has been restricted not only by the low production but also by the expensive precursors and inducers that are used. Herein, we established an induction-free system to de novo biosynthesize (2S)-naringenin in Escherichia coli. The tyrosine synthesis pathway was enhanced by overexpressing feedback inhibition resistant genes (aroGfbr and tyrAfbr) and knocking out a repressor gene (tyrR). After optimizing the fermentation medium and conditions, we found that glycerol, glucose, fatty acids, potassium acetate, temperature, and initial pH are important for producing (2S)-naringenin. Using the optimum fermentation medium and conditions, our best strain Nar-17LM1 could produce 588 mg/L (2S)-naringenin from glucose in a 5-L bioreactor, the highest titer reported to date in E. coli.","Zhou, Shenghu; Hao, Tingting; Zhou, Jingwen",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,120,1

The N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain plays a proofreading role for prevention of lethal mutagenesis, and the C-terminal domain functions as a (guanine-N7) methyl transferase (N7-MTase) for mRNA capping. The molecular basis of both these functions is unknown. Here, we describe crystal structures of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp14 in complex with its activator nonstructural protein10 (nsp10) and functional ligands. One molecule of nsp10 interacts with ExoN of nsp14 to stabilize it and stimulate its activity. Although the catalytic core of nsp14 ExoN is reminiscent of proofreading exonucleases, the presence of two zinc fingers sets it apart from homologs. Mutagenesis studies indicate that both these zinc fingers are essential for the function of nsp14. We show that a DEEDh (the five catalytic amino acids) motif drives nucleotide excision. The N7-MTase domain exhibits a noncanonical MTase fold with a rare β-sheet insertion and a peripheral zinc finger.

After the patient smoked a cigarette, the scotoma scintillans ceased. However, he then developed a headache, general fatigue, and shoulder and elbow pain. He therefore called an ambulance. Based on the rules of the medical cooperative system for decompression sickness in Izu Peninsula, the fire department called a physician-staffed helicopter. After a physician checked the patient, his complaints remained aside from a low-grade fever. A portable ultrasound revealed bubbles in his inferior vena cava. Because of the risk of his being infected with COVID-19, he was transported to our hospital not by air evacuation but via ground ambulance staff while receiving a drip infusion of fluid and oxygen. After arriving at the hospital, his symptoms had almost subsided. Whole-body computed tomography revealed gas around the bladder, left hip, right knee, bilateral shoulder, joints, and right intramedullary humerus. The patient received high-concentration oxygen, infusion therapy, and observational admission. On the second day of admission, his symptoms had completely disappeared, and he was discharged. To our knowledge, this is the first report that computed tomography might be useful for detecting gas in multiple joints, suggesting the onset of decompression sickness after diving. This might be the first report of gas in an intramedullary space after diving as a potential cause of dysbaric osteonecrosis.","Jitsuiki, Kei; Kushida, Yoshihiro; Nishio, Ryota; Yanagawa, Youichi",Wilderness & environmental medicine,120,31

Patients with a new diagnosis of solid malignancy between 9/25/2019 and 9/9/2020 were identified by querying pathology reports for 'carcinoma,' 'sarcoma,' or 'lymphoma.' Patients under 18 years and those with recurrent cancers were excluded. New cancer diagnoses were then compared in two cohorts. The exposure cohort ('Post-COVID-19') included all patients with new, solid malignancy diagnoses from the first day of the mandated stay-at-home order in California, 3/19/2020, until 9/9/2020 (175 days). The control cohort ('Pre-COVID-19') included all patients with new, solid malignancy diagnoses during an equivalent time period before the statewide order, from 9/25/2019 until 3/18/2020 (175 days). A total of 718 patients were found to have new histologic diagnoses of carcinoma, sarcoma, or lymphoma between 9/25/2019 and 9/9/2020. There were 409 patients diagnosed Pre-COVID-19 and 309 patients diagnosed Post-COVID-19, for an overall 24.44% decrease in the number of new, solid malignancy diagnoses (Table 1). There were 51 patients diagnosed with a new gynecologic malignancy Pre-COVID-19 compared to 37 patients Post-COVID-19, representing a 27.45% relative decrease in new diagnoses. Subgroup analysis of gynecologic malignancies revealed a 29.62 to 57.14% decrease in the number of new uterine, cervical and vaginal cancer diagnoses, while the number of new ovarian cancer diagnoses remained relatively stable. [Display omitted] In our public safety net institution, which serves a largely non-White, 70% Latinx patient population, there has been a significant decrease in the total number of new, solid malignancy diagnoses since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Of gynecologic malignancies, the impact has been most pronounced in uterine, cervical and vaginal cancer diagnoses. In contrast, new ovarian cancer diagnoses have remained relatively stable. This may be explained by the different ways each of these cancers presents. Uterine cancers typically present with abnormal bleeding, a symptom often perceived as tolerable and shared with many benign conditions, and may be missed if patients defer outpatient or emergency encounters. Cervical and vaginal cancers are most often identified through outpatient screening practices, and may be missed if in-person clinic encounters are deferred. The relatively stable number of ovarian cancer diagnoses likely reflects the lack of screening and the significant symptom burden common at time of diagnosis, leading patients to seek care even during the pandemic. The results of this study indicate that delaying routine cancer screening and work-up for potential early cancer symptoms, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, is diminishing our ability to presciently diagnose cancer.

Although previous work has revealed important interconnections between autophagy and EVP-mediated secretion, our molecular understanding of these secretory events during endolysosome inhibition remains incomplete. Here, we delineate a secretory autophagy pathway upregulated in response to endolysosomal inhibition that mediates the EVP-associated extracellular release of autophagic cargo receptors, including p62/SQSTM1. This extracellular secretion is highly regulated and critically dependent on multiple ATGs required for the progressive steps of early autophagosome formation as well as Rab27a-dependent exocytosis. Furthermore, the disruption of autophagosome maturation, either due to genetic inhibition of the autophagosome-to-autolyosome fusion machinery or blockade via the SARS-CoV2 viral protein ORF3a, is sufficient to induce robust EVP-associated secretion of autophagy cargo receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that this ATG-dependent, EVP-mediated secretion pathway buffers against the intracellular accumulation of autophagy cargo receptors when classical autophagic degradation is impaired. Based on these results, we propose that secretory autophagy via EVPs functions as an alternate route to clear sequestered material and maintain proteostasis in response to endolysosomal dysfunction or impaired autophagosome maturation.","Solvik, Tina A.; Nguyen, Tan A.; Lin, Yu-Hsiu Tony; Marsh, Timothy; Huang, Eric J.; Wiita, Arun P.; Debnath, Jayanta; Leidal, Andrew M.",bioRxiv,120,1

As the severity of the infection was corelated with ethnicity, this study aimed to assess the correlation of proinflammatory cytokine serum level and COVID-19 symptoms within the Palestinian population. In cross-sectional study, serum samples of 27 non-hospitalized patients and 63 hospitalized patients SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, were tested for total antibodies, IL-6, TNF-, IFN-{beta} and IL-1{beta} using the ELISA test. Results showed that most common symptoms within patients were Joint pain, cough, and fever (73.3%, 69.7% and 50% respectively). Serum total antibodies (IGs) levels in non-hospitalized patients were higher than hospitalized patients ((44.7 COI and 9.2 COI). TNF- and IL-6 were lower in non-hospitalized patients compared to hospitalized patients (48 ± 17.9 pg/ml, 193.3 ± 350.5 pg/ml respectively). On the other hand, IFN-, in non-hospitalized patients (1 ± 2 IU/ml) was significantly higher than hospitalized patients (0.4 ± 0.26 IU/ml). IL-1{beta} was slightly lower in hospitalized patients (8.8 ± 13.6 pg/ml ) compared to non-hospitalized patients (12.5 ± 24.5 pg/ml). Common mild symptoms of COVID-10 were negatively associated with proinflammatory cytokines serum level. In conclusion as it with other populations worldwide, IL-6 and TNF- are playing a major role in the complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monitoring the two cytokines is crucial for management and treatment of complicated consequence of COVID-19.","Basha, W.; Nazzal, Z.; El-Hamshary, Y.; Odeh, A.; Hijjawi, L.; Doden, M.; Musa, A.; Ruzzeh, S.",,120,17

However, their susceptibility to UV degradation has limited their use in exterior applications. Usually, organic UV absorbers and stabilizers are added to epoxy systems to improve their UV stability, but their performance decreases over time due to the degradation and loss of organic UV-stabilizers. In this study, a novel method was developed to encapsulate organic UV stabilizers and lignin (as a natural UV absorber) into halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). To ensure successful encapsulation, the pristine and filled halloysite nanotubes were characterized quantitatively, using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and qualitatively with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Then, encapsulated nanotubes (HNTs) were added to an epoxy system (1−3 wt%) and their efficacy was evaluated before and after 840 h of accelerated weathering. Changes in physical, chemical, and thermal properties of coatings were measured using a spectrophotometer, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that epoxy samples containing 2 wt% HNT-encapsulated with organic UV-stabilizers, and samples containing 1 wt% HNTs encapsulated with lignin had significantly higher UV stability than epoxy resin prepared with the same concentration of these individual components (UV-stabilizers or lignin). This study demonstrates the efficacy of encapsulated HNTs, with UV stabilizers or lignin, in improving UV stability and extending service life of epoxy coatings. Nanoclay (HNT) loaded with lignin, a natural polymer, can be used as an effective UV-absorber to increase the weathering performance of epoxy resins.","Nikafshar, Saeid; McCracken, John; Dunne, Kevin; Nejad, Mojgan",Progress in Organic Coatings,120,9

Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4–66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that one possible interspecies recombination event occurred in ORF2. In summary, this study expanded our understanding of the viral communities of diarrhoeal yaks and identified a novel AstV that was associated with diarrhoea in yaks.","Chen, Xi; Zhang, Bin; Yue, Hua; Wang, Yong; Zhou, Fang; Zhang, Qiang; Tang, Cheng",The Journal of general virology,120,1

Excessive consumption is assumed to lead to a sedentary lifestyle, psychiatric disorders, overconsumption of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. But are these assumptions valid? METHODS We supplemented data from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study for Belgium with a bibliographical search of online databases (Medline, Scopus, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PubMed) with the keywords 'adolescent' - 'internet' and 'sedentarity' or 'suicide' or 'family' or 'sex*' or 'porno*' for articles published between 2014 and 2019. We selected 27 original research articles and/ or quantitative or qualitative meta-analyses. RESULTS Total consumption of different media (television, video games, internet) remained stable until 2010, and significantly increased in 2014. No parallel increase in sedentarity was reported. Controversy continues to surround the quantification of overconsumption, and the definition of 'problematic use'. Nevertheless, it appears that 5% of young people have unusual internet use, and 97.5% of these meet the criteria for a mental disorder. The risk of overconsumption is related to four factors: familial, personality, peer influence and supply. These general factors are supplemented by specific factors related to the abuse of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. For the latter, specific risk factors are the same as for suicidal young people who are not influenced by social media. CONCLUSION Even if screen time is higher for Generation Alpha, these young people are no more at risk unless they accumulate risk factors. They are also exposed to challenges that researchers have not yet studied in any depth. One question relates to how they can manage their privacy if their parents published, without their consent, photographs of them as children? Another issue is their relationship to knowledge, given that everything they need to know can easily be found online.","Zdanowicz, Nicolas; Reynaert, Christine; Jacques, Denis; Lepiece, Brice; Dubois, Thomas",Psychiatria Danubina,120,11

The aim of present study was to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures on emotional well-being and disease activity in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through a telemedicine approach. METHODS An on-line survey, including demographic characteristics, disease-activity and psychometric scales (Stress-related Vulnerability Scale, Resiliency scale), Zung Anxiety and Depression Self-assessment Scale), was anonymously administered to FM, RA and healthy controls (HC). Disease activities were compared to the pre-lockdown cohort referring to our centre. RESULTS Levels of anxiety and depression worthy of psychiatric attention were documented in 36.7% of FM, 14.6% of RA, 12.5% of HC and in 50% of FM, 17.1% of RA, 15% of HC, respectively. HC featured the highest stress scores, followed FM and then RA. RA showed higher resiliency than FM. Both anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher in FM than RA and HC. Disease severity was higher in RA patients and lower in FM patients when compared to the respective historical cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Lockdown significantly affected emotional well-being and disease activity of patients suffering from rheumatic diseases. While HC showed a higher vulnerability to stress, RA patients showed a greater resilience compared to both HC and to FM patients, especially. Emotional disturbances are greater in patients with RDs and in particular with FM. The use of a telemedicine approach to screen for severe symptoms represents a useful addition to the overall management of rheumatic patients.","Iannuccelli, Cristina; Lucchino, Bruno; Gioia, Chiara; Dolcini, Giulio; Favretti, Martina; Franculli, Daniele; Di Franco, Manuela",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,120,16

These principles are: (a) respect for autonomy; (b) doing well (beneficence); (c) not harming (non-maleficence); and (d) justice. In many countries, the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to overloaded healthcare systems due to large numbers of COVID-19 patients. In order to provide care to this high volume of patients, far-reaching measures are taken that affect everyone. These measures are not taken from an individual patient's perspective but in the interest of public health; nonetheless, they can directly affect the individual patient's interests.

The aim of this study is to analyze free and publicly available data to construct useful travel data records for network statistics other than common descriptive statistics. This study describes analytical findings of time-series plots and spatial-temporal maps to illustrate or visualize pandemic connectedness. We analyzed data retrieved from the web-based Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation dashboard, which contains up-to-date and comprehensive meta-information on civil flights from 193 national governments in accordance with the airport, country, city, latitude, and the longitude of flight origin and the destination. We used the database to visualize pandemic connectedness through the workflow of travel data collection, network construction, data aggregation, travel statistics calculation, and visualization with time-series plots and spatial-temporal maps. We observed similar patterns in the time-series plots of worldwide daily flights from January to early-March of 2019 and 2020. A sharp reduction in the number of daily flights recorded in mid-March 2020 was likely related to large-scale air travel restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The levels of connectedness between places are strong indicators of the risk of a pandemic. Since the initial reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide, a high network density and reciprocity in early-March 2020 served as early signals of the COVID-19 pandemic and were associated with the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in mid-March 2020. The spatial-temporal map of connectedness in Europe on March 13, 2020, shows the highest level of connectedness among European countries, which reflected severe outbreaks of COVID-19 in late March and early April of 2020. As a quality control measure, we used the aggregated numbers of international flights from April to October 2020 to compare the number of international flights officially reported by the International Civil Aviation Organization with the data collected from the Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation dashboard, and we observed high consistency between the 2 data sets. The flexible design of the database provides users access to network connectedness at different periods, places, and spatial levels through various network statistics calculation methods in accordance with their needs. The analysis can facilitate early recognition of the risk of a current communicable disease pandemic and newly emerging communicable diseases in the future.","Chu, Amanda My; Chan, Jacky Nl; Tsang, Jenny Ty; Tiwari, Agnes; So, Mike Kp",JMIR Public Health Surveill,120,20

However, the vast number of alarms regularly overwhelms staff and may induce alarm fatigue, a condition recently exacerbated by COVID-19 and potentially endangering patients. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on providing a complete and repeatable analysis of the alarm data of an ICU's patient monitoring system. We aimed to develop do-it-yourself (DIY) instructions for technically versed ICU staff to analyze their monitoring data themselves, which is an essential element for developing efficient and effective alarm optimization strategies. METHODS: This observational study was conducted using alarm log data extracted from the patient monitoring system of a 21-bed surgical ICU in 2019. DIY instructions were iteratively developed in informal interdisciplinary team meetings. The data analysis was grounded in a framework consisting of 5 dimensions, each with specific metrics: alarm load (eg, alarms per bed per day, alarm flood conditions, alarm per device and per criticality), avoidable alarms, (eg, the number of technical alarms), responsiveness and alarm handling (eg alarm duration), sensing (eg, usage of the alarm pause function), and exposure (eg, alarms per room type). Results were visualized using the R package ggplot2 to provide detailed insights into the ICU's alarm situation. RESULTS: We developed 6 DIY instructions that should be followed iteratively step by step. Alarm load metrics should be (re)defined before alarm log data are collected and analyzed. Intuitive visualizations of the alarm metrics should be created next and presented to staff in order to help identify patterns in the alarm data for designing and implementing effective alarm management interventions. We provide the script we used for the data preparation and an R-Markdown file to create comprehensive alarm reports. The alarm load in the respective ICU was quantified by 152.5 (SD 42.2) alarms per bed per day on average and alarm flood conditions with, on average, 69.55 (SD 31.12) per day that both occurred mostly in the morning shifts. Most alarms were issued by the ventilator, invasive blood pressure device, and electrocardiogram (ie, high and low blood pressure, high respiratory rate, low heart rate). The exposure to alarms per bed per day was higher in single rooms (26%, mean 172.9/137.2 alarms per day per bed). CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing ICU alarm log data provides valuable insights into the current alarm situation. Our results call for alarm management interventions that effectively reduce the number of alarms in order to ensure patient safety and ICU staff's work satisfaction. We hope our DIY instructions encourage others to follow suit in analyzing and publishing their ICU alarm data.","Poncette, Akira-Sebastian; Wunderlich, Maximilian Markus; Spies, Claudia; Heeren, Patrick; Vorderwülbecke, Gerald; Salgado, Eduardo; Kastrup, Marc; Feufel, Markus A; Balzer, Felix",J Med Internet Res,120,9

Currently, no mass-market wrist-worn SpO2 monitor meets the medical standards for pulse oximeters. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this monocentric and prospective clinical study with single-blind analysis was to test and validate the accuracy of the reflective pulse oximeter function of the Withings ScanWatch to measure SpO2 levels at different stages of hypoxia. The secondary objective was to confirm the safety of this device when used as intended. METHODS: To achieve these objectives, we included 14 healthy participants aged 23-39 years in the study, and we induced several stable plateaus of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) ranging from 100%-70% to mimic nonhypoxic conditions and then mild, moderate, and severe hypoxic conditions. We measured the SpO2 level with a Withings ScanWatch on each participant's wrist and the SaO2 from blood samples with a co-oximeter, the ABL90 hemoximeter (Radiometer Medical ApS). RESULTS: After removal of the inconclusive measurements, we obtained 275 and 244 conclusive measurements with the two ScanWatches on the participants' right and left wrists, respectively, evenly distributed among the 3 predetermined SpO2 groups: SpO2&#8804;80%, 80%<SpO2&#8804;90%, and 90%<SpO2. We found a strong association and a high level of agreement between the measurements collected from the devices, with high Pearson correlation coefficients of r=0.944 and r=0.954 on the correlation plots, low Pearson correlation coefficients of r=0.083 (P=.17) and r=0.23 (P=.001) on Bland-Altman plots, biases of 0.98% (95% CI 0.65-1.32) and 1.56% (95% CI 1.24-1.87), and root mean square errors of 2.97% and 3.00% from the participants' right and left hands, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the Withings ScanWatch is able to measure SpO2 levels with adequate accuracy at a clinical grade. No undesirable effects or adverse events were reported during the study.

Unfortunately, not all students can benefit from the adoption of such a surrogate of their usual school. We were asked to devise a way to allow a community of children affected by the Rett genetic syndrome, and thus unable to communicate verbally, in writing or by gestures, to actively participate in remote rehabilitation and special education sessions by exploiting eye-gaze tracking. As not all subjects can access commercial eye-tracking devices, we investigated new ways to facilitate the access to eye gaze-based interaction for this specific case. The adopted communication platform is a videoconferencing software, so all we had at our disposal was a live video stream of the child. As a solution to the problem, we developed a software (named SWYG) that only runs at the ""operator"" side of the communication, at the side of the videoconferencing software, and does not require to install other software in the child's computer. The preliminary results obtained are very promising and the software is ready to be deployed on a larger base. While this paper is being written, several children are finally able to communicate with their caregivers from home, without relying on expensive and cumbersome devices.","Iannizzotto, Giancarlo; Nucita, Andrea; Fabio, Rosa Angela; Caprì, Tindara; Bello, Lucia Lo",Information,120,16

As under vaccinations have been documented to cause reactive FDG-avid lymph nodes, the nodes in our patient were considered benign, reactive to the COVID-19 vaccination. Although FDG-avid benign, reactive nodes have been an uncommon finding in the past, the upcoming surge in COVID-19 vaccinations makes this an important finding for the interpreting physician to consider and recognize.","Ulaner, Gary A; Giuliano, Peter",Clin Nucl Med,120,1

The threat of a public health emergency catalyzed underlying xenophobic sentiments, manifesting them into racial discrimination of various degrees. With most discriminatory acts reported in liberal societies, this article investigates whether an economy more open to trade and migration can be more susceptible to xenophobia. Using our first-hand survey data of 1767 Chinese respondents residing overseas from 65 different countries during February of 2020, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal effect of openness to trade and migration of their residence country on the likelihood of them receiving discriminatory behaviors during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that greater openness to trade increases the likelihood of reported xenophobic behaviors, while openness to migration decreases it. On the other hand, stronger trade or immigration relationships with China are associated with less reported discrimination. And these effects primarily influence discriminatory behavior in interpersonal spaces, rather than through media outlets. Our findings highlight nuances of the effect of trade relations on the culture of a society.","He, Leshui; Zhou, Wen; He, Ming; Nie, Xuanhua; He, Jun",PLoS One,120,29

Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we specifically explored if aberrant histone methylation occurs in fetal endothelial cells in preeclampsia. Strikingly, we found that increased di-, and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) expression were associated with upregulation of methyltransferase G9a and downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and CuZn-SOD expression in preeclamptic HUVECs. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced hypermethylation of H3K9 and reduced CuZn-SOD expression mimicked what were seen in preeclamptic HUVECs and inhibition of G9a could attenuate these hypoxia-induced adverse events. Our study was the first to identify hypermethylation status in fetal endothelial cells in preeclampsia, which provides plausible evidence that increased oxidative stress in the intrauterine environment is likely a mechanism to induce aberrant histone modification in fetal endothelial cells which may have a significant impact on fetal programming in preeclampsia.","Sheng, Wenji; Gu, Yang; Chu, Xiaodan; Morgan, John A; Cooper, Danielle B; Lewis, David F; McCathran, Charles E; Wang, Yuping",J. cell. physiol,120,20

Our empirical analysis applies the ordinal regression model (ordered logit model) that takes both the week and regional factors into consideration to control for potential time effects and time-invariant confounders varying across regions. The results show that government aid only mitigates the psychological symptoms for the group in non-urban areas, with no significant impacts on the urban group. On the other hand, the AA working-age group experiences similar or more favorable mental health than other ethnic groups, while government aid does not alleviate the mental pressure for the AA group.

METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective study during the French coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurologic manifestations were eligible. RESULTS: We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations from 46 centres in France. Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (53-72) years and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in 102 patients (45.2%). The most common neurologic diseases were COVID-19-associated encephalopathy (67/222, 30.2%), acute ischaemic cerebrovascular syndrome (57/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21/222, 9.5%) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (15/222, 6.8%). Neurologic manifestations appeared after the first COVID-19 symptoms with a median (IQR) delay of 6 (3-8) days in COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, 7 (5-10) days in encephalitis, 12 (7-18) days in acute ischaemic cerebrovascular syndrome and 18 (15-28) days in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 magnetic resonance imaging (70.7%). Among patients with acute ischaemic cerebrovascular syndrome, 13 (22.8%) of 57 had multiterritory ischaemic strokes, with large vessel thrombosis in 16 (28.1%) of 57. Brain magnetic resonance imaging of encephalitis patients showed heterogeneous acute nonvascular lesions in 14 (66.7%) of 21. Cerebrospinal fluid of 97 patients (43.7%) was analysed, with pleocytosis found in 18 patients (18.6%) and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result in two patients with encephalitis.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper to investigate whether frailty is associated with all-cause mortality in older hospital inpatients, with COVID-19. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Secondary care acute hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included are 677 consecutive inpatients aged 65 years and over. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association of frailty with mortality. Frailty was assessed at baseline, according to the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), where higher categories indicate worse frailty. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, previous admissions and acute illness severity. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty-four patients were classified according to CFS. Two hundred and seventy-one died, during a mean follow-up of 34.3 days. Worse frailty at baseline was associated with increased mortality risk, even after full adjustment (P = 0.004). Patients with CFS 4 and CFS 5 had non-significant increased mortality risks, compared to those with CFS 1-3. Patients with CFS 6 had a 2.13-fold (95% CI 1.34-3.38) and those with CFS 7-9 had a 1.79-fold (95% CI 1.12-2.88) increased mortality risk, compared to those with CFS 1-3 (P = 0.001 and 0.016, respectively). Older age, male sex and acute illness severity were also associated with increased mortality risk.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to two tertiary care centers between March 15 and May 15, 2020, with a diagnosis of COVID-19. From a common database prepared for COVID-19, we retrieved the relevant data and compared the clinical findings and outcomes of PCR-positive patients with those of PCR-negative cases who had been diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical and radiographic findings. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients were included in the analysis, of which 126 (36.1%) were PCR-negative. PCR-negative patients were younger (54.6 ± 20.8 vs. 60.8 ± 18.9 years, P = .009) but were similar to PCR-positive patients in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms. They had higher lymphocyte counts (1519 ± 868 vs. 1331 ± 737/mm3, P = .02) and less frequently presented with bilateral radiographic findings (68.3% vs. 79.4%, P = .046) than PCR-positive patients.

In this research, we investigate a way to crack visual CAPTCHA tests by an automated deep learning based solution. The goal of this research is to investigate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the CAPTCHA generator systems; hence, developing more robust CAPTCHAs, without taking the risks of manual try and fail efforts. We develop a Convolutional Neural Network called Deep-CAPTCHA to achieve this goal. The proposed platform is able to investigate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs. To train and develop an efficient model, we have generated a dataset of 500,000 CAPTCHAs to train our model. In this paper, we present our customised deep neural network model, we review the research gaps, the existing challenges, and the solutions to cope with the issues. Our network's cracking accuracy leads to a high rate of 98.94% and 98.31% for the numerical and the alpha-numerical test datasets, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews with hoteliers were conducted to unveil their dynamic capabilities amid the pandemic as regard adjustments and performance of self-service technology (SST)-based strategies. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings: Data analysis revealed four types of dynamic capabilities (i.e. sensing, learning, integrating and coordinating capabilities). Equipped with these capabilities, hotels made minor adjustments to their SST strategies. In general, during an economic downturn, hotels refrained from introducing new SSTs. SSTs introduced before the pandemic were used more frequently and received enhanced customer feedback. The findings further revealed that the factors influencing hotels’ application of SSTs before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 remained similar. Originality/value: This is the first research integrating CP, dynamic capabilities and strategic management process to explain how hotels adjust technological strategies to recover in a suddenly changed environment. Such a framework enables scholars and practitioners from content-oriented and process-oriented perspectives to make quick but sound strategic management decisions in adapting to turbulent environments. This timely study enriches the expertise of using technology as a recovery strategy and contributes to future research on the practical application of SSTs and crisis management. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Liu, C.; Yang, J.",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,120,16

The first case of COVID-19 was declared in Togo on March 5. Two months later, few data were available to describe the circulation of the new coronavirus in the country. OBJECTIVE: This survey aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations in Lomé. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 23, 2020, to May 8, 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: health care, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swabs for direct detection through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and blood for antibody detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. RESULTS: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included, and 71.6% (n = 684) were men. Approximately 22.1% (n = 212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n = 196) were from the police sector, and 38.7% (n = 370) were from the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR test result at the time of recruitment, and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n = 15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk populations in Lomé was relatively low and could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government. Therefore, we recommend targeted screening.","Halatoko, Wemboo Afiwa; Konu, Yao Rodion; Gbeasor-Komlanvi, Fifonsi Adjidossi; Sadio, Arnold Junior; Tchankoni, Martin Kouame; Komlanvi, Koffi Segbeaya; Salou, Mounerou; Dorkenoo, Ameyo Monique; Maman, Issaka; Agbobli, Amétépé; Wateba, Majesté Ihou; Adjoh, Komi Séraphin; Goeh-Akue, Edem; Kao, Yem-Bla; Kpeto, Innocent; Pana, Paul; Kinde-Sossou, Rebecca; Tamekloe, Agbeko; Nayo-Apétsianyi, Josée; Assane, Simon-Pierre Hamadi; Prine-David, Mireille; Awoussi, Sossinou Marcel; Djibril, Mohaman; Mijiyawa, Moustafa; Dagnra, Anoumou Claver; Ekouevi, Didier Koumavi",PLoS One,120,16

We evaluated the impact of two aerosol boxes (an early-generation box and a latest-generation box) on intubations in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 with an in-situ simulation crossover study. The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society coronavirus disease 2019 airway management guidelines. The primary outcome was intubation time; secondary outcomes included first-pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment. All intubations were performed by specialist (consultant) anaesthetists and video recorded. Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations. Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box (median (IQR [range]) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6])s vs. 82.1 (45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0])s p = 0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4 (43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2])s, p = 0.008). No intubations without a box took more than 1 min, whereas 14 (58%) intubations with a box took over 1 min and 4 (17%) took over 2 min (including one failure). Without an aerosol box, all anaesthetists obtained first-pass success. With the early-generation and latest-generation boxes, 9 (75%) and 10 (83%) participants obtained first-pass success, respectively. One breach of personal protective equipment occurred using the early-generation box and seven breaches occurred using the latest-generation box. Aerosol boxes may increase intubation times and therefore expose patients to the risk of hypoxia. They may cause damage to conventional personal protective equipment and therefore place clinicians at risk of infection.

However, when it comes to protecting those at the highest risk of dying from COVID19, their needs and vulnerabilities need to be considered more broadly than just in terms of the individual protection that vaccination will afford them. Likewise, when considering whether to prioritize health care workers for the vaccine, their crucial role in keeping the health care system operational, and right to a safe work environment need to be factored in.

We performed a public health response to prevent further illness and understand Hia carriage in the community. METHODS: We collected oropharyngeal (OP) samples community-wide from untreated individuals to evaluate baseline carriage. Risk factor data was collected by interview. To prevent additional illness, we offered prophylactic rifampin to individuals in contact with iHia patients (contacts) and to all children aged <10 years. OP samples were collected again eight weeks post-rifampin distribution. Samples were tested using real-time PCR and culture. RESULTS: At baseline, Hia was carried by 4/27 (14.8%) contacts and 7/364 (1.9%) non-contacts (p<0.01). Contacts aged <10 years were more likely to carry Hia at any timepoint (11/18, 61%) than contacts aged &#8805;10 years (3/34, 8.8%) or non-contacts aged <10 years (2/139, 1.4%) and &#8805;10 years (6/276, 2.2%)(p<0.001 for all).

It was determined that finding of a CXR score threshold value of 5 or above during hospitalization predicted a transfer to the ICU with 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the laboratory parameters (leukocyte, neutrophil, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, troponin, D-dimer, ferritin), and rate of transfer to ICU were found to be significantly higher in the group with a CXR score of 5 and above, compared to the group with CXR score below 5 (P &lt; .001 in each). CONCLUSION: Finding high CXR scores during hospitalization due to COVID-19 may act as a warning in terms of the severity of the disease. It may be beneficial to examine the chest X-ray images during hospitalization with utmost care and take these images into account.","Aydoğan Eroğlu, S.; Çagavi, Z.; Yıldız, T.; Karakurt, Z.",Turkish Thoracic Journal,120,26

METHODS: We used data from the IQVIA Total Patient Tracker to estimate the monthly number of patients dispensed antibiotic prescriptions from retail pharmacies in January 2017-May 2020. We averaged estimates from 2017-2019 and defined expected seasonal change as the average percent change from January to May 2017-2019. We calculated percentage point and volume changes in the number of patients dispensed antibiotics from January to May 2020 exceeding expected seasonal changes. We also calculated average percent change in number of patients dispensed antibiotics per month in 2017- 2019 versus 2020. Data were analyzed overall and by agent, class, patient age, state, and prescriber specialty. RESULTS: From January to May 2020, the number of patients dispensed antibiotic prescriptions decreased from 20.3 to 9.9 million, exceeding seasonally expected decreases by 33 percentage points and 6.6 million patients. The largest changes in 2017-2019 versus 2020 were observed in April (-39%) and May (-42%). The number of patients dispensed azithromycin increased from February to March 2020 then decreased. Overall, beyond-expected decreases were greatest among children (&#8804;19 years) and agents used for respiratory infections, dentistry, and surgical prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: From January 2020 to May 2020, the number of outpatients with antibiotic prescriptions decreased substantially more than would be expected due to seasonal trends alone, possibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures.","King, Laura M; Lovegrove, Maribeth C; Shehab, Nadine; Tsay, Sharon; Budnitz, Daniel S; Geller, Andrew I; Lind, Jennifer N; Roberts, Rebecca; Hicks, Lauri A; Kabbani, Sarah",Clin. infect. dis,120,24

Personal protective equipment has been mandatory for healthcare workers in order to contain the outbreak of pandemic disease. Mild neurological disturbances such as headache have been related to the extensive utilization of facemask. This study aims to examine headache variations related to the intensive utilization of facemask among a cohort of healthcare professionals in a setting of low-medium risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare providers from different hospital and clinics in Italy. Each participant completed a specifically designed self-administered questionnaire. Headache features and outcome measures' change from baseline were evaluated over a 4-month period, in which wearing facemask has become mandatory for Italian healthcare workers. RESULTS: A total of 400 healthcare providers completed the questionnaire, 383 of them met the inclusion criteria. The majority were doctors, with a mean age of 33.4 ± 9.2 years old. Among 166/383 subjects, who were headache free at baseline, 44 (26.5%) developed de novo headache. Furthermore, 217/383 reported a previous diagnosis of primary headache disorder: 137 were affected by migraine and 80 had tension-type headache. A proportion (31.3%) of these primary headache sufferers experienced worsening of their pre-existing headache disorder, mainly for migraine frequency and attack mean duration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the appearance of de novo associated facemask headache in previous headache-free subjects and an exacerbation of pre-existing primary headache disorders, mostly experienced by people with migraine disease.","Rapisarda, Laura; Trimboli, Michele; Fortunato, Francesco; De Martino, Antonio; Marsico, Oreste; Demonte, Giulio; Augimeri, Antonio; Labate, Angelo; Gambardella, Antonio",Neurol Sci,120,5

The mechanisms behind this association remain elusive.METHODSWe evaluated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viremia, disease outcome, and inflammatory and proteomic profiles in a cohort of COVID-19 emergency department participants. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR-based platform. Proteomic data were generated with Proximity Extension Assay using the Olink platform.RESULTSThis study included 300 participants with nucleic acid test-confirmed COVID-19. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 viremia levels at the time of presentation predicted adverse disease outcomes, with an adjusted OR of 10.6 (95% CI 4.4-25.5, P < 0.001) for severe disease (mechanical ventilation and/or 28-day mortality) and 3.9 (95% CI 1.5-10.1, P = 0.006) for 28-day mortality. Proteomic analyses revealed prominent proteomic pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, including upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, CTSL, FURIN), heightened markers of tissue damage to the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and endothelium/vasculature, and alterations in coagulation pathways.CONCLUSIONThese results highlight the cascade of vascular and tissue damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia that underlies its ability to predict COVID-19 disease outcomes.FUNDINGMark and Lisa Schwartz; the National Institutes of Health (U19AI082630); the American Lung Association; the Executive Committee on Research at Massachusetts General Hospital; the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; Arthur, Sandra, and Sarah Irving for the David P.

Individuals with substance use disorder have a higher risk of infection and may suffer from more severe forms of the disease. Our goal is to investigate the prevalence of risk factors for COVID-19 severity in individuals with different substance use and explore whether specific types of substance are potentially associated with more clinical risk factors which could increase morbimortality in this population. The sample included 821 men hospitalized at an inpatient Addiction unit (305 alcohol users, 233 cocaine/crack users, and 283 multiusers). Data were collected using the Addiction Severity Index version 6. The most prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 severity observed in our sample were: smoking (82.5%), arterial hypertension (26.6%), respiratory problems (23.4%), and history of homelessness (25.1%). Arterial hypertension and cirrhosis occurred more frequently among alcohol users. Multiusers lived in the streets longer and had a higher prevalence of HIV than alcohol users. Overall, 28% of the sample had three or more risk factors. The frequency of risk factors was high and this scenario suggests that these individuals could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 prognosis. Therefore, prevention strategies directed at specific characteristics of substance users merit attention during the pandemic.","Benzano, Daniela; Ornell, Felipe; Schuch, Jaqueline Bohrer; Pechansky, Flavio; Sordi, Anne Orgler; von Diemen, Lisia; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim",Psychiatry Res,120,26

COVID-19 transmits mainly through respiratory droplets and close contacts, causing cluster infections. The symptoms are dominantly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, and can be complicated with tiredness, sore throat, and headache. A few patients have symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose, and diarrhea. The severe disease can progress rapidly into the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Next-generation sequencing (NGS) are the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Chest imaging is used for cross validation. Chest CT is highly recommended as the preferred imaging diagnosis method for COVID-19 due to its high density and high spatial resolution. The common CT manifestation of COVID-19 includes multiple segmental ground glass opacities (GGOs) distributed dominantly in extrapulmonary/subpleural zones and along bronchovascular bundles with crazy paving sign and interlobular septal thickening and consolidation. Pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rarely seen. In CT imaging, COVID-19 manifests differently in its various stages including the early stage, the progression (consolidation) stage, and the absorption stage. In its early stage, it manifests as scattered flaky GGOs in various sizes, dominated by peripheral pulmonary zone/subpleural distributions. In the progression state, GGOs increase in number and/or size, and lung consolidations may become visible. The main manifestation in the absorption stage is interstitial change of both lungs, such as fibrous cords and reticular opacities. Differentiation between COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral pneumonias are also analyzed. Thus, CT examination can help reduce false negatives of nucleic acid tests.","Zheng, Qiuting; Lu, Yibo; Lure, Fleming; Jaeger, Stefan; Lu, Puxuan",J Xray Sci Technol,120,10

The teamwork literature has struggled to develop strategies that promote effective adaptive behaviours among health care teams. In part, this challenge stems from the fact that truly collective adaptive behaviour requires members of the teams to abandon the human urge to act self-sufficiently. Nature contains striking examples of collective behaviour as seen in social insects, fish and bird colonies. This collective behaviour is known as Swarm Intelligence (SI). SI remains poorly described in the health care team literature and its potential benefits hidden. OBJECTIVE: In this cross-cutting edge paper, I explore the principles of SI as they pertain to systemic or collective adaptation in human teams. In particular, I consider the principles of trace-based communication and collective self-healing and what they might offer to team adaptation researchers in medical education. RESULTS: From a SI perspective, a solution to a problem emerges as a result of the collective action of the members of the swarm, not the individual action. This collective action is achieved via four principles: direct and indirect communication, awareness, self-determination and collective self-healing. Among those principles, trace-based communication and collective self-healing have been purposefully used by other industries to foster team adaptation. Trace-based communication relies on leaving 'traces' in the environment to drive the behaviour of others. Collective self-healing is the ability of the swarm to cope with failure and adapt to changes by permitting swarm members to be interchangeable. CONCLUSIONS: While allowing teams to rely on indirect communication and to be interchangeable might create discomfort to our ways of thinking, teams outside health care are demonstrating their value to advance human teamwork. SI offers a helpful analogy and a constructive language for thinking about team adaptation.","Cristancho, Sayra M",Med. educ,120,16

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, global infection rates have been on the rise with world leaders looking to slow and stop viral transmission. This study is looking at suburban cohabitation/familial infection to compare to similar studies from other countries. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of medical records was collected using the Connecticut Electronic Disease Surveillance System. METHODS: A total of 406 cases who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 from February to June 2020 were reviewed from three towns located in Connecticut, USA. Cohabitation infection rates were identified using the home addresses of those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test results, with the first documented case being the index case, and additional home members being the secondary cases. RESULTS: Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 126 of 406 household contacts (31%). Linear regression indicated positive relationship between cohabitation and age. CONCLUSIONS: The cohabitation infection attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than previously reported. Age of household contacts and spousal relationship to the index case are risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a household.","D039,; Onofrio, L E; Buono, F D; Cooper, M A R",Public Health,120,3

High levels of circulating cytokines were reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Neopterin produced by macrophages on stimulation with interferon-gamma, which is an important cytokine in the antiviral immune response, hence it can be used to predict the severity of disease in COVID-19 cases. In this study, it was aimed to determine the prognostic value of the neopterin for the prediction of severe disease in patients with COVID-19. This single-center, prospective study was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers. Severe and mild COVID-19 cases were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory findings as well as serum neopterin levels on hospital admission. To assess the prognostic utility of neopterin between the severe and mild COVID-19 groups, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The median serum neopterin level was four times higher in COVID-19 patients than the healthy controls (46 vs. 12 nmol/L; p < .001). The AUC value of serum neopterin was 0.914 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.97). The sensitivity and specificity of serum neopterin for the cut-off value of 90 nmol/L to identify severe COVID-19 cases were 100% and 76%, respectively. Serum neopterin levels on hospitalization were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 disease than mild COVID-19 patients. Neopterin levels can be used as an early prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 on admission.","Ozger, Hasan Selcuk; Dizbay, Murat; Corbacioglu, Seref Kerem; Aysert, Pinar; Demirbas, Zehra; Tunccan, Ozlem Guzel; Hizel, Kenan; Bozdayi, Gulendam; Caglar, Kayhan",J Med Virol,120,3

The strategy to protect patients and healthcare workers from infection by SARS-CoV-2 in surgical departments has needed step-by-step development. Based on the evaluation of international recommendations and guidelines, as well as personal experiences in a clinical 'hot spot' and in a 450-bed surgical clinic, an adapted surgical site infection (SSI) prevention checklist was needed to develop concise instructions, which described roles and responsibilities of healthcare professionals that could be used for wider guidance in pandemic conditions. METHOD: Publications of COVID-19-related recommendations and guidelines, produced by health authorities and organizations, such as WHO, US-CDC, ECDC, the American College of Surgery and the Robert Koch Institute, were retrieved, assessed and referenced up to 31st January 2020. Additionally, clinical personal experiences in Germany were evaluated and considered. RESULTS: Part 1 of this guidance summarizes the experience of a tertiary care, surgical centre which utilized redundant hospital buildings for immediate spatial separation in a 'hot spot' COVID-19 area. Part 2 outlines the successful screening and isolation strategy in a surgical clinic in a region of Germany with outbreaks in surrounding medical centres. Part 3 provides the synopsis of personal experiences and international recommendations suggested for implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Understanding of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2-related epidemiology, is constantly and rapidly changing, requiring continuous adaptation and re-evaluation of recommendations. Established national and local guidelines for continuation of surgical services and prevention of SSI require ongoing scrutiny and focused implementation. This manuscript presents a core facility checklist to support medical institutions to continue their clinical and surgical work during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Assadian, O; Golling, M; Krüger, C M; Leaper, D; Mutters, N T; Roth, B; Kramer, A",J. hosp. infect,120,22

METHODS: Patients over 18 who were evaluated for COVID-19 during the period from April 1, to April 30, 2020 were retrospectively scanned. Patients with at least 1 positive PCR test result were as assigned to Group 1 while patients with negative test results were assigned to Group 2. The LMR ratio was calculated by dividing the lymphocyte value by that of MPV. The relationship between LMR, severity of patients' CT findings and 28-day mortality was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 938 patients were included in the study. It was observed that the lymphocyte and LMR levels were significantly different in those who died within 28 days (p < 0.001, p &#8804; 0.001). In the ROC analysis for the LMR level, the area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.737 (95% CI 0.639â0.834).

We studied the physiologic effects of N95 FFR use in a cohort of gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopies. METHODS: Data collection and comparisons included (1) symptoms and change in vital signs in 12 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy for 60 minutes while wearing a surgical mask (SM) and faceshield (FS); N95 FFR, SM, and FS; and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and (2) respiratory belt plethysmography and continuous electrocardiographic frequency-based heart rate (HR) variability indices including very low frequency power (measures intracardiac sympathetic tone) and low frequency to high frequency ratios (intracardiac sympathetic to vagal ratio) in 11 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy while wearing an SM (15 minutes), N95 FFR and SM (60 minutes), and SM (15 minutes) in rapid sequence. RESULTS: Ten of 12 gastroenterologists (83%) reported symptoms with N95 FFR use, most commonly breathing difficulty, frustration, fatigue, and headache. Nine of these gastroenterologists (75%) had associated significant HR elevation. Respiratory peak to trough measurement showed a significant increase (F(2) = 7.543, P = .004) during the N95 FFR stage, which resolved after removal of the N95 FFR. Although not statistically different, all gastroenterologists showed a decrease in sympathetic to vagal ratios and an increase in intracardiac sympathetic effects in the N95 FFR stage.

Recent studies have shown that two human proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, play a key role in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we perform virtual screening of 14010 phytochemicals produced by Indian medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. We built a homology model of TMPRSS2 as an experimentally determined structure is not available. AutoDock Vina was used to perform molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 model structure and cathepsin L crystal structure. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent protein-ligand interactions were used as an additional filter to identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. We have identified 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. The top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are Edgeworoside C, Adlumidine and Qingdainone, and of cathepsin L is Ararobinol. Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitors have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine. Further in vitro and in vivo testing is needed before clinical trials of the promising phytochemical inhibitors identified here.","Vivek-Ananth, R.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is developed from live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, which is a microorganism found in a cow. Discovered by Dr. Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin since 1921, the BCG has served as a protection against tuberculosis and its complications. It is noticeable that countries which use mandatory BCG vaccination approach had lower COVID-19 infection and death rate. Current review aims to clarify this issue through epidemiological illustration of correlation between national BCG immunization and COVID-19 mortality, in addition to biological background of BCG-induced immunity Epidemiological data shows that universal BCG policy countries have lower median mortality rate compare to countries with past universal BCG policy and non-mass immunization BCG. (18 May 2020). Still, the links between BCG vaccination and better COVID-19 situation in certain countries are unclear, and more data on actual infection rate using SAR-CoV-2 antibody testing in large population sample is crucial for disease spreading comparison. Two immunological mechanisms, heterologous effects of adaptive immunity and trained innate immunity which induced by BCG vaccination, may explain host tolerance against COVID-19 infection, however, there is no direct evidence to support this biological background. Clinical trials related to BCG vaccination against COVID-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, BCG must not be recommended for COVID-19 prevention, although, this should not be absolute contraindication. Risk of local and systemic complications from the vaccine should be informed to individual, who request BCG immunization.","Charoenlap, Suvanee; Piromsopa, Krerk; Charoenlap, Chris",Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,120,24

Current tools for taxonomic assignment from sequencing reads based on alignment or alignment-free k-mer approaches may not perform optimally in cases where the sequences diverge significantly from the reference sequences. Furthermore, many tools may not incorporate the genomic coverage of assigned reads as part of overall likelihood of a correct taxonomic assignment for a sample. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe the development of a pipeline that incorporates a multi-task learning model based on convolutional neural network (MT-CNN) and a Bayesian ranking approach to identify and rank the most likely human virus from sequence reads. For taxonomic assignment of reads, the MT-CNN model outperformed Kraken 2, Centrifuge, and Bowtie 2 on reads generated from simulated divergent HIV-1 genomes and was more sensitive in identifying SARS as the closest relation in four RNA sequencing datasets for SARS-CoV-2 virus. For genomic region assignment of assigned reads, the MT-CNN model performed competitively compared with Bowtie 2 and the region assignments were used for estimation of genomic coverage that was incorporated into a naïve Bayesian network together with the proportion of taxonomic assignments to rank the likelihood of candidate human viruses from sequence data. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a pipeline that combines a novel MT-CNN model that is able to identify viruses with divergent sequences together with assignment of the genomic region, with a Bayesian approach to ranking of taxonomic assignments by taking into account both the number of assigned reads and genomic coverage.

However, there have not been any effective drugs for treatment, with symptomatic treatment and prevention prevailing. The treatment plans of severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome(MERS) are often used for reference in clinic. The advantages of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in treating SARS and MERS are that it can intervene and block the progression of disease in early stage, significantly reduce symptoms, shorten the treatment duration of patients, reduce complications and side effects caused by hormone therapy. The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) belongs to the category of TCM epidemic diseases. Chinese patent medicines and prescriptions in medical observation and clinical treatment were recommended in the &quot;pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection&quot;(trial version fifth) of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Qingfei Paidu Decotion was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. TCM shows good clinical efficacy and great potential in the treatment of COVID-19. Previous studies of TCM have shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity, providing a variety of sources for the discovery of new antiviral drugs. In this paper, we reviewed traditional Chinese medicines and its active ingredients in the hope of bringing novel inspirations to the drug screening and clinical treatment for COVID-19.","Zhang, Yu-Shi; Cong, Wei-Hong; Zhang, Jing-Jing; Guo, Fei-Fei; Li, Hong-Mei",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,120,29

To this purpose, we analyzed twenty popular weekly routes and the potential impact of sex and relationship status (single versus coupled) on the reported level of spatial-social activity during the quarantine in Russia between March and June 2020 (N = 492). Our study revealed a significant difference between men's and women's mobility: men, in general, tend to exhibit substantially higher spatial activity. The results have shown that individuals living on their own have more social interactions with friends and exhibit more profound spatial mobility via public transport. On the other hand, spatial activity of coupled individuals of both sexes were mostly devoted to solving a list of economic and matrimonial tasks. At the same time, men already cohabiting with a partner leave their homes for dating purposes more frequently than single men and women. We interpret these findings in the sense that both individual and sex-specific differences in observed sociality could be a result of a fine-tuned adaptive populational response to a contemporary virus threat, predominantly rooted in the evolution of behavioral strategies in the reproductive and economic spheres of each sex. Indeed, unlike women, coupled men have been preserving highly risky and intense social behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Semenova, Olga; Apalkova, Julia; Butovskaya, Marina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),120,1

TRPA1 and TRPV1 induce inflammation and play a key role in the physiology of almost all organs. They may augment sensory or vagal nerve discharges to evoke pain and several symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, nasal obstruction, vomiting, diarrhea, and, at least partly, sudden and severe loss of smell and taste. TRPA1 can be activated by reactive oxygen species and may therefore be up-regulated in COVID-19. TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels can be activated by pungent compounds including many nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) (Nrf2)-interacting foods leading to channel desensitization. Interactions between Nrf2-associated nutrients and TRPA1/TRPV1 may be partly responsible for the severity of some of the COVID-19 symptoms. The regulation by Nrf2 of TRPA1/TRPV1 is still unclear, but suggested from very limited clinical evidence. In COVID-19, it is proposed that rapid desensitization of TRAP1/TRPV1 by some ingredients in foods could reduce symptom severity and provide new therapeutic strategies.","Bousquet, Jean; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Zuberbier, Torsten; Mullol, Joaquim; Blain, Hubert; Cristol, Jean-Paul; De La Torre, Rafael; Pizarro Lozano, Nieves; Le Moing, Vincent; Bedbrook, Anna; Agache, Ioana; Akdis, Cezmi A; Canonica, G Walter; Cruz, Alvaro A; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Fonseca, Joao A; Fonseca, Susana; Gemicioglu, Bilun; Haahtela, Tari; Iaccarino, Guido; Ivancevich, Juan Carlos; Jutel, Marek; Klimek, Ludger; Kraxner, Helga; Kuna, Piotr; Larenas-Linnemann, Désirée E; Martineau, Adrian; Melén, Erik; Okamoto, Yoshitaka; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Pfaar, Oliver; Regateiro, Frederico S; Reynes, Jacques; Rolland, Yves; Rouadi, Philip W; Samolinski, Boleslaw; Sheikh, Aziz; Toppila-Salmi, Sanna; Valiulis, Arunas; Choi, Hak-Jong; Kim, Hyun Ju; Anto, Josep M",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,120,16

This global pandemic is now calling for efforts to develop more effective COVID-19 therapies. Here we use a host-directed approach, which focuses on cellular responses to diverse small-molecule treatments, to identify potentially effective drugs for COVID-19. This framework looks at the ability of compounds to elicit a similar transcriptional response to IFN-ß, a type I interferon that fails to be induced at notable levels in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By correlating the perturbation profiles of ~3,000 small molecules with a high-quality signature of IFN-ß-responsive genes in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells, our analysis revealed four candidate COVID-19 compounds, namely homoharringtonine, narciclasine, anisomycin, and emetine. We experimentally confirmed that the predicted compounds significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells at nanomolar, relatively non-toxic concentrations, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 165.7 nM, 16.5 nM, and 31.4 nM for homoharringtonine, narciclasine, and anisomycin, respectively.

However, the roughened surface does not always maintain stable fixation over a long period. In this study, a simple heat treatment at 600°C was performed on a commercially available dental Ti implant with grit-blasting/acid-etching, and its effect on mineralization capacity was assessed by examining apatite formation in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The as-purchased implant displayed a moderately roughened surface at the micrometer scale. Its surface was composed of titanium hydride accompanied by a small amount of alumina particles derived from the grit-blasting. Heat treatment transformed the titanium hydride into rutile without evidently changing the surface morphology. The immersion in SBF revealed that apatite formed on the heated implant at 7 days. Furthermore, apatite formed on the Ti rod surface within 1 day when the metal was subjected to acid and heat treatment without blasting. These indicate that apatite formation was conferred on the commercially available dental implant by simple heat treatment, although its induction period was slightly affected by alumina particles remaining on the implant surface. The heat-treated implant should achieve stronger and more stable bone bonding due to its apatite formation.","Ogura, Ayano; Yamaguchi, Seiji; Le, Phuc Thi Minh; Yamamoto, Kayoko; Omori, Michi; Inoue, Kazuya; Kato-Kogoe, Nahoko; Nakajima, Yoichiro; Nakano, Hiroyuki; Ueno, Takaaki; Yamada, Tomohiro; Mori, Yoshihide",J. biomed. mater. res.

This review provides an in-depth summary of the available information about SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding disease (also known as COVID-19), with a multi-disciplinary approach. After the paper introduction, the first section treats the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the medical implications of the infection, and the human susceptivity. Great attention is devoted to the factor affecting the infection routes, distinguishing among the possible human-to-human, environmental-to-human, and pollution-to-human transmission mechanisms. The second section is devoted to reporting the impact of SARS-CoV-2 not only on the healthcare systems but also on the economy and society. The third section is devoted to non-pharmaceutical behaviours against COVID-19. In this context, this review section presents an analysis of the European second wave allowing not only to focalize the importance of some restrictions, but also the relevance of social acceptance of some measures. The data reassumed in this work are very useful for interdisciplinary researchers that work in a team to find the basic available information about all the aspects connected with this pandemic (from virus diffusion mechanism to health information, from economic and social impacts to measures to reduce the pandemic spread), with great attention to social acceptance of restriction measures and of vaccines (that currently results to be insufficient to achieve community immunity). Then, this review paper highlights the fundamental role of the trans-multi-disciplinary research that is devoted not only to understand the basics of the pandemic to propose solutions but has also the commitment to find strategies to increase population resilience. For this aim, the authors strongly suggest the establishment of an international health-care trans-multi-disciplinary workforce devoted to investigate, mitigate, and control also future viral events.","Anand, Uttpal; Cabreros, Carlo; Mal, Joyabrata; Ballesteros, Florencio; Sillanpää, Mika; Tripathi, Vijay; Bontempi, Elza",Environ Res,120,20

These suggestions are often based on analogy, the hypothesis of their supposed effectiveness for COVID-19. It can be assumed that a brake on the development of a drug specific for coronavirus disease is a poor knowledge of the pathogenesis of virus invasion in the body's adhesives and the development of complications.

This paper presents a pilot investigation on the geochemical transformation of DNTs affected by historical wastewater spillage from a typical TNT production company in Northwest China. In the horizontal direction, DNTs diffused from the evaporation pond to the surrounding area of the site, and the concentration of DNTs in the evaporation pond surface soil exceeded 1000 mg/kg. The horizontal distribution of DNTs in the site showed a migration trend to the east and south of evaporation, which was consistent with the terrain of high northwest and low southeast of the site. Due to the high water solubility of pollutants, water flow is the main driving force for the horizontal distribution of DNTs. In the vertical direction, the concentration of pollutants gradually increased with the depth of the soil. DNTs are mainly adsorbed in the third layer (6.0-8.0 m). It can be seen that the accumulation of the 2,4-DNTs-3-SO3- is obviously larger than that of the 2,4-DNTs-5-SO3-, which may be related to the steric hindrance effect of sulfonic acid groups in the two isomers. Results showed DNTs distribution strongly linked to soil physicochemical properties and the migration of DNTs in soil exhibited obvious heterogeneity in time and space. The carcinogenic risks in surface soil (0-1.5 m) and lower soil (1.5-6.0 m, 6.0-8.0 m) are all higher than 1â10-6; non-carcinogenic risk surface soil (0-1.5 m) is 4.011â10, which is greater than 1, indicating that they may cause certain harm to the human body.

Une nouvelle approche a été proposée par Riley et al. en 2020 pour répondre aux enjeux majeurs du développement d’un modèle de prédiction : précision des estimations et contrôle de l’optimisme sur les performances de prédiction. Nous rapportons ici l’application de cette approche pour le développement d’un modèle de prédiction combinant des facteurs cliniques, biologiques et d’imagerie pour prédire la survenue d’une aggravation d’une forme légère de COVID-19 chez des patients ayant des résultats d’imagerie thoracique compatibles ou typiques de la COVID-19. Méthodes La stratégie de modélisation envisagée était un modèle de régression logistique avec une sélection a priori de facteurs identifiés dans la littérature. Comme dans la règle empirique, la nouvelle approche nécessite de préciser l’incidence de l’événement à prédire et le nombre de paramètres envisagés dans le modèle de prédiction. La taille d’étude déterminée par cette approche doit satisfaire quatre critères : précision souhaitée pour l’incidence de l’événement ; précision souhaitée pour les prédictions individuelles (sous la forme d’un pourcentage d’erreur absolu moyen) ; niveau maximal souhaité de sur-ajustement aux données (facteur de réduction minimal) et d’optimisme (surestimation maximale du R2 de Nagelkerke). Pour les deux derniers critères, le calcul requiert de préciser le R2 de Cox–Snell qui, en l’absence d’éléments probants dans la littérature, peut être déterminé en faisant une hypothèse sur le niveau de performance attendu du modèle de prédiction en termes de pourcentage de la variation totale observée dans les données expliqué par le modèle. Résultats L’incidence de l’évènement à prédire a été fixée à 20 % selon les données de la littérature. Une revue de la littérature sur les modèles de prédiction développés dans le contexte d’infection à COVID-19 nous a conduits à envisager 16 paramètres dans le modèle. Nous avons suivi les recommandations des auteurs pour définir la précision souhaitée pour l’incidence d’événement (±0,05), le pourcentage d’erreur absolu moyen (5 %), le facteur de réduction minimal (3 0,9) et la surestimation maximale du critère de performance (£ 0,05). Nous avons fait varier le pourcentage de la variation totale observée dans les données expliqué par le modèle entre 10 et 50 %. Pour satisfaire l’ensemble des critères, la taille d’étude requise variait entre 587 et 2205 patients. Nous avons retenu l’hypothèse d’un pourcentage de variance expliqué de 25 % conduisant à l’inclusion de 829 patients pour le développement du modèle. Conclusion La nouvelle approche de calcul de taille d’étude permet de considérer dès la conception, des éléments majeurs qui favorisent le développement d’un modèle de prédiction clinique de qualité, en particulier la précision des probabilités individuelles de survenue de l’événement et le contrôle de l’optimisme. En contrepartie, elle nécessite une expertise statistique plus poussée que pour la règle empirique. Néanmoins, son application est possible même dans un délai court et devrait donc être systématiquement envisagée dans les études de développement d’un modèle de prédiction clinique.","Asselineau, J.; Duperron, M.; Zysman, M.; Laurent, F.; Ben-Lala, I.; Berger, P.; Thiébaut, R.; Frison, E.",Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,120,20

METHODS: Adult patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms potentially related to pneumonia, healthy volunteers and clinical cases from online accessible databases were evaluated. The patients underwent a clinical-epidemiological questionnaire and a LUS acquisition, following a 14-zone protocol. For each zone, a Pneumonia score from 0 to 4 was assigned by the algorithm and by an expert operator (kept blind with respect to the algorithm results) on the basis of the identified imaging signs and the patient Lung Staging was derived as the highest observed score. The output of the operator was considered as the ground truth. The algorithm calculated also the COVID Index by combining the automatically identified LUS markers with the questionnaire answers and compared with the nasopharyngeal swab results. RESULTS: Overall, 556 patients were analysed. A high agreement between the algorithm assignments and the expert operator evaluations was observed, both for Pneumonia Score and Lung Staging, with the latter having sensitivity and specificity over 92% both in the discrimination between healthy/sick patients and between sick patients with mild/severe pneumonia. Regarding the COVID Index, an area under the curve of 0.826 was observed for the classification of patients with/without SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The proposed methodology allowed the identification and staging of patients suffering from pneumonia with high accuracy. Moreover, it provided the probability of being infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Lombardi, Fiorella Anna; Franchini, Roberto; Morello, Rocco; Casciaro, Ernesto; Ianniello, Stefania; Serra, Maurizio; Satriano, Francesco; Mojoli, Francesco; Mongodi, Silvia; Pignatelli, Daniela; Di Paola, Marco; Casciaro, Sergio",Respir Med,120,24

IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. A failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in the lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as with seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection. Rather, it is suggested to include avidity determination into the optimization of vaccination protocols and to try to achieve high avidity IgG directed towards SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Avidity determination also might be useful to control for truly protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2 in individual cases.","Bauer, Georg",Int J Infect Dis,120,9

This species is endemic to Brazil and is currently critically endangered due to its habitat destruction. The genetic basis underlying adaptive traits of New World monkeys has been a subject of interest to several investigators, with significant concern about genes related to the immune system. In the absence of a reference genome, RNA-seq and de novo transcriptome assembly have proved to be valuable genetic procedures for accessing gene sequences and testing evolutionary hypotheses. We present here a first report on the sequencing, assembly, annotation and adaptive selection analysis for thousands of transcripts of B. arachnoides from two different samples, corresponding to 13 different blood cells and fibroblasts. We assembled 284,283 transcripts with N50 of 2,940 bp, with a high rate of complete transcripts, with a median high scoring pair coverage of 88.2%, including low expressed transcripts, accounting for 72.3% of complete BUSCOs. We could predict and extract 81,400 coding sequences with 79.8% of significant BLAST hit against the Euarchontoglires SwissProt dataset. Of these 64,929 sequences, 34,084 were considered homologous to Supraprimate proteins, and of the remaining sequences (30,845), 94% were associated with a protein domain or a KEGG Orthology group, indicating potentially novel or specific protein-coding genes of B. arachnoides. We use the predicted protein sequences to perform a comparative analysis with 10 other primates. This analysis revealed, for the first time in an Atelid species, an expansion of APOBEC3G, extending this knowledge to all NWM families. Using a branch-site model, we searched for evidence of positive selection in 4,533 orthologous sets. This evolutionary analysis revealed 132 amino acid sites in 30 genes potentially evolving under positive selection, shedding light on primate genome evolution. These genes belonged to a wide variety of categories, including those encoding the innate immune system proteins (APOBEC3G, OAS2, and CEACAM1) among others related to the immune response. This work generated a set of thousands of complete sequences that can be used in other studies on molecular evolution and may help to unveil the evolution of primate genes. Still, further functional studies are required to provide an understanding of the underlying evolutionary forces modeling the primate genome.","Moreira, Daniel A.; Lamarca, Alessandra P.; Soares, Rafael Ferreira; Coelho, Ana M.

Given the transformations in teaching modalities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with vocal self-perception during the pandemic and to investigate the ability of selected variables to predict changes in vocal self-perception in teachers with professional vocal demands during the investigated period. STUDY DESIGN: . Cross-sectional survey. METHOD: . A total of 1,126 teachers of both genders (ages 19 to 78 years, average 43.23 years) who were participating in remote teaching activities using their voice answered the online questionnaire. To characterize vocal changes (improvement, worsening or no change), the teachers’ self-assessment of their voice quality was considered; the association between the variables reported in the questionnaire and vocal changes was analyzed, as was the capacity of these variables for predicting voice changes. RESULTS: . Most of the teachers worked at a public school, reported having no previous voice changes or difficulties with their voice during online classes and indicated that they began to use their voice less often and with reduced intensity during the pandemic. Vocal demands were divided between teaching synchronous online classes, recording video lessons and participating in online meetings. Several variables were associated with voice improvement and worsening, and some had the capacity to predict voice changes: improvement in voice quality was associated with working in a public school or as an autonomous teacher, reduced voice use and, to a lesser extent, participating in online meetings, certain vocal habits and a reduction in vocal symptoms; worsening voice quality was associated with working in a private school, increased voice use, using the voice at a higher intensity, difficulty with the voice in online classes, vocal habits and vocal symptoms. CONCLUSION: . The context of remote education has changed the way teachers communicate during classes, and monitoring is necessary to ensure that necessary adaptations are made to preserve the voice and ensure effective communication.","Nemr, Katia; Simões-Zenari, Marcia; Cologis, Vanessa Cássia de Almeida; Martins, Glauciene Amaral; Saito, Isabele Tiemi; Gonçalves, Renata da Silva",J Voice,120,20

While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals present respiratory complications with possible serious lung damage. There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet, though a number are under evaluation, including experimental antivirals. Sofosbuvir, the clinically approved anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug, is also capable of suppressing other families of positive-strand RNA viruses; Flaviviridae and Togaviridae. Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses with conserved polymerase, so SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is very likely to be effectively inhibited by sofosbuvir. More importantly, sofosbuvir is safe and well tolerated at 400 mg daily in a 24 week therapeutic regimen.

STUDY DESIGN English-speaking pregnant women aged 18 years or older who received prenatal care at a safety net hospital participated in qualitative interviews. Interview topics included attitudes toward vaccinations in general and toward influenza and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination in pregnancy. Participants were also queried regarding sources of vaccine information, and were asked to provide feedback on specific messages regarding maternal vaccination. RESULTS Twenty-eight pregnant women participated in interviews. Participant age ranged from 18 to 40 years old; 64% were insured through Medicaid. All participants had positive attitudes toward routine vaccinations and had received vaccinations for themselves and their children. Attitudes were less favorable for influenza vaccines than other vaccines. Participants reported receiving vaccine information from multiple sources. Stories about vaccine harms worried participants, even when they did not trust the sources of negative information. All stated that their health care providers were the most trusted source of information. Participants felt that the most important messages to encourage maternal vaccination were that maternal vaccination protects the baby after birth and maternal vaccination is safe for both mother and baby. Participants were not motivated to vaccinate by messages about the severity of maternal disease. CONCLUSIONS Maternal vaccinations are important to protect pregnant women and infants from influenza and pertussis. Focusing on messages related to vaccine safety and protection of the infant are motivating to mothers, especially when delivered by trusted health care providers.","Fuss, Taylor L; Devera, Jean L; Pierre-Joseph, Natalie; Perkins, Rebecca B",Women's health issues : official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health,120,24

Within general practice in Ireland, complaints management is dependent on individual practice policies, with little standardisation nationally, impeding their use for safety improvement. There is a need to understand factors that contribute to unlocking the potential of complaints for safety improvement in general practice in Ireland and internationally. OBJECTIVES: To explore perceptions of healthcare complaints of general practitioners, practice nurses and managers, medico-legal professionals, and policymakers. METHODS: Participants were recruited using convenience sampling. Interviews were conducted from November 2019–May 2020, based on a semi-structured interview guide. Data were then transcribed and analysed using content analysis. An iterative process was applied to identify emerging themes from the interviews. RESULTS: A total of 29 participants (19 female, 10 male) were interviewed. Three themes emerged from the analysis, ‘why patients submit complaints’, ‘management of complaints’, and ‘impact of complaints’. Subthemes included ‘barriers and facilitators to complaining’, ‘practice processes’ for complaints management, and ‘impacts on staff’ of complaints, among others. CONCLUSION: There is a lot to be learned about how individuals experience complaints, however, this study adds to existing knowledge. The findings from this study can be used to tackle challenges facing complaints management in general practice, including the barriers to complaining for patients and the negative impacts of complaints on the staff, and can also help to build on positive aspects of complaints such as the desire for systemic change among interested parties.","O’Dowd, Emily; Lydon, Sinead; O’Connor, Paul",The European journal of general practice,120,20

To gain insight into virus-host interactions, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen. The expression of over 20,000 cellular genes was individually knocked down in human airway epithelial A549 cells, followed by infection with RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Knockdown of expression of the cellular ATP1A1 protein, which is the major subunit of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase of the plasma membrane, had one of the strongest inhibitory effects on GFP expression and viral titer. Inhibition was not observed for vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that it was RSV-specific rather than a general effect. ATP1A1 formed clusters in the plasma membrane very early following RSV infection, which was independent of replication but dependent on the attachment glycoprotein G. RSV also triggered activation of ATP1A1, resulting in signaling by c-Src-kinase activity that transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by Tyr845 phosphorylation. ATP1A1 signaling and activation of both c-Src and EGFR were found to be required for efficient RSV uptake. Signaling events downstream of EGFR culminated in the formation of macropinosomes. There was extensive uptake of RSV virions into macropinosomes at the beginning of infection, suggesting that this is a major route of RSV uptake, with fusion presumably occurring in the macropinosomes rather than at the plasma membrane. Important findings were validated in primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). In A549 cells and HSAEC, RSV uptake could be inhibited by the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 (rostafuroxin) that bind specifically to the ATP1A1 extracellular domain and block RSV-triggered EGFR Tyr845 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we identified ATP1A1 as a host protein essential for macropinocytic entry of RSV into respiratory epithelial cells, and identified PST2238 as a potential anti-RSV drug.","Lingemann, Matthias; McCarty, Thomas; Liu, Xueqiao; Buchholz, Ursula J.; Surman, Sonja; Martin, Scott E.; Collins, Peter L.; Munir, Shirin",PLoS Pathog,120,20

The mean age was 60.8 ({+/-}13.6) years, BMI 32.6 ({+/-}8), 58 (45 %) were female, 72 (55.8%) were African American, 40 (31%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2%) were smokers. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days ({+/-} 3.3). ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p <0.0001). {Delta}ROX (<=0 versus >0), peak D-dimer >4000 and admission GFR < 60 ml/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=). Mortality was 11.2% in HFNT only group versus 47.5% in the HFNT progressed to IMV group (p,0.0001). Mortality and need for pulmonary vasodilators were higher in the HNFT progressed to IMV group. Conclusion ROX index is a valuable, noninvasive tool to evaluate patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 treated with HFNT. ROX helps predicts need for IMV and thus limiting morbidity and mortality associated with IMV.","Patel, M.; Chowdhury, J.; Mills, N.; Marron, R.; Gangemi, A.; Dorey-Stein, Z.; Yousef, I.; Tragesser, L.; Giurintano, J.; Gupta, R.; Rali, P.; D'Alonzo, G.; Zhao, H.; Patlakh, N.; Marchetti, N.; Criner, G.; Gordon, M.",,120,10

Here, we use this clustering to classify the official national SARS-CoV-2 daily infection counts and check for infection counts that are unusually anti-clustered. We adopt a one-parameter model of [Image: see text] infections per cluster, dividing any daily count n(i) into [Image: see text] ‘clusters’, for ‘country’ i. We assume that [Image: see text] on a given day j is drawn from a Poisson distribution whose mean is robustly estimated from the four neighbouring days, and calculate the inferred Poisson probability [Image: see text] of the observation. The [Image: see text] values should be uniformly distributed. We find the value [Image: see text] that minimises the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance from a uniform distribution. We investigate the (ϕ(i), N(i)) distribution, for total infection count N(i). We consider consecutive count sequences above a threshold of 50 daily infections. We find that most of the daily infection count sequences are inconsistent with a Poissonian model. Most are found to be consistent with the ϕ(i) model. The 28-, 14- and 7-day least noisy sequences for several countries are best modelled as sub-Poissonian, suggesting a distinct epidemiological family. The 28-day least noisy sequence of Algeria has a preferred model that is strongly sub-Poissonian, with [Image: see text] . Tajikistan, Turkey, Russia, Belarus, Albania, United Arab Emirates and Nicaragua have preferred models that are also sub-Poissonian, with [Image: see text] . A statistically significant (P(τ) < 0.05) correlation was found between the lack of media freedom in a country, as represented by a high Reporters sans frontieres Press Freedom Index (PFI(2020)), and the lack of statistical noise in the country’s daily counts. The ϕ(i) model appears to be an effective detector of suspiciously low statistical noise in the national SARS-CoV-2 daily infection counts.","Roukema, Boudewijn F.",PeerJ,120,24

Methods To do so, it draws upon prior and current research to describe the nature of gig work for people with disabilities, as well as the challenges and new prospects that such work presents. It also discusses recent regulatory reforms and proposes improvements, particularly in light of the current pandemic. Results Participation in the traditional employment market for people with disabilities who can and wish to work remains limited, even when workplace accommodations and individualized adjustments are possible. Increasingly, though, self-directed or independently contracted work is a way for people with disabilities to participate in the mainstream economy. The “gig economy,” in particular, has provided additional opportunities for self-directed work, although the novel coronavirus pandemic has required existing approaches to be reconceived. Conclusions The gig economy provides new prospects, as well as challenges, for people with disabilities to engage in meaningful work. It also requires innovative regulatory responses to the gig work relationship, especially during the pandemic era.","Harpur, Paul; Blanck, Peter",J Occup Rehabil,120,30

Factors impacting outcomes will inform triage and management algorithms. We proposed to conduct these clinical and genomic evaluations. Methods: We recorded demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes for 274 patients with COVID-19 in 6 states (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, VT) from 4/8/20-9/16/20, and used STATA v16 for logistic regressions. Peak disease severity was defined from grade 1-5 as no O2 requirement, 1-3 liters (L) by nasal cannula (NC), 4-6 L NC, >6 L O2 or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, and mechanical ventilation. We generated 64 whole genomes from 3/31/20-5/11/20 using Illumina (238) and Nanopore (61) platforms and built a phylogenetic tree (Nextstrain). Results: Of 274 Veterans, 92.7% were male, 83.2% white, and mean age was 63 years (IQR: 51 to 74 years). Over a third resided in a long-term care facility, and most common comorbidities were coronary artery disease (27%), diabetes (25%), and tobacco use (23%). 11.7% of patients required O2 within 24 hours of admission, with 20.8% of all patients requiring O2 support above their baseline during the hospitalization. Overall, 28.8% were hospitalized, with the highest rates in people with COPD (50%), CAD (45.9%), and those over age 80 years (44.4%). The overall mortality rate was 10.6%, with the highest rates in people with dementia (33.3%), age >80 (28.9%), and those from LTC (23.9%). On multivariate regression, significant predictors of hospitalization were age (OR: 1.05) and Non-white race (OR: 2.39). Peak severity also varied by age (OR: 1.07) and O2 requirement on admission (OR: 45.7). Mortality was predicted by age (OR: 1.06), dementia (OR: 3.44), and O2 requirement on admission (OR: 6.74). Most of our samples were in the A (2.36%) and B (97.3%) lineages. One genome was part of the N.1 lineage. Notably, the majority of genomes (97%) are part of the B1 lineage, which is defined by a D614G substitution. Conclusions: Our study found that in an older cohort of Veterans from the six New England states with a high comorbidity burden, age was the single strongest predictor of hospitalization, peak severity, and mortality. Non-white Veterans were more likely to be hospitalized, and patients who required oxygen on admission were more likely to have severe disease and higher rates of mortality. Furthermore, patients with dementia were more likely to die. Multiple genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 were distributed in patients in New England early in the COVID-19 era, mostly in the New York clade with a D614G mutation.","Lee, M.; Sallah, Y.

The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility and procedures for a randomized trial of an intervention to teach PCPs a palliative care approach and communication skills to improve advanced cancer patients’ quality of life. METHODS: Observational pilot study in 5 steps. 1) Recruitment of PCPs. 2) Intervention: training on palliative care competencies and communication skills addressing end-of-life issues. 3) Recruitment of advanced cancer patients by PCPs. 4) Patients follow-up by PCPs, and assessment of their quality of life by a research assistant 5) Feedback from PCPs using a semi-structured focus group and three individual interviews with qualitative deductive theme analysis. RESULTS: Eight PCPs were trained. Patient recruitment was a challenge for PCPs who feared to impose additional loads on their patients. PCPs became more conscious of their role and responsibility during oncologic treatments and felt empowered to take a more active role picking up patient’s cues and addressing advance directives. They developed interprofessional collaborations for advance care planning. Overall, they discovered the role to help patients to make decisions for a better end-of-life. CONCLUSIONS: While the intervention was acceptable to PCPs, recruitment was a challenge and a follow up trial was not deemed feasible using the current design but PCPs reported a change in paradigm about palliative care. They moved from a focus on helping patients to die better, to a new role helping patients to define the conditions for a better end-of-life.

Here we show lymphopenia, selective loss of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells, excessive T-cell activation and high expression of T-cell inhibitory molecules are more prominent in severe cases than in those with mild disease. CD8+ T cells in patients with severe disease express high levels of cytotoxic molecules. Histochemical studies of lung tissue from one fatality show sub-anatomical distributions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and massive infiltration of T cells and macrophages. Thus, aberrant activation and dysregulation of CD8+ T cells occur in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, an effect that might be for pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and indicate that immune-based targets for therapeutic interventions constitute a promising treatment for severe COVID-19 patients.","Song, Jin-Wen; Zhang, Chao; Fan, Xing; Meng, Fan-Ping; Xu, Zhe; Xia, Peng; Cao, Wen-Jing; Yang, Tao; Dai, Xiao-Peng; Wang, Si-Yu; Xu, Ruo-Nan; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Li, Wen-Gang; Zhang, Da-Wei; Zhao, Peng; Shi, Ming; Agrati, Chiara; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhang, Ji-Yuan",Nat Commun,120,11

Less than 10% of global transplantation needs are met worldwide, and the need for LT is still increasing. The death rates on the waiting list remain too high. OBJECTIVE: It is, therefore, critical to raise awareness among the public and health care providers and in turn increasingly acquire donors. METHODS: We performed a Google Trends search using the search terms liver transplantation and liver transplant on October 15, 2020. On the basis of the resulting monthly data, the annual average Google Trends indices were calculated for the years 2004 to 2018. We not only investigated the trend worldwide but also used data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), Spain, and Eurotransplant. Using pairwise Spearman correlations, Google Trends indices were examined over time and compared with the total number of liver transplants retrieved from the respective official websites of UNOS, the Organización Nacional de Trasplantes, and Eurotransplant. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2018, there was a significant decrease in the worldwide Google Trends index from 78.2 in 2004 to 20.5 in 2018 (–71.2%). This trend was more evident in UNOS than in the Eurotransplant group. In the same period, the number of transplanted livers increased worldwide. The waiting list mortality rate was 31% for Eurotransplant and 29% for UNOS. However, in Spain, where there are excellent awareness programs, the Google Trends index remained stable over the years with comparable, increasing LT numbers but a significantly lower waiting list mortality (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Public awareness in LT has decreased significantly over the past two decades.

Rapid qualitative evaluation was conducted to explore experiences of those who took part in the programme, of those who declined and of those in the educational and healthcare organisations involved in the pilot testing who were responsible for roll-out. This included 77 interviews and 20 focus groups with 223 staff, students, pupils and household members from four schools, one university, and one community healthcare NHS trust. Conversations revealed that high levels of communication, trust and convenience were necessary to ensure public engagement with the programme. This suggests community leaders and stakeholder organisations should be involved throughout programme development and implementation to optimise these features of the testing.

Most studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities to date have focused on hospitalized patients or have not characterized who received testing or those who tested positive for Covid-19. OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of testing and test results for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and subsequent mortality by race and ethnicity in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). PARTICIPANTS: 5,834,543 individuals in care, among whom 62,098 were tested and 5,630 tested positive for Covid-19 between February 8 and May 4, 2020. EXPOSURES: Self-reported race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of Covid-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, accounting for a wide range of demographic and clinical risk factors including comorbid conditions, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. RESULTS: Among all individuals in care, 74% were non-Hispanic white (white), 19% non-Hispanic black (black), and 7% Hispanic. Compared with white individuals, black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 (tests per 1000: white=9.0, [95% CI 8.9 to 9.1]; black=16.4, [16.2 to 16.7]; and Hispanic=12.2, [11.9 to 12.5]).

This paper analyses how transformative changes are intended to be encouraged and achieved, where and when. The paper explores critical drivers and how they relate to leverage points at different places in the societal systems. The paper builds on a comprehensive sense-making analysis of scholarly literature, policy documents, including countries’ contributions to the Paris Agreement and national reviews of progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals, international news media and lay focus group discussions on five continents. There are great variations in how drivers were made sense of in the data. The many ongoing interacting transformations across societies involve different social, cultural, and political contexts, while the implementation of the 2030 Agenda also contains goal conflicts and unavoidable trade-offs. The paper highlights four categories of drivers as particularly important to consider in view of international transformation efforts: technological innovations, political economy redistribution, new narratives, and transformative learning. Four features are important for bringing clarity on how deliberate transformations can be encouraged: (1) the function of drivers in enabling and restricting transformations of societal systems characterised by detailed or dynamic complexity, (2) cultural and geographical contexts of transformations, (3) where in the systems the drivers are intended to intervene, and (4) the role of critical junctions in time, where transformative trajectories can branch out.

Its etiology is complex and multifactorial and often associated with host immunodeficiency. Evidence exists that vitamin D has potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this case–control study was to assess the association between vitamin D levels and CADS. The study included 32 complete denture wearers with CADS and 32 sex- and age-matched complete denture wearers without CADS. The patients were clinically examined, and the severity of denture stomatitis was assessed according to Newton’s classification scale. The serum vitamin D level was determined via the use of an electrochemiluminescence assay. The vitamin D level in the CADS group and control group was 54.68 ± 17.07 and 56.82 ± 17.75 nmol/L, respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.622). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of CADS was not associated with hypovitaminosis D (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.37–5.54). It can be concluded that vitamin D is not associated with CADS and does not play a significant role in host susceptibility to CADS. This finding suggests that vitamin D screening is not indicated routinely in patients with Candida-associated denture stomatitis.","Muhvić-Urek, Miranda; Saltović, Ema; Braut, Alen; Kovačević Pavičić, Daniela",Dent J (Basel),120,15

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect remain unknown. In an attempt to identify the accessory proteins involved in this effect, we conducted a proteomic analysis in ACE2-transfected HEK293T cells. A single protein, fascin-1, was found to differentially interact with ACE2 after Ang-II treatment for 4 h. The interactions between fascin-1 and ACE2 were confirmed by confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of fascin-1 attenuates the effects of Ang-II on ACE2 activity. In contrast, downregulation of fascin-1 severely decreased ACE2 enzymatic activity. Interestingly, in brain homogenates from hypertensive mice, we observed a significant reduction of fascin-1, suggesting that the levels of this protein may change in cardiovascular diseases. In conclusion, we identified fascin-1 as an ACE2-accessory protein, interacting with the enzyme in an Ang-II dependent manner and contributing to the regulation of enzyme activity.","Ogunlade, Blessing; Guidry, Jessie J.; Mukerjee, Snigdha; Sriramula, Srinivas; Lazartigues, Eric; Filipeanu, Catalin M.",Cell Mol Neurobiol,120,15

We developed a mathematical model for investigating and predicting the effects of lockdown on future COVID-19 cases with a specific focus on India. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and validate a mathematical model and to assess the impact of various lockdown scenarios on COVID-19 transmission in India. METHODS: A model consisting of a framework of ordinary differential equations was developed by incorporating the actual reported cases in 14 countries. After validation, the model was applied to predict COVID-19 transmission in India for different intervention scenarios in terms of lockdown for 4, 14, 21, 42, and 60 days. We also assessed the situations of enhanced exposure due to aggregation of individuals in transit stations and shopping malls before the lockdown. RESULTS: The developed model is efficient in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases compared to the actual reported cases in 14 countries. For India, the model predicted marked reductions in cases for the intervention periods of 14 and 21 days of lockdown and significant reduction for 42 days of lockdown. Such intervention exceeding 42 days does not result in measurable improvement. Finally, for the scenario of “panic shopping” or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India. Any relaxation in the lockdown may lead to exponential transmission, resulting in a heavy burden on the health care system in the country.","Ambikapathy, Bakiya; Krishnamurthy, Kamalanand",JMIR Public Health Surveill,120,1

Based on 17,123 and 8693 emergency attendance for stroke and AMI, an interrupted time-series (ITS) study was conducted. Since 01/24/2020, the top two levels of regulations on major public health have been implemented in Beijing. This study covered from 03/01/2018 to 06/03/2020, including 19 weeks of lockdown period and 99 weeks before. A segmented Poisson regression model was used to estimate the immediate change and the monthly change in the secular trend of the emergency attendance rates. The emergency attendance rates of stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the lockdown period, with 52.1% (95% CI 45.8% to 57.7%) and 63.1% (95% CI 56.1% to 63.1%) immediate decreases for stroke and AMI, respectively. Then during the lockdown period, 7.0% (95% CI 2.5%, 11.6%) and 16.1% (95% CI 9.5, 23.1) increases per month in the secular trends of emergency attendance rates were shown for stroke and AMI, respectively. Though the accelerated increasing rates, there were estimated 1335 and 747 patients with stroke and AMI without seeking emergency medical aid during the lockdown, respectively. The emergency attendance for stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the pandemic then had gradual restoration thereafter. The results hint the need for more engagement and communications with all stakeholders to reduce the negative impact on CVD emergency medical services during the crisis.

The main aim was to develop a reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of PRRSV-induced multifactorial respiratory disease. The central hypothesis was that respiratory disease results from an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. In a first series of studies, PRRSV was shown to be a poor inducer of TNF-α and IFN-α in the lungs, whereas IL-1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were produced consistently during infection. We then set up a dual inoculation model in which pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRRSV and 3–14 days later with LPS. PRRSV-infected pigs developed acute respiratory signs for 12–24 h upon intratracheal LPS inoculation, in contrast to pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. Moreover, peak TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 titers were 10–100 times higher in PRRSV–LPS inoculated pigs than in the singly inoculated pigs and the cytokine overproduction was associated with disease. To further prove the role of proinflammatory cytokines, we studied the effect of pentoxifylline, a known inhibitor of TNF-α and IL-1, on PRRSV–LPS induced cytokine production and disease. The clinical effects of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), meloxicam and flunixin meglumine, were also examined. Pentoxifylline, but not the NSAIDs, significantly reduced fever and respiratory signs from 2 to 6 h after LPS. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1 in the lungs of pentoxifylline-treated pigs were moderately reduced, but were still 26 and 3.5-fold higher than in pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. This indicates that pathways other than inhibition of cytokine production contributed to the clinical improvement. Finally, we studied a mechanism by which PRRSV may sensitize the lungs for LPS. We hypothesized that PRRSV would increase the amount of LPS receptor complex in the lungs leading to LPS sensitisation. Both CD14 and LPS-binding protein, two components of this complex, increased significantly during infection and the amount of CD14 in particular was correlated with LPS sensitisation. The increase of CD14 was mainly due to infiltration of strongly CD14-positive monocytes in the lungs. The PRRSV–LPS combination proved to be a simple and reproducible experimental model for multifactorial respiratory disease in pigs. To what extent the interaction between PRRSV and LPS contributes to the development of complex respiratory disease is still a matter of debate.","Van Gucht, Steven; Labarque, Geoffrey; Van Reeth, Kristien",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,120,20

In addition, we investigated whether knowledge about COVID-19 can reduce fear, prejudice, and anxiety. METHODS: We performed an anonymous online survey in 1,500 residents aged 19–65 years between April 24 and May 5 of 2020. Anxiety level was assessed using the generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale. We used a questionnaire to investigate COVID-19-related media use, knowledge about COVID-19, fear of infection, and prejudice towards infected people. We analyzed the relationships among the variables using the structural equation model. RESULTS: Media use had significant effects on fear of infection, prejudice against infected people, and anxiety. Knowledge about COVID-19 had a significant protective effect on fear of infection, prejudice against infected people, and anxiety. However, the effect of media use on knowledge about COVID-19 was not statistically significant. There was a partial mediating effect of prejudice against infected people and fear of infection on media usage and anxiety. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated significant effects of mass media coverage regarding COVID-19 on fear, prejudice, and anxiety. While knowledge about COVID-19 could decrease fear, prejudice, and anxiety, the use of mass media did not enhance this knowledge.

Previous evidence suggested the prognostic role of the nutritional status in patients affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aim to investigate the nutritional risk in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in an internal medicine ward and their clinical outcomes using the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) and parameters derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 aimed at exploring: 1) the prevalence of nutritional risk with NRS-2002 and BIA; 2) the relationship between NRS-2002, BIA parameters and selected outcomes: length of hospital stay (LOS); death and need of intensive care unit (ICU); prolonged LOS; and loss of appetite. RESULTS: Data of 90 patients were analyzed. Patients at nutritional risk were 92% with NRS-2002, with BIA-derived parameters: 88% by phase angle; 86% by body cell mass; 84% by fat-free mass and 84% by fat mass (p-value ≤0.001). In ROC analysis, NRS had the maximum sensitivity in predicting the risk of death and need of ICU and a prolonged hospitalization showing moderate-low specificity; phase angle showed a good predictive power in terms of AUC. NRS-2002 was significantly associated with LOS (β 12.62, SE 5.79). In a multivariate analysis, blood glucose level and the early warning score are independent predictors of death and need of ICU (OR 2.79, p ≤0.001; 1.59, p-0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION: Present findings confirm the clinical utility of NRS-2002 to assess nutritional risk in patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission and in predicting LOS, and that bioimpedance does not seem to add further predictive value. An early detection of nutritional risk has to be systematically included in the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in internal medicine wards.","Del Giorno, Rosaria; Quarenghi, Massimo; Stefanelli, Kevyn; Capelli, Silvia; Giagulli, Antonella; Quarleri, Lara; Stehrenberger, Daniela; Ossola, Nicola; Monotti, Rita; Gabutti, Luca",Int J Gen Med,120,32

Hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: This study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes (for filoviruses and for respiratory viruses) to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the U.S. Department of Defense and various international public health agencies. The newly expanded and combined panel is tested using carefully constructed synthetic metagenomic samples that contain clinically relevant amounts of viral genetic material. Target enrichment results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity for virus detection as compared to shotgun sequencing, yielding full, deeply covered viral genomes from materials with Ct values suggesting that amplicon sequencing would be likely to fail. Increased pooling to improve cost- and time-effectiveness does not negatively affect the ability to obtain full-length viral genomes, even in the case of co-infections, although as expected, it does decrease depth of coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Hybridization-based target enrichment is an effective solution to obtain full-length viral genomes for samples from which virus detection would fail via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or even via amplicon sequencing. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique, in conjunction with deeper pooling strategies, could make high-throughput sequencing more economical for routine use in biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.

However, the positive impacts on the environment are not expected to last long as countries have started to gradually come out of lockdown and engage in aggressive measures to regain the pre-COVID-19 levels of economic activity. The present study provides for an assessment of air quality changes during the period of lockdown and unlocking across 9 major cities in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, including three cities (Ghaziabad, Noida, and Greater Noida) in the national capital region, which have frequently found a place among the most polluted cities in the world. The pollutant load in a vertical column of air during March-July 2020 has been analyzed and compared with the corresponding period's pollution load in 2019. In addition, a detailed analysis of the ground-level changes in pollution load for Ghaziabad, Noida, and Greater Noida is also presented, along with the changes in local meteorology. A significant reduction in the total column density of NO(2) and CO and ground-level pollution load of PM(10), PM(2.5), NO(2), and SO(2) have been observed. In contrast, an increase in total column density of SO(2) across all the cities (except Kanpur) and ground-level concentration of CO (in Noida and Greater Noida) and O(3) (in Noida) was evident. Multiple industrial clusters and heavy vehicular traffic characterize the NCR landscape and contribute towards its poor air quality. The improvement in air quality (with respect to particulate matter) can primarily be attributed to the restrictions on construction and demolition activities, reduced re-suspension of roadside dust, and the restrictions on the movement of vehicles.","Kumar, Dipesh; Singh, Anil; Kumar, Vaibhav; Poyoja, R.; Ghosh, Ashok; Singh, Bhaskar",Environ Pollut,120,21

METHODS: The molecular docking of CHM with the SARS-Cov-2 3CL hydrolase and the ACE2 converting enzyme, which were taken as the targets, was achieved by the Autodock Vina software. The CHM monomers acting on 3CLpro and ACE2 receptors were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, the active ingredients were selected, and the key CHMs and compounds were speculated. Based on the perspective of network pharmacology, the chemical-target network was constructed, and the functional enrichment analysis of gene ontology and the pathway enrichment analysis of Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes were carried out by DAVID to speculate about the mechanism of action of the core drug pairs. RESULTS: There are 6 small molecule compounds that have the optimal binding energy with the two target proteins. Among 238 potential anti-COVID-19 herbs screened in total, 16 kinds of CHM containing the most active ingredients, and 5 candidate anti-COVID-19 herbs that had been used in high frequency, as well as a core drug pair, namely, Forsythiae Fructus-Lonicerae Japonicae Flos were selected. CONCLUSION: The core drug pair of Forsythiae Fructus-Lonicerae Japonicae Flos containing multiple components and targets is easy to combine with 3CLpro and ACE2, and exerts an anti-COVID-19 pneumonia effect through multi-component and multi-target, and plays the role of anti-COVID-19 pneumonia in multi-pathway.","Gao, Liang-qin; Xu, Jing; Chen, Shao-dong",Chin J Integr Med,120,22

However, the similarity between features of CXR images of COVID-19 and pneumonia caused by other infections make the differential diagnosis by radiologists challenging. We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we were able to successfully implement our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images. We propose that our COVID-Classifier can be used in conjunction with other tests for optimal allocation of hospital resources by rapid triage of non-COVID-19 cases.","Khuzani, Abolfazl Zargari; Heidari, Morteza; Shariati, S.

To gain a deeper understanding about the future dynamics of COVID-19, a compartmental mathematical model has been proposed in this paper incorporating all possible non-pharmaceutical intervention policies. Model parameters have been calibrated using sophisticated trust-region-reflective algorithm and short-term projection results have been illustrated for Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and India. Control reproduction numbers (Rc) have been calculated in order to get insights about the current epidemic scenario in the above-mentioned countries. Forecasting results depict that the aforesaid countries are having downward trends in daily COVID-19 cases. However, it is highly recommended to use efficacious face coverings and maintain strict physical distancing, as the pandemic is not over in any country. Global sensitivity analysis enlightens the fact that efficacy of face coverings is the most significant parameter, which could significantly control the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus compared to other non-pharmaceutical measures. In addition, reduction in effective contact rate with isolated patients is also essential in bringing down the epidemic threshold (Rc) below unity. All necessary graphical simulations have been performed with the help of Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivatives.

METHOD: Questionnaires were completed by 116 reserve Israeli Home Front Command medical staff (71% males). Background variables (e.g., gender), personality variables (self-efficacy and sense of coherence - SOC), situational variables (state-anxiety, self-rated health and sense of threat) and organizational variables (satisfaction with military’s and government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis) were measured as predictors of burnout. RESULTS: Females had higher levels of state anxiety and burnout compared to males. Females also reported a lower level of satisfaction with the military’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis than males. SOC and state anxiety were the only statistically significant predictors of burnout after controlling for sociodemographic variables. The entire model explained 59.4% of the burnout variance. CONCLUSION: In accordance with salutogenic theory, SOC is associated with active adaptation through use of generalized and specific resistance resources to avoid burnout in a stressful milieu. Psychological support, psychoeducation and simulation training are offered to increase manageability in crisis situations. LIMITATIONS: Following a large dropout rate due to being quarantined, the final sample size was much smaller than planned. Also, although previous longitudinal studies have found SOC to be a causal factor in burnout, the present cross-sectional design limits such conclusions.","Antonovsky, Avishai; Danon, Roey; Schiff, Miriam; Shelef, Leah",Health Promot Int,120,14

Differences in characteristics of strokes such as increasing rates of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke were also observed comparing between pre-COVID and COVID eras. However, these findings were often based on data from selected hospitals or networks and estimates may be biased by level of stroke care and baseline case mix. A population-based study including rural hospitals and non-stroke centers covering a longer observation period beyond the early-pandemic epoch may lead to more accurate insights.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective population-based study using the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File, capturing all discharges from hospitals in the State of Texas excluding federal hospitals. We assessed quarterly changes in volume, characteristics, care of AIS, and patient outcomes from April 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 and compared two time periods. 2020Q2 was defined as the pandemic period and the previous one year as the pre-pandemic period. Cases were defined as inpatient hospitalizations to acute care hospitals with a primary diagnosis of AIS. ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes were used to identify AIS, LVO, use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) and endovascular treatment (EVT). Hospitals were determined as CSC (Comprehensive Stroke Center) and non-CSC based on designation by the Texas Department of State Health Services.ResultsThe number of AIS cases dropped substantially from 10,745 per quarter in the pre-pandemic period to 9,277 in the pandemic period (-14%) in Texas. The percentage of patients aged younger than 65 (39.0% vs 40.4%, p=0.014) and LVO stroke (30.0% vs 32.7%, p&lt;0.001) slightly increased. Percentages of admission to CSC (39.1% vs 39.5%, p=0.57) and admission through inter-hospital transfer (9.6% vs 9.3%, p=0.35) remained similar between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. There was also no significant change in the use of IV-tPA (14.1% vs 13.6%, P=0.20) or EVT (5.4% VS 5.8%, P=0.12). In-hospital mortality slightly increased from 2.9% to 3.2% but it was not statistically significant (p=0.13). However, the percentage of death or hospice discharge increased from 7.6% to 8.4% (p=0.003) and age and LVO type adjusted odds ratio was 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23).Abstact P-031 Figure 1ConclusionIn this population-level study, significant decreases in AIS volume were observed with slightly higher incidence in younger population and higher LVO strokes.

Knowledge about the epidemiology, the diagnostic approach and methods of control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease. The ETEC causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P) or F41, while the ETEC of post-weaning diarrhoea carry the fimbriae F4 (k88) and F18. These fimbriae adhere to specific receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells (enterocytes), starting the process of enteric infection. After this colonization, the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing diarrhoea, such as the heat stable toxin a (STa), the heat stable toxin b (STb), and the heat labile toxin (LT). A role in the pathogenesis of the disease was demonstrated for these toxins. The diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the pathogenic E.coli coupled with the demonstration by PCR of the genes encoding for virulence factors (fimbriae and toxins). The diagnostic approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the outbreak. Among the different methods of control of colibacillosis, the use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in two main ways: as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs. An accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis needs an appropriate sampling for the isolation and quantification of the ETEC responsible for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology. Definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors to identify the isolated E.coli. It is important to confirm the diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly among E. coli isolates. Growing concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers.","Luppi, Andrea",Porcine Health Manag,120,26

A novel human coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in epidemic form in early 2003 in China and spread worldwide in a few months. Every newly emerging human pathogen is of concern for the safety of the blood supply during and after an epidemic crisis. For this purpose, we have evaluated the inactivation of SARS‐coronavirus (CoV) in platelet concentrates using an approved pathogen inactivation device, the INTERCEPT Blood System. Apheresis platelet concentrates (APCs) were inoculated with approximately 10(6) pfu mL(−1) of either Urbani or HSR1 isolates of SARS‐CoV. The inoculated units were mixed with 150 µm amotosalen and illuminated with 3 J cm(−2) UV‐A light. The viral titres were determined by plaque formation in Vero E6 cells. Mixing SARS‐CoV with APC in the absence of any treatment decreased viral infectivity by approximately 0·5–1 log(10). Following photochemical treatment, SARS‐CoV was consistently inactivated to the limit of detection in seven independent APC units. No infectious virus was detected after treatment when up to one‐third of the APC unit was assayed, demonstrating a mean log(10)‐reduction of >6·2. Potent inactivation of SARS‐CoV therefore extends the capability of the INTERCEPT Blood System in inactivating a broad spectrum of human pathogens including recently emerging respiratory viruses.","Pinna, D.; Sampson‐Johannes, A.; Clementi, M.; Poli, G.; Rossini, S.; Lin, L.; Vicenzi, E.",Transfus Med,120,4

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the viral etiological agents responsible for FRI among military recruits training in a tropical climate in Singapore. STUDY DESIGN: From March 2006 through April 2007, a total of 1354 oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were collected from military recruits who reported sick with an oral temperature of ≥38 °C and a cough and/or sore throat. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assay for the presence of influenza A and B viruses and adenoviruses (H-AdV), and conventional PCR used for the remaining respiratory viruses in all specimens. RESULTS: Influenza A virus was the dominant infection with a laboratory-confirmed incidence of 24% (326/1354) and a predominance of the H3N2 subtype. The temporal pattern for influenza A virus infections coincided with the nation-wide pattern in the civilian community. Detection rates of 12% (159/1354) and 2.7% (5/1354) were obtained for influenza B virus and other respiratory viruses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory findings identified influenza A virus as the primary causative viral agent for FRI in the Singapore military, in strong contrast to findings from temperate countries and countries where recruits are often vaccinated for influenza.

The aim of this review is to critically analyze and summarize the research done regarding SARS-COV-2 virus detection, focusing on sampling and laboratory detection methods in environmental media. A special attention will be given to wastewater and sewage sludge. This review has summarized the survival of the virus on surfaces to estimate the risk carried by different environmental media (water, wastewater, air and soil) in order to explain which communities are under higher risk. The critical analysis concludes that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with current technologies and sampling strategies would reveal the presence of the virus. This information could be used to design systematic sampling points throughout the sewage systems when available, taking into account peak flows and more importantly economic factors on when to sample. Such approaches will be able to provide clues for potential future viral outbreak, saving financial resources by reducing testing necessities for viral detection, hence contributing for more appropriate confinement policies by governments and could be further used to define more precisely post-pandemic or second wave measures if/ when needed.","Sanchez-Galan, Javier E.; Ureña, Grimaldo; Escovar, Luis F.; Fabrega-Duque, Jose R.; Coles, Alexander; Kurt, Zohre",J Environ Chem Eng,120,26

In the United States alone, there have been approximately 7 million cases and over 200,000 deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on healthcare systems and workers. Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5% of patients require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is the necessity for clinical care personnel to don and doff cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU equipment may be controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous installed base of existing ventilators do not have this capability. This paper reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic system that permits adjustment of ventilator settings from outside the ICU. The system consists of a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with camera vision control via a wirelessly connected tablet master device located outside the room. Engineering system tests demonstrated that the open-loop mechanical repeatability of the device was 7.5 mm, and that the average positioning error of the robotic finger under visual servoing control was 5.94 mm. Successful usability tests in a simulated ICU environment were carried out and are reported.

In COVID-19 patients, the higher prevalence of neurological symptoms and the lack of dyspnea may suggest common underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. The aim of this preliminary study is to address whether there is a lack of dyspnea in COVID-19 patients and if there is a relationship between neurological symptoms and the perception of dyspnea. METHODS: A structured interview regarding the occurrence of subjective neurological symptoms was performed and coupled with a questionnaire about the intensity and qualities of dyspnea. Respiratory rate (RR) and an arterial blood gas on room air were concurrently evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (age 68.4 ± 13.9 years, 13 males and 9 females) were included and divided into two groups according to the Borg dyspnea scale: dyspneic patients BU ≥ 1(DYSP) and non-dyspneic patients BU < 1 (NDYSP). The prevalence of dyspnea overall was 31.8%. The prevalence of neurological symptoms, dyspnea descriptors, RR, pH, PaCO(2), PaO(2), or lactate was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the prevalence of dyspnea is low in non-severe COVID-19 patients, but contrary to our hypothesis of a relationship between shortness of breath and neurological symptoms, we have not been able to find any evidence of an impairment in dyspnea perception, either in the DYSP or NDYSP group.","Ora, Josuel; Liguori, Claudio; Puxeddu, Ermanno; Coppola, Angelo; Matino, Matteo; Pierantozzi, Mariangela; Mercuri, Nicola Biagio; Rogliani, Paola",Neurol Sci,120,1

Methodology. Thirty-nine patients with different mucogingival defects were included in this study for harvesting a free gingival graft (FGG) for soft tissue augmentation. Patients were randomly assigned into three equal groups: group I (MEBO), group II (0.2% HA Gengigel(®)), and group III (control). Postoperative pain was recorded by using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Analgesic consumption was recorded for 7 days postoperatively. Wound size was measured at baseline and on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. Postoperative healing of the palatal wound was assessed by the VAS score for color match on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42. RESULTS: Results of this study showed significant postoperative pain reduction for the three groups; MEBO showed statistically significant less VAS score compared to the other two groups, while HA showed statistically significant less VAS score compared to the control group. Both MEBO and HA showed statistically significant less total analgesic consumption. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups for wound size. MEBO showed statistically significant higher VAS for color match. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment modalities could reduce postoperative pain following harvesting of FGG and improve the palatal wound healing. However, MEBO showed better outcomes in terms of postoperative pain and color match.","Hassan, Ahmed; Ahmed, Enji; Ghalwash, Dalia; Elarab, Azza Ezz",Int J Dent,120,9

The current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge; practices of Pakistani residents regarding COVID-19 and factors associated with good knowledge and positive practices. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 15-April 2020 to 20 May 2020 among 689 Pakistanis by using a validated self-administered questionnaire. Regression analysis was applied to find potential predictor of knowledge and practices. Of 689 participants, more than half had good knowledge; 80% had good practices regarding COVID-19 and majority seek knowledge from social media. Knowledge was significantly higher (OR>1.00, p<0.05) among educated and higher income participants. Positive practices were significantly (OR>1.00, p<0.05) related to the older age ([≥]50 years), higher education, higher income and good knowledge regarding COVID-19. The study concluded that Pakistani residents had good knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 yet there are gaps in specific aspects of knowledge, and practice that should be focused in future awareness and educational campaigns. The study recommends the ministry of health authorities to promote all precautionary and preventive measures of COVID-19-consisting of a better-organized approach- to all strata of society: less privileged people, older ones and less educated people, in order to have equilibrium of knowledge about COVID-19; hence effective implementation of precautionary measures.","Saqlain, M.; Ahmed, A.; Gulzar, A.; Naz, S.; Munir, M.

On the one hand, this approach relies on the relevance of spatiality, which is where things happen, for understanding social phenomena. On the other, it depends on the adoption of a reflexivity paradigm in cartography, which envisions mapping as a powerful medium for promoting an interpretation of such phenomena.

Five reliable databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus were used to obtain relevant studies of the given topic. Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the 36 studies obtained; however, only 11 studies met the criteria. Taxonomy was performed, and the 11 studies were classified on the basis of two categories, namely, review and research studies. Then, a deep analysis and critical review were performed to highlight the challenges and critical gaps outlined in the academic literature of the given subject. Results showed that no relevant study evaluated and benchmarked AI techniques utilised in classification tasks (i.e. binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical classifications) of COVID-19 medical images. In case evaluation and benchmarking will be conducted, three future challenges will be encountered, namely, multiple evaluation criteria within each classification task, trade-off amongst criteria and importance of these criteria. According to the discussed future challenges, the process of evaluation and benchmarking AI techniques used in the classification of COVID-19 medical images considered multi-complex attribute problems. Thus, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an essential and effective approach to tackle the problem complexity. Moreover, this study proposes a detailed methodology for the evaluation and benchmarking of AI techniques used in all classification tasks of COVID-19 medical images as future directions; such methodology is presented on the basis of three sequential phases. Firstly, the identification procedure for the construction of four decision matrices, namely, binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical, is presented on the basis of the intersection of evaluation criteria of each classification task and AI classification techniques.

Drawing on a large-scale dataset which covers more than 1.4M posts and 18M comments from an online social media platform, we investigate the propagation of two distinct narratives–(i) conspiracy information, whose claims are generally unsubstantiated and thus referred as misinformation to some extent, and (ii) scientific information, whose origins are generally readily identifiable and verifiable. We find that conspiracy cascades tend to propagate in a multigenerational branching process whereas science cascades are more likely to grow in a breadth-first manner. Specifically, conspiracy information triggers larger cascades, involves more users and generations, persists longer, and is more viral and bursty than science information. Content analysis reveals that conspiracy cascades contain more negative words and emotional words which convey anger, fear, disgust, surprise and trust. We also find that conspiracy cascades are much more concerned with political and controversial topics. After applying machine learning models, we achieve an AUC score of nearly 90% in discriminating conspiracy from science narratives using the constructed features. We further investigate user’s role during the growth of cascades. In contrast with previous assumption that misinformation is primarily driven by a small set of users, we find that conspiracy cascades are more likely to be controlled by a broader set of users than science cascades, imposing new challenges on the management of misinformation. Although political affinity is thought to affect the consumption of misinformation, there is very little evidence that political orientation of the information source plays a role during the propagation of conspiracy information; Instead, we find that conspiracy information from media outlets with left or right orientation triggers smaller cascades and is less viral than information from online social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Imgur) whose political orientations are unclear. Our study provides complementing evidence to current misinformation research and has practical policy implications to stem the propagation and mitigate the influence of misinformation online.","Zhang, Yafei; Wang, Lin; Zhu, Jonathan J.

Extensive areas of the plasma membrane surface consist of lipid rafts organized into cholesterol-rich microdomains involved in signal transduction, protein sorting, membrane transport and in many processes of viruses infection. Because of the extraction of cholesterol leads to disorganization of lipid microdomains and to dissociation of proteins bound to the lipid rafts, we investigated the effect of cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) on caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV.1) in three important phases of virus infection such as binding, entry and post-entry. MβCD treatment did not prejudice virus binding to cells, while a dose-dependent reduction of the virus yield was observed at the virus entry stage, and 30 mM MβCD reduced infectivity evidently. Treatment of MDBK after virus entry revealed a moderate inhibitory effect suggesting that cholesterol is mainly required during virus entry rather than during the post-entry stage. Alteration of the envelope lipid composition affected virus entry and a noticeable reduction in virus infectivity was detected in the presence of 15 mM MβCD. Considering that the recognition of a host cell receptor is a crucial step in the start-up phase of infection, these data are essential for the study of CpHV.1 pathogenesis. To date virus receptors for CpHV.1 have not yet been identified and further investigations are required to state that MβCD treatment affects the expression of the viral receptors.","Pratelli, Annamaria; Colao, Valeriana",Virus Res,120,20

Here, we assessed antitumor immunity induced by attenuated coronavirus vectors which exclusively target DCs in vivo and express either lymphocyte- or DC-activating cytokines in combination with a GFP-tagged model antigen. Tracking of in vivo transduced DCs revealed that vectors encoding for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) exhibited a higher capacity to induce DC maturation compared to vectors delivering IL-2 or IL-15. Moreover, Flt3L vectors more efficiently induced tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells, expanded the epitope repertoire, and provided both prophylactic and therapeutic tumor immunity. In contrast, IL-2- or IL-15-encoding vectors showed a substantially lower efficacy in CD8(+) T cell priming and failed to protect the host once tumors had been established. Thus, specific in vivo targeting of DCs with coronavirus vectors in conjunction with appropriate conditioning of the microenvironment through Flt3L represents an efficient strategy for the generation of therapeutic antitumor immunity.","Perez-Shibayama, Christian; Gil-Cruz, Cristina; Nussbacher, Monika; Allgäuer, Eva; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Züst, Roland; Ludewig, Burkhard",PLoS One,120,30

The data were collected from a stratified random sample of 133 mathematics teachers in 13 secondary schools through a questionnaire, and follow-up interviews with 24 of them. The results revealed the following: the textbooks were highly regarded and used by the Shanghai mathematics teachers as facilitators rather than barriers for their teaching and instructional change, and the facilitation was most evident in the process of transformation and comprehension, and least evident in evaluation in teachers’ pedagogical reasoning and action; compared with student books and exercise books, teacher manuals played a larger facilitating role in teachers’ teaching; and finally, compared with teacher characteristics, school characteristics had a greater influence on the extent to which textbooks played a role of facilitation or hindrance for teachers’ instructional practice.

The existence of TB endemic equilibrium points in the presence of reinfection and recurrent TB for [Formula: see text] justifies the existence of backward bifurcation under certain restrictions on the parameters. Further, we numerically simulate the fractional order model to verify the analytical results and highlight the role of fractional order in co-infection modeling. The fractional order derivative is shown to have a crucial role in determining the transmission dynamics of HIV-TB co-infection. It is concluded that the memory effect plays a significant role in reducing the infection prevalence of HIV-TB co-infection. An increment in the number of recovered individuals can also be observed when the memory effect is taken into consideration by introducing fractional order model.","A, Tanvi; Aggarwal, Rajiv; Raj, Yashi A.",Nonlinear Dyn,120,1

However, as more countries' borders closed, the likelihood is that cryptomarkets have been negatively impacted. We aim to measure and understand the success rate of transactions on cryptomarkets during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, through recourse to self-reported data that documents the outcome of cryptomarket transactions. METHODS: To collect self-reported data on cryptomarket transactions, we launched a platform where participants can enter information about their prior activities on cryptomarkets. The sample consists of 591 valid self-reports that were received between January 1st, 2020 and August 21st, 2020. RESULTS: The number of unsuccessful transactions increased concurrently with the global spread of the pandemic. Both the international and inter-continental nature of the transactions and the severity of the crisis in the vendor's country are significantly associated with delivery failure. CONCLUSIONS: Drug cryptomarkets may have been disrupted due to the pandemic. The results lead to two opposing explanations for unsuccessful transactions. One explanation for the lower success rate is the inability of drug dealers to deliver on past promises that were made in good faith, while the second points towards opportunistic and abusive behaviour by drug dealers.","Bergeron, Andréanne; Décary-Hétu, David; Giommoni, Luca; Villeneuve-Dubuc, Marie-Pier",Int J Drug Policy,120,6

METHODS: Ninety participants in an ongoing clinical trial of a risk reduction program for homeless, aged 18–25 years, were administered items about COVID-19 between April 10 and July 9, 2020. RESULTS: Most participants reported engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors. Past week mental health symptoms were reported by 38%–48% of participants, depending on symptoms. Among those who used substances before the outbreak, 16%–28% reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. More than half of the participants reported increased difficulty meeting basic needs (e.g., food), and approximately 32%–44% reported more difficulty getting behavioral health services since the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative strategies are needed to address the increased behavioral health needs of young people experiencing homelessness during events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.","Tucker, Joan S.; D'Amico, Elizabeth J.; Pedersen, Eric R.; Garvey, Rick; Rodriguez, Anthony; Klein, David J.",J Adolesc Health,120,1

While such impacts of Covid-19 are becoming clearer, the implications of the disease for energy and climate policy are more prosaic. This Special Section seeks to offer more clarity on the emerging connections between Covid-19 and energy supply and demand, energy governance, future low-carbon transitions, social justice, and even the practice of research methodology. It features articles that ask, and answer: What are the known and anticipated impacts of Covid-19 on energy demand and climate change? How has the disease shaped institutional responses and varying energy policy frameworks, especially in Africa? How will the disease impact ongoing social practices, innovations and sustainability transitions, including not only renewable energy but also mobility? How might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice? Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the practice of research, and for future research methodology? We find that without careful guidance and consideration, the brave new age wrought by Covid-19 could very well collapse in on itself with bloated stimulus packages that counter sustainability goals, misaligned incentives that exacerbate climate change, the entrenchment of unsustainable practices, and acute and troubling consequences for vulnerable groups.","Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Furszyfer Del Rio, Dylan; Griffiths, Steve",Energy Research & Social Science,120,15

While digital media are increasingly being consumed by all age groups and laypersons frequently obtain information on health and medical topics on the Internet, the question of the quality of (journalistic) content on the Web arises. The roles of journalists are changing and scientists are experiencing new opportunities and challenges in the digital distribution of research results. Which qualitative requirements have to be met by these contents and which potentials and opportunities, but also risks, do online disseminated and received information entail?

Remote work, work from home, telecommuting, as well as teleworking are concepts that describe an alternative activity of performing traditional work. With the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, the shift in a higher or lower proportion of companies' online activities, depending on the economic sector in which they operate, has become inevitable and sudden, with telework becoming the new normality among employees and employers. The objective of this study is to find out to what extent teachers in Romania agree to carry out teaching activities in the telework system and whether the educational environment (pre-university or univeristar), the degree of effort put in and the degree of fatigue felt in the telework system influence the extent to which teachers agree to carry out teaching activities in this type of system.The data was collected through a questionnaire-based exploratory research on a sample of 208 higher education professors and pre-university teachers. Non-parametric statistical methods of data analysis were used to measure the perception of study participants in the telework system and statistical methods suitable for qualitative data analysis were used for the assumptions: ordinal regression, Mann-Whitney U Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test. Research results show that teachers make an additional effort to carry out telework system activitiescompared to the teaching activity period in schools/campus’to the majority of respondents (87.5%), leading to a much higher feeling of fatigue (73.5%), and as the main impediment to online teaching, the evaluation of the progress of pupils/students.

The first scenario predicts an increase in consumption for some populations, particularly men, due to distress experienced as a result of the pandemic. A second scenario predicts the opposite outcome, a lowered level of consumption, based on the decreased physical and financial availability of alcohol. With the current restrictions on alcohol availability, it is postulated that, for the immediate future, the predominant scenario will likely be the second, while the distress experienced in the first may become more relevant in the medium‐ and longer‐term future. Monitoring consumption levels both during and after the COVID‐19 pandemic will be necessary to better understand the effects of COVID‐19 on different groups, as well as to distinguish them from those arising from existing alcohol control policies.","Rehm, Jürgen; Kilian, Carolin; Ferreira‐Borges, Carina; Jernigan, David; Monteiro, Maristela; Parry, Charles D.

To date, methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have not been developed for the rapid detection, quantitation and diagnosis of BECV. Presently, a BECV-specific SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay was evaluated and optimized. Diarrheic specimens (n = 118) collected from 2004 to 2005 were subjected to RT-PCR, nested PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. By conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR, 9 (7.6%) and 59 (50%) samples tested positive, respectively, whereas the SYBR Green assay detected BECV in 91 (77.1%) samples. Using BECV RNA standards generated by in vitro transcription, the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay sensitively detected BECV RNA to 1.1 × 10(0) copies/μl (correlation coefficiency = 0.98). The detection limits of the RT-PCR and nested PCR were 1.1 × 10(5) and 1.1 × 10(2) copies/μl, respectively.

Oleanolic acid and its derivatives have been reported for various types of pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, anti-HIV and anti-HCV activity. METHODS: L.cephalotes plant extracts were prepared by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method and oleanolic acid was isolated by preparatory thin-layer chromatography. The compound was identified and characterize by using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), Fourier transform infra-Red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). The structure of the compound was elucidated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)HNMR) and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)CNMR) and the purity checked by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The MTT assay was used to determine the toxicity of plant extract and oleanolic acid using a microplate reader at 595 nm. The anti-dengue activity of plant extract and oleanolic acid was tested in vitro and in silico using real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The optimum yield of the extract was obtained at 40 °C temperature and 15Mpa pressure. The maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of plant extract and oleanolic acid were found as 46.87 μg/ml and 93.75 μg/ml, respectively in C6/36 cell lines. UV spectrophotometer curve of the isolated compound was overlapped with standard oleanolic acid at 232 nm. Superimposed FT-IR structure of the isolated compound was indicated the same spectra at 3433, 2939, 2871, 1690, 1500,1463, 1387, 1250, 1209, 1137 and 656 position as per marker compound. HPTLC analysis showed the retention factor of L. cephalotes extract was 0.19 + 0.06 as similar to the standard oleanolic acid chromatogram. The NMR structure of the isolated compound was identified as similar to the marker oleanolic acid structure. DSC analysis revealed the purity of isolated oleanolic acid was 98.27% with a melting point of 311.16 °C. Real-time RT PCR results revealed that L. cephalotes supercritical extract and isolated oleanolic acid showed 100 and 99.17% inhibition against the dengue − 2 virus when treated with MNTD value of plant extract (46.87 μg/ml) and the test compound (93.75 μg/ml), respectively. The molecular study demonstrated the binding energy of oleanolic acid with NS1and NS5 (non-structural protein) were − 9.42 & -8.32Kcal/mol, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The SFE extract L. cephalotes and its active compound, oleanolic acid inhibiting the activity of dengue-2 serotype in the in vitro and in silico assays. Thus, the L.cephalotes plant could be an excellent source for drug design for the treatment of dengue infection.
