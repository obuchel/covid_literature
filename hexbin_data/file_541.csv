311,Comparison of distance measures in spatial analytical modeling for health service planning,2009-11-06,"BACKGROUND: Several methodological approaches have been used to estimate distance in health service research. In this study, focusing on cardiac catheterization services, Euclidean, Manhattan, and the less widely known Minkowski distance metrics are used to estimate distances from patient residence to hospital. Distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. Therefore, distance metrics, unlike actual measurements, can be directly used in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance is most often used, but unlikely the most appropriate metric. Minkowski distance is a more promising method. Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling. METHODS: Road distance and travel time are calculated from the postal code of residence of each patient undergoing cardiac catheterization to the pertinent hospital. The Minkowski metric is optimized, to approximate travel time and road distance, respectively. Distance estimates and distance measurements are then compared using descriptive statistics and visual mapping methods. The optimized Minkowski metric is implemented, via the spatial weight matrix, in a spatial regression model identifying socio-economic factors significantly associated with cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: The Minkowski coefficient that best approximates road distance is 1.54; 1.31 best approximates travel time. The latter is also a good predictor of road distance, thus providing the best single model of travel from patient's residence to hospital. The Euclidean metric and the optimal Minkowski metric are alternatively implemented in the regression model, and the results compared. The Minkowski method produces more reliable results than the traditional Euclidean metric. CONCLUSION: Road distance and travel time measurements are the most accurate estimates, but cannot be directly implemented in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance tends to underestimate road distance and travel time; Manhattan distance tends to overestimate both. The optimized Minkowski distance partially overcomes their shortcomings; it provides a single model of travel over the network. The method is flexible, suitable for analytical modeling, and more accurate than the traditional metrics; its use ultimately increases the reliability of spatial analytical models.","Shahid, Rizwan; Bertazzon, Stefania; Knudtson, Merril L; Ghali, William A",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781002/,541
7586,Evacuation of Intensive Care Units During Disaster: Learning From the Hurricane Sandy Experience,2015-08-27,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the geographic distribution of post-Hurricane Sandy emergency department use in administrative flood evacuation zones of New York City. METHODS: Using emergency claims data, we identified significant deviations in emergency department use after Hurricane Sandy. Using time-series analysis, we analyzed the frequency of visits for specific conditions and comorbidities to identify medically vulnerable populations who developed acute postdisaster medical needs. RESULTS: We found statistically significant decreases in overall post-Sandy emergency department use in New York City but increased utilization in the most vulnerable evacuation zone. In addition to dialysis- and ventilator-dependent patients, we identified that patients who were elderly or homeless or who had diabetes, dementia, cardiac conditions, limitations in mobility, or drug dependence were more likely to visit emergency departments after Hurricane Sandy. Furthermore, patients were more likely to develop drug-resistant infections, require isolation, and present for hypothermia, environmental exposures, or administrative reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified high-risk populations who developed acute medical and social needs in specific geographic areas after Hurricane Sandy. Our findings can inform coherent and targeted responses to disasters. Early identification of medically vulnerable populations can help to map “hot spots” requiring additional medical and social attention and prioritize resources for areas most impacted by disasters.

Cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major health problem in women. DNA vaccines are a perfect approach to immunization, but their potency in clinical trials has been insufficient for generating effective immunity, which may be related to the degradation of the DNA via nucleases, poor delivery to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and insufficient uptake of DNA plasmids by cells upon injection. Archaeosome is a nano-delivery systems based on liposomes with their immunological role have been developed for gene delivery. In this study, human papillomavirus type 16 genes, containing truncated L1, E6, and E7, were simultaneously used in combination therapy with archaeosome and assessed in vivo. Findings supported that archaeosomes promotes immune responses to DNA vaccines and a long-term CTL response was generated with a low antigen dose. Combination therapy with archaeosome/L1/E6/E7 vaccines exhibited a strong cytolytic activity against tumor cells and induced prophylactic and therapeutic effect against the development of tumor in the animal model.","Karimi, Hesam; Soleimanjahi, Hoorieh; Abdoli, Asghar; Banijamali, Razieh Sadat",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7113280/,541

64598,Dynamics of a Global Zoonotic Research Network Over 33 Years (1980-2012).,2015,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of countries to resource constraints while highlighting the indispensability of plastic. Personal protective equipment (PPE), comprising plastic materials, is experiencing an unusual increase in demand globally due to unprecedented consumption for the protection of healthcare workers and the general population. There is a need to model and better understand the material implications of the pandemic. In this research, material flow analysis was used to model the flow of plastic material pre-COVID-19 in South Africa and the additional contribution of the COVID-19 PPE to the plastic footprint. Sankey diagrams were developed to capture the material flow analysis. The mass flow of PPE through the supply chain during the ongoing pandemic is relatively smaller compared to the total national plastic. However, the number of separate PPE items presents a major and growing problem for waste management systems. This paper puts the COVID-19 resource requirements into perspective in relation to South Africa's total national plastic and provides the first known estimate of COVID-19 plastic material resources and waste legacy.","Olatayo, Kunle Ibukun; Mativenga, Paul T; Marnewick, Annlizé L",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34380276/,541
77097,Creation of surge capacity by early discharge of hospitalized patients at low risk for untoward events.,2009,"Introduction On March 19, 2020, preventive and mandatory social isolation was decreed in Argentina in response to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). This measure aimed to reduce the transmission of the virus and the resulting severe respira-tory condition that frequently besets older adults. However, this measure can also affect the support networks of these isolated people. Objectives To explore the emerging needs related to the mental health of isolated older adults in this period and to identify the main support networks they have and the emerging coping strategies in the face of the situation. Methodology We carried out an exploratory qualitative study, summoning participants over 60 years of age. Using snowball sampling, a group of researchers contacted them by phone to collect data. The analysis of the findings was triangulated among researchers with different academic backgrounds (medicine, psychology, and sociology). The concepts emerging from the interviews were linked in conceptual networks using an inductive methodology and were mapped into conceptual frameworks available to researchers. Atlas.ti 8 software was used for coding. Results Thirty-nine participants belonging to the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area were interviewed between April and July 2020. For greater clarity, the main themes were described in five cross-sectional axes: network configurations, resources and coping strategies, affective states and emo-tions, perceptions and reflections on the future, and actions emerging from the participatory approach. Participants reported distress, anxiety, anger, uncertainty, exhaustion, and expressed fear of contagion from themselves and their loved ones. We identify greater vulnerability in people living alone, in small and closed environments, with weak linkages and networks, or limited access to technologies. We also found vari-ous coping strategies and technology was a fundamental factor in maintaining the bonds. Conclusions The findings of this research have implications for decision-making at the individual level, health systems, professional care, and policy devel-opment. Future research may elucidate the regional, temporal, and socioeconomic variations of the phenomena explored in our research.","Pisula, Pedro; Salas Apaza, Julieta Aldana; Baez, Germán Nicolás; Loza, Candela Agustina; Valverdi, Rodrigo; Discacciati, Vilda; Granero, Mariano; Pizzorno Santoro, Ximena Salomé; Franco, Juan Víctor Ariel",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.04.8186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086666/,541
77862,"Ebola Preparedness Planning and Collaboration by Two Health Systems in Wisconsin, September to December 2014.",2016,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the global surgery landscape. OBJECTIVES To analyse and describe the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic surgery at Groote Schuur Hospital, a tertiary academic hospital in South Africa. METHODS The number of orthopaedic surgical cases, emergency theatre patient waiting times, and numbers of outpatient clinic visits, ward admissions, bed occupancies and total inpatient days for January - April 2019 (pre-COVID-19) were compared with the same time frame in 2020 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 timeframe included initiation of a national 'hard lockdown' from 26 March 2020, in preparation for an increasing volume of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS April 2020, the time of the imposed hard lockdown, was the most affected month, although the number of surgical cases had started to decrease slowly during the 3 preceding months. The total number of surgeries, outpatient visits and ward admissions decreased significantly during April 2020 (55.2%, 69.1% and 60.6%, respectively) compared with April 2019 (p<0.05). Trauma cases were reduced by 40% in April 2020. Overall emergency theatre patient waiting time was 30% lower for April 2020 compared with 2019. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 and the associated lockdown has heavily impacted on both orthopaedic inpatient and outpatient services. Lockdown led to a larger reduction in the orthopaedic trauma burden than in international centres, but the overall reduction in surgeries, outpatient visits and hospital admissions was less. This lesser reduction was probably due to local factors, but also to a conscious decision to avoid total collapse of our surgical services.","Waters, R; Dey, R; Laubscher, M; Dunn, R; Maqungo, S; McCollum, G; Nortje, M; Roche, S; Hilton, T; Held, M",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2021.v111i3.15263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944745/,541

80943,Zika Virus: A Review of Management Considerations and Controversies at Six Months.,2017,"BACKGROUND Capsule endoscopy (CE) has allowed the characterization of small bowel lesions. However, small bowel lesions in ulcerative colitis (UC) have not been elucidated and no studies have compared between UC and Crohn's disease (CD). AIM The objective of this study was to investigate the small bowel lesions in UC, and to characterize UC lesions by comparison with CD. METHODS Subjects comprised 54 UC patients and 39 CD patients who underwent CE. We retrospectively investigated characteristics of small bowel lesions in UC. We also compared endoscopic findings and degree of inflammation between UC and CD. RESULTS The incidence of small bowel lesions in UC was 27.8%. The group with small bowel lesions exhibited higher endoscopic activity in the colon than without small bowel lesions (p = 0.002). Comparing small bowel lesions between UC and CD, significantly more ulcerative lesions, notched appearance, longitudinal tendency of lesions, and cobblestone appearance were seen in CD. The Lewis score was significantly higher in CD than UC in the second and third tertiles (205 ± 379 vs. 73 ± 223, p = 0.01; 358 ± 449 vs. 105 ± 333, p < 0.001).

109135,"Fear, familiarity, and the perception of risk: a quantitative analysis of disaster-specific concerns of paramedics.",2011,"Inefficient syntrophic propionate degradation causes severe operating disturbances and reduces biogas productivity in many high-ammonia anaerobic digesters, but propionate-degrading microorganisms in these systems remain unknown. Here, we identified candidate ammonia-tolerant syntrophic propionate-oxidising bacteria using propionate enrichment at high ammonia levels (0.7-0.8 g NH3 /L) in continuously-fed reactors. We reconstructed 30 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the propionate-fed reactors, which revealed two novel species from the families Peptococcaceae and Desulfobulbaceae as syntrophic propionate-oxidising candidates. Both MAGs possess genomic potential for the propionate oxidation and electron transfer required for syntrophic energy conservation and, similar to ammonia-tolerant acetate degrading syntrophs, both MAGs contain genes predicted to link to ammonia and pH tolerance. Based on relative abundance, a Peptococcaceae sp. appeared to be the main propionate degrader and has been given the provisional name ""Candidatus Syntrophopropionicum ammoniitolerans"". This bacterium was also found in high-ammonia biogas digesters, using quantitative PCR. Acetate was degraded by syntrophic acetate-oxidising bacteria and the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community consisted of Methanoculleus bourgensis and a yet to be characterised Methanoculleus sp. This work provides knowledge of cooperating syntrophic species in high-ammonia systems and reveals that ammonia-tolerant syntrophic propionate-degrading populations share common features, but diverge genomically and taxonomically from known species.

113484,Rising to the Challenge: The Ebola Outbreak in Sierra Leone and How Insights Into One Nongovernmental Organization's Response Can Inform Future Core Competencies.,2015,"Several infectious disease outbreaks with high mortality in humans have been attributed to viruses that are thought to have evolved from bat viruses. In this study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n = 624) was performed longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n = 254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum Logistic regression revealed that the level of Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P < 0.01), probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus1 strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern. Both the SARS-related and Betacoronavirus 1 strains detected in bats in Luxembourg may cross the species barrier after a host adaptation process.IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Several severe outbreaks in humans (e.g., a Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and the almost global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003) have been caused by bat-borne viruses that were transmitted to humans mostly after virus adaptation (e.g., in intermediate animal hosts). Despite the indigenousness of bat species that host viruses with suspected zoonotic potential and despite the zoonotic transmission of European bat 1 lyssavirus in Luxembourg, knowledge about the diversity and epidemiology of bat viruses remains limited in this country. Moreover, in contrast to other European countries, bat viruses are currently not included in the national surveillance activities of this land-locked country. We suggest that this gap in disease surveillance should be addressed, since we show here that synanthropic bats host viruses that may be able to cross the species barrier.","Pauly, Maude; Pir, Jacques B; Loesch, Catherine; Sausy, Aurélie; Snoeck, Chantal J; Hübschen, Judith M; Muller, Claude P",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01326-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710271/,541

116972,The Importance of Developing Rigorous Social Science Methods for Community Engagement and Behavior Change During Outbreak Response.,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND Infectious peritonitis (IP) is the most common complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD). The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of IP and to determine its clinical, biological, and evolutive characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a five year, five months retrospective study from July 2006 to December 2011. All patients on peritoneal dialysis that have been followed on PD for a minimum of 3 months and who presented IP during follow-up were included. Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS The 76 episodes of IP were identified in 36 patients. The peritonitis rate (months × patients/peritonitis), as calculated by the Registre de Dialyse Péritonéale de Langue Française (RDPLF Registry) [French peritoneal dialysis registry] in December 2011, was 18.59. Time to occurrence of peritonitis from the start of peritoneal exchange was 15.44±10 months. The mean age of our patients was 49.1±16.8 years [10-80]: the youngest patient's age was 10, while the oldest was 80 years old (male to female: sex ratio M/F=1,66). Also, 22% of our patients were diabetic. The mean follow-up in PD was 22.6±14 months. Abdominal pain was present in 79% of the cases. Fever and vomiting were noted in 42% and 38% of cases, respectively. The C-reactive protein rate was elevated in 77% of cases, and leukocytosis was found in 27% of cases. Bacteriological proof was present in 73.68% of cases. Gram-positive cocci were involved in 56.6% of microbiologically proven IP cases. Gram-negative bacilli were represented in 37.7%. The outcome was favorable in 89.4%. The PD catheter was removed in 2.63% of the cases. In addition, 7.89% of our patients were transferred to hemodialysis. DISCUSSION The rate of IP remains high in our series. More than one-half of the peritonitis cases with positive cultures (56.6%) were caused by Gram-positive cocci. Gram-negative bacilli ranked second (27.7%). These results agree with data in the literature. Moreover, the rate of culture-negative IP in our series is high (26%). Evolution is good in most cases (89%). CONCLUSION Despite the gradual decrease of its rate, peritonitis remains frequent in our center and calls for optimization of means of prevention. The high frequency of negative culture IP in our study urges us toward better collaboration with biologists to target antibiotic therapy and improve IP management.","Bekaoui, Samira; Haddiya, Intissar; Houti, Maria Slimani; Berkchi, Fatima Zahra; Ezaitouni, Fatima; Ouzeddoun, Naima; Bayahia, Rabia; Benamar, Loubna",International journal of nephrology and renovascular disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijnrd.s42069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187732/,541

121967,Is There a Case for Quarantine? Perspectives from SARS to Ebola.,2015,"Renal afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and have a pathophysiological role in hypertension. Renal sympathetic denervation is a novel therapeutic technique for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension. Clinical trials of renal sympathetic denervation have shown significant reductions in blood pressure in these patients. Renal sympathetic denervation also reduces heart rate, which is a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk. Conditions that are comorbid with hypertension, such as heart failure and myocardial hypertrophy, obstructive sleep apnoea, atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome are closely associated with enhanced sympathetic activity. In experimental models and case-control studies, renal denervation has had beneficial effects on these conditions. Renal denervation could become a commonly used procedure to treat resistant hypertension and chronic diseases associated with enhanced sympathetic activation. Current work is focused on refining the techniques and interventional devices to provide safe and effective renal sympathetic denervation. Controlled studies in patients with mild-to-moderate, nonresistant hypertension and comorbid conditions such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnoea, and arrhythmias are needed to investigate the capability of renal sympathetic denervation to improve cardiovascular outcomes.","Böhm, Michael; Linz, Dominik; Urban, Daniel; Mahfoud, Felix; Ukena, Christian",Nature reviews.

It is carried out mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and requires a specific molecular machinery associating several hundreds of glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, transporters and regulating proteins. Modifications of glycosylation are found in numerous diseases, notably in cancers. All types of glycosylation can be affected and this leads to dysfunctions of cellular metabolism. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the regulation of glycosylation mechanisms and illustrate how the alteration of these regulatory mechanisms can lead to abnormal protein and lipid glycosylation, and take part in the development of cancers.","Groux-Degroote, Sophie; Foulquier, François; Cavdarli, Sumeyye; Delannoy, Philippe",Medecine sciences : M/S,https://doi.org/10.1051/medsci/2021082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180820/,541

This may be particularly helpful in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing kidney tumor ablation, in whom there is a desire to minimize or avoid nephrotoxic iodinated contrast exposure. EM tracking software merges and fuses different imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound and can also display the position of needles in real time in relation to preprocedure imaging, which may better define tumor targets than available intraoperative imaging. EM tracking was successfully used to ablate a poorly visualized renal tumor, through the combined use of CT, gadolinium-enhanced MR, and contrast-enhanced US imaging to localize the tumor.","Amalou, Hayet; Wood, Bradford J",Case reports in urology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/390912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23304625/,541
133228,COVID 19 - To Strive Against the Strike.,2020-12-01,"Clinical prognostic tools are used to objectively predict outcomes in many fields of medicine. Whilst over 400 have been developed for use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), only a minority have undergone full external validation and just one, the DECAF score, has undergone an implementation study supporting use in clinical practice. Little is known about how such tools are used in the UK. We distributed surveys at two time points, in 2017 and 2019, to hospitals included in the Royal College of Physicians of London national COPD secondary care audit program. The survey assessed the use of prognostic tools in routine care of hospitalized COPD patients. Hospital response rates were 71/196 in 2017 and 72/196 in 2019. The use of the DECAF and PEARL scores more than doubled in decisions about unsupported discharge (7%-15.3%), admission avoidance (8.1%-17%) and readmission avoidance (4.8%-13.1%); it more than tripled (8.8%-27.8%) in decisions around hospital-at-home or early supported discharge schemes. In other areas, routine use of clinical prognostic tools was uncommon. In palliative care decisions, the use of the Gold Standards Framework Prognostic Indicator Guidance fell (5.6%-1.4%). In 2017, 43.7% of hospitals used at least one clinical prognostic tool in routine COPD care, increasing to 52.1% in 2019. Such tools can help challenge prognostic pessimism and improve care. To integrate these further into routine clinical care, future research should explore current barriers to their use and focus on implementation studies.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1959540.","Lane, Nicholas D; Gillespie, Sarah M; Steer, John; Bourke, Stephen C",COPD,https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1959540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355632/,541

A number of genetic factors such as HLA and CTLA-4 loci have been associated with risk of this disorder. In addition to these factors, recent studies have shown contribution of non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of this condition. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) and a number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as IFNG-AS1, Heg, NR_038461, NR_038462, T204821 and NR_104125 have been dysregulated in peripheral blood of patients with AITD. These transcripts have been mostly enriched in pathways that modulate humoral and cellular immune responses such as those associated with antigen presentation and differentiation of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. Functional studies verified the role of a number of lncRNAs and miRNAs in regulation of critical immune-related pathways in AITD. Thus, they participate in the pathophysiology of AITD.

The 2020 survey was designed and largely fielded before the full extent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had been felt by employers. Data collection took place from mid-January through July, with half of the interviews being completed in the first three months of the year. Most of the key metrics that we measure-including premiums and cost sharing-reflect employers' decisions made before the full impacts of the pandemic were felt. We found that in 2020 the average annual premium for single coverage rose 4 percent, to $7,470, and the average annual premium for family coverage also rose 4 percent, to $21,342. Covered workers, on average, contributed 17 percent of the cost for single coverage and 27 percent of the cost for family coverage. Fifty-six percent of firms offered health benefits to at least some of their workers, and 64 percent of workers were covered at their own firm.

CONTENT Potentially eligible original research articles were identified through a systematic search in PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and WHO Virtual Health Library from 2000 to 2018. From the initial search, a total of 7,258 research articles were obtained. Duplicate studies were identified and removed. Observational studies on children and adolescents (5-19 years) of any gender, ethnicity and country were included in which the outcome measured was either a scoring of/ association between nutrition knowledge and practices. After screening using the inclusion criteria, 13 studies were selected for this paper. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Four studies reported non-significant association between overall nutrition knowledge and practices. Only two studies found a significant association, out of which one showed a weak association highlighting that nutrition knowledge is not sufficient to result in healthy eating. Other factors which showed significant but weak associations with knowledge/practices included age, gender, nutritional status and lifestyle, peer influence, parents'/guardians' knowledge, education and occupation level. The causal relationship couldn't be examined in the present review due to the cross-sectional nature of the studies. Besides imparting knowledge through nutrition education interventions, there is a need for holistic behaviour change strategies including supporting food skills like menu planning, food shopping and cooking to encourage healthy eating habits among children. These interventions should target children from an early age, involving family/parents, teachers and peers to facilitate improvement in the food environment for sustainable change.","Thakur, Sunaina; Mathur, Pulkit",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,https://doi.org/10.1515/ijamh-2020-0192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594848/,541
153352,COVID-19 Susceptibility Mapping Using Multicriteria Evaluation.,2020-06-25,"BACKGROUND Diarrhea is frequent in patients in intensive care units (ICU) and is associated with discomfort and complications and may increase the length of stay and nursing workload. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled single-center pilot study to assess the incidence and frequency of diarrhea and the respective effects of a modified enteral diet (intervention: Peptamen® AF, rich in proteins, medium chain triglycerides and fish oil) compared to a standard diet (control: Isosource® Energy) in 90 randomized adult patients (intervention, n = 46; control, n = 44) with an ICU stay ≥5 days and tube feeding ≥3 days. Tube feeding was initiated within 72 h of ICU admission and continued up to 10 days. The caloric goal was adjusted to needs by indirect calorimetry. Gastrointestinal function, nutritional intake, and nursing workload were recorded. Follow-up was until 28 days after randomization. RESULTS Median age was 63.3 (interquartile range (IQR) 51.0-73.2) years and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II was 61.0 (IQR 47.8-74). Time to reach caloric goal (intervention: 2.2 (0.8-3.7) days (median, IQR); control: 2.0 (1.3-2.7) days; p = 0.16), length of time on study nutrition (intervention: 5.0 (3.6-6.4) days; control: 7.0 (5.3-8.7) days; p = 0.26), and calorie intake (intervention: 18.0 (12.5-20.9) kcal/kg/day; control 19.7 (17.3-23.1) kcal/kg/day; p = 0.08) did not differ between groups, with a higher protein intake for Peptamen® group (1.13 (0.78-1.31) g/kg/day vs 0.80 (0.70-0.94); p < 0.001). No difference in diarrhea incidence (intervention group: 29 (64%); control group: 31 (70%); p = 0.652), use of fecal collectors (23 (51%) vs. 24 (55%); p = 0.83), or diarrhea-free days (161 (64%) vs 196 (68%); p = 0.65) was found. Nursing workload and cost for diarrhea care were not different between the groups. In a post-hoc analysis, adjusted for treatment group, age, sex, and SAPS II score, diarrhea was associated with length of mechanical ventilation (9.5 (6.0-13.1) vs. 3.9 (3.2-4.6) days; p = 0.006) and length of ICU stay (11.0 (8.9-13.1) vs. 5.0 (3.8-6.2) days; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, we found a high incidence of diarrhea, which was not attenuated by Peptamen® AF. Patients with diarrhea stayed longer in the ICU.

193084,"If you ask them, will they come? Predictors of quarantine compliance during a hypothetical avian influenza pandemic: results from a statewide survey.",2010,"Ranpirnase [Onconase] is an amphibian oocyte/early embryo ribonuclease (RNase) of 105 amino acids in length that is capable of controlling tumour growth by degrading RNA within cancer cells, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and arresting mitosis in G(1 )phase. It represents the first successful isolation, purification and characterisation of the oocytic/early embryonic factor that is capable of controlling cell growth activities of the early embryonic tissues. Alfacell Corporation is currently conducting clinical trials of ranpirnase in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma and non-small-cell lung cancer. The company may initiate phase II clinical trials in breast cancer and oesophageal cancer in 2006. Alfacell expanded a research agreement with the National Cancer Institute in September 2002, allowing the NCI to examine the effects of ranpirnase as a radiation enhancer. However, investigation in this use of ranpirnase now appears to be discontinued. Alfacell is conducting a confirmatory phase IIIb registration trial of ranpirnase plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone in more than 360 patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma, and will assess survival as the primary endpoint. The targeted treatment group in this trial represents 90% of malignant mesothelioma patients at the time of diagnosis. The trial is being conducted in the US, Canada, Poland, Italy, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Romania, Mexico and Brazil. In April 2006, a total of 210 events (patient deaths) was reached, representing two-thirds of the required events for the study. Results from the protocol-specified first interim analysis based on one-third of the required events have been reported and the company has the option to conduct a second interim analysis of the data at any point after 210 events. A final analysis will be undertaken at 316 events. Alfacell completed a phase III trial of single-agent ranpirnase in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma in April 1999. The efficacy of ranpirnase was compared with that of doxorubicin (head-to-head). The primary objectives were overall survival, progression-free survival and quality of life. In preclinical studies, ranpirnase demonstrated significant activity against neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and chemotherapy-resistant variants of these cancer cells. Development for these indications has been discontinued. Preclinical investigations conducted by Alfacell showed synergistic antitumour effects between ranpirnase and proteasome inhibitors. However, development is this area has been discontinued. Alfacell announced in May 2003 that it would be providing ranpirnase to the federal severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) testing programme for evaluation against the human coronavirus implicated in the disease. No further development has been reported. Alfacell has received nine US and four European patents for ranpirnase. Patents issued in the US range from the 1996-issued patent (No. 5 559 212) covering the amino acid sequence of ranpirnase, to the patent (No. 6 175 003 B1) issued in January 2001 protecting the gene sequences of the compound plus another genetically engineered variant, effectively protecting the company's proprietary technology. In August 2002, Alfacell received a US patent (No. 6 423 515 B1) entitled 'Methods of Making Nucleic Acids Encoding Ribonucleases'.

201120,Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Infection Trend Using Technical Analysis Indicators,2020,"Recently, we showed that porcine sialoadhesin (pSn) mediates internalization of the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in alveolar macrophages (Vanderheijden et al., J. Virol. 77:8207-8215, 2003). In rodents and humans, sialoadhesin, or Siglec-1, has been described as a macrophage-restricted molecule and to specifically bind sialic acid moieties. In the current study, we investigated whether pSn is a sialic acid binding protein and, whether so, whether this property is important for its function as a PRRSV receptor. Using untreated and neuraminidase-treated sheep erythrocytes, we showed that pSn binds sialic acid. Furthermore, pSn-specific monoclonal antibody 41D3, which blocks PRRSV infection, inhibited this interaction. PRRSV attachment to and infection of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were both shown to be dependent on the presence of sialic acid on the virus: neuraminidase treatment of virus but not of PAM blocked infection and reduced attachment. Enzymatic removal of all N-linked glycans on the virus with N-glycosidase F reduced PRRSV infection, while exclusive removal of nonsialylated N-linked glycans of the high-mannose type with endoglycosidase H had no significant effect. Free sialyllactose and sialic acid containing (neo)glycoproteins reduced infection, while lactose and (neo)glycoproteins devoid of sialic acids had no significant effect. Studies with linkage-specific neuraminidases and lectins indicated that alpha2-3- and alpha2-6-linked sialic acids on the virion are important for PRRSV infection of PAM. From these results, we conclude that pSn is a sialic acid binding lectin and that interactions between sialic acid on the PRRS virion and pSn are essential for PRRSV infection of PAM.","Delputte, Peter L; Nauwynck, Hans J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254181/,541

This study aimed to assess the well-being of Vietnamese people after COVID-19 lockdown measures were lifted and life gradually returned to normal. An online survey was organized from 21 to 25 April 2020 among Vietnamese residents aged 18 and over. The survey was launched by the Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The WHO-5 Well-Being Index (scored 0-25) was used to score participants' well-being. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of well-being. A total of 1922 responses were analyzed (mean age: 31 years; 30.5% male; 88.2% health professionals or students in the health sector). The mean well-being score was 17.35 ± 4.97. Determinants of a high well-being score (&#8805;13) included older age, eating healthy food, practicing physical exercise, working from home, and adhering to the COVID-19 preventive measures. Female participants, persons worried about their relatives' health, and smokers were more likely to have a low well-being score. In conclusion, after the lockdown measures were lifted, the Vietnamese have people continued to follow COVID-19 preventive measures, and most of them scored high on the well-being scale. Waiting to achieve large-scale COVID-19 vaccine coverage, promoting preventive COVID-19 measures remains important, together with strategies to guarantee the well-being of the Vietnamese people.","Hoang, Tuyen Dinh; Colebunders, Robert; Fodjo, Joseph Nelson Siewe; Nguyen, Nhan Phuc Thanh; Tran, Trung Dinh; Vo, Thang Van",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,541
204139,South Korea's COVID-19 Infection Status: From the Perspective of Re-positive Test Results After Viral Clearance Evidenced by Negative Test Results,2020,"Background: Northern Italy was one of the most impacted areas by COVID. It is now widely assumed that the virus was silently spreading for at least 2 weeks before the first patient was identified. During this silent phase, and in the following weeks when the hospital system was overburdened, data collection was not performed in an accurate enough way to estimate an epidemic curve. With the aim of assessing both the dynamics of the introduction of the virus and the effectiveness of containment measures introduced, we try to reconstruct the epidemic curve using all cause mortality data. Methods: we collected all cause mortality data stratified by age from the national institute of statistics, together with COVID-related deaths data released by other government structures. Using a SEIR model together with estimates of the exposure to death time distribution, we fitted the reproduction number in different phases of the spread at regional level. Results: We estimate a reproduction number of 2.6+/-0.1 before case 1 was identified. School closures in Lombardy lowered it to 1.3. Soft lockdown measures resulted in R<0.8 and no further reductions were observed when a hard lockdown was introduced (e.g. Emilia-Romagna soft lockdown 0.67 +/-0.07, hard lockdown 0.69+/-0.071). Reproduction number for the>75 age range during hard lockdown are consistently higher than for the rest of the population (e.g. 0.98 vs 0.71 in Milan province), suggesting outbreaks in retirement facilities. Reproduction numbers in Bergamo and Brescia provinces starting from March 7th are markedly lower than in other areas with the same strict lockdown measures (Nearby provinces: 0.73, Brescia: 0.52, Bergamo 0.43) supporting the hypothesis that in those provinces a large percentage of the population had already been infected by the beginning of March.","Presotto, Luca",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14359v2.pdf,541

205572,Current Data Gaps in Modeling Essential Worker Absenteeism Due to COVID-19,2020,"The pathophysiological mechanisms of Moyamoya angiopathy (MA), which is a rare cerebrovascular condition characterized by recurrent ischemic/hemorrhagic strokes, are still largely unknown. An imbalance of vasculogenic/angiogenic mechanisms has been proposed as one possible disease aspect. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) have been hypothesized to contribute to vascular remodeling of MA, but it remains unclear whether they might be considered a disease effect or have a role in disease pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to provide a morphological, phenotypical, and functional characterization of the cEPCs from MA patients to uncover their role in the disease pathophysiology. cEPCs were identified from whole blood as CD45dimCD34+CD133+ mononuclear cells. Morphological, biochemical, and functional assays were performed to characterize cEPCs. A significant reduced level of cEPCs was found in blood samples collected from a homogeneous group of adult (mean age 46.86 ± 11.7; 86.36% females), Caucasian, non-operated MA patients with respect to healthy donors (HD; p = 0.032). Since no difference in cEPC characteristics and functionality was observed between MA patients and HD, a defective recruitment mechanism could be involved in the disease pathophysiology. Collectively, our results suggest that cEPC level more than endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) functionality seems to be a potential marker of MA. The validation of our results on a larger population and the correlation with clinical data as well as the use of more complex cellular model could help our understanding of EPC role in MA pathophysiology.","Tinelli, Francesca; Nava, Sara; Arioli, Francesco; Bedini, Gloria; Scelzo, Emma; Lisini, Daniela; Faragò, Giuseppe; Gioppo, Andrea; Ciceri, Elisa F; Acerbi, Francesco; Ferroli, Paolo; Vetrano, Ignazio G; Esposito, Silvia; Saletti, Veronica; Pantaleoni, Chiara; Zibordi, Federica; Nardocci, Nardo; Zedde, Maria Luisa; Pezzini, Alessandro; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Capone, Fioravante; Dell039,; Acqua, Maria Luisa; Vajkoczy, Peter; Tournier-Lasserve, Elisabeth; Parati, Eugenio A; Bersano, Anna; Gatti, Laura",,,541

210267,Utilizing Rapid Research Implementation and Collaborations to Assess the Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Community and Clinical Cohorts,2021,"Severe acquired respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread worldwide and acquired multiple mutations in its genome. Orf3a, an accessory protein encoded by the genome of SARS-CoV-2, plays a significant role in viral infection and pathogenesis. In the present in-silico study, 15,928 sequences of Orf3a reported worldwide were compared to identify variations in this protein. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of mutations at 173 residues of Orf3a protein. Subsequently, protein modelling was performed that revealed twelve mutations which can considerably affect the stability of Orf3a. Among the 12 mutations, three mutations (Y160H, D210Y and S171L) also lead to alterations in secondary structure and protein disorder parameters of the Orf3a protein. Further, we used predictive tools to identify five promising epitopes of B-cells, which resides in the mutated regions of Orf3a. Altogether, our study sheds light on the variations occurring in Orf3a that might contribute to alteration in protein structure and function.","Azad, Gajendra Kumar; Khan, Parimal Kumar",Biochem Biophys Rep,,541

210984,In Pursuit of COVID-19 Treatment Strategies: Are We Triggering Antimicrobial Resistance?,2020,"This research describes the development of a new multiplex real-time RT-PCR test for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with primers designed to amplify a 108 bp target on the spike surface glycoprotein (S gene) and a hydrolysis TaqMan probe designed to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2. The limit of detection (LOD) and clinical performance of this new assay were evaluated. A LOD study with inactivated virus exhibited performance equal to the modified CDC assay, with a final LOD of 1301 ± 13 genome equivalents/mL for the Northwell Health Laboratories laboratory-developed test (NWHL LDT) versus 1249 ± 14 genome equivalents/mL for the modified CDC assay. In addition, a clinical evaluation with 270 nasopharyngeal swab specimens exhibited 98.5% positive percent agreement and 99.3% negative percent agreement compared with the modified CDC assay. The NWHL LDT multiplex design allows testing of 91 patients per plate, versus a maximum of 29 patients per plate on the modified CDC assay, providing the benefit of testing significantly more patients per run and saving reagents, during a time when both of these parameters are critical. The results show that the NWHL LDT multiplex assay performs as well as the modified CDC assay but is more efficient and cost-effective and can be used as a diagnostic assay and for epidemiologic surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhen, Wei; Berry, Gregory J",J Mol Diagn,,541

Undoubtedly, the period has been stressful for nursing students. The scoping review aimed to explore the relevant evidence related to stressors and coping strategies among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The scoping review methodology was used to map the relevant evidence and synthesize the findings by framing the research question using PICOT, determining the keywords, eligibility criteria, searching the CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases for the relevant studies. The review further involved study selection based on the PRISMA flow diagram, charting the data, collecting, and summarizing the findings. The critical analysis of findings from the 13 journal articles showed that the COVID-19 period has been stressful for nursing students with classes moving online. The nursing students feared the COVID-19 virus along with experiencing anxiety and stressful situations due to distance learning, clinical training, assignments, and educational workloads. Nursing students applied coping strategies of seeking information and consultation, staying optimistic, and transference. The pandemic affected the psychological health of learners as they adjusted to the new learning structure.

217854,COVID-19: Yin and Yang and Herd Immunity,2020,"Background: Data on the performance of saliva specimens for diagnosing COVID-19 in ambulatory patients are scarce and inconsistent. We assessed saliva-based specimens for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the community setting and compared three different collection methods.Method: Prospective study conducted in three primary care centres. RT-PCR was performed in paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples collected from outpatients with a broad clinical spectrum of illness. To assess differences in collection methods, saliva specimens were obtained in a different way in each of the participating centres: supervised collection (SVC), oropharyngeal washing (OPW) and self-collection (SC).Results: NPS and saliva pairs of samples from 577 patients (median age 39 years, 44% men, 42% asymptomatic) were collected and tested, and 120 (20.8%) gave positive results. The overall agreement with NPS and kappa coefficients (Æ) for SVC, OPW and SC were 95% (Æ=0.85), 93.4% (Æ=0.76), and 93.3% (Æ=0.76), respectively. The sensitivity (95% CI) of the saliva specimens varied from 86% (72.6-93.7) for SVC to 66.7% (50.4-80) for SC samples. The sensitivity was higher in samples with lower cycle threshold (Ct) values. The best performance of RT-PCR was observed for SVC, with sensitivity (95% CI) for Ct values &#8804;30 of 100% (85.9-100) in symptomatic, and 88.9% (50.7-99.4) in asymptomatic individuals.Conclusions: Saliva is an acceptable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting. Specimens collected under supervision perform comparably to NPS and can effectively identify individuals with higher risk of transmission in real life conditions.","Fernández-González, Marta; Agulló, Vanesa; de la Rica, Alba; Infante, Ana; Carvajal, Mar; García, José Alberto; Gonzalo-Jiménez, Nieves; Cuartero, Claudio; Ruiz-García, Montserrat; de Gregorio, Carlos; Sánchez, Manuel; Masiá, Mar; Gutiérrez, Félix",J. clin. microbiol,,541

As public libraries adapt to an increasingly digital world, they must address the balance of print and electronic materials to ensure that users have access to what they want and need. While public libraries' print collections are decreasing at a slower rate than those of their academic counterparts, they are also facing increasing pressure to offer materials electronically. Public libraries must address challenges in tracking usage statistics as well as their users' attitudes towards ebooks and print materials. Resource issues must be addressed, including costs and staffing. An increased desire for flexible space within library branches may also be a consideration impacting print collections. In addressing issues of accessibility, both print and electronic materials may create barriers in some instances while increasing access in others. The closure of many public library spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has introduced new issues, including limitations to access of print materials, new ease of access to online materials, and additional resource limitations as libraries work with limited budgets and staff. While the shift to online services during the COVID-19 pandemic has likely sped up the transition to increasing availability of online resources in public libraries, an appetite for print materials remains.","Larose, C.",Dalhousie Journal of Interdisciplinary Management,,541
225013,Coronavirus and Exceptional Health Situations: The First Disaster With Benefits on Air Pollution,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the delivery of high-quality care are ongoing concerns when caring for pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We compared self-reported HRQoL and hospital quality of care among perinatal women with and without COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of perinatal women attending a tertiary maternity unit during the pandemic. Eighteen women who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 20 SARS-CoV-2-negative women were recruited. Participants completed the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure, and Quality from the Patient's Perspective questionnaires. Mean scores were compared. RESULTS: Of the Non-COVID-19 cohort, 95% (n = 19) were Caucasian, whereas 67% (n = 12) of the COVID-19 cohort were not Caucasian (&#967;2 = 16.01, P < 0.001). The mean SF-12 for physical health in the COVID-19 cohort had significantly lower scores (P < 0.002). There was no difference in mental health and well-being between cohorts. The quality of care experienced was notably similar and very positive. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly greater burden on physical health among pregnant women with COVID-19. Mental health and psychological status were similar in both groups. High quality of care during a pandemic is possible to deliver in a maternity setting, irrespective of COVID-19 status.","Alaya, Fátimah; Worrall, Amy P; O039,; Toole, Fiona; Doyle, Jillian; Duffy, Richard M; Geary, Michael P",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,541
225322,High Mortality Among Health Personnel With COVID-19 in Mexico,2020,"Background: Risk factors for SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy remain poorly understood. Understanding populations at heightened risk of acquisition is essential to more effectively target outreach and prevention efforts. Objective: To compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with and without SARS-CoV2 infection and, among those with SARS-CoV2, to compare characteristics of those who reported COVID-19 symptoms and those who were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study includes pregnant women who delivered or intended to deliver at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after initiation of a universal testing protocol on admission (April 8, 2020 - May 31, 2020). Women were dichotomized by whether they tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Among women who tested positive, women were further dichotomized by whether they endorsed symptoms of COVID-19. Bivariable analysis, and non-parametric tests of trend were used for analyses. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders as well as to examine effect modification between race and ethnicity and any other identified risk factors. Results: During the study period, 1,418 women met inclusion criteria, of whom 101 (7.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Of the 101 women who tested positive, 77 (76.2%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Compared to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV2, women who tested positive were younger and were more likely to have public insurance, to identify as Black/African-American or Latina, to be unmarried, to be obese, have pre-existing pulmonary disease, and have living children. An increasing number of living children was associated with an increasing risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and this finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders. There was no effect modification between race or ethnicity and having living children with regard to the risk of infection. There were no significant differences identified between women who were symptomatic and asymptomatic. Conclusion: Many risk factors for SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy are similar to the social and structural determinants of health that have been reported in the general population. The observed association between SARS-CoV2 infection and having children raises the possibility of children themselves as vectors of viral spread or behavior patterns of parents as mediators of acquisition.","Sakowicz, Allie; Ayala, Alexander E; Ukeje, Chideraa C; Witting, Celeste S; Grobman, William A; Miller, Emily S",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,541
225627,Professional Life During COVID-19 Crisis: An Emotional and Ethical Dilemma for the Medical Staff,2020,"The viral epidemic caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the new Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19). Fifteen percent of the Covid-19 patients will require hospital stay, and 10% of them will need urgent respiratory and hemodynamic support in the intensive care unit (ICU). Covid-19 is an infectious disease characterized by inflammatory syndrome, itself leading to reduced food intake and increased muscle catabolism. Therefore Covid-19 patients are at high risk of being malnourished, making the prevention of malnutrition and the nutritional management key aspects of care. Urgent, brutal and massive arrivals of patients needing urgent respiratory care and artificial ventilation lead to the necessity to reorganize hospital care, wards and staff. In that context, nutritional screening and care may not be considered a priority. Moreover, at the start of the epidemic, due to mask and other protecting material shortage, the risk of healthcare givers contamination have led to not using enteral nutrition, although indicated, because nasogastric tube insertion is an aerosol-generating procedure. Clinical nutrition practice based on the international guidelines should therefore adapt and the use of degraded procedures could unfortunately be the only way. Based on the experience from the first weeks of the epidemic in France, we emphasize ten challenges for clinical nutrition practice. The objective is to bring objective answers to the most frequently met issues to help the clinical nutrition caregivers to promote nutritional care in the hospitalized Covid-19 patient. We propose a flow chart for optimizing the nutrition management of the Covid-19 patients in the non-ICU wards.","Thibault, Ronan; Coëffier, Moïse; Joly, Francisca; Bohé, Julien; Schneider, Stéphane M; Déchelotte, Pierre",Eur. j. clin. nutr,,541
227209,"Optimizing Scarce Resource Allocation During COVID-19: Rapid Creation of a Regional Health-Care Coalition and Triage Teams in San Diego County, California",2020,"In December of 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus flared in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei Province, China. The pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a disease characterized by severe atypical pneumonia known as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Typical symptoms of this disease include cough, fever, malaise, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia, and, in severe cases, pneumonia.1 The high-risk group of COVID-19 patients includes people over the age of 60 years as well as people with existing cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes mellitus. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a live animal market in Wuhan. Within the first few months of the outbreak, cases were growing exponentially all over the world. The unabated spread of this deadly and highly infectious virus is a health emergency for all nations in the world and has led to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In this report, we consolidate and review the available clinically and preclinically relevant results emanating from in vitro animal models and clinical studies of drugs approved for emergency use as a treatment for COVID-19, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir combinations. These compounds have been frequently touted as top candidates to treat COVID-19, but recent clinical reports suggest mixed outcomes on their efficacies within the current clinical protocol frameworks.","Maciorowski, Dawid; Idrissi, Samir Z El; Gupta, Yash; Medernach, Brian J; Burns, Michael B; Becker, Daniel P; Durvasula, Ravi; Kempaiah, Prakasha",SLAS Discov,,541
227580,Managing a Primary Care Pediatric Practice Through COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide as a pandemic throughout 2020. Since the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cellular entry, increment of ACE2 would lead to an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the same time, an association of the ABO blood group system with COVID-19 has also been highlighted: there is increasing evidence to suggest that non-O individuals are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 than O individuals. These findings imply that simultaneous suppression of ACE2 and ABO would be a promising approach for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Notably, we have previously clarified that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are able to suppress ABO expression in vitro. Against this background, we further evaluated the effect of HDACIs on cultured epithelial cell lines, and found that HDACIs suppress both ACE2 and ABO expression simultaneously. Furthermore, the amount of ACE2 protein was shown to be decreased by one of the clinically-used HDACIs, panobinostat, which has been reported to reduce B-antigens on cell surfaces. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that panobinostat could have the potential to serve as a preventive drug against COVID-19.","Takahashi, Yoichiro; Hayakawa, Akira; Sano, Rie; Fukuda, Haruki; Harada, Megumi; Kubo, Rieko; Okawa, Takafumi; Kominato, Yoshihiko",Sci Rep,,541

No study has evaluated the time required to reverse this downward curve of MI admissions. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis on patients (N = 2415) admitted to the Emergency Departments for acute MI in nine Italian centers. Primary endpoint was the incidence rates (IRs) of MI admissions in the post-lockdown COVID-19 period (case-period: from May 4 to July 12, 2020) vs. the following control periods: January 1-February 19, 2020 (pre-lockdown period); February 20-May 3, 2020 (intra-lockdown period); May 4-July 12, 2019 (inter-year non-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: IR of admissions for MI in the post-lockdown period was higher than the intra-lockdown period (IR ratio, IRR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.42-1.81; p = 0.0001), was lower than the pre-lockdown period (IRR: 0.86, 0.77-0.96; p = 0.009) and similar to the inter-year non-COVID-19 period (IRR: 0.96, 0.87-1.07; p = 0.47). Within the case period, the increase in MI admissions was more pronounced in earlier vs later weeks (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.38, p = 0.024) and, compared to the inter-year control period, was significant for non ST-segment elevation MI (IRR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.46, p = 0.004), but was not observed for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), where hospitalizations were reduced (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.88, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study first indicates an increase in the number of admissions for MI after the removal of the national lockdown for COVID-19 in Italy. This increase was prevalent in the first weeks following the lockdown removal, but was under-represented in STEMI patients.","Rognoni, Andrea; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Solli, Martina; Mennuni, Marco G; Galiffa, Vincenzo; Rosso, Roberta; Cavallino, Chiara; Ugo, Fabrizio; De Filippo, Ovidio; Borin, Andrea; Porto, Italo; Fedele, Francesco; Mancone, Massimo; Sardella, Gennaro; Trabattoni, Daniela; Barbero, Umberto; Moncalvo, Cinzia; Verardi, Roberto; Casella, Gianni; Montalto, Claudio; Leonardi, Sergio; Azzolina, Danila; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; Patti, Giuseppe",Int J Cardiol,,541

250217,Perceived Public Stress Among Jordanians During the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 outbreak has had major impact on individual's psychological health and overall well being worldwide. Evidence shows that these psychological challenges are especially prominent in healthcare workers (HCW); especially in nurses. Indeed, several studies report that nurses suffer more psychologically because of the consequences of the pandemic compared with medical doctors. To further look into this, we systematically review the recent literature to see whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic differs between medical doctors and nurses across studies and which aspects of mental health are especially affected in nurses. RECENT FINDINGS: Across studies, there is solid evidence that nurses show poorer mental health outcomes compared with medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, prevalence rates in nurses are often higher than 50%. In contrast, general stress levels and burnout seem to be comparable between nurses and medical doctors. SUMMARY: Given that nurses suffer more from depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, special programs addressing their needs are required.","Kunz, Miriam; Strasser, Martina; Hasan, Alkomiet",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,541

We aim to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among healthcare workers and compare risk-factors between seropositive and seronegative HCWs. In this observational study, serum samples were collected from HCWs between July 13th to 26th, 2020 at Boston Medical Center (BMC). Samples were subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Participants also answered a questionnaire capturing data on demographics, history of COVID-19 symptoms, occupation, infection prevention and control measures. Overall, 95 of 1743 (5.5%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Of these, 1.8% of the participants had mild or no COVID-19 symptoms and did not require a diagnostic test. Seropositivity was not associated with gender, occupation, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) practices amongst HCWs. However, lack of physical distancing among health care workers in work areas and break room was associated with seropositivity (p = 0.05, p = 0.003, respectively). The majority of the HCWs are negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This data highlights the need to promote infection prevention measures, and the importance of distance amongst co-workers to help mitigate infection rates.","Kataria, Yachana; Cole, Manisha; Duffy, Elizabeth; de la Cena, Kyle; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M; Bouton, Tara C; Werler, Martha M; Pierre, Cassandra; Ragan, Elizabeth J; Weber, Sarah E; Jacobson, Karen R; Andry, Chris",Sci Rep,,541

It acts as an inert bulking, or stabilizing, agent. Despite its ubiquity, including in 2 of the newly launched vaccines against SARS‐CoV‐2, awareness of PEG allergy remains low. We present 6 cases of acute hypersensitivity to PEG. Accurate diagnoses in these cases posed a challenge, and although the triggering agents differed, PEG was demonstrated as the common culprit. All cases were female, with a mean age of 36.4 years. Four patients were originally suspected to have nonsteroid anti‐inflammatory drug allergy, and 2 had a history of chronic spontaneous urticaria and angioedema. Biphasic allergic reactions featured prominently in this case series. Diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion leading to a focused clinical history, supported by skin tests with PEG solutions to demonstrate sensitization. This case series highlights important clinical features of this rare, potentially serious, and increasingly recognized excipient allergy.","Cox, Fionnuala Khairin Khalib Conlon Niall",Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,,541

264729,Country Quarantine During COVID-19: Critical or Not?,2020,"The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 affects the world’s economics, social and health systems and has a great impact on every person’s life. In an attempt to control the spread of the disease, regular usage of face masks became an ordinary routine. A large proportion of the population is reporting ocular symptoms through the period of mask-wearing that are still underestimated. Thus the eyes are not only widely exposed to a potential viral invasion but are also under the influence of an additional irritant factor, the face mask usage. The results of our pilot study indicate that the presence and severity of the ocular complaints are dependent on the type of mask and the duration of usage. Now, in the COVID-19 outbreak, the protection of the anterior ocular surface is necessary more than ever to contribute to personal eye health. Based on the concept for the protective role of the tear film and specifically, its lipid layer against the SARS-CoV-2 invasion, all substances sustaining tear film balance and lipid layer thickness could be beneficial in ensuring the local defense mechanisms. Some medications approved for the treatment of dry eye symptoms may have a defensive effect against the viral invasion, which should be additionally evaluated. The topical ophthalmic application of Cyclosporine A, Chloroquine, Azithromycin, Povidone Iodine, Hypertonic saline drops might contribute to local protection and ensure high local dose in minimum systemic effects.","Marinova, Evelina Dabov Dimitar Zdravkov Yani","Biotechnology, biotechnological equipment",,541
266500,The Development of Disaster Nursing in China-from the Spirit of Nightingale to COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: There are no specific generally accepted therapies for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The full spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to mild respiratory tract illness to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multisystem organ failure, and death. The efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains unknown. We postulated that adjunctive treatment of established ARDS caused by COVID-19 with intravenous dexamethasone might change the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response and thereby reduce morbidity, leading to a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and in mortality. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label, superiority trial testing dexamethasone in 200 mechanically ventilated adult patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS caused by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Established ARDS is defined as maintaining a PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 200 mmHg on PEEP &#8805; 10 cmH2O and FiO2 &#8805; 0.5 after 12 ± 3 h of routine intensive care. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone plus standard intensive care or standard intensive care alone. Patients in the dexamethasone group will receive an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, followed by 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. The primary outcome is 60-day mortality. The secondary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days, defined as days alive and free from mechanical ventilation at day 28 after randomization. All analyses will be done according to the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the role of dexamethasone in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04325061 .

267111,COVID-19 and Alcohol Poisoning: A Fatal Competition,2021,"Cerebral ischemia (CI) is a severe cause of neurological dysfunction and mortality. Sirtuin-1 (Silent information regulator family protein 1, SIRT1), an oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylase, plays an important role in protection against several neurodegenerative disorders. The present study aims to investigate the protective role of SIRT1 after CI in experimental young and aged rats and humans. Also, the study examines the possible regulatory mechanisms of neuronal death in CI settings. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate changes in the expression of SIRT1, JNK/ERK/MAPK/AKT signaling, and pro-apoptotic caspase-3 in experimental rats and CI patients. The study findings demonstrated that, in aged experimental rats, SIRT1 activation positively influenced JNK and ERK phosphorylation and modulated neuronal survival in AKT-dependent manner. Further, the protection conferred by SIRT1 was effectively reversed by JNK inhibition and increased pro-apoptotic caspase-3 expression. In young experimental rats, SIRT1 activation decreased the phosphorylation of stress-induced JNK, ERK, caspase-3, and increased the phosphorylation of AKT after CI. Inhibition of SIRT1 reversed the protective effect of resveratrol. More importantly, in human patients, SIRT1 expression, phosphorylation of JNK/ERK/MAPK/AKT signaling and caspase-3 were up-regulated. In conclusion, SIRT1 could possibly be involved in the modulation of JNK/ERK/MAPK/AKT signaling pathway in experimental rats and humans after CI.","Teertam, Sireesh Kumar; Prakash Babu, Phanithi",Sci Rep,,541

However, subsequent studies using genetic knockouts or RNAi-mediated depletion of IRF1 provide a much broader view, linking IRF1 to a wide range of functions in protection against invading pathogens. Conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, IRF1 has been shown in recent years to mediate constitutive as well as inducible host defenses against a variety of viruses. Fine-tuning of these ancient IRF1-mediated host defenses, and countering strategies by pathogens to disarm IRF1, play crucial roles in pathogenesis and determining the outcome of infection.","Feng, Hui; Zhang, Yi-Bing; Gui, Jian-Fang; Lemon, Stanley M; Yamane, Daisuke",PLoS Pathog,,541

Using a large data set, we evaluated the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in samples submitted for respiratory testing from mid-February to mid-April 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR was developed and validated. A subset of canine and feline samples submitted for respiratory pathogen panel testing to reference laboratories in Asia, Europe, and North America were also tested for SARS-CoV-2. The frequency of respiratory pathogens was compared for the February-April period of 2020 and 2019. RESULTS: Samples from 4616 patients were included in the study and 44% of canine and 69% of feline samples were PCR positive with Mycoplasma cynos and Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma felis and feline calicivirus, respectively. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified. Positive results for respiratory samples were similar between years. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The data in this study suggest that during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in early 2020, respiratory diseases in tested pet cats and dogs were caused by common veterinary pathogens and that SARS-CoV-2 infections in dogs and cats are rare.","Michael, H T; Waterhouse, T; Estrada, M; Seguin, M A",,,541

280370,Bioimpedance Vector Patterns Changes in Response to Swimming Training: An Ecological Approach,2020,"Patients with severe COVID-19 infection exhibit a low level of oxygen in affected tissue and blood. To understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection, it is therefore necessary to understand cell function during hypoxia. We investigated aspects of human monocyte activation under hypoxic conditions. HMGB1 is an alarmin released by stressed cells. Under normoxic conditions, HMGB1 activates interferon regulatory factor (IRF)5 and nuclear factor-&#954;B in monocytes, leading to expression of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor &#945;, and interleukin 1ß, respectively. When hypoxic monocytes are activated by HMGB1, they produce proinflammatory cytokines but fail to produce type I IFN. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945;, induced by hypoxia, functions as a direct transcriptional repressor of IRF5 and IRF3. As hypoxia is a stressor that induces secretion of HMGB1 by epithelial cells, hypoxia establishes a microenvironment that favors monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines but not IFN. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Peng, Travis; Du, Shin-Yi; Son, Myoungsun; Diamond, Betty",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A,,541

285962,How Is COVID-19 Affecting South Korea? What Is Our Current Strategy?,2020,"The increasing use of insecticides, promoted by the intensification of agriculture, has raised concerns about their influence on the decline of bee colonies, which play a fundamental role in pollination. Thus, it is fundamental to elucidate the effects of insecticides on bees. This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/µL of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The results showed enzymes such as CaE3, GST, AChE, ALP, SOD, and GPX, as well as the TBARS assay, are useful biomarkers on bees. They may be used in combination as a promising tool for characterizing bee exposure to insecticides.","Decio, Pâmela; Miotelo, Lucas; Pereira, Franco Dani Campos; Roat, Thaisa Cristina; Marin-Morales, Maria Aparecida; Malaspina, Osmar",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,541

Acute stroke patients continue to present to the emergency department and they may not have the usual symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Stroke team response and management must be done within the shortest possible time to minimize worsening of the functional outcome without compromising safety of the medical team. METHODS: Infection control recommendations, emergency department protocols and stroke response pathways utilized prior to the COVID 19 pandemic within our institution were evaluated by our stroke team in collaboration with the multidisciplinary healthcare services. Challenges during the COVID-19 scenario were identified, from which a revised acute stroke care algorithm was formulated to adapt to this pandemic. RESULTS: We formulated an algorithm that incorporates practices from internationally devised protocols while tailoring certain aspects to suit the available resources in our system locally. We highlighted the significance of the following: team role designation, coordination among different subspecialties and departments, proper use of personal protective equipment and resources, and telemedicine use during this pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This pandemic has shaped the stroke team's approach in the management of acute stroke patients. Our algorithm ensures proper resource management while optimizing acute stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic in our local setting. This algorithm may be utilized and adapted for local practice and other third world countries who face similar constraints.","Co, Christian Oliver C; Yu, Jeryl Ritzi T; Macrohon-Valdez, Ma Cristina; Laxamana, Lina C; De Guzman, Vincent Paul E; Berroya-Moreno, Remy Margarette M; Mariano, Manuel M; Rivera, Peter Paul Dela Paz; Racpan-Cauntay, Joana Lyn M; Ilano, Karen Czarina S; Trias, Evita C; Domingo, Alyssa Mae C; Marcelo, Alvin Valeriano De Borja; Pineda-Franks, Maria Carissa C",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,541

Although previous studies have described the clinical aspects of COVID-19, few studies have focused on the early detection of severe COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of severe COVID-19 and to compare clinical features between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with less severe COVID-19. Patients admitted to designated hospital in the Henan Province of China who were either discharged or died prior to February 15, 2020 were enrolled retrospectively. Additionally, patients who underwent at least one of the following treatments were assigned to the severe group: continuous renal replacement therapy, high-flow oxygen absorption, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining patients were assigned to the non-severe group. Demographic information, initial symptoms, and first visit examination results were collected from the electronic medical records and compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of severe COVID-19. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify a threshold for each predictor. Altogether,104 patients were enrolled in our study with 30 and 74 patients in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that patients aged &#8805;63 years (odds ratio = 41.0; 95% CI: 2.8, 592.4), with an absolute lymphocyte value of &#8804;1.02×109/L (odds ratio = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.5, 25.2) and a C-reactive protein level of &#8805;65.08mg/L (odds ratio = 8.9; 95% CI = 1.0, 74.2) were at a higher risk of severe illness. Thus, our results could be helpful in the early detection of patients at risk for severe illness, enabling the implementation of effective interventions and likely lowering the morbidity of COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Xinkui; Yue, Xinpei; Liu, Furong; Wei, Le; Chu, Yuntian; Bao, Honghong; Dong, Yichao; Cheng, Wenjie; Yang, Linpeng",PLoS One,,541

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. However, even after a decade of coronavirus research, there are still no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat the coronavirus infection. In this context, apitherapy presents as a promising source of pharmacological and nutraceutical agents for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of COVID-19. For instance, several honeybee products, such as honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, beeswax, and bee venom, have shown potent antiviral activity against pathogens that cause severe respiratory syndromes, including those caused by human coronaviruses. In addition, the benefits of these natural products to the immune system are remarkable, and many of them are involved in the induction of antibody production, maturation of immune cells, and stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, in the absence of specific antivirals against SARS-CoV-2, apitherapy could offer one hope toward mitigating some of the risks associated with COVID-19.","Lima, William G; Brito, Júlio C M; da Cruz Nizer, Waleska S",Phytother. res,,541

The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the link between infantile colic and the gastro-intestinal microbiome. AREAS COVERED: The gastro-intestinal microbiome may already start to develop in the womb and grows exponentially immediately after birth. Factors influencing the microbiome can cause dysbiosis and precipitate symptoms of colic through several mechanisms such as increased gas-production and low grade gut inflammation. Other possible factors are immaturity of the enterohepatic bile acid cycle and administration of antibiotics and other medications during the perinatal period. An effective treatment for all colicky infants has yet to be discovered, but the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 was shown to be effective in breastfed infants with colic. The scientific databases ""Pubmed"" and ""Google scholar"" were searched from inception until 02/2020. Relevant articles were selected based on the abstract. EXPERT OPINION: Recent literature confirmed that the composition of the gastro-intestinal microbiome is associated with the development of infantile colic. It can be speculated that full sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify the microbiome down to the species level may provide answers to the etiology and management of infantile colic.","Ouald Chaib, Abdelhalim; Levy, Ingrid E; Ouald Chaib, Mariam; Vandenplas, Yvan",,,541

Therefore, elevated volume ventilations, usually reached during physical efforts and exercise, are a potential source of contamination. On the other hand, the lockdown period which has lasted for nearly 2 months and is actually involving several countries worldwide, obliged a large part of human population to sedentary behaviors, drastically reducing their physical activity level, and reducing their cardiopulmonary fitness. Therefore, cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be beneficial, so that a safe and well-weighted return to pre-lockdown active lifestyle can be efficiently planned. However, specific guidelines on exercise testing safety procedures in the era of COVID-19 are unavailable so far.

To date, over 2,000 CFTR mutations belonging to six protein-defect classes have been identified, increasing vastly our understanding of genotype/phenotype correlations. In the last 30 years, major achievements have been made in neonatal screening, antenatal diagnosis, and crucially with recent breakthroughs in the development of CFTR-directed therapies that may be effective for 90% of patients, paving the way for precision medicine.","Férec, Claude",Med Sci (Paris),,541

318417,Tracking Applications: A Factor of Mithridatism of Personal Data and Privacy in the Post-COVID-19 Era,2020,"133Ba has been standardised by direct measurements for the first time in the laboratory using two counting systems: (i) the 4&#960;ß (plastic scintillator) -Î³ coincidence, (ii) the 4&#960;ß (proportional counter) -Î³ coincidence. Furthermore, this standardisation experiment demonstrates the performance and applicability of the recently developed 4&#960;ß (plastic scintillator)-Î³ coincidence system for radionuclides decaying with complex decay schemes as well as for e, X-Î³ emitters. Additionally, 133Ba solution standards were prepared to calibrate the pressurized 4&#960; Î³ ionisation chamber and determination of the calibration coefficient. The En score is a statistical indicator of the agreement between two independent estimations. Thus, the performance of the PS system was compared to the result obtained with the PC system using the En score as specified in the ISO13528:2015. The results of measurements are acceptable if En â¦ 1.0. An En score of 0.2 was obtained which indicates that, the 133Ba activity concentration obtained by the 4&#960;ß (plastic scintillator) -Î³ coincidence and 4&#960;ß (proportional counter) -Î³ coincidence systems are in agreement. This paper presents the standardisation procedure, the results obtained by the measurements and their comparison.","Ravindra, Anuradha; Kulkarni, D B; Sathian, V; Chaudhury, Probal; Dahiwale, S S; Dhole, Sanjay D",Appl Radiat Isot,,541

Mesenchymal stem cells are known to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and could yield beneficial effects in COVID-19 ARDS. The objective of this study was to determine safety and explore efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusions in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS. A double-blind, phase 1/2a, randomized, controlled trial was performed. Randomization and stratification by ARDS severity was used to foster balance among groups. All subjects were analyzed under intention to treat design. Twenty-four subjects were randomized 1:1 to either UC-MSC treatment (n = 12) or the control group (n = 12). Subjects in the UC-MSC treatment group received two intravenous infusions (at day 0 and 3) of 100 ± 20 × 106 UC-MSCs; controls received two infusions of vehicle solution. Both groups received best standard of care. Primary endpoint was safety (adverse events [AEs]) within 6 hours; cardiac arrest or death within 24 hours postinfusion). Secondary endpoints included patient survival at 31 days after the first infusion and time to recovery. No difference was observed between groups in infusion-associated AEs. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed related to UC-MSC infusions. UC-MSC infusions in COVID-19 ARDS were found to be safe. Inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in UC-MSC-treated subjects at day 6. Treatment was associated with significantly improved patient survival (91% vs 42%, P = .015), SAE-free survival (P = .008), and time to recovery (P = .03). UC-MSC infusions are safe and could be beneficial in treating subjects with COVID-19 ARDS.","Lanzoni, Giacomo; Linetsky, Elina; Correa, Diego; Messinger Cayetano, Shari; Alvarez, Roger A; Kouroupis, Dimitrios; Alvarez Gil, Ana; Poggioli, Raffaella; Ruiz, Phillip; Marttos, Antonio C; Hirani, Khemraj; Bell, Crystal A; Kusack, Halina; Rafkin, Lisa; Baidal, David; Pastewski, Andrew; Gawri, Kunal; Leñero, Clarissa; Mantero, Alejandro M A; Metalonis, Sarah W; Wang, Xiaojing; Roque, Luis; Masters, Burlett; Kenyon, Norma S; Ginzburg, Enrique; Xu, Xiumin; Tan, Jianming; Caplan, Arnold I; Glassberg, Marilyn K; Alejandro, Rodolfo; Ricordi, Camillo",Stem cells transl. med.

325449,India fighting COVID 19: experiences and lessons learnt from the successful Kerala and Bhilwara model,2021,"Researchers have long endeavoured to accumulate triacylglycerols (TAGs) or their derivatives in easily managed microbes. The attempted production of TAGs in Escherichia coli has revealed barriers to the broad applications of this technology, including low TAG productivity and slow cell growth. We have demonstrated that an acyl-CoA-independent pathway can divert phospholipid flux into TAG formation in E. coli mediated by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (CrPDAT) without interfering with membrane functions. We then showed the synergistic effect on TAG accumulation via the acyl-CoA-independent pathway mediated by PDAT and the acyl-CoA-dependent pathway mediated by wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT). Furthermore, CrPDAT led to synchronous TAG accumulation during cell growth and this could be enhanced by supplementation of arbutin. We also showed that rationally mutated CrPDAT was capable of decreasing TAG lipase activity without impairing PDAT activity. Finally, ScPDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibited similar activities as those of CrPDAT in E. coli Our results suggest that the improvement in accumulation of TAGs and their derivatives can be achieved by fine tuning of phospholipid metabolism in E. coli Understanding the roles of PDAT in the conversion of phospholipids into TAGs during the logarithmic growth phase may enable novel strategies for the production of microbial oils.Importance Although phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) activity is presumed to exist in prokaryotic oleaginous bacteria, the corresponding gene has not been identified yet. In this manuscript, we have demonstrated that an acyl-CoA-independent pathway can divert phospholipid flux into TAG formation in E. coli mediated by exogenous CrPDAT from C. reinhardtii without interfering with membrane functions. In addition, the acyl-CoA-independent pathway and the acyl-CoA-dependent pathway had the synergistic effect on TAG accumulation. Overexpression of CrPDAT led to synchronous TAG accumulation during cell growth. In particular, CrPDAT possessed multiple catalytic activities and the rational mutation of CrPDAT led to the decrease of TAG lipase activity without impairing acyltransferase activity. The present findings suggested that applying PDAT in E. coli or other prokaryotic microbes may be a promising strategy for accumulation of TAGs and their derivatives.","Wang, Lian; Jiang, Shan; Chen, Wen-Chao; Zhou, Xue-Rong; Huang, Ting-Xuan; Huang, Feng-Hong; Wan, Xia",,,541

326557,Calculating Outcome Predictors of COVID-19 Requires Inclusion of Multiple Determinants,2021,"Background: Infectious outbreaks, most recently coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have required pervasive public health strategies, termed lockdown measures, including quarantine, social distancing, and closure of workplaces and educational establishments. Although evidence analysing immediate effects is expanding, repercussions following lockdown measures remain poorly understood. This systematic review aims to analyse biopsychosocial consequences after lockdown measures end according to short, medium, and long-term impacts. Methods: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to January 12, 2021. Reference lists were manually reviewed. Eligible studies analysed biopsychosocial functioning after lockdown measures secondary to recent infectious outbreaks ended. Lockdown measures were defined as quarantine, isolation, workplace or educational closures, social or physical distancing, and national or local closure of public institutions deemed non-essential. Studies exclusively researching outcomes during lockdown measures, examined infectious participants, or analysed lockdown measures not pertaining to an infectious outbreak were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed bias with a third resolving discrepancies. Data was extracted from published reports with further information requested from authors where necessary. The mixed methods appraisal tool assessed study quality, languages were restricted to English, German, Italian, and French and narrative synthesis was applied. Results: Of 5149 identified studies, 40 were eligible for inclusion. Psychological distress, economic repercussions, social, biological, and behavioural ramifications were observed. Short to medium-term effects comprised reactions relating to early trauma processing whereas medium to long-term repercussions manifested in maladaptive behaviours and mental health deterioration. Increased alcohol intake, stigmatisation, and economic effects were also identified consequences. High-risk groups included health care workers, children, elderly, inpatients, those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, and socially isolated individuals. Conclusions: Supporting vulnerable groups and offering education, workplace modifications, financial, and social assistance may mitigate negative repercussions. Establishing a rapid and comprehensive evidence base appraising the efficacy of such interventions and identifying areas for development is essential. This review was limited by study heterogeneity and lack of randomisation in available literature. Given the unprecedented nature and progression of COVID-19, the relevance of previous outcomes remains uncertain.

METHODS: We share novel insights from our experience in five HTx patients with COVID-19 (three within 2 months post-transplant) from our institution at the epicenter of the pandemic. RESULTS: All five exhibited moderate (requiring hospitalization, n = 3) or severe (requiring ICU and/or mechanical ventilation, n = 2) illness. Both cases with severe illness were transplanted approximately 6 weeks before presentation and acquired COVID-19 through community spread. All five patients were on immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus, and three that were transplanted within the prior 2 months were additionally on prednisone. The two cases with severe illness had profound lymphopenia with markedly elevated C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin. All had bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest imaging. MMF was discontinued in all five, and both severe cases received convalescent plasma. All three recent transplants underwent routine endomyocardial biopsies, revealing mild (n = 1) or no acute cellular rejection (n = 2), and no visible viral particles on electron microscopy. Within 30 days of admission, the two cases with severe illness remain hospitalized but have clinically improved, while the other three have been discharged.

It is mostly caused by untreated hydatid cyst, liver abscess, iatrogenic stenosis, and, rarely, trauma. CASE PRESENTATION: We experienced an extremely rare case of bronchobiliary fistula after motor vehicle accident. A 15-year-old Persian boy visited our clinic with chief complaints of persistent pleuritic chest pain, productive cough, weight loss, and fever for 2 months. Coronavirus disease 2019 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test was negative. Chest X-ray revealed hazy opacification of right lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage for acid-fast bacillus came back negative. Thoracoabdominal computed tomography scan revealed a collection in segment VIII of the liver communicating with another 13 × 5 cm multiloculated collection in the lower lobe of the right lung, with air foci within the collection. Right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed with the impression of bronchobiliary fistula. Drainage of hepatic collection with debridement, diaphragmatic repair, and open decortication of lung followed by resection of the involved segment of the right lung was performed. Histopathologic evaluations revealed abscess formation in pulmonary tissue, and many multinucleated giant cells were seen that appear to be due to foreign body remnants after previous laparotomy surgery. The foreign body seemed to be the remnants of Surgicel absorbable hemostat. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report an extremely rare case of a posttraumatic bronchobiliary fistula caused by remnants of Surgicel hemostatic agent. Bronchobiliary fistula is mainly caused by untreated hydatid cyst, liver abscess, iatrogenic stenosis, and, rarely, trauma. Migration and erosion of oxidized regenerated cellulose through the diaphragm seems to be the causative factor of bronchobiliary fistula in this patient.","Seyed-Alagheband, Seyed-Ahmad; Shahmoradi, Mohammad-Kazem; Shekouhi, Ramin",J Med Case Rep,,541

Past pandemic studies have suggested that nurses working in such crises might experience a deterioration of mental health, which could persist for years beyond the initial outbreak. This study used a qualitative descriptive design to explore nurses' experiences of working in tertiary hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 17 registered nurses who had worked for at least one year prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited from a University Health System in Singapore from March to June 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews lasting at least an hour conducted over an online platform by the principal investigator. The data were analysed through Braun and Clarke's six-step thematic analysis independently by two researchers. Three main themes emerged: (i) challenging moments of COVID-19, during which the participants reported physical and psychological challenges relating to working conditions of the hospital in the initial months of the pandemic; (ii) the professional role as nurses, in where the participants dispelled their worries and demonstrated commitment to their role as nurses; and (iii) support for nurses, which originated from their family, friends and leaders from their organizations for them to persevere and overcome the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19. The nurses in this study demonstrated resilience and professionalism despite the challenges of COVID-19. The findings highlighted the importance of a robust support system for healthcare professionals.","Goh, Yong-Shian; Ow Yong, Qing Yun Jenna; Chen, Terri Hui-Min; Ho, Su Hui Cyrus; Chee, Yin Ing Cornelia; Chee, Tji Tjian",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,541

A consecutive sample of 15 ICU patients with COVID-19 was treated with oXiris membrane for blood purification or for support of renal function due to acute kidney injury. We have included 19 non treated ICU COVID-19 patients as a control group. Two chest x-rays were analyzed for determining the chest x-ray severity score. We have found a significant decrease of SOFA score, respiratory status improved and the chest x-ray severity score was significantly decreased after 72?h of treatment. IL-6 significantly decreased after 72?h of treatment while other inflammatory markers did not. Respiratory status in the control group worsened as well as increase in SOFA score and chest x-ray severity score. Survived patients have shorter time from the onset of symptoms before starting with extracorporeal blood purification treatment and shorter time on vasoactive therapy and invasive respiratory support than deceased patients. Critically-ill patients with COVID-19 treated with extracorporeal blood purification survived significantly longer than other ICU COVID-19 patients. Treatment with oXiris membrane provides significant reduction of IL-6, leads to improvement in respiratory status, chest x-ray severity score, and reduction of SOFA score severity. Our results can suggest that ICU COVID-19 patients in an early course of a disease could be potentially a target group for earlier initiation of extracorporeal blood purification.","Premužić, Vedran Babel Jakša Gardijan Danilo Lapić Ivana Gabelica Rajka Ostojić Zvonimir Lozić Marin Pavliša Gordana Hrabak Maja Knežević Josip Rogić Dunja Mihaljević Slobodan",Therapeutic Apheresis and Dialysis,,541

Current calls for masking, social distancing and other restrictive measures for the public-good are difficult to enforce and are unstainable. As ~2-4% of the 50 million SARS-CoV2-infected have succumbed to Covid-19, the US department of Health and Human Services has organized a public-private partnership called Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to develop, produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with a January 2021 target. While a majority of the 300+ Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in various stages of preclinical and early-stage clinical testing, 6 clinical candidates are supported with over 10 billion USD plus integrated resources under the OWS agenda. This unprecedented approach is investing in the manufacture of product candidates ahead of product approval. It is enabled by new gene and recombinant pharmaceutical platform technologies that are accelerating the clinical study timeline from ~10 to less than 1 year. It is anticipated that one or more of the 6 candidates under the OWS initiative will be safe, effective and provide a sustained immune response to prevent infection and disease progression.

355599,COVID-19 and the Well-Being of the Homeless Population,2021,"Purpose: The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the global supply chains are not as resilient as expected. First investigations indicate that the main contributing factor is a lack of visibility into the supply chain's lower tiers. Simultaneously, the willingness to share data in the supply chain is low as companies mainly consider their data as proprietary. However, large amounts of data are available on the internet. The amount of this data is steadily increasing;however, the problem remains, that this data is hardly structured. Therefore, this paper investigates current approaches to use this data for supply chain transparency and derives further research directions. Methodology: The paper uses a systematic review of the literature followed by content analysis. The research process further follows established frameworks in the literature and is subdivided into distinct stages. Findings: Descriptive and clustering results show a fragmented research field, where current approaches disconnect from prior research. We classify the methods using a simple taxonomy and show developments from rule-based to supervised techniques and horizontal to vertical mining approaches. The techniques with rule-based-matching procedures mainly suffer from low recall. The current approaches do not satisfy yet essential requirements on supply chain mapping based on natural language. Originality: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior research has been attempted to review textual data usage for supply chain mapping. Therefore, this paper's main contribution is to fill this gap and add further evidence to the use of data-driven supply chain management methods.","Schopper, H.; Kersten, W.",5th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Systems (COLINS),,541

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the associations of health behaviors, food preferences, and with the incidence of MCI. METHODS: All participants aged &#8805; 55 years were potential eligible. The types of health behaviors and food preferences were recorded using the valid questionnaire. The obesity patterns were defined as follows:G-/A-, G+/A- or G-/A+, and G+/A+. The cognition tests included immediate and delayed recall, counting backward from 20, and serial 7 subtraction. The total cognitive score ranged from 0 to 27. Subjects with a score < 7 were considered as MCI. RESULTS: There were 8236 subjects included in this study. Martial arts, ping pong, and reading or writing were associated with the lower incident MCI (P = 0.039, 0.006, and 0.016, respectively). However, TV or computer usage was associated with the higher incident MCI (P = 0.029; HR: 1.455; and HR 95% CI: 1.040- 2.036). Fast foods, soft/sugared drinks, and salty snack foods increased the incident MCI (P< 0.001, = 0.032, and 0.002, respectively). G+/A- or G-/A+ and G+/A+ were associated with the lower incident MCI (P = 0.018 and < 0.001, respectively). LIMITATIONS: The basic mechanisms of health behaviors, food preferences, and obesity patterns on the risk of MCI were not fully explained. CONCLUSION: Reading or writing and G+/A+ were associated with the lower incident MCI.

The manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in transplant patients are not well understood and may have more severe symptoms, longer duration, and a worse prognosis than in immunocompetent populations. AIMS: This study proposed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. PATIENTS/METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, radiological characteristics, and clinical outcome of 24 kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated from March 20, 2020, to May 20, 2020. RESULTS: The most common symptom was shortness of breath (70.8%), followed by fever (62.5%) and cough (45.8%). Five patients had leukopenia, and only one patient had leukocytosis, while 75% of the patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count in the normal range, and 79% of recipients developed lymphopenia. All of the patients had an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein and an increase in blood urea levels. Chest CT images of 23 patients (95.8%) showed typical findings of patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Of the 24 patients, 12 were admitted to ICU (invasive care unit), and ten of 24 patients (41.6%) died, and 14 patients were discharged after complete recovery. CONCLUSION: It seems that COVID-19 is more severe in transplant patients and has poorer outcomes. Multiple underlying diseases, low O2 saturation, and multilobar view in chest CT scan may be of prognostic value. However, many SARS-CoV-2 demonstrations are similar to those of the general population.","Abolghasemi, Sara; Mardani, Masoud; Sali, Shahnaz; Honarvar, Negin; Baziboroun, Mana",Transpl Infect Dis,,541

The aim of the study is to analyze CT score in COVID-19 patients and explore its predictive value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among confirmed COVID -19 patients with available CT images between February 8, 2020 and March 7, 2020. The lung was divided into six zones by the level of tracheal carina and the level of inferior pulmonary vein bilaterally on CT. Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and overall lung involvement were rated by Likert scale of 0-4 or binary as 0 or 1. Global severity score for each targeted pattern was calculated as total score of six zones. RESULTS: There were 53 patients and 137 CT scans included in the study. There were 18(34%) of the patients classified as moderate cases while 35(66%) patients were severe/critical cases. Severe/critical patients had higher CT scores in several types of abnormalities than moderate patients from the second week to the fourth week post symptom onset. Overall lung involvement score in the second week demonstrated predictive value for severity with a sensitivity of 81.0% and specificity of 69.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Our modified semi-quantitative CT scoring system for COVID-19 patients demonstrated feasibility. Overall lung involvement score on the second week had predictive value for clinical severity and could be indicator for further treatment.","Li, Shu; Liu, Shaoyu; Wang, Ben; Li, Qiuyu; Zhang, Hua; Zeng, Lin; Ge, Hongxia; Ma, Qingbian; Shen, Ning",Respir Med,,541

For developing any preventive measure, an understanding of the zoonotic pattern for this virus is a necessity. We should have a clear knowledge of its reservoir host, its distribution pattern and spreading routes. Information about zoonotic reservoirs and its transmission among them can help to understand the COVID-19 outbreaks. In this article, we discuss about the bats as the zoonotic reservoir of several CoV strains, co-existence of bats and CoV/viruses, the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with bat SARS-like CoV, the probable source of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 strain and COVID-19 outbreak, intermediate host of CoVs and SARS-CoV-2, human to human transmission and the possibility to maintain the zoonotic barriers. Our knowledge about the zoonotic reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and its transmission ability may help develop the preventive measures and control for the future outbreak of CoV.","Chakraborty, Chiranjib; Sharma, Ashish; Bhattacharya, Manojit; Sharma, Garima; Lee, Sang-Soo",Asian Pac.

Emergence of side effects and noncompliance to therapy lead to reduced efficacy of medicines resulting in relapse of diseases. There is an increasing fact to support the incorporation of a pharmacist into clinical team due to their distinctive skills. Clinical oncology pharmacist with experience and specialized training in hematological cancers and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patient care has in-depth knowledge and skills of chemotherapy regimens including drug information, monitoring parameters of cancer treatment, dose adjustment, drug-drug interactions, adverse effects, and patient counseling skills. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The main objective of our study was to assess the significance of incorporation of clinical oncology pharmacist in ambulatory care in pediatric hematology-oncology and transplant clinic. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study was conducted at National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation hospital with duration of five months from 17 March 2019 to 16 July 2019. In this study the clinical oncology pharmacist was made available at ambulatory clinic of hematology-oncology and transplantation. The activities performed by a clinical oncology pharmacist were observed by resident BMT clinical pharmacist during the visits of patients and their families in a clinic. The BMT pharmacist is a clinical oncology pharmacist with experience and specialized training in hematological cancers and BMT patient care. Only pediatrics patients with beta thalassemia major and those who were on chemotherapy treatment and post-transplant patient were included in this study. RESULTS: During the five months' tenure, there were 1820 pediatric patients' visits in total. The clinical oncology pharmacist performed 980 direct patient interviews and documented 1665 pharmacist interventions. The majority of the documented clinical oncology pharmacist interventions were review of medication histories (n: 404, 24%) and ""deferiprone"" dose adjustments (n:400, 24%). Genomic profiling interventions were also among the commonly reported activities by the clinical oncology pharmacist. For beta thalassemia patients undergoing hydroxyurea therapy, the genomic profiling was performed to assess whether the hydroxyurea treatment is clinically effective or not (n:396, 23%). CONCLUSION: The involvement of clinical oncology pharmacist into a specialized outpatient clinic of hematology-oncology and transplant clinic plays an integral role in minimizing the adverse effect and reduction in readmission into the hospital. This is new expansion of pharmacist's role especially in underdeveloped country, considering the relevant clinical participation of clinical oncology pharmacist into specialized clinic revealing through optimized therapy and future prospect of clinical oncology pharmacist in pediatric hematology.","Ali, Kashif; Al-Quteimat, Osama; Naseem, Rida; Malhi, Saima Mehmood; Wajdi, Mehwish; Jahan, Noor; Ansari, Saqib Hussain; Shamsi, Tahir Sultan",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,541
367310,Effect of Implementation of the Lockdown on the Number of COVID-19 Deaths in Four European Countries,2020,"Abstract Variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with an asparagine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 501 (N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) show enhanced infectivity compared to wild-type, resulting in an altered pandemic situation in affected areas. These SARS-Cov-2 variants comprise the two Alpha variants (B.1.1.7, United Kingdom and B.1.1.7 with the additional E484K mutation), the Beta variant (B.1.351, South Africa), and the Gamma variant (P.1, Brazil). Understanding the binding modalities between these viral variants and the host cell receptor ACE2 allows to depict changes, but also common motifs of virus?host cell interaction. The trimeric spike protein expressed at the viral surface contains the RBD that forms the molecular interface with ACE2. All the above-mentioned variants carry between one and three amino acid exchanges within the interface-forming region of the RBD, thereby altering the binding interface with ACE2. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and decomposition of intermolecular contacts between the RBD and ACE2, we identified phenylalanine 486, glutamine 498, threonine 500, and tyrosine 505 as important interface-forming residues across viral variants. However, especially the N501Y exchange increased contact formation for this residue and also induced some local conformational changes. Comparing here, the in silico generated B.1.1.7 RBD?ACE2 complex with the now available experimentally solved structure reveals very similar behavior during MD simulation. We demonstrate, how computational methods can help to identify differences in conformation as well as contact formation for newly emerging viral variants. Altogether, we provide extensive data on all N501Y expressing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with respect to their interaction with ACE2 and how this induces reshaping of the RBD?ACE2 interface.","Socher, Eileen Conrad Marcus Heger Lukas Paulsen Friedrich Sticht Heinrich Zunke Friederike Arnold Philipp",Journal of Cellular Biochemistry,,541

The monodispersed mesoporous Fe3O4 nanospheres with self-assembled carboxyl terminated shell have been prepared via a simple solvothermal method. These as-synthesized mesoporous Fe3O4 nanospheres showed a high magnetic saturation value (Ms = 46 emu g-1) and large specific surface area (111.12 m2 g-1) which made them potential candidates as sorbents in magnetic solid-phase extraction. The adsorption experimental data fitted well with the Freundlich-Langmuir isotherm and followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Moreover influential parameters on extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection for KNM and NEO were 1.0 and 0.1 ng mL-1, respectively. Recovery assessments using real samples exhibited recoveries in the range of 96.0 ± 4.3 to 101.5 ± 7.1 %, with relative standard deviations of <10.7% (for intra- day) and <14.6% (for inter- day). The proposed method was successfully applied for different spiked and un-spiked MMR vaccine samples. The presented extraction method provides a fast, selective, robust and practical platform for the detection of KNM and NEO in MMR vaccine samples.","Hamidi, Hamideh; Zarrineh, Mahshid; Es-Haghi, Ali; Ghasempour, Alireza",J Chromatogr A,,541

375486,Lessons Learned From Cases of COVID-19 Infection in South Korea,2020,"Background: Clozapine is among the most effective antipsychotic used for treatment resistant schizophrenia. Adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia. In March 2020, at the start of the Coronavirus -19 pandemic, clinicians raised concerns regarding continuation of antipsychotic treatment, and specifically of clozapine, in patients with coronavirus disease. We aimed here at providing a short report focusing on the association between neutropenia and clozapine in a case series of psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients & Methods: We retrospectively inspected data of 10 patients on clozapine, admitted to Highgate Mental Health Centre -Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust between March and July 2020; selection was based on their COVID-19 positive PCR test. We used a linear regression model to estimate whether there was a significant drop in the neutrophil count during SARS-CoV-2 infection.The analysis was done in R using a linear regression to the origin. Results: Data were collected on 10 patients, of which 7 were males. During COVID-19 infection, neutrophils' count (ANC) 4.13 × 109/l (SD = 2.70) from a baseline value of 5.2 × 109/l (SD = 2.24). The mean relative reduction in ANC was -0.2729 (SD = 0.1666). The beta value of 0.8377 obtained with the linear regression showed that ANC values during SARS-CoV-2 infection were 83.77% of the baseline ANC showing that within the two time points there was a decrease in ANC of 16.23%. The linear regression had a pvalue = 8.96 x 10-8 and an adjusted R2 of 95.94% which shows that the variability of the data is very well explained by the model. We also compared baseline ANC with ANC values approximately a month after resolution of the infection and results indicate that ANC values return to a 95% of baseline. Conclusions: Clinicians should bear in mind that a significant drop in neutrophils' count may occur in patients taking clozapine and affected from a SARS-CoV-2 infection and that this drop is only transitory.","Bonaccorso, Stefania; Ricciardi, Angelo; Ouabbou, Sophie; Theleritis, Christos; Ross-Michealides, Arabella; Metastasio, Antonio; Stewart, Neil; Mohammed, Marwa; Schifano, Fabrizio",Brain Behav Immun Health,,541

376438,The Performance of the Iranian Red Crescent by Launching Testing Centers for the Coronavirus Disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is no clear evidence that resection of the primary tumor, or distant site resection ('metastasectomy'), yields a survival benefit in patients with stage IV breast cancer (BC). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with metastatic BC using the National Cancer Database. To evaluate variables associated with the use of surgery at the primary site, we first used univariate tests (ie, chi-squared or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests). Subsequently, we included significant predictors in a multivariate logistic regression model. We also evaluated the impact of lumpectomy, mastectomy, or metastasectomy on overall survival (OS) by conducting multivariate Cox regression analyses on the following 3 groups: (1) all patients with stage IV disease; (2) a subset of patients with a single metastatic site; and (3) another subset of patients with metastasis to multiple distant sites. RESULTS: A total of 54,871 patients with stage IV BC were included in this analysis. Variables associated with the use of surgery at the primary were: age, race, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score, insurance and facility type, involved breast quadrant, receptor status, American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical N-staging, extent of metastasis, and year of diagnosis. Survival analysis showed that both lumpectomy (median OS, 45 months) and mastectomy (median OS, 44 months) were associated with better OS compared to no surgery (median OS, 22 months). The statistical effect was larger in the subgroup with metastasis to one site, but still significant in the subgroup with multiple metastatic sites. Distant site resection also yielded a survival benefit. In patients with metastasis to only one site, metastasectomy was associated with better OS when that site was the liver, lung, or brain. CONCLUSION: This large retrospective study has shown potential utility of a surgical approach in metastatic breast cancer. More research, particularly with prospective trials assessing the combined benefit of primary and secondary site resection, is needed to corroborate these data.","Bilani, Nadeem; Elson, Leah; Liang, Hong; Elimimian, Elizabeth Blessing; Nahleh, Zeina",,,541

This online cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (SA). Participants were approached via social media (SM), and 2006 participants (953 [47.5%] females and 1053 [52.5%] males) were included in this study. SM was the leading source of information for 43.9% of the study participants. Most of the participants had various misconceptions such as ""females are more vulnerable to develop this infection, rinsing the nose with saline and sipping water every 15 minutes protects against Coronavirus, flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against this virus."" About one-third of participants (31.7%) had self-reported disturbed social, mental, and psychological wellbeing due to the pandemic. Many participants became more religious during this pandemic. Two-thirds of the study participants (68.1%) had good knowledge scores. Attitudes were highly positive in 93.1%, and practice scores were adequate in 97.7% of the participants. Participants' educational status was a predictor of high knowledge scores. Male gender and divorced status were predictors of low practice scores, and aged 51-61 years, private-sector jobs, and student status were predictors of high practice scores. Being Saudi was a predictor of a positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced status were predictors of a negative attitude. Higher education was a predictor of good concepts, while the older age and businessmen were predictors of misconceptions. Overall, our study participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices, but several myths were also prevalent. Being a PhD and a Saudi national predicted high knowledge scores and positive attitudes, respectively. A higher education level was a predictor of good concepts, and students, private-sector jobs, and aged 51-61 years were predictors of high practice scores. Study participants had good understanding of the effects of this pandemic.","Baig, Mukhtiar; Jameel, Tahir; Alzahrani, Sami H; Mirza, Ahmad A; Gazzaz, Zohair J; Ahmad, Tauseef; Baig, Fizzah; Almurashi, Saleh H",PLoS One,,541

Several studies support the involvement of TSH receptor autoantibodies (TRAbs) in the pathogenesis of GO, and a correlation between GO features and TRAbs has been reported, but not confirmed by all studies. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional investigation to determine whether there is a correlation between TRAbs and the clinical features of GO in an initial phase of the eye disease. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients with untreated GO (67 women and 23 men, age 48.9 ± 12.6 years) were included. Patients who had received treatments other than anti-thyroid drugs for hyperthyroidism or lubricants for GO were excluded. All patients underwent an endocrinological and ophthalmological evaluation, the latter including exophthalmometry, measurement of eyelid width, clinical activity score (CAS), visual acuity, assessment of diplopia, and NOSPECS score. TRAb levels were measured by a third-generation competitive immunoassay. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant, direct correlation between serum TRAb levels and CAS by linear regression analysis (R = 0.278, P = 0.007). The correlation was confirmed by a multiple regression analysis (R = 0.285; P = 0.006) including age and FT3 levels, which also correlated with CAS. There were no relationships between TRAbs and exophthalmometry, eyelid aperture, degree of diplopia, visual acuity, and NOSPECS score. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of TRAb in subjects with a recent-onset, untreated GO are directly correlated with the clinical activity of the disease, confirming a possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of GO.","Nicolì, F; Lanzolla, G; Mantuano, M; Ionni, I; Mazzi, B; Leo, M; Sframeli, A; Posarelli, C; Maglionico, M N; Figus, M; Nardi, M; Marcocci, C; Marinò, M",J. endocrinol. invest,,541

394831,Persisting on Readability Could Provoke the Risk of Misinformation: A COVID-19 Pandemic Concern,2021,"Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. It is currently used as a possible treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pre-clinical or clinical trials of favipiravir require robust, sensitive, and accurate bioanalytical methods for quantitation of favipiravir levels. Recently, several studies have been reported about developing a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for measuring favipiravir levels. However, these methods were validated predominantly for plasma samples, electrospray ionization was operated only in negative or positive mode, and clinical application of these methods has not been applied for patients with COVID-19. This study aimed was to develop a validated LC-MS/MS method for the measurement of favipiravir levels in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode and to perform a pilot study in patients with COVID-19 receiving favipiravir to demonstrate the applicability of this method in biological samples. Simple protein precipitation was used for the extraction of favipiravir from the desired matrix. Favipiravir levels were quantitated using MS / MS with an electrospray ionization source in positive and negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The chromatographic detection was performed on a reverse-phase Phenomenex C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, 100 Å) with gradient elution using 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in methanol as mobile phase. The method was linear over the concentration ranges of 0.048-50 µg/mL (in negative ionization mode) and 0.062-50 µg/mL (in positive ionization mode) with a correlation coefficient (r2) better than 0.998. The total run time was 3.5 min. The intra-assay and inter-assay %CV values were less than 7.2% and 8.0%, respectively. A simple, rapid and robust LC-MS / MS method was developed for the measurement of favipiravir and validation studies were performed. The validated method was successfully applied for drug level measurement in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir.","Eryavuz Onmaz, Duygu; Abusoglu, Sedat; Onmaz, Mustafa; Yerlikaya, Fatma Humeyra; Unlu, Ali",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,,541

395567,Predictive Value of 5 Early Warning Scores for Critical COVID-19 Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is known to be susceptible in vitro to exposure to hydroxychloroquine and its effect has been found to be potentiated by azithromycin. We hypothesise that early administration of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin can prevent respiratory deterioration in patients admitted to intensive care due to rapidly progressive COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Design: Prospective, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT). PARTICIPANTS: Adult (> 18 years) within 24 h of admission to the intensive care unit with proven or suspected COVID-19 infection, whether or not mechanically ventilated. Exclusion criteria include duration symptoms of febrile disease for &#8805; 1 week, treatment limitations in place or moribund patients, allergy or intolerance of any study treatment, and pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients will be randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to receive Hydroxychloroquine 800 mg orally in two doses followed by 400 mg daily in two doses and azithromycin 500 mg orally in one dose followed by 250 mg in one dose for a total of 5 days (HC-A group) or hydroxychloroquine + placebo (HC group) or placebo + placebo (C-group) in addition to the best standard of care, which may evolve during the trial period but will not differ between groups. Primary outcome is the composite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who are free of mechanical ventilation at day 14. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The percentage of patients who were prevented from needing intubation until day 14, ICU length of stay, and mortality (in hospital) at day 28 and 90. DISCUSSION: Although both investigational drugs are often administered off label to patients with severe COVID-19, at present, there is no data from RCTs on their safety and efficacy. In vitro and observational trial suggests their potential to limit viral replication and the damage to lungs as the most common reason for ICU admission.

398348,Conducting COVID-19-Related Research in Jordan: Are We Ready?,2020,"COVID-19, the acute respiratory tract infection (RTI) caused by the Coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has swept around the world. No country has been spared from its onslaught. Treatments that can reduce the risk of infection and mortality from the disease are desperately needed. Though high quality randomized controlled trials are lacking, some observational and interventional studies that explore the link between vitamin D and RTIs exist. Vitamin D modulates both innate as well as adaptive immunity and may potentially prevent or mitigate the complications associated with RTIs. Evidence linking vitamin D to COVID-19 include that the outbreak occurred in winter in the northern hemisphere at a time when vitamin D levels are lowest in resident populations, that blacks and minority ethnic individuals who are known to have lower levels of vitamin D appear to be disproportionately affected and have more severe complications from the disease, that vitamin D deficiency has been shown to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome and that case fatality rates increase with age and in populations with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with lower vitamin D levels. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge about the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19, the evidence linking vitamin D and RTIs, especially COVID-19, the mechanistic reasons behind the possible protective effect of vitamin D in COVID-19, and the evidence with regard to vitamin D supplementation in RTIs. It concludes with some recommendations regarding supplementation of vitamin D in patients with COVID-19.","Chandran, Manju; Chan Maung, Aye; Mithal, Ambrish; Parameswaran, Rajeev",,,541
399913,Public Opinions and Conspiracy Thinking Toward the COVID-19 Outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although hospital systems have largely halted elective surgical practices in preparing their response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, transplantation remains an essential and lifesaving surgical practice. To continue transplantation while protecting immunocompromised patients and health care workers, significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits is required. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, descriptive study of the abdominal transplant program at 1 academic center (University of California, San Francisco) and the programmatic changes undertaken to safely continue transplantations. Patient transfers, fellow use, and patient discharge education were identified as key areas requiring significant reorganization. RESULTS: The University of California, San Francisco abdominal transplant program took an early and aggressive approach to restructuring inpatient workflows and health care worker staffing. The authors formalized a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transfer system to address patients in need of services at their institution while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in their transplant ward and used technological approaches to provide virtual telehealth where possible. They also modified their transplant fellow staffing and responsibilities to develop an adequate backup system in case of potential exposures. CONCLUSION: Every transplant program is unique, and an individualized plan to adapt and modify standard clinical practices will be required to continue providing essential transplantation services. The authors' experience highlights areas of attention specific to transplant programs and may provide generalizable solutions to support continued transplantation in the COVID-19 era.","Thiessen, Carrie; Wisel, Steven A; Yamaguchi, Seiji; Dietch, Zachary C; Feng, Sandy; Freise, Chris E",Transplant. proc,,541

Our proposed framework consists of: 1) SwiftFlow, an efficient and accurate convolutional neural network (CNN) for unsupervised optical flow estimation; 2) Flow-RCNN, a flow-guided CNN for car detection and classification; and 3) an illegally parked car (IPC) candidate investigation module developed based on visual SLAM. The proposed framework was successfully embedded in a drone from ATG Robotics. The experimental results demonstrate that, firstly, our proposed SwiftFlow outperforms all other state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow estimation approaches in terms of both speed and accuracy; secondly, IPC candidates can be effectively and efficiently detected by our proposed Flow-RCNN, with a better performance than our baseline network, Faster-RCNN; finally, the actual IPCs can be successfully verified by our investigation module after drone re-localization.","Wang, Hengli; Liu, Yuxuan; Huang, Huaiyang; Pan, Yuheng; Yu, Wenbin; Jiang, Jialin; Lyu, Dianbin; Bocus, Mohammud J.; Liu, Ming; Pitas, Ioannis; Fan, Rui",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09305v1.pdf,541

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, all of which can cause severe lung injury, respiratory distress and cytokine storm. While mortality rates associated with SARS-CoV-2 are lower than those associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, it is more contagious and spreads more rapidly than these other viruses. This article summarises the epidemiology and potential options for treating COVID-19 to give a foundation for future studies of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this deadly disease.","Qu, Liujing; Li, Jinchun; Ren, Hao",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,541
401686,A swift and dynamic strategy to expand emergency department capacity for COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a model for prediction of near-term in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19 by application of a machine learning (ML) algorithm on time-series inpatient data from electronic health records. METHODS: A cohort comprised of 567 patients with COVID-19 at a large acute care healthcare system between 10 February 2020 and 7 April 2020 observed until either death or discharge. Random forest (RF) model was developed on randomly drawn 70% of the cohort (training set) and its performance was evaluated on the rest of 30% (the test set). The outcome variable was in-hospital mortality within 20-84 hours from the time of prediction. Input features included patients' vital signs, laboratory data and ECG results. RESULTS: Patients had a median age of 60.2 years (IQR 26.2 years); 54.1% were men. In-hospital mortality rate was 17.0% and overall median time to death was 6.5 days (range 1.3-23.0 days). In the test set, the RF classifier yielded a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI: 78.2% to 94.3%), specificity of 60.6% (95% CI: 55.2% to 65.8%), accuracy of 65.5% (95% CI: 60.7% to 70.0%), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 85.5% (95% CI: 80.8% to 90.2%) and area under the precision recall curve of 64.4% (95% CI: 53.5% to 75.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our ML-based approach can be used to analyse electronic health record data and reliably predict near-term mortality prediction. Using such a model in hospitals could help improve care, thereby better aligning clinical decisions with prognosis in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Parchure, Prathamesh; Joshi, Himanshu; Dharmarajan, Kavita; Freeman, Robert; Reich, David L; Mazumdar, Madhu; Timsina, Prem; Kia, Arash",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,541
402229,"New Approach to Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Complex Tertiary Care Medical Center in Madrid, Spain",2021,"Purpose: To demonstrate the validity and reliability of a smartphone app to measure ROM after stroke.Materials and methods: Twenty-one stroke survivors with a diagnosis of stroke that affected the motor cortex or subcortical motor pathways and were hospital inpatients at one of two metropolitan hospitals were recruited. A within-session test-retest design was used to compare ROM measurements taken using the GetMyROM app for iPhone to those taken by a digital inclinometer. Torque-controlled passive elbow and wrist extension were collected and statistical analysis of concurrent validity and test-retest reliability performed.Results: GetMyROM app was valid when compared to the digital inclinometer for measuring passive ROM of the elbow (r = .98, p = .0001, ICC = 0.97) and wrist (r = .97, p = .0001, ICC = 0.96) in individuals with acute stroke. Both the GetMyROM app and inclinometer demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability: ICC values are 0.84 to 0.93, and standard error of measurement between 6° to 10°.Conclusion: The GetMyROM app may be implemented in a clinical setting similar to that where the study was conducted, enabling rehabilitation physicians and therapists to use a smartphone to take precise measurements of ROM in daily clinical practice.Implications for rehabilitationApproximately half of all stroke survivors experience reduced passive upper limb range of movement.Accurate measurement of passive upper limb range of movement using validated assessments and/or instruments is paramount.This study demonstrates that the GetMyROM app is valid and reliable compared to the gold standard comparison (digital inclinometer), and is therefore appropriate to use in clinical settings to take precise measurements.","Lin, Natalie Chew Jin; Hayward, Kathryn S; D039,; Cruz, Kate; Thompson, Eloise; Li, Xia; Lannin, Natasha A",Disabil Rehabil,,541

METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study of heart failure patients inserted with remote monitoring (RM)-capable CIED. We analyzed the transmitted data of physical activity and fluid volume status of all patients, before, and during the lockdown periods between February and April 2020. The clinical status of the patients was also evaluated. Results: Device data from 429 patients implanted with CIED capable of RM were initially evaluated. Patients with an implantable loop recorder, Brugada or Long QT syndromes, and patients with incomplete transmissions were excluded. Eighty-two patients with heart failure were included. The median age was 65 years (58-72), and 53 (64.6%) subjects were men. There was a 27.1% decline in physical activity, and the median physical activity of patients significantly declined from 2.4 to 1.8 hours/day (p=0.000010).

411357,Humanitarian Training With Virtual Simulation During a Pandemic,2021,"Objective: To compare the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, and evaluate the effectiveness of their prevention and control measures. Methods: Data of COVID-19 cases reported in Guangzhou and Wenzhou as of February 29, 2020 were collected. The incidence curves of COVID-19 in two cities were constructed. The real time reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 in two cities was calculated respectively. Results: A total of 346 and 465 confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, respectively. In two cities, most cases were aged 30-59 years (Guangzhou: 54.9%; Wenzhou: 70.3%). The incidence curve peaked on 27 January, 2020 in Guangzhou and on 26 January, 2020 in Wenzhou, then began to decline in both cities. The peaks of imported COVID-19 cases from Hubei occurred earlier than the peak of COVID-19 incidences in two cities, and the peak of imported cases from Hubei occurred earlier in Wenzhou than in Guangzhou. In early epidemic phase, imported cases were predominant in both cities, then the number of local cases increased and gradually took the dominance in Wenzhou. In Guangzhou, the imported cases was still predominant. Despite the different epidemic pattern, the R(t) and the number of COVID-19 cases declined after strict prevention and control measures were taken in Guangzhou and in Wenzhou. Conclusion: The time and scale specific differences of imported COVID-19 resulted in different epidemic patterns in two cities, but the spread of the disease were effectively controlled after taking strict prevention and control measures.","He, G H; Rong, Z H; Hu, J X; Liu, T; Xiao, J P; Guo, L C; Zeng, W L; Zhu, Z H; Gong, D X; Yin, L H; Wan, D H; Wu, J L; Kang, M; Song, T; He, J F; Ma, W J",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,541
411358,Humanitarian Training with Virtual Simulation during a Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and develop a symptom-based risk score useful in primary healthcare. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Sixty-one thousand ninty-two community-dwelling participants in a nationwide population-based serosurvey completed a questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms and received an immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies between April 27 and June 22, 2020. Standardized prevalence ratios for asymptomatic infection were estimated across participant characteristics. We constructed a symptom-based risk score and evaluated its ability to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Of all, 28.7% of infections were asymptomatic (95% CI 26.1-31.4%). Standardized asymptomatic prevalence ratios were 1.19 (1.02-1.40) for men vs. women, 1.82 (1.33-2.50) and 1.45 (0.96-2.18) for individuals <20 and &#8805;80 years vs. those aged 40-59, 1.27 (1.03-1.55) for smokers vs. nonsmokers, and 1.91 (1.59-2.29) for individuals without vs. with case contact. In symptomatic population, a symptom-based score (weights: severe tiredness = 1; absence of sore throat = 1; fever = 2; anosmia/ageusia = 5) reached standardized seroprevalence ratio of 8.71 (7.37-10.3), discrimination index of 0.79 (0.77-0.81), and sensitivity and specificity of 71.4% (68.1-74.4%) and 74.2% (73.1-75.2%) for a score &#8805;3.

414376,Survival Analysis and Risk Factors in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: It is expected that COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China by the end of 2020. Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children's vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.","Zhang, Ke Chun; Fang, Yuan; Cao, He; Chen, Hongbiao; Hu, Tian; Chen, Ya Qi; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Zixin",JMIR Pediatr Parent,,541
415387,Beirut explosion effects on COVID-19 situation in Lebanon,2021,": The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may cause not only an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but also multiple organ damage and failure requiring intensive care and leading to death. Male sex, advanced age, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity have been identified as risk factors for the COVID-19 severity. Presumably, as these three cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a high prevalence of multiorgan damage. In the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome (acute cardiac injury/COVID cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias) and post-COVID-19 sequelae. Preliminary data shows that the cause of acute cardiovascular syndrome may be multifactorial and involve direct viral invasion of the heart and vascular system, as well as through the immune and inflammation-mediated systemic cytokine storm. COVID-19 survivors may also show persistently elevated blood pressure and sinus tachycardia at rest. Furthermore, poor diabetic control, persistent renal damage and cerebral sequelae, such as persistent cognitive and neuropsychiatric alterations are also frequently reported. A particular attention should be paid towards cardiovascular protection in COVID-19 patients who develop acute cardiovascular syndromes during hospitalization, and/or permanent/semipermanent sequelae after recovery from COVID-19. These conditions may require careful clinical assessment, treatment and close follow-up to avoid short-term and long-term complications.","Saeed, Sahrai; Tadic, Marijana; Larsen, Terje H; Grassi, Guido; Mancia, Giuseppe",J. hypertens,,541

The most efficient solution to end this pandemic is a safe and efficient vaccine. Classic platforms are used to develop vaccines including live-attenuated vaccine, inactivated vaccine, protein subunit vaccine, and viral vector. Nucleic acid vaccine uses next-generation platforms for their development. Vaccines are now rushing to the market. Eleven candidates are in advance development. These comprise inactivated vaccines, viral vector vaccine, nucleic acid vaccine, and the protein subunit vaccine platform, which are now quite advanced in trials in various geographic and ethnic populations. The reported severe adverse effects raised the worries about their safety. It becomes critical to know whether these vaccines will cause neurologic disorders like previously recognized vaccine-related demyelinating diseases, fever-induced seizure, and other possible deficits. We reviewed the most promising COVID-2 vaccines with a particular interest in mechanism(s) and adverse effect(s). We exemplify potential neurological problems these vaccines could cause by looking at previous studies. The current evidence indicated a minor risk of the acute neurological disorders after the application. The observation of the long-time effect is still needed.","Lu, Lu; Xiong, Weixi; Mu, Jie; Zhang, Qi; Zhang, Hesheng; Zou, Ling; Li, Weimin; He, Li; Sander, Josemir W; Zhou, Dong",Acta Neurol Scand,,541

425644,The Pandemic of COVID-19: Current Situation in South Africa,2021,"OBJECTIVES: During severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, dramatic endothelial cell damage with pulmonary microvascular thrombosis have been was hypothesized to occur. The aim was to assess whether pulmonary vascular thrombosis (PVT) is due to recurrent thromboembolism from peripheral deep vein thrombosis or to local inflammatory endothelial damage, with a superimposed thrombotic late complication. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Medical and intensive care unit wards of a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The authors report a subset of patients included in a prospective institutional study (CovidBiob study) with clinical suspicion of pulmonary vascular thromboembolism. INTERVENTIONS: Computed tomography pulmonary angiography and evaluation of laboratory markers and coagulation profile. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 55 (50.9%) patients showed PVT, with a median time interval from symptom onset of 17.5 days. Simultaneous multiple PVTs were identified in 22 patients, with bilateral involvement in 16, mostly affecting segmental/subsegmental pulmonary artery branches (67.8% and 96.4%). Patients with PVT had significantly higher ground glass opacity areas (31.7% [22.9-41] v 17.8% [10.8-22.1], p < 0.001) compared with those without PVT. Remarkably, in all 28 patients, ground glass opacities areas and PVT had an almost perfect spatial overlap. D-dimer level at hospital admission was predictive of PVT. CONCLUSIONS: The findings identified a specific radiologic pattern of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia with a unique spatial distribution of PVT overlapping areas of ground-glass opacities. These findings supported the hypothesis of a pathogenetic relationship between COVID-19 lung inflammation and PVT and challenged the previous definition of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.","De Cobelli, Francesco; Palumbo, Diego; Ciceri, Fabio; Landoni, Giovanni; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; D039,; Angelo, Armando; Steidler, Stephanie; Galli, Laura; Poli, Andrea; Fominskiy, Evgeny; Calabrò, Maria Grazia; Colombo, Sergio; Monti, Giacomo; Nicoletti, Roberto; Esposito, Antonio; Conte, Caterina; Dagna, Lorenzo; Ambrosio, Alberto; Scarpellini, Paolo; Ripa, Marco; Spessot, Marzia; Carlucci, Michele; Montorfano, Matteo; Agricola, Eustachio; Baccellieri, Domenico; Bosi, Emanuele; Tresoldi, Moreno; Castagna, Antonella; Martino, Gianvito; Zangrillo, Alberto",,,541

430169,Mask Wearing Hesitancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Iran,2021,"BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid testing is a reliable method for diagnosing viral infection in clinical samples. However, when the number of cases is huge and there are individual differences in the virus itself, the probability of false-negative results increases. With the advancement in research on the new coronavirus, new detection technologies that use serum-specific antibodies as detection targets have been developed. These detection technologies have high efficiency and shorter turnaround time, which ultimately shortens the time required for diagnosis. This article summarizes the methods that have been reported to date for the detection of the new coronavirus and discusses their principles and technical characteristics. AIMS: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of various SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and analyze their principles. METHODS: Searched reports on SARS-CoV-2 detection methods published so far, extracted the data and analyzed them. Use the primer blast function of NCBI to analyze the primers used in qRT-PCR detection. RESULTS: The detection sensitivity was the highest when nucleocapsid protein gene was used as the target, reaching 96.6%. The detection efficiency of the remaining targets ranged from 66.7% to 96.0%. Various new detection methods, like Serum specific antibody detection, can speed up the test time. However, due to the complexity of the method and higher testing requirements, it seems that it cannot be used as a complete replacement for qRT-PRC testing. CONCLUSIONS: With the advancement of technology and the improvement of methods, the detection methods of SARSCoV-2 have become more mature. These advances provided great help to the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Wang, Hao-Jia; Xiang, Yang-Hui; Hu, Rui; Ji, Rui; Wang, Yu-Ping",Ir. j. med. sci,,541

433742,Monitoring and Surveillance of COVID-19 Survival and Stay Characteristics: A Need for Hospital Preparedness in India,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the onset of a dengue vaccine controversy in late 2017, vaccine confidence has plummeted in the Philippines, leading to measles and polio outbreaks in early 2019. This protocol outlines a human-centered design (HCD) approach to co-create and test an intervention that addresses vaccine hesitancy (VH) via narrative and empathy with and among families and healthcare workers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 'Salubong' is a Filipino term that means to welcome someone back into one's life, reinforcing notions of family ties and friendships. We apply this sentiment to vaccines. Following the phases of HCD, guided by a theoretical framework, and drawing from locally held understandings of faith and acceptance, we will conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) in rural and urban Filipino communities that witnessed dramatic increases in measles cases in recent years. During qualitative engagements with caretakers, providers, and policymakers, we will collect narratives about family and community perceptions of childhood vaccinations, public health systems and opportunities to restore faith. IDIs and FGDs will continuously inform the development of (and delivery mechanisms for) story-based interventions. Once developed, we will test our co-created interventions among 800 caretakers and administer a VH questionnaire prior to and immediately following the intervention encounter. We will use the feedback gained through the survey and Kano-style questionnaires to further refine the intervention. Considering the data collection challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed workarounds to conduct data collection primarily online. We will use systematic online debriefings to facilitate comprehensive participation of the full research team. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (number 2019-44) and Ethical Commission of Heidelberg University, Faculty of Medicine (S-833/2019).

434087,May the new locally-acquired cases of COVID-19 have been linked to illegal entry into Vietnam?,2020,"This review seeks to explain three features of viral respiratory illnesses that have perplexed generations of virologists: (1) the seasonal timing of respiratory illness and the rapid response of outbreaks to weather, specifically temperature; (2) the common viruses causing respiratory illness worldwide, including year-round disease in the Tropics; (3) the rapid arrival and termination of epidemics caused by influenza and other viruses. The inadequacy of the popular explanations of seasonality is discussed, and a simple hypothesis is proposed, called temperature dependent viral tropism (TDVT), that is compatible with the above features of respiratory illness. TDVT notes that viruses can spread more effectively if they moderate their pathogenicity (thereby maintaining host mobility) and suggests that endemic respiratory viruses accomplish this by developing thermal sensitivity within a range that supports organ-specific viral tropism within the human body, whereby they replicate most rapidly at temperatures below body temperature. This can confine them to the upper respiratory tract and allow them to avoid infecting the lungs, heart, gut etc. Biochemical and tissue-culture studies show that 'wild' respiratory viruses show such natural thermal sensitivity. The typical early autumn surge of colds and the occurrence of respiratory illness in the Tropics year-round at intermediate levels are explained by the tendency for strains to adapt their thermal sensitivity to their local climate and season. TDVT has important practical implications for preventing and treating respiratory illness including Covid-19. It is testable with many options for experiments to increase our understanding of viral seasonality and pathogenicity.","Shaw Stewart, Patrick D; Bach, Julia L",Rev Med Virol,,541

Twenty five ml of sewage samples were clarified and viruses concentrated using a glycine buffer method coupled with polyethylene glycol precipitation, and viral RNA extracted using a commercial kit. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-qPCR using oligonucleotides targeting N1, S and two RdRp regions. The results of all positive samples were further confirmed by a different RT-qPCR system in an independent laboratory. S and RdRp amplicons were sequenced to confirm identity with SARS-CoV-2. Genome sequencing was performed using two strategies; a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach, and by direct metagenomics using Illumina's NGS. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 27th November 2019 (5.49 ± 0.02 log10 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies (GC) L-1), detection being confirmed by an independent laboratory and genome sequencing analysis. The samples in the subsequent three events were positive by all RT-qPCR assays; these positive results were also confirmed by an independent laboratory. The average load was 5.83 ± 0.12 log10 SARS-CoV-2 GC L-1, ranging from 5.49 ± 0.02 log10 GC L-1 (27th November 2019) to 6.68 ± 0.02 log10 GC L-1 (4th March 2020).

This study aims to assess the association between different tobacco use patterns and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, self-reported infection and social distancing behaviors in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Data come from the first wave of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) COVID-19 survey, comprising four birth cohorts (N = 13,077, aged 20-63 years) surveyed between 2 to 31 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes (symptoms, testing, diagnosis and social distancing behaviors) were compared across different product user groups (non-users, exclusive cigarette users, exclusive e-cigarettes users and dual use) using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore associations between COVID-19-related outcomes and different smoking patterns. RESULTS: Across all four cohorts, 12.6% and 4.9% of the respondents were current exclusive cigarette and e-cigarette users, respectively, with approximately 3% of the respondents being dual users. Significant differences in prevalence were observed between different tobacco use patterns and COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.02), self-reported infection (p = 0.04) and social distancing behaviors (p &lt; 0.001). Current cigarette and e-cigarette dual use was associated with 2.15-fold higher odds for reporting COVID-19 infection (aOR = 2.15;CI [1.15-4.05]). Compliance of social distancing behaviors were the lowest for current dual users (aOR = 0.58;CI [0.41-0.83]) and exclusive cigarette users (aOR = 0.72;CI [0.63-0.92]). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight dual users' higher prevalence of having COVID-19 symptoms, infection and incompliance of social distancing behaviors. Self-reported infection was associated with dual product use;dual users and exclusive cigarette users were linked to poor adherence to social distancing behaviors.

448278,"From COVID-19 to COVID-20: one virus, two diseases",2020,"We conducted a quasi-experimental study and compared hand hygiene behaviors at potential pathogen transmission events among outpatient visitors (according to structured observations a trained enumerator) before and after installation of 12 pedal-operated alcohol gel dispensers with behavioral nudges (signs attached to the dispensers) at a tertiary hospital in southern Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. The enumerator observed 243 events during the pre-intervention period and 223 events during the postintervention period. Prevalence of hand hygiene was significantly different between the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods (0 vs 24 events, or 0% vs 11%, respectively; p-value <0.001). However, 21 of 24 hand hygiene events were of participants who came from outside the observation area, used the dispensers, then left. Nonetheless, the intervention might have helped to increase access to hand hygiene materials and created opportunities for hand hygiene among hospital visitors in general.","Wichaidit, Wit; Naknual, Sommanas; Kleangkert, Nanta; Liabsuetrakul, Tippawan",J Public Health Res,,541
448747,COVID 19 - To Strive Against the Strike,2020,"The field of mRNA modifications has been steadily growing in recent years as technologies have improved and the importance of these residues became clear. However, a subfield has also arisen, specifically focused on how these modifications affect viral RNA, with the possibility that viruses can also be used as a model to best determine the role that these modifications play on cellular mRNAs. First, virologists focused on the most abundant internal mRNA modification, m6A, mapping this modification and elucidating its effects on the RNA of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. Next, less common RNA modifications including m5C, Nm and ac4C were investigated and also found to be present on viral RNA. It now appears that viral RNA is littered with a multitude of RNA modifications. In biological systems that are under constant evolutionary pressure to out compete both the host as well as newly arising viral mutants, it poses an interesting question about what evolutionary benefit these modifications provide as it seems evident, at least to this author, that these modifications have been selected for. In this review, I discuss how RNA modifications are identified on viral RNA and the roles that have now been uncovered for these modifications in regard to viral replication. Finally, I propose some interesting avenues of research that may shed further light on the exact role that these modifications play in viral replication.","Courtney, David G",,,541

The first model indicated parental autonomy support had a direct positive relation with academic self-efficacy and self-regulated learning; it also had an indirect positive effect on academic achievement. On the other hand, parental control was directly and indirectly negatively related to academic self-efficacy, self-regulated learning, and academic achievement. The second model showed that children psychological resources and academic achievement influenced types of parental involvement in homework. A multi-group analysis indicated that gender did not moderate the proposed relations in the model.

No studies examined the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between challenge stress and health illness. This study attempted to investigate the relationships between these three variables among Chinese college students. Especially, this study focused on examining whether self-efficacy moderated the effect of perceived challenge stress on students' mental health. Also, the differences were tested between male and female students in terms of these three variables. A sample of 578 Chinese college students was recruited over an approximately 12-week period from 7 Chinese universities. An online survey link was distributed through WeChat. The SPSS version 26 software was used to analyze the data. Results showed that there is no significant difference between genders in terms of perceived challenge stress, self-efficacy, and students' mental health. In addition, challenge stress was positively related to the students' mental health (beta = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01) while there was a negative association between self-efficacy and mental health (beta = -0.41, p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, self-efficacy plays a moderating role in the relationship between challenge stress and mental health (beta = -0.11, p = 0.02). Students with low self-efficacy tend to experience more mental health issues. It is suggested that Chinese colleges and universities pay more attention to students with low self-efficacy, either through faculty/staff interventions or peer counseling.

Application for the protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), rotavirus, and influenza viruses, as well as for the eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, caries, various enteric bacteria and other pathogens, and toxins have been developed. This approach is a fast, reliable, safe, and tested method for producing molecular shield and protection against emerging pathogens and epidemics. In the current pandemic situation caused by coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), this method of passive immunization could be applied for rapid protection against modifiable agents. The specific IgY antibodies start to accumulate into egg yolks about 3 weeks after the immunization of the chicken. The product can be collected safely, as the antigen is not found in the eggs. This method for microbial safety uses natural means and commonly used food substances, which have been tested and could be produced for both blocking epidemics and applying personalized medicine.","Hakalehto, Elias",Isr Med Assoc J,,541

An Observational Study on the Local Level,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health threat since December 2019, and there is still no highly effective drug to control the pandemic. To facilitate drug target identification for drug development, studies on molecular mechanisms, such as SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions, are urgently needed. In this study, we focused on Nsp2, a non-structural protein with largely unknown function and mechanism. The interactome of Nsp2 was revealed through the combination of affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and 84 proteins of high-confidence were identified. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that Nsp2-interacting proteins are involved in several biological processes such as endosome transport and translation. Network analysis generated two clusters, including ribosome assembly and vesicular transport. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay confirmed the bindings between Nsp2- and 4-interacting proteins, i.e. STAU2 (Staufen2), HNRNPLL, ATP6V1B2, and RAP1GDS1 (SmgGDS), which were randomly selected from the list of 84 proteins. Our findings provide insights into the Nsp2-host interplay and indicate that Nsp2 may play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection and serve as a potential drug target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development.","Zheng, Yun-Xiao; Wang, Lei; Kong, Wei-Sha; Chen, Hong; Wang, Xue-Ning; Meng, Qingfeng; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Guo, Shu-Juan; Jiang, He-Wei; Tao, Sheng-Ce",Acta biochim. biophys.

Informatics pharmacists can combine their clinical and information technology skills to help provide essential patient safety services related to medication management, procurement and analytics. The objective of this study was to determine the key opportunities for a pharmacist informatician to improve patient care and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Fourteen expert informatics professionals involved in the provision of digital health in Queensland, Australia, were invited to participate in a brief semistructured interview. Transcripts were manually coded, through iterative readings of the text to identify participant responses related to opportunities for a pharmacist informatician to assist during COVID-19. Inductive thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke, was used to identify groups of text related to the provision of digital health, informatics and change of practice during a pandemic. The relevant codes were then grouped into themes to help answer the research question. KEY FINDINGS: Twelve experts agreed to participate, they included nine informatics pharmacists and three digital health experts from hospital and community. Two key themes and 13 codes related to enabling safer and more efficient workflow and use of data analytics to optimise care were identified. The first theme related to 'social distancing without compromising care' for example, by using the electronic capabilities of digital hospitals and telehealth services. The second theme related to the use of real-time data streaming to optimise patient flow and timely medication procurement and management. Examples of quotes from transcripts were used to provide context and answer the research question. CONCLUSIONS: The experts interviewed identified areas where informatics pharmacists have the potential to assist with maintaining high quality patient care during this pandemic, and in future disasters. Improving awareness, training, and the integration about informatics roles as a result of this global pandemic will likely assist with future patient management in the event of future disasters.","Falconer, Nazanin; Monaghan, Corey; Snoswell, Centaine L",Int J Pharm Pract,,541

481945,Responding to the Psychological Needs of Health Workers During Pandemic: Ten Lessons from Humanitarian Work,2020,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? We sought to investigate whether carotid stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness and the aortic augmentation index are altered in young adults 3-4 weeks after contraction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared with young healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We found that carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and the aortic augmentation index were greater in young adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with healthy young adults. These findings provide additional evidence for detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 on young adult vasculature, which might have implications for cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT: Contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been observed to cause decrements in vascular function of young adults. However, less is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on arterial stiffness and structure, which might have additional implications for cardiovascular health. The purpose of this study was to assess the carotid artery stiffness and structure using ultrasound and the aortic augmentation index (AIx) using applanation tonometry in young adults after they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that carotid artery stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and aortic AIx would be elevated in young adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared with healthy young adults. We evaluated 15 young adults (six male and nine female; 20 ± 1 years of age; body mass index, 24 ± 3 kg m-2 ) 3-4 weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result compared with young healthy adults (five male and 10 female; 23 ± 1 years of age; body mass index, 22 ± 2 kg m-2 ) who were evaluated before the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and cIMT were assessed using ultrasound, whereas aortic AIx and aortic AIx standardized to 75 beats min-1 (AIx@HR75) were assessed from carotid pulse wave analysis using SphygmoCor. Group differences were observed for carotid stiffness (control, 5 ± 1 m s-1 ; SARS-CoV-2, 6 ± 1 m s-1 ), Young's modulus (control, 396 ± 120 kPa; SARS-CoV-2, 576 ± 224 kPa), aortic AIx (control, 3 ± 13%; SARS-CoV-2, 13 ± 9%) and aortic AIx@HR75 (control, -3 ± 16%; SARS-CoV-2, 10 ± 7%; P < 0.05). However, cIMT was similar between groups (control, 0.42 ± 0.06 mm; SARS-CoV-2, 0.44 ± 0.08 mm; P > 0.05). This cross-sectional analysis revealed higher carotid artery stiffness and aortic stiffness among young adults with SARS-CoV-2. These results provide further evidence of cardiovascular impairments among young adults recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be considered for cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2.","Szeghy, Rachel E; Province, Valesha M; Stute, Nina L; Augenreich, Marc A; Koontz, Laurel K; Stickford, Jonathon L; Stickford, Abigail S L; Ratchford, Stephen M",Exp. physiol,,541

UK Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) national guidelines states that 'masks must be well-fitting and fit for purpose, fully covering the mouth and nose'. AIM: To review the fit of the FRSM supplied to the NHS front line workers against the national IPC guidelines and, through re-audit, assess for improvements in fit with FRSM worn with a plastic strap (intervention A) and FFP3 mask (intervention B). METHOD: A three-part closed-loop audit was carried out comprising controlled observation, observation in the clinical area and questionnaire. Re-audit was carried out following interventions A and B. RESULTS: FRSMs slipped below the nose in 43% and below the mouth of 10% of participants during the controlled observation and below the nose (above or below the mouth) in 30% of staff in the clinical area.

484482,Emergency Department Changes to Combat COVID-19 in Oman,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China at the end of December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic zoonotic virus and closely related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic due to its high infectiousness, and worldwide morbidities and mortalities. The Chinese scientists at the start of the outbreak reported genome sequences, which made the characterization of glycoproteins and other structural proteins possible. Moreover, researchers across the world have widely focused on understanding basic biology, developing vaccines, and therapeutic drugs against the COVID-19. However, until now, no promising treatment options, as well as vaccines, are available. In this review, we have described SARS-CoV-2's genome, transmission, and pathogenicity. We also discussed novel potential therapeutic agents that can help to treat the COVID-19 patients.","Khan, Suliman; Tombuloglu, Huseyin; Hassanein, Sameh E; Rehman, Suriya; Bozkurt, Ayhan; Cevik, Emre; Abdel-Ghany, Shaimaa; Nabi, Ghulam; Ali, Ashaq; Sabit, Hussein",Eur J Pharmacol,,541

PURPOSE: To evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates and COVID-19 outcomes, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them. (PROSPERO: CRD42020187078). DATA SOURCES: English-language articles in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, searched from inception through 31 August 2020. Gray literature sources were searched through 2 November 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies examining SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, or deaths by race/ethnicity in U.S. settings. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by a second reviewer; independent dual-reviewer assessment of quality and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: 37 mostly fair-quality cohort and cross-sectional studies, 15 mostly good-quality ecological studies, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and APM Research Lab were included. African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and COVID-19-related mortality compared with non-Hispanic White populations, but not higher case-fatality rates (mostly reported as in-hospital mortality) (moderate- to high-strength evidence). Asian populations experience similar outcomes to non-Hispanic White populations (low-strength evidence). Outcomes for other racial/ethnic groups have been insufficiently studied. Health care access and exposure factors may underlie the observed disparities more than susceptibility due to comorbid conditions (low-strength evidence). LIMITATIONS: Selection bias, missing race/ethnicity data, and incomplete outcome assessments in cohort and cross-sectional studies must be considered. In addition, adjustment for key demographic covariates was lacking in ecological studies. CONCLUSION: African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality but similar rates of case fatality. Differences in health care access and exposure risk may be driving higher infection and mortality rates.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients admitted to our institution with confirmed COVID-19 status by polymerase chain reaction between March 1, 2020, and May 13, 2020, and selected those who underwent both d-dimer and venous duplex ultrasound examination. This cohort was divided into two groups, those with and without DVT based on duplex ultrasound examination. These groups were then compared to determine the value of d-dimer in establishing this diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1170 patients were admitted with COVID-19, of which 158 were selected for this study. Of the 158, there were 52 patients with DVT and 106 without DVT. There were no differences in sex, age, race, or ethnicity between groups. Diabetes and routine hemodialysis were less commonly seen in the group with DVT. More than 90% of patients in both groups received prophylactic anticoagulation, but the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis was not predictive of DVT. All patients had elevated acute-phase d-dimer levels using conventional criteria, and 154 of the 158 (97.5%) had elevated levels with age-adjusted criteria (mean d-dimer 16,163 ± 5395 ng/mL). Those with DVT had higher acute-phase d-dimer levels than those without DVT (median, 13,602 [interquartile range, 6616-36,543 ng/mL] vs 2880 [interquartile range, 1030-9126 ng/mL], P < .001). An optimal d-dimer cutoff of 6494 ng/mL was determined to differentiate those with and without DVT (sensitivity 80.8%, specificity 68.9%, negative predictive value 88.0%). Wells DVT criteria was not found to be a significant predictor of DVT. Elevated d-dimer as defined by our optimal metric was a statistically significant predictor of DVT in both univariate and multivariable analyses when adjusting for other factors (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.79-13.39; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: d-dimer levels are uniformly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Although standard predictive criteria failed to predict DVT, our analysis showed a d-dimer of less than 6494 ng/mL may exclude DVT, potentially limiting the need for venous duplex ultrasound examination.","Cho, Edward S; McClelland, Paul H; Cheng, Olivia; Kim, Yuri; Hu, James; Zenilman, Michael E; D039,; Ayala, Marcus",J.

METHODS: The most efficient pool size was determined to be five specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 µL from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 µL each) for a total volume of 250 µL. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools. RESULTS: All 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions. CONCLUSIONS: When the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.","Abdalhamid, Baha; Bilder, Christopher R; McCutchen, Emily L; Hinrichs, Steven H; Koepsell, Scott A; Iwen, Peter C",Am J Clin Pathol,,541
494796,Assessment of the Preparedness and Planning of Academic Emergency Departments in India During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicentric Survey,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe respiratory involvement (COVID-19) in 5-20% of patients through initial immune derangement, followed by intense cytokine production and vascular leakage. Evidence of immune involvement point to the participation of T, B, and NK cells in the lack of control of virus replication leading to COVID-19. NK cells contribute to early phases of virus control and to the regulation of adaptive responses. The precise mechanism of NK cell dysregulation is poorly understood, with little information on tissue margination or turnover. We investigated these aspects by multiparameter flow cytometry in a cohort of 28 patients hospitalized with early COVID-19. Relevant decreases in CD56brightCD16+/- NK subsets were detected, with a shift of circulating NK cells toward more mature CD56dimCD16+KIR+NKG2A+ and ""memory"" KIR+CD57+CD85j+ cells with increased inhibitory NKG2A and KIR molecules. Impaired cytotoxicity and IFN-Î³ production were associated with conserved expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors and perforin. Moreover, intense NK cell activation with increased HLA-DR and CD69 expression was associated with the circulation of CD69+CD103+ CXCR6+ tissue-resident NK cells and of CD34+DNAM-1brightCXCR4+ inflammatory precursors to mature functional NK cells. Severe disease trajectories were directly associated with the proportion of CD34+DNAM-1brightCXCR4+ precursors and inversely associated with the proportion of NKG2D+ and of CD103+ NK cells. Intense NK cell activation and trafficking to and from tissues occurs early in COVID-19, and is associated with subsequent disease progression, providing an insight into the mechanism of clinical deterioration. Strategies to positively manipulate tissue-resident NK cell responses may provide advantages to future therapeutic and vaccine approaches.","Bozzano, Federica; Dentone, Chiara; Perrone, Carola; Di Biagio, Antonio; Fenoglio, Daniela; Parodi, Alessia; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Bruzzone, Bianca; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Vena, Antonio; Taramasso, Lucia; Nicolini, Laura; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pelosi, Paolo; Gratarola, Angelo; De Palma, Raffaele; Filaci, Gilberto; Bassetti, Matteo; De Maria, Andrea",PLoS Pathog,,541

TMBIM6 was identified as a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 in host cells through weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of the time course of expression of host and viral proteins. The expression and related functions of TMBIM6 were subsequently analyzed to illuminate how viral proteins interfere with the physiological function of host cells.

An assessment of mortality relative to mortality in the general population is presented. DESIGN: Retrospective population-based study. SETTING: Individual information on symptomatic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and subsequent deaths from any cause were compared with the all-cause mortality in the Swiss population of 2018. Starting 23 February 2020, mortality in COVID-19 patients was monitored for 80 days and compared with the population mortality observed in the same time of year starting 23 February 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 5 102 300 inhabitants of Switzerland aged 35-95 without COVID-19 (general population in spring 2018) and 20 769 persons tested positively for COVID-19 during the first wave in spring 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Sex-specific and age-specific mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute probabilities of death were predicted and risk was assessed in terms of relative mortality by taking the ratio between the sex-specific and age-specific absolute mortality in COVID-19 patients and the corresponding mortality in the 2018 general population. RESULTS: Absolute mortalities increased with age and were higher for males compared with females, both in the general population and in positively tested persons. A confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased the probability of death across all patient groups at least eightfold. The highest relative mortality risks were observed among males and younger patients. Male COVID-19 patients exceeded the population hazard for males (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.44). An additional year of age increased the population hazard in COVID-19 patients only marginally (HR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals, decision-makers and societies are provided with an additional population-adjusted assessment of COVID-19 mortality risk. In combination with absolute measures of risk, the relative risks presented here help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the actual impact of COVID-19.","Hothorn, Torsten; Bopp, Matthias; Günthard, Huldrych; Keiser, Olivia; Roelens, Maroussia; Weibull, Caroline E; Crowther, Michael",BMJ Open,,541

505347,COVID-19 Prediction Models Need Robust and Transparent Development,2021,"With the emergence and rapid proliferation of social media platforms and social networking sites, recent years have witnessed a surge of misinformation spreading in our daily life. Drawing on a large-scale dataset which covers more than 1.4M posts and 18M comments, we investigate the propagation of two distinct narratives--(i) conspiracy information, whose claims are generally unsubstantiated and thus referred as misinformation to some extent, and (ii) scientific information, whose origins are generally readily identifiable and verifiable--in an online social media platform. We find that conspiracy cascades tend to propagate in a multigenerational branching process while science cascades are more likely to grow in a breadth-first manner. Specifically, conspiracy information triggers larger cascades, involves more users and generations, persists longer, is more viral and bursty than science information. Content analysis reveals that conspiracy cascades contain more negative words and emotional words which convey anger, fear, disgust, surprise and trust. We also find that conspiracy cascades are more concerned with political and controversial topics. After applying machine learning models, we achieve an AUC score of nearly 90% in discriminating conspiracy from science narratives using the constructed features. We also find that conspiracy cascades are more likely to be controlled by a broader set of users than science cascades. Although political affinity is thought to affect the consumption of misinformation, there is very few evidence that political orientation of the information source plays a role during the propagation of conspiracy information. Our study provides complementing evidence to current misinformation research and has practical policy implications to stem the propagation and mitigate the influence of misinformation online.","Zhang, Yafei; Wang, Lin; Zhu, Jonathan J.H.; Wang, Xiaofan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00765v1.pdf,541

Recent experimental studies showed no obvious clinical signs in the infected dromedary camels.Aim: To study the pathological changes associated with natural MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels.Methods: Tissues from three MERS-CoV positive animals as well as two negative animals were collected and examined for the presence of pathological changes. The screening of the animals was carried out first by the rapid agglutination test and then confirmed by the RT-PCR. The selected animals ranged from six to twelve months in age. The sensitivity of the latter technique was much higher in the detection of MERS-CoV than the Rapid test (14 out of 75 animals positive or 18% versus 31 out of 75 positive or 41%).Results: MERS-CoV induced marked desquamation of the respiratory epithelium accompanied by lamina propria and submucosal mononuclear cells infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia in the respiratory tract, and interstitial pneumonia. Ciliary cell loss was seen in the trachea and turbinate. In addition, degeneration of glomerular capillaries with the complete destruction of glomerular tufts that were replaced with fibrinous exudate in renal corpuscles in the renal cortex were noticed. Expression of the MERS-CoV-S1 and MERS-CoV-N proteins was revealed in respiratory tract, and kidneys.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the pathological changes of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels under natural conditions.

Passive immunity is based on recovering hyper-immune plasma from convalescent patients, or monoclonal antibodies with elevated titer of neutralizing antibodies with high antiviral activity, that have potential for both treatment and prevention. In this review, we focused on researching the potentiality of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. Our research review includes antibody-based immunotherapy, using human monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral protein regions, specifically the spike protein regions, and using hyper-immune plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients, in which monoclonal antibodies act as immunotherapy for the cytokine storm syndrome associated with the COVID-19 infection. In addition, we will demonstrate the role of the monoclonal antibodies in the development of candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the recent progress of the diagnostic mouse monoclonal antibodies' role will be highlighted, as an accurate and rapid diagnostic assay, in the antigen detection of SARS-CoV-2. In brief, the monoclonal antibodies are the potential counter measures that may control SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, through immunotherapy and vaccine development, as well as viral detection.","Tabll, Ashraf A; Shahein, Yasser E; Omran, Mohamed M; Elnakib, Mostafa M; Ragheb, Ameera A; Amer, Khaled E",Hum Antibodies,,541
506090,Assessing Fear and Anxiety of Corona Virus Among Dental Practitioners,2020,"BACKGROUND: Imported COVID-19 cases, if unchecked, can jeopardize the effort of domestic containment. We aim to find out what sustainable border control options for different entities (e.g., countries, states) exist during the reopening phases, given their own choice of domestic control measures. METHODS: We propose a SUIHR model, which has built-in imported risk and (1-tier) contact tracing to study the cross-border spreading and control of COVID-19. Under plausible parameter assumptions, we examine the effectiveness of border control policies, in combination with internal measures, to confine the virus and avoid reverting back to more restrictive life styles again. RESULTS: When the basic reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 exceeds 2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically, and resumes ""normal"", without mandatory institutional quarantine, even very strict border control measures combined with effective contact tracing can only delay another outbreak by 6 months. For entities employing a confining domestic control policy, non-increasing net imported cases is sufficient to remain open. CONCLUSIONS: Extremely strict border control in entities, where domestic spreading is currently eliminated (e.g., China), is justifiable. However such harsh measure are not necessary for other places.

Opening the borders to entities lacking sufficient internal control of the virus should be exercised in combination with pre-departure screening and tests upon arrival.","Zhu, Zhen; Weber, Enzo; Strohsal, Till; Serhan, Duaa",Travel Med Infect Dis,,541

In March 2020 the WHO announced that the epidemic could be characterized as a pandemic. Subsequently, the WHO acknowledged the importance of providing support to the medical teams, realizing the enormous burden and stress facing this group. The aim of the present study is to review the up-to-date professional literature dealing with the psychological impact of a pandemic outbreak on medical staff. The literature existing so-far is scarce. It does, however, provide evidence of the short- and long-term impact of such epidemics on the mental health of the medical teams. Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one's medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma. A sense of control, especially regarding the means of protection and controlling infection, altruistic acceptance of the work-related risks, social support, good team-spirit in the medical unit and support from superiors are all protective factors.","Shelef, Leah; Schiff, Miriam; Zalsman, Gil",Harefuah,,541
515721,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Acute Admissions to a Secondary Referral Hospital in a Rural City in Japan: A Retrospective Study,2021,"The problem of modifying a network topology in such a way as to delay the propagation of a disease with minimal disruption of the network capacity to reroute goods/items/passengers is considered here. We find an approximate solution to the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model, which constitutes a tight upper bound to its exact solution. This upper bound allows direct structure-epidemic dynamic relations via the total communicability function. Using this approach we propose a strategy to remove edges in a network that significantly delays the propagation of a disease across the network with minimal disruption of its capacity to deliver goods/items/passengers. We apply this strategy to the analysis of the U.K. airport transportation network weighted by the number of passengers transported in the year 2003. We find that the removal of all flights connecting four origin-destination pairs in the U.K. delays the propagation of a disease by more than 300\%, with a minimal deterioration of the transportation capacity of this network. These time delays in the propagation of a disease represent an important non-pharmaceutical intervention to confront an epidemics, allowing for better preparations of the health systems, while keeping the economy moving with minimal disruptions.","Bartesaghi, Paolo; Estrada, Ernesto",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00938v1.pdf,541

This study examined the effect of wearing personal protective equipment on the view achieved using the operating microscope. METHODS: ENT surgeons assessed the area of a calibrated target visible through an operating microscope whilst wearing a range of personal protective equipment, with prescription glasses when required. The distance between the surgeon's eye and the microscope was measured in each personal protective equipment condition. RESULTS: Eleven surgeons participated. The distance from the eye to the microscope inversely correlated with the diameter and area visible (p < 0.001). The median area visible while wearing the filtering facepiece code 3 mask and full-face visor was 4 per cent (range, 4-16 per cent). CONCLUSION: The full-face visor is incompatible with the operating microscope. Solutions offering adequate eye protection for aerosol-generating procedures that require the microscope, including mastoidectomy, are urgently needed. Low-profile safety goggles should have a working distance of less than 20 mm and be compatible with prescription lenses.","Clamp, P J; Broomfield, S J",J Laryngol Otol,,541

518600,Adaptation of the National Plan for the Prevention and Fight Against Pandemic Influenza to the 2020 COVID-19 Epidemic in France,2020,"Recent research suggests greater COVID-19 prevalence in areas burdened with higher exposure to chronic air pollution, but previous studies have not examined if socially disadvantaged populations are more likely to reside in communities located at the convergence of both COVID-19 and air pollution health risks. This article presents a national scale U.S. study that investigates whether racial/ethnic minorities, socioeconomically deprived residents, and other vulnerable groups are significantly overrepresented in counties where significantly higher COVID-19 incidence spatially coincides with higher respiratory health risks from outdoor exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). COVID-19 data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database are linked to respiratory risk estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxics Assessment and variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Bivariate local measures of spatial association are implemented to identify county clusters representing relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and respiratory risk from HAP exposure. Socio-demographic characteristics of these clusters are compared using bivariate statistical tests and multivariable generalized estimating equations. Counties where greater COVID-19 incidence coincides significantly with higher HAP respiratory risk contain disproportionately higher percentages of non-Hispanic Black, socioeconomically deprived, and uninsured residents than all other U.S. counties, after controlling for spatial clustering, population density, older age, and other contextual factors. These significant socio-demographic inequities represent an important starting point for more detailed investigations of places facing the double burden of elevated COVID-19 prevalence and air pollution exposure, and also emphasize the urgent need to develop mitigation strategies for addressing both COVID-19 and chronic air pollution in socially vulnerable communities.","Chakraborty, Jayajit",Environ Res,,541

The antiviral drug, remdesivir, and the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone, have shown beneficial effects. As the current COVID-19 vaccines are not yet fully available to everyone, or they may not be readily and universally accepted, various treatment options are being evaluated and will still be needed under these conditions. One of these treatment options, passive immunization, has shown promise in some studies. Further research is needed to determine the utility of immunotherapy with convalescent plasma or artificially produced monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of symptomatic patients, and potentially for use as post-exposure prophylaxis, at least until more effective drugs are available or safe and effective vaccines are distributed and administered to everyone.","Pavia, Charles S; Wormser, Gary P",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,541
519026,Appropriate Usage of Face Masks to Prevent SARS-CoV-2: Sharpening the Messaging Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a secreted glycoprotein with roles in multiple biological processes. It contributes to host defense by interference with bacterial iron uptake and exerts immunomodulatory functions in various diseases. Here, we aimed to characterize the function of LCN2 in lung macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) using Lcn2-/- mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed strong LCN2-related effects in CD103+ DCs during homeostasis, with differential regulation of antigen processing and presentation and antiviral immunity pathways. We next validated the relevance of LCN2 in a mouse model of influenza infection, wherein LCN2 protected from excessive weight loss and improved survival. LCN2-deficiency was associated with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and increased lung T cell numbers, indicating a dysregulated immune response to influenza infection. Depletion of CD8+ T cells equalized weight loss between WT and Lcn2-/- mice, proving that LCN2 protects from excessive disease morbidity by dampening CD8+ T cell responses. In vivo T cell chimerism and in vitro T cell proliferation assays indicated that improved antigen processing by CD103+ DCs, rather than T cell intrinsic effects of LCN2, contribute to the exacerbated T cell response. Considering the antibacterial potential of LCN2 and that commensal microbes can modulate antiviral immune responses, we speculated that LCN2 might cause the observed influenza phenotype via the microbiome. Comparing the lung and gut microbiome of WT and Lcn2-/- mice by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed profound effects of LCN2 on gut microbial composition. Interestingly, antibiotic treatment or co-housing of WT and Lcn2-/- mice prior to influenza infection equalized lung CD8+ T cell counts, suggesting that the LCN2-related effects are mediated by the microbiome. In summary, our results highlight a novel regulatory function of LCN2 in the modulation of antiviral immunity.","Watzenboeck, Martin L; Drobits, Barbara; Zahalka, Sophie; Gorki, Anna-Dorothea; Farhat, Asma; Quattrone, Federica; Hladik, Anastasiya; Lakovits, Karin; Richard, Gabriel M; Lederer, Therese; Strobl, Birgit; Versteeg, Gijs A; Boon, Louis; Starkl, Philipp; Knapp, Sylvia",PLoS Pathog,,541

520735,Why May COVID-19 Overwhelm Low-Income Countries Like Pakistan?,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of the S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, pangolin coronavirus (PgCoV), RaTG13, and LyRa11, a bat virus similar to SARS-CoV-1, to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the PgCoV RBD bound human ACE2 at least as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and that both RBDs bound pangolin ACE2 efficiently. We also observed a high level of variability in binding to closely related horseshoe-bat ACE2 orthologs consistent with the heterogeneity of their RBD-binding regions. However five consensus horseshoe-bat ACE2 residues enhanced ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by an enzymatically inactive immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (hACE2-NN-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses. An hACE2-NN-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and infectious virus more efficiently than wild-type hACE2-NN-Fc. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of soluble ACE2.","Mou, Huihui; Quinlan, Brian D; Peng, Haiyong; Liu, Guanqun; Guo, Yan; Peng, Shoujiao; Zhang, Lizhou; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E; Gardner, Matthew R; Crynen, Gogce; DeVaux, Lindsey B; Voo, Zhi Xiang; Bailey, Charles C; Alpert, Michael D; Rader, Christoph; Gack, Michaela U; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael",PLoS Pathog,,541

591571,Changes in Preventive Behavior During the First 3 Months of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Iran,2020-10-12,"A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation is a state-of-the-art delivery system for genetic drugs such as DNA, messenger RNA, and small interfering RNA, which is successfully applied to COVID-19 vaccines and gains tremendous interest in therapeutic applications. Despite its importance, a molecular-level understanding of the LNP structures and dynamics is still lacking, which makes rational LNP design almost impossible. In this work, we present an extension of CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder to model and simulate all-atom LNPs with various (ionizable) cationic lipids and PEGylated lipids (PEG-lipids). These new lipid types can be mixed with any existing lipid types with or without a biomolecule of interest, and the generated systems can be simulated using various molecular dynamics engines. As a first illustration, we considered model LNP membranes with DLin-KC2-DMA (KC2) or DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) without PEG-lipids. The results from these model membranes are consistent with those from the two previous studies, albeit with mild accumulation of neutral MC3 in the bilayer center. To demonstrate Membrane Builder's capability of building a realistic LNP patch, we generated KC2- or MC3-containing LNP membranes with high concentrations of cholesterol and ionizable cationic lipids together with 2 mol % PEG-lipids. We observe that PEG-chains are flexible, which can be more preferentially extended laterally in the presence of cationic lipids due to the attractive interactions between their head groups and PEG oxygen. The presence of PEG-lipids also relaxes the lateral packing in LNP membranes, and the area compressibility modulus (KA) of LNP membranes with cationic lipids fit into typical KA of fluid-phase membranes. Interestingly, the interactions between PEG oxygen and the head group of ionizable cationic lipids induce a negative curvature. We hope that this LNP capability in Membrane Builder can be useful to better characterize various LNPs with or without genetic drugs for rational LNP design.","Park, Soohyung; Choi, Yeol Kyo; Kim, Seonghoon; Lee, Jumin; Im, Wonpil",J. chem. inf. model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546048/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00770,541

Therefore, most antiviral discovery efforts are focused on the re-purposing of clinical stage or approved drugs. While emerging data on drugs undergoing COVID-19 repurpose are intriguing, there is an undeniable need to develop broad-spectrum antivirals to prevent future viral pandemics of unknown origin. The ideal drug to curtail rapid viral spread would be a broad-acting agent with activity against a wide range of viruses. Such a drug would work by modulating host-proteins that are often shared by multiple virus families thereby enabling preemptive drug development and therefore rapid deployment at the onset of an outbreak. Targeting host-pathways and cellular proteins that are hijacked by viruses can potentially offer broad-spectrum targets for the development of future antiviral drugs. Such host-directed antivirals are also likely to offer a higher barrier to the development and selection of drug resistant mutations. Given that most approved antivirals do not target host-proteins, we reinforce the need for the development of such antivirals that can be used in pre- and post-exposure populations.","Chitalia, Vipul C.; Munawar, Ali H.",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059719/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02476-9,541

594664,Post-Hospital Discharge Strategy for COVID-19 Treatment and Control: Focus on Fangcang Hospitals,2021-03-26,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered SARS-COV-2. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, appear to have the worst outcomes with the COVID-19 virus. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries enforced stringent lockdowns to prevent the spread of the disease. India had a lockdown of 68 days between 21(st) March and 31(st) May 2020. In this background, we undertook this study to assess the effect of the lockdown on the glycemic status and weight of people with diabetes, which was indirectly an opportunity to assess the self-care practices of people with diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects included in the study were people with type 2 diabetes identified from electronic medical records who had attended the Jai Clinic and Diabetes Care Centre in Lucknow and were tested for HbA1c between 20(th) Feb 2020 and 20(th) March 2020. A total of 313 people with diabetes were identified meeting the inclusion criteria, out of which 171 were females and 142 were males. They were again tested for HbA1c between 1(st) June 2020 and 1(st) July 2020 after lockdown. Their pre- and post-lockdown HbA1c and weight were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: HbA1c was increased in 195 patients, which was statistically significant.

Early identification of emerging complications could potentially allow for immediate institution of therapy. OBJECTIVE: To intensify postoperative patient-physician communication via a cellphone-based health care application (CHA) and to evaluate its potential for early detection of complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a pilot study involving 18 radical cystectomy patients. During the first 30 d, patients received a push cellphone notification twice a week requesting data input into the CHA. This was reduced to once a week from day 31 to day 90. De-identified recorded data were reviewed by the surgeon involved. If deemed necessary, patients were contacted by the surgeon via telephone to obtain more detailed clinical information. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 18 patients enrolled, all completed the 90-d reporting period. On two occasions, interventions were necessary on the basis of data recorded on the CHA. One neobladder patient was given antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis. Another patient reported weight loss and nausea with clinical suspicion of metabolic acidosis, and his sodium bicarbonate and fluid intake were increased. Limitations include the small number of cases from a single low-volume center. CONCLUSIONS: CHA-based monitoring of clinical parameters within the crucial 90-d postoperative period following radical cystectomy provides meaningful information. In this pilot study, two potential readmissions were possibly avoided on the basis of recorded basic vital signs and early intervention. PATIENT SUMMARY: Besides regular clinic follow-up visits after radical cystectomy, additional aids such as a cellphone-based health care application can provide treating physicians with relevant clinical information and may help to identify imminent deviations from normal postoperative recovery at an early stage.","Birkhäuser, Frédéric D.; Moltzahn, Felix; Huber, Philipp M.; Zehnder, Jean-Luc; Flückiger, Sebastian; Hasler, Daniel; Mitra, Anirban P.; Zehnder, Pascal",Eur Urol Open Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euros.2020.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337472/,541

AIMS: To outline the prevalence and dynamic changing features of medical workers’ psychological issues and to review the related national policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: We systematically searched for studies on the psychological states of Chinese medical staff from 1 January 2020 to 8 May 2020. The aggregate prevalence of each psychological issue was calculated and plotted to observe the changes over time. Policies on psychological support for medical staff during the pandemic were reviewed to explore their link to the prevalence of psychological problems. RESULTS: In total, 26 studies were included in this study. A total of 22 062 medical workers were surveyed from 31 January to 27 February 2020. Medical staff exhibited a substantial prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, stress-related symptoms and sleep problems during the survey period, with aggregate prevalence rates of 27.0%, 26.2%, 42.1% and 34.5%, respectively. Cumulative meta-analyses revealed that the prevalence of psychological distress peaked at the beginning of the pandemic and subsequently exhibited a slow downward trend. CONCLUSION: Chinese medical staff displayed significant psychological disturbance during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was especially severe at the early stage. Implementing supportive policies may help alleviate ongoing psychological problems in healthcare workers.","Zhang, Huijuan; Li, Wei; Li, Hui; Zhang, Caidi; Luo, Jinjing; Zhu, Yikang; Wu, Hui; Zhu, Zhuoying; Xu, Yifeng; Wang, Jijun; Li, Chunbo",Gen Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192242/; https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100344,541

There is a renewed focus on preserving treatment outcomes while maintaining medical accessibility and decreasing medical resource utilization. Brachytherapy, which is a vital part of the treatment course of many cancers (particularly prostate and gynecologic cancers), has the ability to deliver hypofractionated radiation and thus shorten treatment time. Studies in the early 2000s demonstrated a decline in brachytherapy usage despite data showing equivalent or even superior treatment outcomes for brachytherapy in disease sites, such as the prostate and cervix. However, newer data suggest that this trend may be reversing. The renewed call for shorter radiation courses based on data showing equivalent outcomes will likely establish hypofractionated radiation as the standard of care across multiple disease sites. With shifting reimbursement, brachytherapy represents the pinnacle in hypofractionated, conformal radiation therapy, and with extensive long-term data in support of the treatment modality brachytherapy is primed for a renaissance.","Williams, Vonetta M.; Kahn, Jenna M.; Thaker, Nikhil G.; Beriwal, Sushil; Nguyen, Paul L.; Arthur, Douglas; Petereit, Daniel; Dyer, Brandon A.",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420303080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420303080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723523/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.10.018,541

In this regard, deciphering the operation of the value creation system and finding the balance between the digital strategy and the deployment of technological platforms, are the main motivations behind this research. To achieve the proposed objectives, systems theory has been adopted in the conceptualization stage, later, fuzzy logic has been used to structure a subsystem for the evaluation of input parameters. Subsequently, system dynamics have been used to build a computational representation and later, through dynamic simulation, the model has been adjusted according to iterations and the identified limits of the system. Finally, with the obtained set of results, different value creation and capture behaviors have been identified. The simulation model, based on the conceptualization of the system and the mathematical representation of the value function, allows to establish a frame of reference for the evaluation of the behaviour of IoT ecosystems in the context of the connected home.","Lopez, Carlos Alberto; Castillo, Luis Fernando; Corchado, Juan M.",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21020328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418918/,541

Although wild birds are reservoir hosts for a high diversity of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, we have little understanding of the ecology or evolution of any of these viruses. In this review, we use genome sequence and ecological data to disentangle the evolution of coronaviruses in wild birds. Specifically, we explore host range at the levels of viral genus and species, and reveal the multi-host nature of many viral species, albeit with biases to certain types of avian host. We conclude that it is currently challenging to infer viral ecology due to major sampling and technical limitations, and suggest that improved assay performance across the breadth of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, assay standardization, as well as better sequencing approaches, will improve both the repeatability and interpretation of results. Finally, we discuss cross-species virus transmission across both the wild bird – poultry interface as well as from birds to mammals. Clarifying the ecology and diversity in the wild bird reservoir has important ramifications for our ability to respond to the likely future emergence of coronaviruses in socioeconomically important animal species or human populations.","Wille, Michelle; Holmes, Edward C",FEMS Microbiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32672814/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuaa026,541

In this study, we evaluated one RT-PCR kit for this screening (ID SARS-CoV-2/UK/SA Variant Triplex(®), ID Solutions, Grabels, France) on 2207 nasopharyngeal samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using ID Solutions kit, 4.1% (92/2207) of samples were suspected to belonged to B.1.351 or P.1 variants. Next-generation sequencing that was performed on 67.4% (62/92) of these samples confirmed the presence of a B.1.351 variant in only 75.8% of the samples (47/62). Thirteen samples belonged to the UK variant (B.1.1.7), and two to A.27 with N501Y mutation. The thirteen with the UK variant presented one mutation in the S-gene, near the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion (S71F or A67S), which impacted the detection of ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion. Using another screening kit (PKampVariantDetect SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR combination 1 and 3(®) PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) on the misidentified samples, we observed that the two mutations, S71F or A67S, did not impact the detection of the UK variant.

A comprehensive understanding of the core virome of diverse rodents should therefore assist in efforts to reduce the risk of future emergence or re-emergence of rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens. RESULTS: This study aimed to describe the viral range that could be detected in the lungs of rodents from Mainland Southeast Asia. Lung samples were collected from 3284 rodents and insectivores of the orders Rodentia, Scandentia, and Eulipotyphla in eighteen provinces of Thailand, Lao PDR, and Cambodia throughout 2006–2018. Meta-transcriptomic analysis was used to outline the unique spectral characteristics of the mammalian viruses within these lungs and the ecological and genetic imprints of the novel viruses. Many mammalian- or arthropod-related viruses from distinct evolutionary lineages were reported for the first time in these species, and viruses related to known pathogens were characterized for their genomic and evolutionary characteristics, host species, and locations. CONCLUSIONS: These results expand our understanding of the core viromes of rodents and insectivores from Mainland Southeast Asia and suggest that a high diversity of viruses remains to be found in rodent species of this area. These findings, combined with our previous virome data from China, increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife and arthropod vectors in emerging disease hotspots of East and Southeast Asia.

METHODS: Surveillance physicians collected respiratory specimens from children aged <5 years hospitalized with respiratory illness and residing in the primary hospital catchment areas. We tested respiratory specimens for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus and rhinoviruses using rRT-PCR. During 2013, we conducted a health utilization survey in the primary catchment areas of the hospitals to determine the proportion of all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among children aged <5 years at the surveillance hospitals during the preceding 12 months. We estimated the respiratory virus-specific incidence of hospitalization by dividing the estimated number of hospitalized children with a laboratory confirmed infection with a respiratory virus by the population aged <5 years of the catchment areas and adjusted for the proportion of children who were hospitalized at the surveillance hospitals. RESULTS: We estimated that the annual incidence per 1000 children (95% CI) of all cause associated respiratory hospitalization was 11.5 (10–12). The incidences per 1000 children (95% CI) per year for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and influenza infections were 3(2–3), 0.5(0.4–0.8), 0.4 (0.3–0.6), 0.4 (0.3–0.6), and 0.4 (0.3–0.6) respectively.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","Sawalha, A.

The second wave of this disease has led to panic in many countries, including India and some parts of the world suffering from the third wave. As there are no proper treatment options or remedies available for this deadly infection, supportive care equipment's such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators and heavy use of steroids play a vital role in the management of COVID-19. In the midst of this pandemic, the COVID-19 patients are acquiring secondary infections such as mucormycosis also known as black fungus disease. Mucormycosis is a serious, but rare opportunistic fungal infection that spreads rapidly, and hence prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid high rate of mortality and morbidity rates. Mucormycosis is caused by the inhalation of its filamentous (hyphal form) fungi especially in the patients who are immunosuppressed. Recent studies have documented alarming number of COVID-19 patients with mucormycosis infection. Most of these patients had diabetes and were administered steroids for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and were consequently more prone to mucormycosis. Hence, the present review emphasizes mucormycosis and its related conditions, its mechanism in normal and COVID-19 affected individuals, influencing factors and challenges to overcome this black mold infection.

Treatment was successful for seven patients, six of whom were discharged without any myasthenia gravis symptoms. One patient died after eleven days of intensive care unit treatment. Although treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis and COVID-19 patients is challenging, case series of myasthenia gravis patients with COVID-19 treated in our institution demonstrates relatively favorable treatment outcome. Our data seem to support the notion that immunosuppressive medication does not seem to result in worse outcomes. Our data also support the notion that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is safe and should be administered to patients with myasthenia gravis and COVID-19 in case of myasthenia gravis worsening since benefits seem to greatly outweigh the risks.","Županić, Sven; Perić Šitum, Martina; Majdak, Maja; Karakaš, Mirna; Bašić, Silvio; Sporiš, Davor",Acta Neurol Belg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797054/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13760-021-01662-w,541

Here, we investigate the role of multiple factors on COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines, a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a “Minimum Health Standards” policy, MHS) to represent the first wave of the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and interventions. FINDINGS: Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 13-27%. The February 2021 case detection rate was estimated at ~8%, population recovered at ~9%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, mobility, and MHS adherence. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS should help the Philippines control the epidemic until vaccines are widely distributed, but disease resurgence may be occurring due to a combination of low population immunity and detection rates and new variants of concern.","Caldwell, Jamie M.; de Lara-Tuprio, Elvira; Teng, Timothy Robin; Estuar, Maria Regina Justina E.; Sarmiento, Raymond Francis R.; Abayawardana, Milinda; Leong, Robert Neil F.; Gray, Richard T.; Wood, James G.; Le, Linh-Vi; McBryde, Emma S.; Ragonnet, Romain; Trauer, James M.",Lancet Reg Health West Pac,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanwpc.2021.100211; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666606521001206; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666606521001206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34308400/,541
625478,"Successful Confinement of a Familial Cluster of COVID-19 in Qingdao, China, in the Early Phase of Pandemic",2020-12-22,"UV radiation can inactivate viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. However, designing effective UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems can be difficult because the effects of dried respiratory droplets and other fomites on UV light intensities are poorly understood. Numerical modeling of UV intensities inside virus-containing particles on surfaces can increase understanding of these possible reductions in UV intensity. We model UV intensities within spherical approximations of virions randomly positioned within spherical particles. The model virions and dried particles have sizes and optical properties to approximate SARS-CoV-2 and dried particles formed from respiratory droplets, respectively. Wavelengths used are 260 nm (germicidal UVC) and 302 nm (solar UVB). In 5- and 9-um diameter particles on a surface, illuminated by 260-nm UV light from a direction perpendicular to the surface, 10% and 18% (respectively) of simulated virions are exposed to intensities less than 1/100th of intensities in individually exposed virions (i.e, they are partially shielded). Even for 302-nm light, where the absorption is small, 11% of virions in 9-um particles have exposures 1/100th those of individually exposed virions. Calculated results show that shielding of virions in a particle can be strongly reduced by illuminating a particle either from multiple widely separated incident directions, or by illuminating a particle rotating in air (because of turbulence, Brownian diffusion, etc.) for a time sufficient to rotate through all orientations with respect to the UV illumination. Because highly UV-reflective paints and surfaces can increase the angular ranges of illumination, they appear likely to be useful for reducing shielding of virions.","Doughty, D. C.; Hill, S.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the sex-stratified cross-sectional associations of trait anxiety with intake of various macronutrients in a large population-based sample of non-diabetic adults. METHODS: N = 20,231 participants (mean age = 53.7 ± 13.6 years) of the NutriNet-Santé web-cohort, who had completed the trait anxiety subscale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (T-STAI; 2013–2016) were included in the analyses. Dietary intake was calculated from at least 3 self-administered 24-h dietary records. The associations of interest were assessed by multiple linear regression stratified by sex, owing to significant interaction tests. RESULTS: In total, 74.3% (n = 15,033) of the sample were females who had a significantly higher mean T-STAI score than did males (39.0 versus 34.8; p < 0.01). Among females, the fully-adjusted analyses showed significant positive associations of T-STAI with total carbohydrate intake (β = 0.04; p < 0.04), complex carbohydrate intake (β = 0.05; p < 0.02), and percentage energy from carbohydrates (β = 0.01; p < 0.03), as well as a significant inverse association of T-STAI with percentage energy from fat (β = -0.01; p < 0.05). As regards males, the only significant finding was an inverse association between T-STAI and percent of the mean daily energy from protein (fully-adjusted model: β = -0.01; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study found modest sex-specific associations between anxiety status and macronutrient intake among French non-diabetic adults. Prospective studies are needed to further elucidate the observed associations.","Kose, Junko; Fezeu, Léopold K.; Touvier, Mathilde; Péneau, Sandrine; Hercberg, Serge; Galan, Pilar; Andreeva, Valentina A.",Nutr J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12937-021-00733-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496851/,541

The aim of the present study is to dissect the chemical composition and the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD), a clinically used Chinese medicine for treating COVID-19 patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), a total of 129 compounds of QFPD were putatively identified. We also constructed molecular networking of mass spectrometry data to classify these compounds into 14 main clusters, in which exhibited specific patterns of flavonoids (45%), glycosides (15%), carboxylic acids (10%), and saponins (5%). The target network model of QFPD, established by predicting and collecting the targets of identified compounds, indicated a pivotal role of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) in the therapeutic efficacy of QFPD. Supportively, through transcriptomic analysis of gene expression after MXSG administration in rat model of LPS-induced pneumonia, the thrombin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway were suggested to be essential pathways for MXSG mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, changes in content of major compounds in MXSG during decoction were found by the chemical analysis. We also validate that one major compound in MXSG, i.e. glycyrrhizic acid, inhibited TLR agonists induced IL-6 production in macrophage. In conclusion, the integration of in silico and experimental results indicated that the therapeutic effects of QFPD against COVID-19 may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of MXSG, which supports the rationality of the compatibility of TCM.","Yang, Ruocong; Liu, Hao; Bai, Chen; Wang, Yingchao; Zhang, Xiaohui; Guo, Rui; Wu, Siying; Wang, Jianxun; Leung, Elaine; Chang, Hang; Li, Peng; Liu, Tiegang; Wang, Yi",Pharmacol Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311282?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360484/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104820; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820311282,541

Cancer patients are considered a vulnerable population to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may develop several COVID-19 symptoms. The heightened immunocompromised state, prolonged chronic pro-inflammatory milieu coupled with comorbid conditions are shared in both disease conditions and may influence patient outcome. Although ovarian cancer (OC) and COVID-19 are diseases of entirely different primary organs, both diseases share similar molecular and cellular characteristics in their microenvironment suggesting a potential cooperativity leading to poor outcome. In COVID-19 related cases, hospitalizations and deaths worldwide are lower in women than in males; however, comorbidities associated with OC may increase the COVID-19 risk in women. The women at the age of 50-60 years are at greater risk of developing OC as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased levels of gonadotropin and androgen, dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), hyper-coagulation and chronic inflammation are common conditions observed among OC and severe cases of COVID-19. The upregulation of common inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), among others in the sera of COVID-19 and OC subjects suggests potentially similar mechanism(s) involved in the hyper-inflammatory condition observed in both disease states. Thus, it is conceivable that the pathogenesis of OC may significantly contribute to the potential infection by SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding of the influence and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection on OC is at an early stage and in this article, we review the underlying pathogenesis presented by various comorbidities of OC and correlate their influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chaudhari, Sima; Dey Pereira, Satyajit; Asare-Warehene, Meshach; Naha, Ritam; Kabekkodu, Shama Prasada; Tsang, Benjamin K.; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu",J Ovarian Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-021-00787-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632295/,541

Methods, Design and Setting: Coronavirus pandemic data for 19 European countries were downloaded from Our World in Data, which was last updated on January 24, 2021. Data from March 21, 2020, to January 22, 2021, were included in the statistical analysis. Vitamin D (25) HD means data were collected by literature review. Poisson mixed-effect model was used to model the data. Results: European countries with Vitamin D (25) HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID 19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin D (25) HD mean greater than 50, the relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068,4.347, p value = 0.032). A statistically significant negative moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin D (25) HD mean and the number of COVID 19 deaths for each 14 day period during the COVID 19 pandemic time period. Conclusions: The observation of the significantly lower COVID 19 mortality rates in countries with the lowest annual sun exposure but the highest mean Vitamin D (25) HD levels provides support for more awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy due to the emergence of a large number of COVID 19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these observations.","Ahmad, A.; Heumann, C.; Ali, R.; Oliver, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253361; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253361v1?rss=1,541

The aim of this study is to identify high-risk phenotypes of diabetes associated with COVID-19 severity and death. METHODS: This is the first edition of a living systematic review and meta-analysis on observational studies investigating phenotypes in individuals with diabetes and COVID-19-related death and severity. Four different databases were searched up to 10 October 2020. We used a random effects meta-analysis to calculate summary relative risks (SRR) with 95% CI. The certainty of evidence was evaluated by the GRADE tool. RESULTS: A total of 22 articles, including 17,687 individuals, met our inclusion criteria. For COVID-19-related death among individuals with diabetes and COVID-19, there was high to moderate certainty of evidence for associations (SRR [95% CI]) between male sex (1.28 [1.02, 1.61], n = 10 studies), older age (>65 years: 3.49 [1.82, 6.69], n = 6 studies), pre-existing comorbidities (cardiovascular disease: 1.56 [1.09, 2.24], n = 8 studies; chronic kidney disease: 1.93 [1.28, 2.90], n = 6 studies; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 1.40 [1.21, 1.62], n = 5 studies), diabetes treatment (insulin use: 1.75 [1.01, 3.03], n = 5 studies; metformin use: 0.50 [0.28, 0.90], n = 4 studies) and blood glucose at admission (≥11 mmol/l: 8.60 [2.25, 32.83], n = 2 studies). Similar, but generally weaker and less precise associations were observed between risk phenotypes of diabetes and severity of COVID-19.

METHOD: Data come from a national sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults. Using an online platform, information was gathered during the third week of March 2020, and post‐stratification weighted to proportionally represent the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and geography. RESULTS: Nearly 15 percent of sampled respondents were categorized as high risk, scoring 7+ on the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire‐Revised (SBQ‐R). This level of risk varied across social vulnerability groupings: Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, families with children, unmarried, and younger respondents reported higher SBQ‐R scores than their counterparts (p < .000). Regression results confirm these bivariate differences and also reveal that risk factors (food insecurity, physical symptoms, and CES‐D symptomatology) are positive and significantly related to suicidality (p < .000). Additionally, resource measures are significant and negatively related to suicidality (p < .000).

In high doses (≥160 ppm), inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) has been shown to act as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, including its efficacy in vitro for coronavirus family. However, the safety of prolonged in vivo implementation of high-dose iNO therapy has not been studied. Herein we aim to explore the feasibility and safety of delivering continuous high-dose iNO over an extended period of time using an in vivo animal model. Yorkshire pigs were randomized to one of the following two groups: group 1, standard ventilation; and group 2, standard ventilation + continuous iNO 160 ppm + methylene blue (MB) as intravenous bolus, whenever required, to maintain metHb <6%. Both groups were ventilated continuously for 6 hours, then the animals were weaned from sedation, mechanical ventilation and followed for 3 days. During treatment, and on the third post-operative day, physiologic assessments were performed to monitor lung function and other significative markers were assessed for potential pulmonary or systemic injury. No significant change in lung function, or inflammatory markers were observed during the study period. Both gas exchange function, lung tissue cytokine analysis and histology were similar between treated and control animals. During treatment, levels of metHb were maintained <6% by administration of MB, and NO(2) remained <5 ppm. Additionally, considering extrapulmonary effects, no significant changes were observed in biochemistry markers. Our findings showed that high-dose iNO delivered continuously over 6 hours with adjuvant MB is clinically feasible and safe.

654849,Single Parameter Estimation Approach for Robust Estimation of SIR Model With Limited and Noisy Data: The Case for COVID-19,2020-06-25,"The envelopes of coronaviruses (CoVs) contain primarily three proteins; the two major glycoproteins spike (S) and membrane (M), and envelope (E), a non-glycosylated protein. Unlike other enveloped viruses, CoVs bud and assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). For efficient virion assembly, these proteins must be targeted to the budding site and to interact with each other or the ribonucleoprotein. Thus, the efficient incorporation of viral envelope proteins into CoV virions depends on protein trafficking and protein–protein interactions near the ERGIC. The goal of this review is to summarize recent findings on the mechanism of incorporation of the M and S glycoproteins into the CoV virion, focusing on protein trafficking and protein–protein interactions.","Ujike, Makoto; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7041700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855243/,541

657015,"Local Perceptions of COVID-19 in Pakistan’s Sindh Province: “Political Game”, Supernatural Test, or Western Conspiracy?",2021-07-12,"Yellow dwarf viruses cause the most economically important virus diseases of cereal crops worldwide and are transmitted by aphid vectors. The identification of aphid genes and proteins mediating virus transmission is critical to develop agriculturally sustainable virus management practices and to understand viral strategies for circulative movement in all insect vectors. Two cyclophilin B proteins, S28 and S29, were identified previously in populations of Schizaphisgraminum that differed in their ability to transmit the RPV strain of Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV). The presence of S29 was correlated with F2 genotypes that were efficient virus transmitters. The present study revealed the two proteins were isoforms, and a single amino acid change distinguished S28 and S29. The distribution of the two alleles was determined in 12 F2 genotypes segregating for CYDV-RPV transmission capacity and in 11 genetically independent, field-collected S . graminum biotypes. Transmission efficiency for CYDV-RPV was determined in all genotypes and biotypes. The S29 isoform was present in all genotypes or biotypes that efficiently transmit CYDV-RPV and more specifically in genotypes that efficiently transport virus across the hindgut. We confirmed a direct interaction between CYDV-RPV and both S28 and S29 using purified virus and bacterially expressed, his-tagged S28 and S29 proteins. Importantly, S29 failed to interact with a closely related virus that is transported across the aphid midgut. We tested for in vivo interactions using an aphid-virus co-immunoprecipitation strategy coupled with a bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. This analysis enabled us to identify a third cyclophilin protein, cyclophilin A, interacting directly or in complex with purified CYDV-RPV. Taken together, these data provide evidence that both cyclophilin A and B interact with CYDV-RPV, and these interactions may be important but not sufficient to mediate virus transport from the hindgut lumen into the hemocoel.","Tamborindeguy, Cecilia; Bereman, Michael S.; DeBlasio, Stacy; Igwe, David; Smith, Dawn M.; White, Frank; MacCoss, Michael J.; Gray, Stewart M.; Cilia, Michelle",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23951206/,541

It has been observed that 222G/N changes in the HA gene of H1N1pdm09 are associated with increased lower respiratory tract (LRT) replication and worse clinical outcome. In the present study, the frequency of respiratory viruses was assessed in respiratory samples from 88 patients admitted to 16 ICUs during the 2014–2015 winter-spring season in Lombardy. Sixty-nine out of 88 (78.4%) patients were positive for a respiratory viral infection at admission. Of these, 57/69 (82.6%) were positive for influenza A (41 A/H1N1pdm09 and 15 A/H3N2), 8/69 (11.6%) for HRV, 2/69 (2.9%) for RSV and 2/69 (2.9%) for influenza B. Phylogenetic analysis of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strains from 28/41 ICU-patients and 21 patients with mild respiratory syndrome not requiring hospitalization, showed the clear predominance of subgroup 6B strains. The median influenza A load in LRT samples of ICU patients was higher than that observed in the upper respiratory tract (URT) (p<0.05). Overall, a greater number of H1N1pdm09 virus variants were observed using next generation sequencing on partial HA sequences (codons 180–286) in clinical samples from the LRT as compared to URT. In addition, 222G/N/A mutations were observed in 30% of LRT samples from ICU patients. Finally, intra-host evolution analysis showed the presence of different dynamics of viral population in LRT of patients hospitalized in ICU with a severe influenza infection.","Piralla, Antonio; Rovida, Francesca; Girello, Alessia; Premoli, Marta; Mojoli, Francesco; Belliato, Mirko; Braschi, Antonio; Iotti, Giorgio; Pariani, Elena; Bubba, Laura; Zanetti, Alessandro R.; Baldanti, Fausto",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28591230/,541
657521,Home quarantine induced health anxiety during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic- evidence from Iraq,2021,"[Image: see text] Over 5 million people around the world have tested positive for the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as of May 29, 2020, a third of which are in the United States alone. These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of antifibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects. Although our results are observational, they highlight a clear increase in the levels of inhibitory components of the fibrinolytic cascade in severe COVID-19 disease, providing potential clues related to the etiology of coagulopathic complications in COVID-19 and paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions, such as the use of pro-fibrinolytic agents.

This short commentary tells us about the feasibility of telemedicine in this scenario in obstetrics and gynaecology. METHODS: The database from our teleconsultation application (Apollo 247 and Askapollo) was analysed to assess feasibility of telemedicine and to design a triage pathway to reduce hospital visits for non-emergency situations and also to identify emergency cases without delay during this lockdown phase. Existing guidelines by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, were accessed. RESULTS: This was a single-doctor experience of 375 consultations done over 65 days. We also designed a triage pathway for obstetrics and gynaecology cases, and we discussed general practice for obstetricians and gynaecologists with its utility and limitations. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has provided us the opportunity to manage women health problems and pregnancy concerns during this pandemic of COVID-19, except a few instances where face-to-face consultation or hospital visit is must.

This observation and subsequent mechanistic studies have demonstrated important interactions among allergens, microbes and the atopic host. The mechanisms responsible for microbe-induced asthma exacerbations are only incompletely understood. A focal point of current research is the inflammatory response of the host following an encounter with a pathogenic microbe, including variations in chemokine and cytokine production and resulting in changes in bronchial hyper-responsiveness and lung function. Direct bronchial infection, exposure of nerves with resulting neurogenic inflammation and a deviated host immune response are among the mechanisms underlying these functional disorders. Lately, suboptimal innate immune responses, expressed as defective interferon production, have gained attention as they might be amenable to intervention. This review describes the suggested mechanisms involved in the complex interactions between ‘asthmagenic’ microbes, the immune system and atopy, based on in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models and epidemiological evidence. In addition, it provides a synopsis of potential therapeutic strategies either directly against the microorganisms or in respect to the associated inflammation.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.; Konstantinou, George N.",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332206003350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17188832/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332206003350,541
663735,Higher Testing Coverage Associated With a Lower COVID-19 Mortality Rate: Insights From Italian Regions,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Covid‐19 has caused many complications for both the infected and those in need of medical care. This may be due to infection‐related prognosis worsening or the patients’ avoidance of referring to the hospital for fear of contracting the infection. The decline of acute referral to the ER of many significant conditions with severe results on both the well‐being and life‐expectancy is a serious concern. To address these concerns, we designed this study to evaluate the recent pandemic's impact on “in‐hospital mortality” caused by neurological disorders pre and postpandemic. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The inclusion criteria were any acute neurological condition and the consent of the patients eligible for our study. The definitions of all assessed conditions and the comorbidities are ICD‐10 based. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus, due to their high prevalence, were evaluated separately from other internal comorbidities. The total number of the enrolled patients was 1742, 671 of whom had been during the COVID‐19 pandemic, and 1071 had attended the ER during the prepandemic era. RESULTS: The overall mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic, and the covid infected had suffered higher mortality rates. (p‐value < 0.05) CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, those with minor strokes and other nonlife‐threatening ailments had avoided hospital care leading to a significantly higher rate of critical conditions. Increased incidence of strokes and ICHs during the pandemic, too, caused significant increased in‐hospital mortality.","Khoshsirat, Nahid Abbasi; Qorbani, Mostafa; Farivar, Ali Mokhtari; Mohammadpoor Nami, Sahar; Mohammadian Khonsari, Nami",Brain Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087954/; https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2246,541

Calculations are performed across the physiological pH range to also examine the impact of pH on these interactions. Two of six spike protein s1 variations having greater electric forces at pH levels consistent with nasal secretions and significant variations in force across all five variants of ACE2. Five out of six spike protein s1 variations have relatively consistent forces at pH levels of the lung, and one spike protein s1 variant that has low potential across a wide range of pH.

665631,"Evidence Review and Practice Recommendation on the Material, Design, and Maintenance of Cloth Masks",2020-09-02,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the supply chain for personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical professionals, including N95-type respiratory protective masks. To address this shortage, many have looked to the agility and accessibility of additive manufacturing (AM) systems to provide a democratized, decentralized solution to producing respirators with equivalent protection for last-resort measures. However, there are concerns about the viability and safety in deploying this localized download, print, and wear strategy due to a lack of commensurate quality assurance processes. Many open-source respirator designs for AM indicate that they do not provide N95-equivalent protection (filtering 95% of SARS-CoV-2 particles) because they have either not passed aerosol generation tests or not been tested. Few studies have quantified particle transmission through respirator designs outside of the filter medium. This is concerning because several polymer-based AM processes produce porous parts, and inherent process variation between printers and materials also threaten the integrity of tolerances and seals within the printed respirator assembly. No study has isolated these failure mechanisms specifically for respirators. The goal of this paper is to measure particle transmission through printed respirators of different designs, materials, and AM processes. The authors compare the performance of printed respirators to N95 respirators and cloth masks. Respirators in this study printed using desktop- and industrial-scale fused filament fabrication processes and industrial-scale powder bed fusion processes were not sufficiently reliable for widespread distribution and local production of N95-type respiratory protection. Even while assuming a perfect seal between the respirator and the user’s face, although a few respirators provided >90% efficiency at the 100−300 nm particle range, almost all printed respirators provided <60% filtration efficiency. Post-processing procedures including cleaning, sealing surfaces, and reinforcing the filter cap seal generally improved performance, but the printed respirators showed similar performance to various cloth masks. The authors further explore the process-driven aspects leading to low filtration efficiency. Although the design/printer/material combination dictates the AM respirator performance, the identified failure modes originate from system-level constraints and are therefore generalizable across multiple AM processes. Quantifying the limitations of AM in producing N95-type respiratory protective masks advances understanding of AM systems toward the development of better part and machine designs to meet the needs of reliable, functional, end-use parts.","Bezek, Lindsey B.; Pan, Jin; Harb, Charbel; Zawaski, Callie E.; Molla, Bemnet; Kubalak, Joseph R.; Marr, Linsey C.; Williams, Christopher B.",J Manuf Syst,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.01.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612521000029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278612521000029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551537/,541

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the sputum cellular, mediator, and microbiome profiles of both asthma and COPD exacerbations. METHODS: Patients with severe asthma or moderate-to-severe COPD were recruited prospectively to a single center. Sputum mediators were available in 32 asthmatic patients and 73 patients with COPD assessed at exacerbation. Biologic clusters were determined by using factor and cluster analyses on a panel of sputum mediators. Patterns of clinical parameters, sputum mediators, and microbiome communities were assessed across the identified clusters. RESULTS: The asthmatic patients and patients with COPD had different clinical characteristics and inflammatory profiles but similar microbial ecology. Three exacerbation biologic clusters were identified. Cluster 1 was COPD predominant, with 27 patients with COPD and 7 asthmatic patients exhibiting increased blood and sputum neutrophil counts, proinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, TNF-α, TNF receptors 1 and 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor), and proportions of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria. Cluster 2 had 10 asthmatic patients and 17 patients with COPD with increased blood and sputum eosinophil counts, type 2 mediators (IL-5, IL-13, CCL13, CCL17, and CCL26), and proportions of the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes. Cluster 3 had 15 asthmatic patients and 29 patients with COPD with increased type 1 mediators (CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFN-γ) and proportions of the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes.

A clinical score predictive of COVID-19 based on readily assessed variables may be useful in settings with restricted or no access to molecular diagnostic tests. Methods: A score based on demographics and symptoms was developed in a cross-sectional study including patients attended in a dedicated COVID-19 screening unit. A backward stepwise logistic regression model was constructed and values for each variable were assigned according to their {beta} coefficient values in the final model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and its area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: A total of 464 patients were included: 98 (21.1%) COVID-19 and 366 (78.9%) non-COVID-19 patients. The score included variables independently associated with COVID-19 in the final model: age equal or above 60 years (2 points), fever (2), dyspnea (1), fatigue (1 point) and coryza (-1). Score values were significantly higher in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients: median (Interquartile Range), 3 (2-4), and 1 (0-2), respectively; P<0.001.

However, little is known about the association between immunosuppression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. Our aim was to describe the clinical course of immunosuppressed autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection in Italy. METHODS: Our study is a case series of AIH patients treated with immunosuppression, who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 in March 2020 during outbreak of COVID‐19. RESULTS: Ten patients from six different hospitals in Italy were diagnosed with COVID‐19 during the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 in March 2020. Seven subjects were female (70%) and age ranged from 27 to 73 years. Before the onset of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, all patients were taking immunosuppressive therapy for AIH, and eight of them were on biochemical remission. Two other patients had recent acute onset of their AIH, and were consequently started high‐dose steroids, as per induction protocol. All patients had a respiratory syndrome and had a positive nasal swab for SARS‐CoV‐2. Five patients developed a CT‐confirmed COVID‐19 pneumonia. Six subjects received a combination of antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs. In seven patients the dosage of immunosuppressive medication was changed. Liver enzymes were repeated during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in all hospitalized cases; they remained within the normal range in all cases, and improved in the two acute cases treated with high‐dose steroids. The clinical outcome was comparable to the reported cases occurring in non‐immunosuppressed subjects. CONCLUSION: Patients under immunosuppressive therapy for AIH developing COVID‐19 show a disease course presumptively similar to that reported in non‐immunosuppressed population.

RESULTS: Both daily posted and forwarded number and BAI for keyword H7N9 increased quickly during the first 3 days of the outbreaks and remained at a high level for 5 days. The total daily posted and forwarded number for H7N9 on Sina microblog peaked at 850,000 on April 3, from zero blogs before March 31, increasing to 97,726 on April 1 and to 370,607 on April 2, and remaining above 500,000 from April 5-8 before declining to 208,524 on April 12. The total daily BAI showed a similar pattern of change to the total daily posted and forwarded number over time from March 31 to April 12. When the outbreak locations spread, especially into other areas of the same province/city and the capital, Beijing, daily posted and forwarded number and BAI increased again to a peak at 368,500 and 116,911, respectively. The median daily BAI during the studied 25 days was significantly higher among the 7 provinces/cities with reported human H7N9 cases than the 2 provinces without any cases (P<.001). So were the median daily posted and forwarded number and daily BAI in each province/city except Anhui province. We retrieved a total of 32 confirmed rumors spread across 19 provinces/cities in China. In all, 84% (27/32) of rumors were disseminated and transmitted by social media. CONCLUSIONS: The first 3 days of an epidemic is a critical period for the authorities to take appropriate action through Internet surveillance to prevent and control the epidemic, including preparation of personnel, technology, and other resources; information release; collection of public opinion and reaction; and clarification, prevention, and control of rumors. Internet surveillance can be used as an efficient and economical tool to prevent and control public health emergencies, such as H7N9 outbreaks.","Gu, Hua; Chen, Bin; Zhu, Honghong; Jiang, Tao; Wang, Xinyi; Chen, Lei; Jiang, Zhenggang; Zheng, Dawei; Jiang, Jianmin",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440770/,541
680764,"Ready or Not, Patients Will Present: Improving Urban Pandemic Preparedness",2020-03-16,"The public specialty ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong, under the Hospital Authority, receive tens of thousands of referrals each year. Triaging these referrals incurs a significant workload for practitioners and the other clinical duties. It is well-established that Hong Kong is currently facing a shortage of healthcare workers. Thus a more efficient system in triaging will not only free up resources for better use but also improve the satisfaction of both practitioners and patients. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to improve the efficiency of various medical workflows, including triaging, by both reducing the workload and increasing accuracy in some cases. Despite a myriad of studies on medical artificial intelligence, there is no specific framework for a triaging algorithm in ophthalmology clinics. This study proposes a general framework for developing, deploying and evaluating an ML-based triaging algorithm in a clinical setting. Through literature review, this study identifies good practices in various facets of developing such a network and protocols for maintenance and evaluation of the impact concerning clinical utility and external validity out of the laboratory. We hope this framework, albeit not exhaustive, can act as a foundation to accelerate future pilot studies and deployments.","Li, Yalsin Yik Sum; Vardhanabhuti, Varut; Tsougenis, Efstratios; Lam, Wai Ching; Shih, Kendrick Co",Ophthalmol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40123-021-00405-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637117/,541

687374,COVID-19: A Retrospective by the Numbers,2021-03-25,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has altered how the current generation of thoracic surgery residents are being trained. The aim of this survey was to determine how thoracic surgery program directors (PDs) are adapting to educating residents during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: Thoracic surgery PDs of integrated, traditional (2 or 3 year), and combined 4 + 3 general/thoracic surgery training programs in the United States were surveyed between 17th April and 1st May 2020 during the peak of the COVID‐19 pandemic in much of the United States. The 15‐question electronic survey queried program status, changes to the baseline surgical practice, changes to didactic education, deployment/scheduling of residents, and effect of the pandemic on case logs and preparedness for resident graduation. RESULTS: All 23 institutions responding had ceased elective procedures, and most had switched to telemedicine clinic visits. Online virtual didactic sessions were implemented by 91% of programs, with most (69.6%) observing same or increased attendance. PDs reported that 82.7% of residents were on a non‐standard schedule, with most being deployed in a 1 to 2 week on, 1 to 2 week off block schedule. Case volumes were affected for both junior and graduating trainees, but a majority of PDs report that graduating residents will graduate on time without perceived negative effect on first career/fellowship position. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐19 pandemic has radically changed the educational approach of thoracic surgery programs. PDs are adapting educational delivery to optimize training and safety during the pandemic. Long‐term effects remain uncertain and require additional study.","Coyan, Garrett N.; Aranda‐Michel, Edgar; Kilic, Arman; Luketich, James D.; Okusanya, Olugbenga; Chu, Danny; Morell, Victor O.; Schuchert, Matthew; Sultan, Ibrahim",J Card Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881042/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14954,541
687587,Community Preparedness and Practices for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (COP-COVID): An assessment from rural northern India.,2021-08-04,"SARS-CoV-2 uses − 1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (− 1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins. Because modulating − 1 PRF can attenuate the virus, ligands binding to the RNA pseudoknot that stimulates − 1 PRF may have therapeutic potential. Mutations in the pseudoknot have occurred during the pandemic, but how they affect − 1 PRF efficiency and ligand activity is unknown. Studying a panel of 6 mutations in key regions of the pseudoknot, we found that most did not change − 1 PRF levels, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a striking 3-fold decrease, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may be less sensitive to − 1 PRF modulation than expected. Examining the effects of a small-molecule − 1 PRF inhibitor active against SARS-CoV-2, it had a similar effect on all mutants tested, regardless of basal − 1 PRF efficiency, indicating that anti-frameshifting activity can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of − 1 PRF.","Neupane, Krishna; Munshi, Sneha; Zhao, Meng; Ritchie, Dustin B.; Ileperuma, Sandaru M.; Woodside, Michael T.",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920049/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.09.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283620305374; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620305374?v=s5,541
689018,Thoughts on the Future Medical Care Pattern of Pediatrics in China Based on the Outbreak of COVID-19,2020-10-26,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged recently as a new infectious disease that was transmitted efficiently in the healthcare setting and particularly affected healthcare workers (HCWs), patients and visitors. The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of ‘super-spreading events’. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of IC measures that limited exposure of HCWs to potentially infectious individuals. As the ‘global village’ becomes smaller and other microbial threats to health emerge, or re-emerge, there is an urgent need to develop a global strategy for infection control in hospitals. This paper provides an overview of the main IC practices employed during the 2003 SARS outbreak, including management measures, dedicated SARS hospitals, personal protective equipment, isolation, handwashing, environmental decontamination, education and training. The psychological and psychosocial impact on HCWs during the outbreak are also discussed. Requirements for IC programmes in the post-SARS period are proposed based on the major lessons learnt from the SARS outbreak.","Shaw, Karen",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297415/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350605002362; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350605002362,541

This study aimed at investigating in cats from southern Italy FeMV prevalence and risk factors for exposure to FeMV, including the relationship with CKD; sequencing amplicons and analyzing phylogeny of PCR positive samples. Blood serum, K(3)EDTA blood and urine samples from 223 cats were investigated. Ten carcasses were also evaluated. FeMV RNA was detected in 2.4% (5/211) blood and 16.1% (36/223) urine samples. One carcass tested positive by qPCR(FeMV) from kidney, urinary bladder, and submandibular lymph nodes. Antibodies against FeMV were detected in 14.5% (28/193) cats. We followed up 27 cats (13 FeMV positive cats) and documented in some cases urine shedding after up to 360 days. Older and foundling cats and cats living in rescue catteries, were more frequently infected with FeMV. A significant correlation between FeMV and higher serum creatinine values or low urine specific gravity was found. FeMV positivity was significantly associated with retroviral infection, and the presence of some clinical signs apart from CKD clinicopathological markers. Our study highlights the possibility of a link between FeMV exposure and CKD and a general impairment of feline health.","Donato, Giulia; Masucci, Marisa; De Luca, Eliana; Alibrandi, Angela; De Majo, Massimo; Berjaoui, Shadia; Martino, Camillo; Mangano, Cyndi; Lorusso, Alessio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452315/,541
