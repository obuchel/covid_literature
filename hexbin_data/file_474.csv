1565,Asthma in the elderly: what we know and what we have yet to know,2014-05-30,"In the past, asthma was considered mainly as a childhood disease. However, asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly nowadays. In addition, the burden of asthma is more significant in the elderly than in their younger counterparts, particularly with regard to mortality, hospitalization, medical costs or health-related quality of life. Nevertheless, asthma in the elderly is still been underdiagnosed and undertreated. Therefore, it is an imperative task to recognize our current challenges and to set future directions. This project aims to review the current literature and identify unmet needs in the fields of research and practice for asthma in the elderly. This will enable us to find new research directions, propose new therapeutic strategies, and ultimately improve outcomes for elderly people with asthma. There are data to suggest that asthma in older adults is phenotypically different from young patients, with potential impact on the diagnosis, assessment and management in this population. The diagnosis of AIE in older populations relies on the same clinical findings and diagnostic tests used in younger populations, but the interpretation of the clinical data is more difficult. The challenge today is to encourage new research in AIE but to use the existing knowledge we have to make the diagnosis of AIE, educate the patient, develop a therapeutic approach to control the disease, and ultimately provide a better quality of life to our elderly patients.","Yáñez, Anahí; Cho, Sang-Hoen; Soriano, Joan B; Rosenwasser, Lanny J; Rodrigo, Gustavo J; Rabe, Klaus F; Peters, Stephen; Niimi, Akio; Ledford, Dennis K; Katial, Rohit; Fabbri, Leonardo M; Celedón, Juan C; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Busse, Paula; Boulet, Louis-Phillippe; Baena-Cagnani, Carlos E; Hamid, Qutayba; Bachert, Claus; Pawankar, Ruby; Holgate, Stephen T",World Allergy Organ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4137434/,474

The effects are categorized on their scale, complexity, and lag-time. Some but not all of these can be classified as resulting from reduced ecosystem services. The articles also explores the impacts that different socioeconomic–ecologic scenarios are likely to have on human health and how changes to human health may, in turn, influence the unfolding of four different plausible future scenarios. We provide examples to show that our categorization is a useful taxonomy for understanding the complex relationships between ecosystems and human well-being and for predicting how future ecosystem changes may affect human health.","Butler, Colin D.; Corvalan, Carlos F.; Koren, Hillel S.",Ecosystems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088287/,474

MIF was originally discovered as a lymphokine involved in delayed hypersensitivity and various macrophage functions, including production of proinflammatory cytokines, glucocorticoid-induced immunomodulator, and natural killer cell inhibitory factor (NKIF), regulation of toll-like receptor expression, adherence and phagocytosis of macrophages, as well as induction of metalloproteinase. Therefore MIF is considered as a potential target protein in many pathophysiological states. In this review, considering the protein structure and the acting mechanisms of MIF, we mainly discuss the important role of MIF in pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and graft rejection.","Javeed, A.; Zhao, Y.; Zhao, Y.",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095795/,474

The recombinant proteins induce immune responses and have several benefits over current vaccine technologies, including increased safety, economy, stability, versatility and efficacy. Antigens expressed in corn are particularly advantageous since the seed can be produced in vast quantities and shipped over long distances at ambient temperature, potentially allowing global vaccination.

8452,The COVID-19 outbreak and implications for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games,2020-02-26,"An increase in fast axonal transport of protein by the optic nerve was found in mice following a single combined injection of human recombinant tumour necrosis factor alpha (rTNF) and [(3)H]proline into the vitreous chamber. Demyelination was observed in optic nerve fibres arising from the eyes of mice which received a single rTNF injection. No such changes were detected when heat-inactivated rTNF was injected with the label. The effects of intravitreal injection of rTNF on the pathophysiology of mouse optic nerve resembled those found in mice infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. We suggest that TNF could mediate at lease some of the pathophysiological changes found in SFV-infected mice and may provide a clue concerning the disease mechanism in multiple sclerosis.","Jenkins, Huw G.; Ikeda, Hisako",J Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130121/,474
15325,Veranstaltungstipps:,2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND: The effect of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation on the length of mechanical ventilation and mortality in immunocompetent ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation remains controversial. The main objective of this study was to determine whether preemptive intravenous ganciclovir increases the number of ventilator-free days in patients with CMV blood reactivation. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involved 19 ICUs in France. Seventy-six adults ≥ 18 years old who had been mechanically ventilated for at least 96 h, expected to remain on mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 h, and exhibited reactivation of CMV in blood were enrolled between February 5th, 2014, and January 23rd, 2019. Participants were randomized to receive ganciclovir 5 mg/kg bid for 14 days (n = 39) or a matching placebo (n = 37). RESULTS: The primary endpoint was ventilator-free days from randomization to day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes included day 60 mortality. The trial was stopped for futility based on the results of an interim analysis by the DSMB. The subdistribution hazard ratio for being alive and weaned from mechanical ventilation at day 60 for patients receiving ganciclovir (N = 39) compared with control patients (N = 37) was 1.14 (95% CI from 0.63 to 2.06; P = 0.66). The median [IQR] numbers of ventilator-free days for ganciclovir-treated patients and controls were 10 [0–51] and 0 [0–43] days, respectively (P = 0.46). Mortality at day 60 was 41% in patients in the ganciclovir group and 43% in the placebo group (P = .845). Creatinine levels and blood cells counts did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients mechanically ventilated for ≥ 96 h with CMV reactivation in blood, preemptive ganciclovir did not improve the outcome.","Papazian, Laurent; Jaber, Samir; Hraiech, Sami; Baumstarck, Karine; Cayot-Constantin, Sophie; Aissaoui, Nadia; Jung, Boris; Leone, Marc; Souweine, Bertrand; Schwebel, Carole; Bourenne, Jérémy; Allardet-Servent, Jérôme; Kamel, Toufik; Lu, Qin; Zandotti, Christine; Loundou, Anderson; Penot-Ragon, Christine; Chastre, Jean; Forel, Jean-Marie; Luyt, Charles-Edouard",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7876264/,474
16046,Pandemic COVID-19 in the Brazil prison system,2021-03-11,"Glucocorticoids (GC) are still the recommended initial treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, although the treatment should be temporary and confined to the administration of low doses. The complex mechanism of action is accompanied by side effects that particularly occur in long-term treatment exceeding 5 mg prednisolone per day. In this dosage range they promote osteoporosis, diabetes and hyperglycemia as well as cardiovascular events and infections, thereby contributing to an excess mortality. The risks of GC treatment are dependent on patient-related parameters, such as age, comorbidity and additional medication. A negative influence of very low steroid doses on overall survival is possibly due to high cumulative steroid doses; however, the data in this respect are contradictory. Recently, a validated index was developed to monitor GC-related toxicity. In the future, this index should help to describe the advantages of steroid-sparing treatment strategies. In the future, more selectively acting substances could achieve an uncoupling of desired and adverse effects.","Keyßer, Gernot",Z Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7948162/,474
16186,Veranstaltungstipps:,2021-03-17,"In order to obtain a partial overview of the integration of the German Society of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery (DGHNO-KHC) in worldwide networks, the frequencies of its annually announced contacts with international otorhinolaryngologic societies between 1976 and 2020 were collected based on the meetings listed in the journal HNO Informationen. Of the 534 international meetings, 388 took place within and 146 outside Europe. These contacts have increased significantly to date, even in very distant countries. Furthermore, honorary and corresponding members of the DGHNO-KHC were counted. Up until 2020 there were 210 honorary members, 53 living honorary members from European countries and 19 from non-European countries. Among the deceased honorary members (1951–2019), 125 were from Europe and 13 from non-European countries. Up until 2020, 140 living and 72 deceased corresponding members from 212 countries were counted, 143 from European and 69 from non-European countries. Several subject-related subspecialties and otorhinolaryngologic umbrella organizations, particularly Europe, are also addressed. The last section concerns international cooperations of the former German Democratic Republic from 1950 to 1989.

Now is the time to reimagine plant science as a critical component of fundamental science, agriculture, environmental stewardship, energy, technology and healthcare. This effort requires a conceptual and technological framework to identify and map all cell types, and to comprehensively annotate the localization and organization of molecules at cellular and tissue levels. This framework, called the Plant Cell Atlas (PCA), will be critical for understanding and engineering plant development, physiology and environmental responses. A workshop was convened to discuss the purpose and utility of such an initiative, resulting in a roadmap that acknowledges the current knowledge gaps and technical challenges, and underscores how the PCA initiative can help to overcome them.","Jha, Suryatapa Ghosh; Borowsky, Alexander T; Cole, Benjamin J; Fahlgren, Noah; Farmer, Andrew; Huang, Shao-shan Carol; Karia, Purva; Libault, Marc; Provart, Nicholas J; Rice, Selena L; Saura-Sanchez, Maite; Agarwal, Pinky; Ahkami, Amir H; Anderton, Christopher R; Briggs, Steven P; Brophy, Jennifer AN; Denolf, Peter; Di Costanzo, Luigi F; Exposito-Alonso, Moises; Giacomello, Stefania; Gomez-Cano, Fabio; Kaufmann, Kerstin; Ko, Dae Kwan; Kumar, Sagar; Malkovskiy, Andrey V; Nakayama, Naomi; Obata, Toshihiro; Otegui, Marisa S; Palfalvi, Gergo; Quezada-Rodríguez, Elsa H; Singh, Rajveer; Uhrig, R Glen; Waese, Jamie; Van Wijk, Klaas; Wright, R Clay; Ehrhardt, David W; Birnbaum, Kenneth D; Rhee, Seung Y",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8423441/,474
21308,HRCT Surrogate for Vaccine Efficacy?,2021-09-15,"Data on long-term survival among people with HIV (PWH) can inform the development of services for this population. An estimated 90,000 PWH live in New York City (NYC). Using HIV surveillance data, we conducted survival analysis of PWH diagnosed in NYC before and after introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (pre-HAART cohort: 1981–1994; post-HAART cohort: 1995–2016). We created Kaplan–Meier curves by cohort and demographic factors, and Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate adjusted mortality risk by cohort. 205,584 adults and adolescents were diagnosed with HIV in NYC from 1981 to 2016, half each in the pre-HAART and post-HAART eras. The pre-HAART cohort had significantly poorer survival compared with the post-HAART cohort. Adjusted mortality risk in the pre-HAART cohort was almost threefold that in the post-HAART cohort (HR 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.80–2.88). In sex- and risk-stratified models, men who have sex with men (MSM) had the largest difference in mortality risk pre-HAART versus post-HAART (HR 5.41, 95% CI 5.23–5.59). Race/ethnic disparities were pronounced among MSM, with Latino/Hispanic and White MSM having lower mortality than Black MSM. Females with heterosexual risk born outside the US had lower mortality than US-born women. The improvement in survival post-HAART was most pronounced for White people. Survival among persons diagnosed with HIV in NYC increased significantly since the introduction of HAART. However, among MSM and among PWH overall, improvements even post-HAART lagged for Black and Latino/Hispanic people, underscoring the need to address structural barriers, including racism, to achieve optimal health outcomes among people with HIV.","Braunstein, Sarah L.; Kersanske, Laura; Torian, Lucia V.; Lazar, Rachael; Harriman, Graham",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449215/,474
22087,Tolerability of polysorbate 80 containing COVID-19 vaccines in confirmed PEG allergic patients.,2021-10-06,"Proper protection of vascular access after haemodialysis is one of the key measures for the prevention of catheter-related infections. Various substances with bactericidal and anticoagulant properties are used to fill catheters, but due to the unsatisfactory clinical effects and occurrence of adverse reactions, the search for new substances is still ongoing. In the present paper, we compared the in vitro antimicrobial activity of solutions used for tunnelled catheter locking (taurolidine, trisodium citrate) and solutions of substances that could potentially be used for this purpose (sodium bicarbonate, polyhexanide-betaine). The studies have been conducted on bacteria that most commonly cause catheter-related infections. The values of both minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum biofilm eradication concentration of the substances were determined. The ability of the tested substances to eradicate biofilm from the dialysis catheter surface was also evaluated. The results showed that polyhexanide-betaine inhibited the growth of all microbes comparably to taurolidine, even after ≥ 32-fold dilution. The activity of trisodium citrate and sodium bicarbonate was significantly lower. Polyhexanide exhibited the highest activity in the eradication of bacterial biofilm on polystyrene plates. The biofilm formed on a polyurethane dialysis catheter was resistant to complete eradication by the test substances. Polyhexanide-betaine and taurolidine showed the highest activity. Inhibition of bacterial growth regardless of species was observed not only at the highest concentration of these compounds but also after dilution 32–128x (taurolidine) and 32–1024x (polyhexanide-betaine). Therefore, it can be assumed that taurolidine application as a locking solution prevents catheter colonization and systemic infection development. Taurolidine displays high antimicrobial efficacy against Gram-positive cocci as well as Gram-negative bacilli. On the contrary, the lowest antibacterial effect displayed product contained sodium bicarbonate. The inhibitions of bacterial growth were not satisfactory to consider it as a substance for colonization prevention. Polyhexanidine-betaine possessed potent inhibitory and biofilm eradication properties comparing to all tested products. PHMB is applied as a wound irrigation solution worldwide. However, based on our results, we assume that the PHMB is a promising substance for catheter locking solutions thanks to its safety and high antimicrobial properties.","Piątkowska, Elżbieta; Paleczny, Justyna; Dydak, Karolina; Letachowicz, Krzysztof",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496847/,474

TS poses a considerable burden on both patients and health care providers, leading to a major detriment of educational success, occupation, and interpersonal relationships. A multidisciplinary, specialist-driven management approach is required due to the complexity of TS. However, access to such specialty care is often dramatically limited by the patients' locations and the specialists' geographic clustering in large urban centers. Telemedicine uses electronic information and communication technology to provide and support health care when distance separates participants. Therefore, we conducted this mini-review to describe the latest information on telemedicine in the assessment and management of TS and discuss the potential contributions to care for TS patients with a multidisciplinary approach. We believe that telemedicine could be a revolutionary method in improving medical access to patients with TS.","Cen, Shan-shan; Yu, Jun; Wang, Qiao; Deeb, Wissam; Wang, Kai-liang; Shukla, Aparna Wagle; Malaty, Irene; Ramirez-Zamora, Adolfo; Zhang, Jian-guo; Hu, Wei; Meng, Fan-gang",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7775481/,474

Motivated by the success of lean implementation in manufacturing systems, this study attempts to apply the lean principles in healthcare delivery environments. The lean approach begins with the identification of seven types of wastes in any production or service system. This study attempts to identify and prioritize the present in hospitals. The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge in two ways. First, we identify the various sources contributing to the seven basic wastes in healthcare delivery. Second, we prioritize the seven types of wastes and the dimensions contributing to these wastes using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). This paper used the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process approach, which is a well-accepted tool in MCDM. The study was conducted at select hospitals located in and around Pune city in India. We find that waiting, transportation, motion, and defects are dominant in adopting lean practices among the seven wastes. The findings of this study may guide hospital management in strategic planning in adopting a lean healthcare process.

Canadian consensus of COVID-19 policy and management aspects,2020-12-31,"INTRODUCTION: Frequent calibration of ventilators and anesthesia machines might reduce the risk of death and of sequelae in patients under mechanical ventilation. However, ventilator analyzers might be difficult to purchase due to high cost or even in trade-restrictive scenarios, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To alleviate this problem, the aim of this article is to present the design and characterization of a Pitot tube transducer fabricated with additive manufacturing (AM), to be used in ventilator analyzers. METHOD: A split Pitot tube (SPT) transducer was designed using computer-aided design (CAD) and characterized using finite element method (FEM) simulations. Bernoulli’s equation was used to determine a transducer discharge coefficient. The sensor was fabricated with the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic, with the fused deposition modeling after properly configuring the 3D printer. RESULTS: According to the simulated velocity profile, the transducer does not impose excessive resistance to the flow and the pressure profile revealed that the pressure is constant and stable inside the pressure lines. The characteristic curve of differential pressure (dP) versus flow is quadratic. For the minimal and maximal simulated flows 0.01 to 300 L/min, the corresponding dP values are 6.535·10(−4) Pa and 13.178·10(3) Pa. CONCLUSION: The split Pitot tube transducer developed here has appropriate characteristics for measuring air flows from mechanical ventilators, and the delivered pressures can be read by commercial electronic sensors. The AM is viable for fabricating the transducer, and the printing time is considerably low compared to that necessary to order a similar part from a sales representative.","de Andrade, Luiz A.

OPAT Delivery during COVID-19,2020-12-31,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative spiral bacterium that caused infections in half of the world’s population and had been identified as type I carcinogen by the World Health Organization. Compared with antibiotic treatment which could result in drug resistance, the vaccine therapy is becoming a promising immunotherapy option against H. pylori. Further, the multi-epitope vaccine could provoke a wider immune protection to control H. pylori infection. In this study, the in-silico immunogenicity calculations on 381 protein sequences of H. pylori were performed, and the immunogenicity of selected proteins with top-ranked score were tested. The B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes from three well performed proteins UreB, PLA1, and Omp6 were assembled into six constructs of multi-epitope vaccines with random orders. In order to select the optimal constructs, the stability of the vaccine structure and the exposure of B cell epitopes on the vaccine surface were evaluated based on structure prediction and solvent accessible surface area analysis. Finally Construct S1 was selected and molecular docking showed that it had the potential of binding TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 to stimulate strong immune response. In particular, this study provides good suggestions for epitope assembly in the construction of multi-epitope vaccines and it may be helpful to control H. pylori infection in the future.

Impact of a customized travel and exposure screening tool during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-12-31,"PURPOSE: Due to the large number of patients with respiratory deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic, several governments and their respective health care services have been studying ways to complement the care provided by offering immediate solutions. In view of this, the aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the advantages and disadvantages of possible solutions in oxygenation support. METHODS: This systematic review used the PRISMA-P methodology and sought to list alternatives in oxygenation support that are being applied and studied worldwide. A bibliographic search was conducted in the MEDLINE and Cochrane Central databases, using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID19, or coronavirus; combined with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilation support, low-cost, anesthesia, anesthesia machine, and ventilation therapy. The records were also found in the gray literature. RESULTS: The search found 85 publications of which 41 articles were considered after excluding duplicate articles, reading the title and summary, and reading the articles in full. The oxygenation supports identified in these publications were the following: ECMO, shared mechanical ventilator, fast or low-cost production equipment, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), non-invasive ventilation, and use of anesthesia equipment as a mechanical ventilator. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the importance of a trained clinical team in the application of technologies. The alternatives found for support oxygenation require a more robust clinical evaluation to demonstrate their efficacy and safety for the COVID-19 patient.","de Souza, Daniel Baldoino; de Oliveira Andrade, Adriano; Milagre, Selma Terezinha; Pereira, Adriano Alves",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778687/,474

Elevated IL-1β level as a predictor of inflammation and death in COVID-19,2020-12-31,"Cyber technologies are offering new horizons for quality control in manufacturing and safety assurance in-service of physical assets. The line between non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and Industry 4.0 is getting blurred since both are sensory data-driven domains. This multidisciplinary approach has led to the emergence of a new capability: NDE 4.0. The NDT community is coming together once again to define the purpose, chart the process, and address the adoption of emerging technologies. In this paper, the authors have taken a design thinking approach to spotlight proper objectives for research on this subject. It begins with qualitative research on twenty different perceptions of stakeholders and misconceptions around the current state of NDE. The interpretation is used to define ten value propositions or use cases under ‘NDE for Industry 4.0’ and ‘Industry 4.0 for NDE’ leading up to the clarity of purpose for NDE 4.0—enhanced safety and economic value for stakeholders. To pursue this worthy cause, the paper delves into some of the top adoption challenges, and proposes a journey of managed innovation, conscious skills development, and a new form of leadership required to succeed in the cyber-physical world.","Vrana, Johannes; Singh, Ripudaman",J Nondestr Eval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778845/,474

Outbreak of COVID-19 Among School Auction Attendees: Was it a “Silent Auction” or “Silent Transmission”?,2020-12-31,"In recent years, a surge of remittances to Bangladesh has enabled rural households to adopt modern renewable energy sources. However, researchers have yet to examine any statistical association between remittances and renewable energy. In this study, we determined the causal relationships between per capita remittance inflows and renewable energy consumption in Bangladesh using annual data for the period 1980–2017. This is the first such study. This determination was made while controlling for changes in GDP, and employing causality and cointegration testing. We arrived at three key results. First, a unidirectional causality running from the level of remittances per capita to a level of renewable energy consumption was determined. Second, we observed a unique cointegrating relationship between the variables.

COVID-19 Preparedness in Hospice and Palliative Care,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Airway management with cervical spine immobilization poses a particular challenge for intubation in the absence of neck extension and risks neurological damage in cases of unstable cervical spine injuries. Here, with manual inline stabilization (MILS) in patients with cervical spine injuries, we compared the safety/efficacy of intubation utilizing the TruView versus King Vision video laryngoscopes. METHODS: This prospective, single-blind, comparative study was conducted over a 3-year period. The study population included 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I-III patients, aged 18–65 years, who underwent subaxial cervical spine surgery utilizing two intubation techniques; TruView (TV) versus King Vision (KV). For both groups, relative intubation difficulty scores (IDS), total duration of intubation, hemodynamic changes, and other complications (e.g., soft-tissue injury and neurological deterioration) were recorded. RESULTS: With MILS, patients in the KV group had statistically significant lower IDS (0.70 ± 1.02) and significantly shorter duration of intubation as compared to the TV group (1.67 ± 1.27) with MILS (P = 0.0010); notably, the glottic exposure was similar in both groups. The complication rate (e.g., soft-tissue injury) was lower for the KV group, but this was not statistically significant. Interestingly, no patient from either group exhibited increased neurological deterioration attributable to the method of intubation. CONCLUSION: King Vision has several advantages over TruView for intubating patients who have sustained cervical spine trauma. Nevertheless, both laryngoscopes afford comparable glottic views and safety profiles with similar alterations in hemodynamics.","Sen, Rupanwita; Mallepally, Abhinandan Reddy; Sakrikar, Gayatri; Marathe, Nandan; Rathod, Tushar",Surg Neurol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7771478/,474

Tocilizumab Induces Rapid, Sustained Improvement of Inflammatory Markers in COVID-19",2020-12-31,"Economic shocks test the resilience and adaptability of the shipping industry and container ports. Each crisis triggers different ramifications in the container market. This paper investigates the temporal and spatial sequences of the supply and demand shocks of COVID-19 on container ports and the container shipping industry by comparing these events to the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Using operational and financial data from primary and secondary sources, we analyze short-term impacts and their differences, the reasons for these variations, and the evolution in the adaptive capacity and resilience of ports, terminal operators, and carriers. The analysis revolves around several inter-related domains: impacts on global supply chains; impacts on operational aspects, market structure, and strategic behavior of shipping lines and terminal operators; impacts on port activity levels in terms of vessel calls and container volumes handled; and network impacts in terms of changes in aspects of container port connectivity. The changes observed and the strategic behavior of the market players involved reveal that further adaptation mechanisms, such as slow steaming, economies of scale, and capacity management, have been applied differently between the financial crisis and COVID-19, resulting in different outcomes. For an external shock such as COVID-19, impacts are the outcome of how ports and the shipping industry fit within complex supply chains and the cargo composition handled by ports.","Notteboom, Theo; Pallis, Thanos; Rodrigue, Jean-Paul",Marit Econ Logist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781181/,474

Tracking COVID-19 in Real Time: Leveraging Public Data Sources to Inform Infection Prevention Practices,2020-12-31,"Despite the prevalence of SUDs, many individuals remain untreated (Grant et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 73(1), 39-45, 2016). Substance use disorders (SUDs) in young adults present unique challenges and stressors to parents of these individuals (D’Aniello et al., American Journal of Family Therapy, 2020; Kaur et al., International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health, 5(6), 2380-2383, 2018; Shumway et al., Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly, 37(1), 75-98, 2019). Parents and caregivers often facilitate their children’s care and provide pragmatic and emotional support to their children; this high level of care is challenging to maintain, as with any chronic, relapsing condition. In the case of SUDs, the challenges caregivers face may be exacerbated by the stigma and the blame associated with parents in the development and maintenance of children’s SUDs, and the strains that come with navigating barriers related to accessing treatment in the USA. Estimates suggest that healthcare spending for substance use treatment is relatively low and few utilize therapeutic family treatment. This disconnect between widespread SUD prevalence, and service underutilization, indicates that families who need treatment are not accessing it. The present paper synthesizes the extant literature on the role of family members in SUD treatment, as families are a primary context of care for their children’s treatment across many chronic, relapsing conditions. Finally, we identify the utility of family therapy in addressing family member’s unique needs related to their loved one with a SUD, in the family and in a treatment context.","Tambling, Rachel R.; Russell, Beth; D’Aniello, Carissa",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781401/,474

These businesses are widespread and represent a distinct form of business; they can be large corporations or home-based businesses, they can make large or small revenues, and the couples running them can have high or low levels of education. Scholars from different disciplines have addressed couple businesses, which makes the literature base fragmented. In this review of 71 articles on couple businesses, we synthesize the research around three guiding questions: what is a couple business (descriptions), where does it come from (antecedents), and where does it lead (outcomes)? Providing a cohesive picture of empirical research on couple businesses adds clarity and richness to the research field and increases our understanding of the phenomenon. Avenues for further research are discussed in five thematic areas: conceptualizations of couple businesses, work-home boundaries, gendered power differentials, and antecedents and outcomes of couple businesses.","El Shoubaki, Aliaa; Block, Jörn; Lasch, Frank",Manag Rev Q,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7782565/,474

As a result, university-industry-government collaboration is gaining importance among the agenda of policymakers to enable open innovation in SMEs. However, these inter-organisational relationships often fail to meet expectations, especially when projects are oriented to pre-competitive R&D. Nevertheless, the literature has not yet provided sufficient evidence of the challenges related to the participation of traditional SMEs (i.e., low- and medium-low tech SMEs) in this specific type of collaboration. We collected qualitative data to analyse longitudinally three pre-competitive projects, exploring the main challenges faced by traditional SMEs. We have bracketed the projects in four phases: initiation and planning phase, execution phase, closing phase, and monitoring and control phase. For each of these phases we have individuated firm- and project-level challenges, providing practical and theoretical insights for open innovation scholars.","Bertello, Alberto; Ferraris, Alberto; De Bernardi, Paola; Bertoldi, Bernardo",Int Entrep Manag J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7782566/,474
44007,493. Clinical and Epidemiological Features of Healthcare Workers Detected with Coronavirus Disease,2020-12-31,"As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), the world is currently facing a devastating pandemic of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which started as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in the Wuhan city of China in December 2019. Since then, the respiratory disease has exponentially spread to over 210 countries. By the end of April, COVID-19 had caused over three million confirmed cases of infections and over 200,000 fatalities globally. The trend poses a huge threat to global public health. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We employed a SEIHQRD delay differential mathematical transmission model with reported Kenyan data on cases of COVID-19 to estimate how transmission varies over time and which population to target for mass testing. The model is concise in structure, and successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and the vulnerable populations. The results show that, the government should target population in the informal settlement for mass testing and provide affordable sanitizers and clean water to this population. The model results also indicate that people with pre-existing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) should be identified and given special medical care. Given the absence of vaccine at the moment, non-pharmaceutical intervention is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.","Mbogo, Rachel Waema; Odhiambo, John W.",Afr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7782570/,474

Innovative Virtual Learning in the Midst of a Pandemic - Patients, Populations, and Pandemics: Responding to COVID-19",2020-12-31,"AIM: Acute bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by viral agents in children aged under two years. Treatment includes hydration, oxygen, nebulized salbutamol, and intravenous steroids. This study aimed to determine the clinically related factors, the effect of viral agents on the clinical picture, and the efficacy of treatment methods in patients admitted with acute bronchiolitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients aged under two years of age who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of moderate/severe acute bronchiolitis between March 2015 and March 2019 were included in the study. Demographic data, hospitalization time, body temperature, presence of congenital heart disease, history of atopy, acute-phase reactants, mean platelet volume values, and respiratory virus panel results were recorded. The treatment modalities, length of hospitalization, intensive care hospitalization, and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) were recorded. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-two patients were included in the study. The duration of hospitalization was found to be significantly longer in patients aged under one year and in patients with acyanotic congenital heart disease. A single viral agent was detected in 69 (51.9%) patients. Rhinovirus was detected in 70 patients and RSV was detected in 37. The duration of hospitalization was found to be significantly shorter in patients who received only oxygen and/or intravenous fluid treatment compared with those who received nebulized salbutamol and/or intravenous steroids. In addition, and there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of HFNC and hospitalization in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Rhinovirus was the most common cause of acute bronchiolitis in our study. It was observed that congenital heart disease prolonged the length of hospitalization. In the treatment approaches, it was observed that hydration and oxygen therapy were sufficient treatment methods for the patients, in accordance with the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and giving nebulized therapy prolonged the hospitalization period due to the treatment discontinuation steps.","Üzüm, Özlem; Kanık, Ali; Eliaçık, Kayı; Hortu, Hacer Örsdemir; Demirçelik, Yavuz; Yan, Mehmet; Helvacı, Mehmet; Demir, Belde Kasap",Turk Pediatri Ars,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750333/,474

Antibiotic Utilization During the COVID-19 Surge in Detroit,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Early reports have indicated widespread empiric antimicrobial usage in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As data regarding bacterial complications in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited and emerging, it is important to delineate the burden of complications with bacterial pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 and its implication on antimicrobial usage. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from March 1, 2020 to May 10, 2020. Data were collected retrospectively to determine the presence of bacterial pneumonia among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to identify demographics, comorbidities, or laboratory values that may help to distinguish patients with bacterial pneumonia. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze categorical data and Student’s t test was used to analyze differences between means. RESULTS: Among 99 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period, complication with bacterial pneumonia was seen in 17 (17%) based on sputum, tracheal aspirate or lower respiratory tract cultures performed 8.9 ± 7.8 (mean ± SD) days from the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in 8 (47%) cases while Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in 7 (41%) cases, Burkholderia cepacia in one (6%) and Rahnella aqualitis in one (6%) case. There were no significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, or laboratory findings between patients with or without complication with bacterial pneumonia. However, those with complication with bacterial pneumonia were more likely to be intubated (24% vs. 88%, p< 0.01), on vasopressors (23% vs. 82%, p < 0.01), and require intensive care unit admission (37% vs. 94%, p< 0.01). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia were commonly seen among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring intubation and intensive care use admission. With complications of bacterial pneumonia common among critically-ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, widespread antimicrobial usage may increase the selective pressure for antibiotic resistance in this patient population.

COVID 19 Pandemicity: a global situation report as of June 9, 2020",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: As of June 2, 2020, 67,113 cases and 321 deaths due to Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have been reported in healthcare personnel (HCP) in the United States. Given the close contact of HCP with individuals with COVID-19, it is important to quantify the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HCP exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at our academic medical center from March 15, 2020 to May 16, 2020. Exposure during the study period was defined as having contact with patients or other HCP with COVID-19 within 6 feet of distance for at least 90 seconds when HCP’s eyes, nose, or mouth were not covered. HCP with exposures were monitored for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 for 14 days from last exposure and those who developed symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: We identified 33 exposure events; 19 of which were patient-to-HCP exposures and 14 of which were HCP-to-HCP exposures. These 33 events resulted in 959 exposed HCP among whom 238 (25%) developed one or more symptoms of COVID-19 and required SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. Testing was performed at 7.1 ± 5.0 (mean ± SD) days from exposure. Of the 238 HCP who were tested, 82% were female and 49% were registered nurses (Table 1). Five HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, but one was presumed to have acquired the disease from a household member with confirmed COVID-19. Among the four HCP who were infected due to occupational exposure, three were nurses while one was an environmental service worker (Table 1). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Despite exposures among HCP, the risk of acquiring symptomatic COVID-19 in the healthcare setting was low with less than 1% of HCP with occupational exposure subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. With the definition of exposure now changed to at least 15 minutes of close contact without personal protective equipment, we anticipate fewer exposures at our healthcare facility and that much of COVID-19 transmission affecting HCP are due to community exposures.

44057,558. Innovative CME Tools in the Teaching of Evolving Strategies in the Management and Prevention of COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of COVID-19 relies upon RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). However, results depend upon duration of illness at the time of testing and operator performance. False negatives occur 10–30% of the time. In our center we formulated & applied a clinical prediction tool for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Patients who satisfied criteria were designated as having COVID-19 regardless of NPS results. Herein, we describe the set of patients who fulfilled full and strict clinical criteria (VHCL) (Table 1) and had at least 2 negative NPSs on hospital admission. Table 1: Clinical criteria for Very High Clinical Likelihood of COVID-19 Infection (VHCL COVID-19) [Image: see text] METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted from March 4(th) to April 11(th), 2020. We evaluated patients with ≥ 2 consecutive negative NPS COVID-19 results admitted to our hospital. Of these, we identified patients fitting all 5 criteria for Very High Clinical Likelihood (VHCL) of COVID-19 infection (Table 1). We analyzed symptoms & lab data (including results of repeat NPS testing if performed) in those patients. RESULTS: 1855 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the study period. Of these, 23 had ≥ 2 negative COVID-19 NPS results but met criteria for VHCL (Table 2). Of these 23, 7 had a subsequent 3(rd) NPS that was positive-proving infection. Similar to other reports, patients had low lymphocytes and elevated procalcitonin, ferritin, C-reactive protein levels. And consistent with proven cases, our cohort presented after a median of 5 days of symptoms (Table 3). Table 2: Clinical and laboratory characteristics of VHCL COVID-19 patients [Rows Bolded include those patients who had a 3rd NPS swab that was positive]. [Image: see text] Table 3: Demographic and Median Lab Data of VHCL COVID-19 patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: It is critical to be mindful of the imperfection of laboratory testing & to integrate clinical criteria to diagnostic algorithms. This is especially true in the COVID-19 pandemic, which is marked by high morbidity & mortality. In our study, we demonstrated how a set of clinical parameters (which we termed VHCL) can aid in widening the net of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 despite negative laboratory tests. While 16 patients in our cohort did not have a confirmatory result, the strict criteria for VHCL & the close match of other study variables with those of proven cases supports the value of VHCL designation. Applying VHCL can optimize infection control, identify patients for emerging therapeutics & aid in contact tracing to reduce nosocomial & community transmission of COVID-19.

Tocilizumab is an IL-6 inhibitor, effective in treating CRS secondary to CAR-T cell therapy. The efficacy of tocilizumab in treating Covid-19 is unknown. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at two hospitals in northern New Jersey. All patients treated with tocilizumab for confirmed or suspected Covid-19 between the dates of 3/10/20 and 4/9/20 at the study sites were included. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement on day 7 after treatment as assessed by respiratory status. Univariate analysis compared data between those who improved and those who did not. RESULTS: Forty five severe and critically ill patients treated with tocilizumab for Covid-19 were evaluated. Eleven (24%), 22 (49%) and 12 (27%) patients improved, had no change and worsened by day 7 after treatment, respectively. Lower WBC and LDH at the time of drug administration as well as shorter time from supplemental oxygen initiation to dose were significantly associated with clinical improvement in the univariate analysis.

44073,471. The Rochester Regional COVID-19 Registry: One Small Step toward a Unified National Action Plan,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Screening for communicable diseases at entry to any healthcare setting due to a patient’s travel or exposure history is an important tenet of reducing transmission of pathogens among patients and healthcare providers. We identified multiple screening tools across our enterprise leading to inconsistent documentation by staff and inability to rapidly change screening questions. We aimed to develop a customized screening tool within our electronic health record to address these challenges and provide real-time screening data to our Department of Infection Prevention. METHODS: Stakeholders from all clinical areas as well as family consultants and registration staff provided input on needs for an optimized screening tool. Process mapping across clinical areas of prior screening tools identified variation in decision support and screening questions for both countries and diseases, and demonstrated lack of clear communication between registration staff and clinical teams. Questions and decision support needed to identify communicable diseases in a waiting room setting were identified with stakeholders. Our informatics team reviewed multiple tool options available in the EHR including a built-in travel module with print groups and best practice alerts, a smartform, and flowsheets. RESULTS: Our informatics team designed a universal flowsheet with cascading rows that included clinical decision support with travel, exposure, and symptom screening. During the period of peak COVID-19 transmission in our region, an average of 1644 patients were screened daily. Of those, 2.8% screened positive for travel to an area of increased transmission with 14.9% of those who traveled reporting respiratory symptoms. An additional 4.1% of total patients screened positive for exposure to COVID-19, while 7.7% reported respiratory symptoms. Nine real-time updates to locations of increased disease transmission and symptoms have been made. Customized travel and exposure screening flowsheet cascade [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Utilizing a custom-built flowsheet model in our EHR permitted real time changes to screening to support appropriate use of infection prevention measures.

44109,54. Microbiologic Characterization and Antibacterial Use in Hospitalized Adults with covid-19 Infection,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been limited and sold at increased cost. Prior to the pandemic, we had initiated a project to improve PPE adherence and decrease cost by removing eligible patients from transmission based precautions (TBPs). At baseline, ordering providers are responsible for TBP utilization with orders through the electronic medical record. We observed that patients were in TBP when not indicated; remained in TBP beyond the appropriate time; and a reluctance on the part of providers to discontinue the orders. We tested the effect on TBP duration and PPE utilization house-wide through frequent review of TBP by a nurse educator with communication to providers of discontinuation opportunities. METHODS: From November 2019 to February 2020, all TBP orders in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) were reviewed intermittently. In March 2020, review was expanded to all inpatients with daily reviews in all units. Changes recommended and completed were tracked for all reviewed patients. We estimated cost of PPE in the PICU over time based on the number of patients in isolation and type of TBP utilized to determine whether our intervention resulted in reduced PPE use. RESULTS: Regular rounding in the PICU increased the proportion of patients in appropriate TBP and reduced the need to communicate with providers directly (33% vs 3% requiring intervention, Figure 1). Over the same time period, less PPE was used and PPE-related costs lowered (average total PPE cost $306.18 vs $95.15 per day, Figure 2). Less of an effect was seen when analyzing house-wide data. Figure 1 - P-chart of Percent Interventions Among Patients in TBP [Image: see text] Figure 2 - X-chart of Total PPE Cost in the ICU [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Isolation rounds is an effective means to ensure proper TBP adherence and manage PPE use appropriately.

RESULTS: From April 1 to June 3, we tested 2,662 persons, of which 884 (33.2%) were positive. The estimated prevalence of the time of writing is 4.9% and the rate of 4,911 per 100,000 persons. Data compiled from the first 800 laboratory-confirmed patients is summarized in table 1. Median age for confirmed cases was 40.6 (IQR 28–54). 555 cases (72.1%) were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (67.7%), subjective fever (39.5%), and muscle aches (36.8%). 30.6% of confirmed cases were asymptomatic at the time of testing. The majority of cases were among persons aged 30–39 years (22.9%). Some of the most common comorbidities in confirmed cases included cardiovascular disease (30.4%), substance abuse (30.1%), and diabetes (25.0%). There were 18 (2.04%) deaths. Clinical findings among symptomatic patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We observed a significantly higher prevalence (10-times) and attack rate of (17-times) COVID-19 in a well-defined NA population, when compared to the general Arizona population. We provide characteristics of these cases and report that nearly a third were asymptomatic at the time of testing. More research is needed to understand the rapid spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable rural communities.

44143,64. Metagenomic Sequencing to Identify Alternative Infections and Co-infections in Persons Under Investigation for covid-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the diversity, breadth, magnitude, and functional profile of the T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 individuals is critical to evaluate the contribution of T cells to produce a potentially protective immune response. METHODS: We used a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach to screen a total of 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate peptide epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cohort of 30 individuals recovered from COVID-19. The peptides spanned the whole viral genome and were restricted to six prevalent HLA alleles; T cells were simultaneously characterized by a 28-marker phenotypic panel. The evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was then statistically modeled against time from diagnosis, and in relation to humoral and inflammatory response. Workflow for Study. A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 candidate peptide epitopes in a cohort of 30 COVID-19 recovered patients across 6 prevalent HLA alleles, and T cells profiled with a 28-marker phenotypic panel. [Image: see text] Multiplex tetramer screen. One representative COVID-19 recovered patient and one healthy donor were screened for HLA- relevant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, as well as epitopes for CMV, EBV, Influenza, Adenovirus and MART-1. Shown are the frequencies of tetramer-positive CD8 T cells from 2 technical replicates per subject. [Image: see text] RESULTS: Almost all individuals screened showed a T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 (29/30): 132 SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells hits were detected, corresponding to 52 unique reactive epitopes. Twelve of the 52 unique SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes were recognized by more than 40% of the individuals screened, indicating high prevalence in the subjects. Importantly, these CD8+ T cell responses were directed against both structural and non-structural viral proteins, with the highest magnitude against nucleocapsid derived peptides, but without any antigen-driven bias in the phenotype of specific T cells. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 T cells showed specific states of differentiation (stem-cell memory and transitional memory), which differed from those of MART-1, influenza, CMV and EBV-specific T cells. UMAP visualization revealed a phenotypic profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells in COVID-19 convalescent donors that is distinct from other viral specificities, such as influenza, CMV, EBV and Adenovirus. [Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2 epitope screening revealed CD8+ T cell responses directed against both structural and non-structural viral proteins, with the highest magnitude response against nucleocapsid derived peptides [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The kinetics modeling demonstrates a dynamic, evolving immune response characterized by a time-dependent decrease in overall inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and progressive differentiation of a broad SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell response. It could be desirable to aim at recapitulating the hallmarks of this robust CD8 T cell response in the design of protective COVID-19 vaccines.

Biomarker elevation during COVID-19: Differences between ambulatory and hospitalized individuals,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to many different cardiovascular complications, we were interested in studying prognostic markers in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter (A. Fib/Flutter). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and either with existing or new onset A. Fib/Flutter who were admitted to our hospital between March 15 and May 20, 2020. Demographic, outcome and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic medical record and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to identify the prognostic markers associated with mortality in patients with A. Fib/Flutter RESULTS: The total number of confirmed COVID-19 patients during the study period was 350; 37 of them had existing or new onset A. Fib/Flutter. Twenty one (57%) expired, and 16 (43%) were discharged alive. The median age was 72 years old, ranged from 19 to 100 years old. Comorbidities were present in 33 (89%) patients, with hypertension (82%) being the most common, followed by diabetes (46%) and coronary artery disease (30%). New onset of atrial fibrillation was identified in 23 patients (70%), of whom 13 (57%) expired; 29 patients (78%) presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and 2 patients (5%) with atrial flutter. Mechanical ventilation was required for 8 patients, of whom 6 expired. In univariate analysis, we found a significant difference in baseline ferritin (p=0.04), LDH (p=0.02), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p=0.05), neutrophil-monocyte ratio (NMR) (p=0.03) and platelet (p=0.015) between survivors and non-survivors. With multivariable logistic regression analysis, the only value that had an odds of survival was a low NLR (odds ratio 0.74; 95% confidence interval 0.53–0.93). CONCLUSION: This retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 demonstrated an association of increase NLR as risk factors for death in COVID-19 patients with A. Fib/Flutter. A high NLR has been associated with increased incidence, severity and risk for stroke in atrial fibrillation patients but to our knowledge, we are first to demonstrate the utilization in mortality predictions in COVID-19 patients with A. Fib/Flutter.

44148,405. Trend in blood culture results in Washington DC during and prior to Pandemic COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Children and young adults were initially reported as largely spared from severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the impact to this population has been significant. METHODS: This observational retrospective cohort study includes 420 symptomatic children and young adults with lab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated between March 15 and June 16, 2020 at Children’s National Hospital in Washington DC. We identified and compared cohorts of non-hospitalized (N=324) and hospitalized (N=96) patients, including non-critically ill (N=64) and critically ill hospitalized (N=32) patients. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records RESULTS: Of 420 SARS-CoV-2-infected symptomatic patients, 23% required hospitalization, of which 67% were non-critically ill and 33% were critically ill. All age groups were represented in the symptomatic cohort, with a median age of 8.6 years. Patients > 15 years of age represented 44% of critical care admissions. Males and females were equally represented in all cohorts. Underlying medical conditions were present in 36%, but more common in hospitalized (59 %) and critically ill (66 %) patients. The most frequent underlying diagnosis overall was asthma (16 %), but also included neurologic (6 %), diabetes (3 %), obesity (3 %), cardiac (3 %), hematologic (3 %) and oncologic (1 %) conditions. The majority (66 %) of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presented with respiratory symptoms with or without fever. Other symptoms were also present, including diarrhea/vomiting (21 %), myalgia (11 %), chest pain (8 %) and loss of sense of smell or taste (7%). Hospitalized patients required varying levels of respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation, BiPAP, RAM cannula and HFNC. Additional presentations included diabetic hyperglycemia, sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis, vascular complications, and multisystem inflammation. Treatment included remdesivir, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab and other therapies. CONCLUSION: Although children/young adults have been less affected than elderly adults, the impact of SARS-CoV2 on this population has been significant in Washington DC and informs other regions anticipating their surge.

44717,What makes you continuously use chatbot services? Evidence from chinese online travel agencies,2021-01-21,"Background The overwhelming majority of published articles have taken colon and rectal cancer as a single group, i.e., colorectal cancer, when normalizing gene expression data with housekeeping genes (HKG) in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments though there are published reports that suggest the differential expression pattern of genes between the colon and rectal cancer groups and hence the current experiment was attempted to find out the optimal set of housekeeping genes from the list of common HKG for rectal tumor gene expression analysis. Methods The expression of five potential housekeeping genes GAPDH, RPNI, PUM1, B2M, and PMM1 was analyzed through qPCR and Bestkeeper software (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/bestkeeper.html) in 20 stage II-IV rectal cancer samples to check for uniformity in their expression pattern. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker (EMT) markers E cadherin, vimentin, Twist, and SNAI2 expression were evaluated in conjunction with the two optimal reference genes in 10 rectal cancers as part of validation. Results The standard deviation of the cycle threshold value of GAPDH was found the lowest at 0.65 followed by RPN1 at 0.88, PUM1 at 0.94, PMM1 at 0.94, and B2M at 1.21 when analyzed with BestKeeper software. Using GAPDH and PUM1 as the reference gene for the validation phase, rectal cancer patients with stage III/IV showed a 4.79-fold change (P=0.006) in ALDH1 expression, and an 11.76-fold change in Twist expression (P=0.003) with respect to stage II rectal tumor when normalized with GAPDH and PUM1. Conclusion GAPDH and PUM1 can be used as an optimal set of housekeeping genes for gene expression-related experiments in rectal tumors. ALDH1 and Twist were found significantly overexpressed in stage III/IV rectal tumors in comparison to stage II rectal cancer. Genes associated with cancer stem cells and EMT markers could be optimally analyzed by normalizing them with GAPDH and PUM1 as housekeeping genes.","Vermani, Litika; Kumar, Rajeev; Senthil Kumar, Nachimuthu",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7797410/,474

There have been few cases of incidental findings of perfusion abnormalities on early quality control images of the lungs during radiolabeled white blood cell studies. This study is the first to detect perfusion defects on the early quality control images of the lungs during a labelled white blood cell study suspicious of pulmonary embolism in an unknown but treated COVID-19 patient. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 40-year-old male who was referred to our department for a nuclear medicine (99m)Tc HMPAO-labelled white blood cell study to rule out osteomyelitis of his right foot. Early 5-min quality control images of his lungs revealed two perfusion defects in the right lung. A suspicion of pulmonary embolism was made, and a perfusion only SPECT/CT study the next day confirmed the suspicion of pulmonary embolism in one of the defects, with a possible fissure sign as a differential. CONCLUSION: There has been an increase in the incidence of lung perfusion abnormalities and pulmonary embolism during the COVID-19 pandemic.

56528,Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 disease: Too good to pass up or too good to be true?,2021-06-14,"Fruits have been widely consumed since the beginning of human evolution and are important source of a healthy being and helpful in treating various diseases as immunity boosters with the presence of a rich amount of health-promoting bioactives. Therapeutic efficacies of fruit extracts are reported to have immune-modulatory properties and influence greatly on the immune system of human body. Given the facts of the efficacy of edible fruits in improving the immunity of body as immune-stimulants, we have tried to consolidate the previously published data on edible fruits and its juices with antiviral potential. The objective of this review was to gather information on edible fruits with antiviral properties and the efforts to obtain their efficient delivery. Online bibliographical databases like PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were used to search literature on the antiviral effect of edible fruit extracts and fruit juices. The edible fruits like almond, apple, bael, blackberry, black currants, crane berry, citrus, grapes, Japanese cherry, mango, mulberry, pistachios, pomegranate, and strawberry showed promising antiviral properties against the different pathogenic viruses. The review provided an overview of likely effects of the intake of edible fruit extracts/fruit juices to strengthen the immune cells by reducing the oxidative stress in host body system which in turn inhibits the viral attachment and replication on the host cell. Hence these fruits can also be exploited in combating COVID-19 in the current pandemic situation. To validate the present hypothesis, the proposed edible fruit extracts can be evaluated against the SARS-CoV-2 via in vitro and in vivo models to confirm the fact.","Santhi, Veerasamy Pushparaj; Sriramavaratharajan, Venkatraman; Murugan, Ramar; Masilamani, Poomaruthai; Gurav, Shailendra S.; Sarasu, Veerasamy Pushparaj; Parthiban, Subbaiyan; Ayyanar, Muniappan",Food Measure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328999/,474

Community-based approaches are a key focus of public health strategy in the UK, and may reduce the impact of these risks, protecting mental health and promoting wellbeing. We conducted a review of UK community-based interventions to understand the types of intervention studied and mental health/wellbeing impacts reported. METHOD We conducted a scoping review of the literature, systematically searching six electronic databases (2000-2020) to identify academic studies of any non-clinical community intervention to improve mental health or wellbeing outcomes for older adults. Data were extracted, grouped by population targeted, intervention type, and outcomes reported, and synthesised according to a framework categorising community actions targeting older adults. RESULTS In total, 1,131 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 54 included in the final synthesis. Example interventions included: link workers; telephone helplines; befriending; digital support services; group social activities. These were grouped into: connector services, gateway services/approaches, direct interventions and systems approaches. These interventions aimed to address key risk factors: loneliness, social isolation, being a caregiver and living with long-term health conditions. Outcome measurement varied greatly, confounding strong evidence in favour of particular intervention types. CONCLUSION The literature is wide-ranging in focus and methodology. Greater specificity and consistency in outcome measurement are required to evidence effectiveness - no single category of intervention yet stands out as 'promising'.

Studies have demonstrated that Geritalk, a two day (16 hours total) in-person communication skills training improves self-assessed preparedness, skill acquisition, and sustained practice of communication skills. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Geritalk was adapted to a virtual format (4 days, 10 hours total). OBJECTIVES Our study evaluated the change in participants' self-assessed preparedness for serious illness communication before and after the virtual course and satisfaction with the course, and compared these findings to responses from a prior in-person Geritalk course. METHODS Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine fellows at three urban academic medical centers completed surveys, which employed 5-point Likert scales, before and after the virtual course to assess satisfaction with the course and preparedness for serious illness communication. RESULTS Of the 20 virtual Geritalk participants, 17 (85%) completed the pre-course assessment, and 14 (70%) completed the post-course assessment. Overall, satisfaction with the course was high (mean 4.9 on a 5-point scale). Compared to in-person Geritalk participants, virtual course participants reported comparable and significant (p <.01) improvements in mean self-reported preparedness across all surveyed communication skills. CONCLUSION We show that a virtual communication skills training is feasible and effective. Our findings suggest that the innovative virtual Geritalk course has the potential to increase access to communication skills training, improve serious illness communication skills, and in turn, improve the quality of care received by older adults with serious illness.","Frydman, Julia L; Gelfman, Laura P; Lindenberger, Elizabeth C; Smith, Cardinale B; Berns, Stephen; Kelley, Amy S; Dow, Lindsay A",Journal of pain and symptom management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.02.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631324/,474

DESIGN Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Linked, person-level health system administrative data on older adults who were newly diagnosed with dementia and resided in an assisted living facility in Ontario, Canada, from 2014 to 2019 (n = 977). METHODS Access to a dementia care program in an assisted living facility (n = 57) was examined. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with robust standard errors clustered on the assisted living facility was used to model the time to transition to a nursing home from the new dementia diagnosis. RESULTS There were 11.8 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults who resided in an assisted living facility with a dementia care program, compared with 20.5 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults who resided in an assisted living facility without a dementia care program. After adjustment for relevant characteristics at baseline, older adults who resided in an assisted living facility with a dementia care program had a 40% lower rate of transition to a nursing home (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.44, 0.81), compared with those in an assisted living facility without such a program at any point during the follow-up period.

Patient pain as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) was the primary study endpoint. Clinical evaluation, with careful attention to the identification of hernia recurrence, was performed at 1 month and 1 year. The evaluation of fixation precision, quality of fixation and ease of use was assessed by the primary surgeon. RESULTS The mean patient pain was 1.3 (+/-1.4) at discharge, 0.1 (+/-0.4) at 1 month and 0.0 (+/-0.1) (one patient with VAS 1/10) at 1 year, respectively. The mean operative time was 19 +/- 4 min. There was one minor cutaneous infection and no documented recurrence. The quality of the gripping effect was rated very good in 51 (98.1%) of the cases performed. CONCLUSION The use of a novel low-density, macroporous mesh with semi-resorbable self-fixing properties during tension-free repair may be a satisfactory solution to the clinical problems of pain and recurrence following inguinal herniorrhaphy.","Chastan, P",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-008-0451-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19005611/,474

109060,Serum antibody response in COVID-19-recovered patients who retested positive.,2021-05-07,"The fabrication of large-scale, solid-supported lipid bilayer (SLB) arrays has traditionally been an arduous and complex task, primarily due to the need to maintain SLBs within an aqueous environment. In this work, we demonstrate the use of trehalose vitrified phospholipid vesicles that facilitate on-demand generation of microarrays, allowing each element a unique composition, for the label-free and high-throughput analysis of biomolecular interactions by SPR imaging (SPRi). Small, unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are suspended in trehalose, deposited in a spatially defined manner, with the trehalose vitrifying on either hydrophilic or hydrophobic SPR substrates. SLBs are subsequently spontaneously formed on-demand simply by in situ hydration of the array in the SPR instrument flow cell. The resulting SLBs exhibit high lateral mobility, characteristic of fluidic cellular lipid membranes, and preserve the biological function of embedded cell membrane receptors, as indicated by SPR affinity measurements. Independent fluorescence and SPR imaging studies show that the individual SLBs stay localized at the area of deposition, without any encapsulating matrix, confining coral, or boundaries. The introduced methodology allows individually addressable SLB arrays to be analyzed with excellent label-free sensitivity in a real-time, high-throughput manner. Various protein-ganglioside interactions have been selected as a model system to illustrate discrimination of strong and weak binding responses in SPRi sensorgrams. This methodology has been applied toward generating hybrid bilayer membranes on hydrophobic SPR substrates, demonstrating its versatility toward a range of surfaces and membrane geometries. The stability of the fabricated arrays, over medium to long storage periods, was evaluated and found to be good. The highly efficient and easily scalable nature of the method has the potential to be applied to a variety of label-free sensing platforms requiring lipid membranes for high-throughput analysis of their properties and constituents.","Hinman, Samuel S; Ruiz, Charles J; Drakakaki, Georgia; Wilkop, Thomas E; Cheng, Quan",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b03809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26193345/,474

119352,IVIG Compared to IVIG Plus Infliximab in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children.,2021-09-21,"BACKGROUND& OBJECTIVES Although about 80% of COVID-19 cases are reported to be mild, the remaining 20% of cases often result in a severe disease with the potential of crushing already overstrained health care services. There has been sustainable growth of COVID-19 cases worldwide since mid-May 2020. In order to keep tabs on community transmission of COVID-19 infection screening of the samples from large population is needed which includes asymptomatic/symptomatic individuals along with migrant population. This requires extra resources, man power and time for detection of SARS-CoV-2by RT-PCR. In current scenario pooled sample testingstrategy advocated by ICMR, New Delhiis a new approach which is very promising in resource limited settings. In this study we have evaluated pooled strategy in terms of accurate testing results, utilization of consumables and identification of border line positive cases. MATERIALS & METHODS Between April-June 2020 we performed COVID-19 testing by RTPCR from areas with varying prevalence of population referred to COVID laboratory, Dr RMLIMS, Lucknow. In a first step the samples are collated into pools of 5 or 10.These pools are tested by RT-PCR. Negative Pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 are then deconvoluted and each sample is tested individually. RESULTS In the present study, we tested 4620 samples in 462 pools of 10 and 14940 samples in 2990 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool 61 (13%) pools flagged positive in first step. In second step among 61 pools (610 samples) deconvoluted strategy was followed in which 72 individual samples came positive. Pooled-sample testing strategy helps saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76% to 93% less tests done in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSIONS Pooled-sample PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison to individual testing without compromising the result outcome of test. In particular, pooled-sample approach can facilitate mass screening in early coming stages of COVID-19 outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income settings and control the spread by meticulous testing of all risk groups.

COVID-19 mainly causes the respiratory complications of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, and severe immune disruptions. The assays depict that though people recuperate from COVID-19, there are still symptoms that persists in the body causing discomfort, which is the consequence of the viral infection due to severe immune disruptions. Upon various difficulties of post COVID-19, the pulmonary fibrosis is the stumbling block in the lungs causing severe damage. In this review, we have shown the effectiveness and importance of the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) secreted by Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) therapy on selective stoppage of the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-β) signalling pathway by causing immunomodulatory effects that ameliorate the pulmonary fibrosis through paracrine signalling. However, more pilot studies have to be carried out to determine the efficacy and outcomes of the re-emerging complication.","Vishnupriya, M; Naveenkumar, M; Manjima, K; Sooryasree, N V; Saranya, T; Ramya, S; Harysh Winster, S; Paulpandi, M; Balachandar, V; Arul, N",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202103_25438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829461/,474

However, laparoscopic total gastrectomy is developing relatively slowly because of technical difficulties, particularly in esophagojejunostomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 83 patients with early gastric cancer in the upper portion of the stomach who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy between April 2007 and March 2016. We classified the patients into three periods, mainly on the basis of the esophagojejunostomy procedures performed: first period, various conventional procedures based on the physicians' choice (n=14); second period, transoral method (n=51); and third period, fully intracorporeal technique (n=18). We evaluated the clinical impact of a stepwise introduction of unfamiliar new methods during laparoscopic total gastrectomy. RESULTS Between the first and second periods, there were significant differences in the blood loss volume, number of harvested lymph nodes, frequency of conversion to open surgery, and postoperative hospital stay. The number of harvested lymph nodes was significantly higher in the third than in the second period, with no detriment to other intraoperative or postoperative factors. CONCLUSION The use of a unified surgical method for esophagojejunostomy seems to be the key to a successful and advantageous laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Stepwise introduction of a well-established technique of esophagojejunostomy during laparoscopic total gastrectomy will benefit patients, as shown, for example, by the higher number of dissected lymph nodes in the present study. However, a protracted learning curve is required.","Yasukawa, Daiki; Hori, Tomohide; Kadokawa, Yoshio; Kato, Shigeru; Machimoto, Takafumi; Hata, Toshiyuki; Aisu, Yuki; Sasaki, Maho; Kimura, Yusuke; Takamatsu, Yuichi; Ito, Tatsuo; Yoshimura, Tsunehiro",Annals of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2017.0157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28845113/,474

METHODS A 43-question survey was sent to cardiac surgery Centres worldwide. The survey analysed the pre-pandemic organization of the Centre, the Centre's response to Covid-19 in terms of re-organization pathways, surveillance methods, personalprotective equipment (PPE), and allowed surgical practice with results. RESULTS Sixty-one out of 64 Centres (95.3%) fulfilled the survey. One third of ICUs were transformed into COVID-19 dedicated-ICUs and one-third moved to another location inside the hospital. Negative-pressure rooms were available in 60.6% Centres. Informative measures from hospital administration were received after the first COVID-19 admitted case in 36.1% and during the spread of the infection inside the hospital in 19.6%. Inadequate supply of PPE was common, with no COVID-surveillance of the medical personnel in 4.9% of Centres. COVID-19 infected 7.4% of staff surgeons , 8.3% of residents and 9.5% of anaesthetists. Cardiac surgery caseload declined in 93.4% Centres. COVID-19 infection in patients receiving cardiac surgery resulted in 41-50% mortality in 9.5% Centres, and 91-100% mortality in 4.7% Centres. Successful weaning with survival from V-V ECMO and V-A ECMO was <50% in 79.2% and 80.0% Centres respectively. COVID-19 infection in transplanted patients was rare, with a reported mortality of 0.5% and 1% in one Centre each. CONCLUSIONS There is room for improvement in hospital surveillance, informative measures and PPE to the personnel.

158576,Economic Evaluations of Artificial Intelligence in Ophthalmology.,2021-07-13,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease that causes episodic attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal edema, which can be painful, incapacitating, and potentially fatal. These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE. In conclusion, an increasing shift towards the use of highly effective long-term prophylaxis is anticipated, which should drastically abate the burden on patients with hereditary angioedema.","Fijen, Lauré M; Bork, Konrad; Cohn, Danny M",Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-021-08832-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423210/,474

They can happen anywhere and at any time and regional hospitals and health-care providers have to mount a response quickly and effectively to save as many lives as possible. Radiologists must go from passenger to pilot when it comes to MCI planning. When involved at the hospital-wide planning stage, they can offer valuable expertise on how radiology can improve triage accuracy and at what cost in terms of time and resources and thereby contribute a pragmatic understanding of radiology's role and value during MCIs.

159990,"Severe acute respiratory illness surveillance for coronavirus disease 2019, India, 2020.",2020-04-09,"Human factors, including contact structure, movement, impact on the environment and patterns of behaviour, can have significant influence on the emergence of novel infectious diseases and the transmission and amplification of established ones. As anthropogenic climate change alters natural systems and global economic forces drive land-use and land-cover change, it becomes increasingly important to understand both the ecological and social factors that impact infectious disease outcomes for human populations. While the field of disease ecology explicitly studies the ecological aspects of infectious disease transmission, the effects of the social context on zoonotic pathogen spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission are comparatively neglected in the literature. The social sciences encompass a variety of disciplines and frameworks for understanding infectious diseases; however, here we focus on four primary areas of social systems that quantitatively and qualitatively contribute to infectious diseases as social-ecological systems. These areas are social mixing and structure, space and mobility, geography and environmental impact, and behaviour and behaviour change. Incorporation of these social factors requires empirical studies for parametrization, phenomena characterization and integrated theoretical modelling of social-ecological interactions. The social-ecological system that dictates infectious disease dynamics is a complex system rich in interacting variables with dynamically significant heterogeneous properties. Future discussions about infectious disease spillover and transmission in human populations need to address the social context that affects particular disease systems by identifying and measuring qualitatively important drivers.This article is part of the themed issue 'Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'.","Arthur, Ronan F; Gurley, Emily S; Salje, Henrik; Bloomfield, Laura S P; Jones, James H","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The present study evaluated the prevalence of IA in patients with AD and identified potential risk factors of IA using nationwide representative cohort sample data. Methods and Results We defined AD as both aortic dissections and aortic aneurysms. This study used a nationwide representative cohort sample from the Korea National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database from 1.1million patients. Using χ2 or Fisher's exact tests, the prevalence of the IA in patients with AD and potential risk factors for their concurrence were analyzed. The prevalence of IA in patients with AD was 6.8% (155/2285). The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for having concurrent IA in patients with AD was 3.809 (95% CI, 3.191-4.546; P<0.01). Patients with AD and hypertension were >19 times more likely to be affected by IA (adjusted OR, 18.679; 95% CI, 16.555-21.076; P<0.01). Patients with AD and diabetes mellitus, old age (>60 years), and male sex were >4, 3, and 2 times more likely to be affected by IA, respectively (adjusted OR, 4.291, 3.469, and 1.983, respectively; 95% CI, 3.914-4.704, 3.152-3.878, and 1.779-2.112, respectively). Subgroup analysis with socioeconomic status or disability revealed that the prevalence of IA was significantly higher in all groups.

Our proposed study was designed to research whether COVID-19 is a driver of digital transformation and to look at the three most positive and negative DT disruptors. Our study suggests that COVID-19 is a driver of digital transformation, since 94 percent of respondents agreed that COVID-19 is a driver of DT. The second phase of our study shows that technology, automation, and collaboration (TAC) is the most positive significant factor which enables work from anywhere (WFA) (or work from home) arrangements and also leads to the third positive factor of a work-life balance (WLB). The top three negative factors are no work-life balance (NWL), social employment issues (SEI), and data security and technology issues (DST). The negative factors show a contradictory result since NWL is the most negative factor, even though WLB is the third most positive factor. While the pandemic situation is leading to a positive situation for economies and organizations at a micro level, the negative impacts, which will affect overall economic growth as well as social, health, and wealth wellbeing, need to be kept in mind. The motivation of this study was to research positive and negative effects of COVID-19 on DT, since COVID-19 is impacting everyone and everyday life, including businesses.

The properties of the alpha- and flavivirus fusion proteins distinguish them from the class I viral fusion proteins, such as influenza virus hemagglutinin, and establish them as the first members of the class II fusion proteins. Understanding how this new class carries out membrane fusion will require analysis of the structural basis for both the interaction of the protein subunits within the homotrimer and their interaction with the viral and target membranes. To this end we report a purification method for the E1 ectodomain homotrimer from the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus. The purified protein is trimeric, detergent soluble, retains the characteristic stability of the starting homotrimer, and is free of lipid and other contaminants. In contrast to the postfusion structures that have been determined for the class I proteins, the E1 homotrimer contains the fusion peptide region responsible for interaction with target membranes. This E1 trimer preparation is an excellent candidate for structural studies of the class II viral fusion proteins, and we report conditions that generate three-dimensional crystals suitable for analysis by X-ray diffraction. Determination of the structure will provide our first high-resolution views of both the low-pH-induced trimeric conformation and the target membrane-interacting region of the alphavirus fusion protein.","Gibbons, Don L; Reilly, Brigid; Ahn, Anna; Vaney, Marie-Christine; Vigouroux, Armelle; Rey, Felix A; Kielian, Margaret",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15016874/,474

Transmission patterns suggest spread by respiratory droplet or close person-to-person contact. To elucidate the correlation of clinical presentation to the pathogenesis and course of the disease, we reviewed the pulmonary pathologic specimens of SARS patients taken at different stages of the disease. METHODS Four ""probable"" cases of SARS were studied. SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection was demonstrated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all 4 patients. The pulmonary specimens were taken on day 7 after symptom onset in patient 1, day 11 in patient 2, day 17 in patient 3, and day 21 in patient 4. RESULTS The autopsy lung tissue from patient 1, who died 7 days after symptoms onset due to the complication of acute myocardial infarction, revealed mild histologic change in the lung. Only focal pulmonary edema or hemorrhage was seen. In the second patient, who died 11 days after symptom onset, severe acute alveolar damage was characterized by patchy or diffuse lung edema, hyaline membrane formation, and scarce lymphocytic infiltration. The lymphocytes were mostly CD3-positive and CD20-negative. In the third patient, biopsy specimen taken 17 days after symptom onset showed patches of organizing pneumonia with reactive fibroblastic proliferation, more abundant type II pneumocytes and clustering of CD68-positive macrophages within the alveolar spaces. Few CD68-positive syncytial multinucleated giant cells were also seen in the specimens but no viral inclusion body could be identified in these cells. The lung biopsy specimen from patient 4 taken 21 days after symptom onset showed characteristics of the fibrotic stage, with significant myofibroblastic proliferation in the alveolar space and interstitium resulting in loss of pulmonary architecture. The number of CD3-positive lymphocytes and of CD68-positive macrophages in this specimen from a patient in the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) whose condition deteriorated was less than in the specimen from case 3 who was in the early proliferative phase of DAD and eventually recovered. CONCLUSIONS The histologic evolution of SARS coincided with the different stages of DAD: acute, proliferative organizing, and fibrotic stages. SARS cannot be differentiated from the other etiologies of DAD by morphologic examination alone. The absence of DAD does not rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV infection, particularly in the early stage of the disease.","Hsiao, Cheng Hsiang; Wu, Mu-Zong; Chen, Chi-Long; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Hsieh, Shun-Wen; Yang, Pan-Chyr; Su, Ih-Jen",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15765160/,474

Infection with or immunization against any of these viruses induces a subset of antibodies that are broadly flavivirus cross-reactive but do not exhibit significant cross-neutralization. Nevertheless, these antibodies can efficiently bind to the major envelope protein (E), which is the main target of neutralizing and protective antibodies because of its receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. The structural basis for this phenomenon is still unclear. In our studies with TBE virus, we have provided evidence that such cross-reactive antibodies are specific for a cluster of epitopes that are partially occluded in the cage-like assembly of E proteins at the surfaces of infectious virions and involve-but are not restricted to-amino acids of the highly conserved internal fusion peptide loop. Virus disintegration leads to increased accessibility of these epitopes, allowing the cross-reactive antibodies to bind with strongly increased avidity. The cryptic properties of these sites in the context of infectious virions can thus provide an explanation for the observed lack of efficient neutralizing activity of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, despite their specificity for a functionally important structural element in the E protein.","Stiasny, Karin; Kiermayr, Stefan; Holzmann, Heidemarie; Heinz, Franz X",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16973559/,474

199825,Organizing pneumonia following Covid19 pneumonia,2021,"Study of coronavirus OC43 infections has been limited because of the lack of sensitive cell culture systems and serologic assays. To improve this circumstance, we developed an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect serum antibody to OC43. Antigen (100 ng) prepared by polyethylene glycol precipitation provided optimal results without a postcoat procedure. Evaluation of intraplate variation indicated that a > or = 2.5-fold increase in serum titer was significant. Sixteen of 18 (89%) paired serum samples with previously identified, reproducible increases in the level of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody to OC43 also showed significant increases as detected by EIA. Specificity for the EIA was established with paired sera obtained from persons given influenza immunizations or experiencing a respiratory infection. No rise in antibody titers occurred among 33 persons with documented coronavirus 229E infection. EIA was then performed on each of 419 paired serum samples from ambulatory chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and healthy older adults, from asthmatic adults presenting for emergency room treatment, and from persons hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms. Twenty-three antibody rises to OC43 were detected; only nine of these were detected by the HAI test, and the HAI test did not detect any increases in antibody titers that were not detected by EIA. Nineteen of 25 coronavirus OC43 infections for which a month of infection could be assigned occurred between November and February. Overall, 4.4% of acute respiratory illnesses in the studied populations were associated with a coronavirus OC43 infection.","Gill, E P; Dominguez, E A; Greenberg, S B; Atmar, R L; Hogue, B G; Baxter, B D; Couch, R B",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7814468/,474
200460,A Potential Role of the Renin-Angiotensin-System for Disturbances of Respiratory Chemosensitivity in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,2020,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been crucial in curbing COVID-19 in the United States (US). Consequently, relaxing NPIs through a phased re-opening of the US amid still-high levels of COVID-19 susceptibility could lead to new epidemic waves. This calls for a COVID-19 early warning system. Here we evaluate multiple digital data streams as early warning indicators of increasing or decreasing state-level US COVID-19 activity between January and June 2020. We estimate the timing of sharp changes in each data stream using a simple Bayesian model that calculates in near real-time the probability of exponential growth or decay. Analysis of COVID-19-related activity on social network microblogs, Internet searches, point-of-care medical software, and a metapopulation mechanistic model, as well as fever anomalies captured by smart thermometer networks, shows exponential growth roughly 2-3 weeks prior to comparable growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3-4 weeks prior to comparable growth in COVID-19 deaths across the US over the last 6 months. We further observe exponential decay in confirmed cases and deaths 5-6 weeks after implementation of NPIs, as measured by anonymized and aggregated human mobility data from mobile phones. Finally, we propose a combined indicator for exponential growth in multiple data streams that may aid in developing an early warning system for future COVID-19 outbreaks. These efforts represent an initial exploratory framework, and both continued study of the predictive power of digital indicators as well as further development of the statistical approach are needed.","Kogan, Nicole E; Clemente, Leonardo; Liautaud, Parker; Kaashoek, Justin; Link, Nicholas B; Nguyen, Andre T; Lu, Fred S; Huybers, Peter; Resch, Bernd; Havas, Clemens; Petutschnig, Andreas; Davis, Jessica; Chinazzi, Matteo; Mustafa, Backtosch; Hanage, William P; Vespignani, Alessandro; Santillana, Mauricio",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676518/,474

AIM: To study the association between various hematological parameters and disease severity of COVID-19. To analyze the effects of hypertension and diabetes on neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil-monocyte ratio in patients suffering from COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional study involving 148 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of disease severity. Various hematological parameters were analyzed. The effects of hypertension and diabetes on NLR and NMR in COVID-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 148 patients, 78.4%, 8.1% and 13.5% cases were in the mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively. Mean age was 42.63 ± 16.04 years (IQR: 29, 54.75; Range: 7-74). 58.8% patients were male while the rest (42.2%) were female. Mean TLC (cells/mm3), neutrophil (%), lymphocyte (%), monocyte (%), eosinophil (%), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and neutrophil-monocyte ratio (NMR) among mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Basophil (%) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) was statistically insignificant among the three groups. Lymphocyte (%), monocyte (%) and eosinophil (%) were negatively correlated to disease severity. Among diabetics, both NLR and NMR were statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, among hypertensive cases, only the NLR was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Older age, higher TLC, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, high NLR and high NMR are associated with severe COVID-19. High NLR and high NMR are indicative of severe disease among diabetic patients. High NLR also indicates severe disease among hypertensive patients.","Anurag, Aditya; Jha, Prakash Kumar; Kumar, Abhishek",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,474

Many researches proved the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples of patients, where the genes of this virus gave a positive signal several days prior to the occurrence of symptoms. The fact of viral shedding in stools provides an advantage in utilizing wastewater systems as a tool to monitor the viral prevalence. We tested more than 2900 municipal wastewater samples coming from 49 distinctive area in Dubai, where 28.6% showed positive results.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the imposed social confinement have produced significant stress, anxiety, and worries about health and the fear of being infected, jobs and financial problems, and uncertainty about the future. The incidence of sleep disturbances has also increased dramatically during this period. Aside from stress and anxiety, two other factors are likely to contribute to increased sleep disturbances during this crisis. First, alterations of our daily routines such as arising at a specific time, showing up at work, eating, exercising, and engaging in social and leisure activities at relatively fixed times are all important timekeepers for our sleep-wake cycles to remain synchronized with the day (light) and night (dark) cycles. Alterations of these timekeepers, combined with reduced daylight exposure, also essential to keep our biological clock synchronized, are likely to disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Sleep plays a fundamental role for mental and physical health, and adequate sleep duration and quality are essential for coping with major life events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health education is warranted to keep the population well informed about the importance of sleep and healthy sleep practices in order to cope with the pandemic and prevent or minimize long-term adverse outcomes.","Morin, Charles M; Carrier, Julie; Bastien, Célyne; Godbout, Roger",Can J Public Health,,474

In this study, we estimated changes in the biovolume-based composition of a polyculture built in vitro and composed of three algal strains: Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., and Parachlorella sp. This study was performed using the PhotoBiobox under different temperatures (10-36°C) and light intensities (50-700 µmol m-2 s-1) in air and in 5% CO2. In 5% CO2, Chlorella sp. exhibited better adaptation to high temperatures than in air conditions. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the composition of Parachlorella sp. was highly related to temperature whereas Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. showed negative correlations in both air and 5% CO2. Furthermore, light intensity slightly affected the composition of Scenedesmus sp., whereas no significant effect was observed in other species. Based on these results, it is speculated that temperature is an important factor in influencing changes in algal polyculture community structure (PCS). These results further confirm that the PhotoBiobox is a convenient and available tool of performing lab-scale experiments on PCS changes. The application of the PhotoBiobox to the study of PCS will provide new insight into polyculture-based ecology.","Cho, Dae-Hyun; Cho, Kichul; Heo, Jina; Kim, Urim; Lee, Yong Jae; Choi, Dong-Yun; Yoo, Chan; Kim, Hee-Sik; Bae, Seunghee",,,474

A total of 6,505 patients (in 18 cross-sectional studies) were included to estimate the pooled prevalence of AKI, and 18,934 patients (in 27 cohort studies) were included to determine the pooled incidence of AKI. The pooled prevalence of AKI was estimated as 10.08% (95% CI: 4.59, 17.32; I2=98.56%; P<0.001). Furthermore, the pooled incidence of AKI was 12.78% (95% CI: 7.38, 19.36; I2=99.27%; P<0.001). The mean (95% CI) values of serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and sodium were 76.10 (69.36, 82.84), 4.60 (4.04, 5.30), 3.94 (3.78, 4.11), and 139.30 (138.26, 140.36) mmol/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: The AKI is a considerable complication among COVID-19 patients and should be screened for on clinical examinations. The BUN, SCr, potassium, and sodium levels were within the normal ranges.","Nasiri, Naser; Rahmati, Shoboo; Etminan, Abbas; Sharifi, Hamid; Bazrafshan, Azam; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Sharifi, Ali",J Res Health Sci,,474
237432,How to reduce the potential risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during vaginal delivery?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prioritizing patients in need of intensive care is necessary to reduce the mortality rate during the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Although several scoring methods have been introduced, many require laboratory or radiographic findings that may not be easily available in certain situations OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for COVID-19 patients with easily providable characteristics, limited to baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25th, 2020 to June 3rd, 2020 were included Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form Variables that could be easily provided were extracted The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization Patients admitted until March 20th were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21st, 2020 The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against CURB-65 using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) RESULTS: A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9 6%) patients needed intensive care Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance The AUROC of the XGBoost model was 0 897 (95% CI 0 877-0 917) for the derivation group and 0 885 (95% CI 0 855-0 915) for the validation group Both the AUROCs were superior to those of CURB-65, which were 0 836 (95% CI 0 825-0 847) and 0 843 (95% CI 0 829-0 857), respectively CONCLUSIONS: We developed a machine learning model comprising simple patient-provided characteristics, which can efficiently predict the need for intensive care among COVID-19 patients","Kim, H.

239513,"Tokyo Olympics, Hajj pilgrimage, Grand Magal of Touba and COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection, which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation. Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging, and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use Twitter data to explore methods to characterize and classify four COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to provide context for each of these conspiracy theories through the first 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: We began with a corpus of COVID-19 tweets (approximately 120 million) spanning late January to early May 2020. We first filtered tweets using regular expressions (n=1.8 million) and used random forest classification models to identify tweets related to four conspiracy theories. Our classified data sets were then used in downstream sentiment analysis and dynamic topic modeling to characterize the linguistic features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories as they evolve over time. RESULTS: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. CONCLUSIONS: Although we focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become incorporated.","Gerts, Dax; Shelley, Courtney D; Parikh, Nidhi; Pitts, Travis; Watson Ross, Chrysm; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Vaquera Chavez, Nidia Yadria; Daughton, Ashlynn R",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,474

241415,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is driven by zonulin-dependent loss of gut mucosal barrier,2021,"Introduction En mars 2020, le service des Maladies Infectieuses (MI) a pris en charge les patients atteints de pneumopathie hypoxémiante à SARS-CoV-2. En cas de dégradation avec augmentation de l’oxygéno-réquerance, le masque à haute concentration avec un débit maximal de 15l/min était la seule solution en attendant un transfert en réanimation pour les patients le nécessitant. Au mois d’août 2020, le retour d’expérience nous a conduit à l’acquisition d’appareils d’Oxygénothérapie Haut Débit (OHD) pour des services non habitués à leur usage comme les MI. L’OHD pouvait se faire avant un transfert en réanimation ou pour des patients non réanimatoires dans le service. Après 6 mois d’utilisation nous souhaitions avoir un retour d’expérience des IDE sur une pratique peu commune. Matériels et méthodes Le service d’hospitalisation conventionnelle (HC) est composé de 28 lits. L’équipe comporte 10 IDE de jour et 3 de nuit, travaillant en 12h. Un questionnaire a été remis à chaque IDE. Les questions à choix multiples ou ouvertes portaient sur la formation, le nombre de patient pris en charge (PEC), les difficultés rencontrées, la surveillance, leur ressenti et jugement sur le choix de cette pratique. L’objectif était de faire un retour d’expérience sur l’utilisation inhabituelle d’OHD en HC. Résultats Sur 13 IDE interrogés, 12 ont répondu au questionnaire avec une moyenne d’âge de 34,4 ans (24–61) et un sexe ratio 11/1. Dix IDE avaient obtenu leur diplôme après 2010. Une IDE avait déjà travaillé en réanimation et 3 (25 %) en pneumologie. Neuf (75 %) avaient reçu une formation spécifique à la mise en route et la surveillance de l’OHD, réalisées par les réanimateurs (6), pneumologues (4), le prestataire d’OHD (4) et par une collègue IDE (1). Les 3 (25 %) IDE n’ayant pas été formé ont tous PEC des patients sous OHD. Dans 83 % des cas plus de 10 patients ont été PEC par IDE sur la période d’utilisation. Les difficultés rencontrées lors de la mise en route étaient pour 7 (58 %) une mauvaise connaissance du matériel ou des réglages et pour 2 (16,6 %) la mauvaise tolérance du patient. La présence systématique d’un médecin à la mise en route était positive pour 58 % des réponses. Tous les IDE ont jugé que l’OHD a apporté du confort au patient qui n’était pas réanimatoire. Pour 11 IDE (91,6 %) la surveillance imposée par l’OHD était accrue et pour 9 (75 %) jugée insuffisante. Chez les patients stabilisés, pour 11 IDE (91 %) un sentiment d’inquiétude persistait et pour 10 (83 %) un sentiment d’insécurité dans sa pratique professionnelle. Le choix de mise à disposition de l’OHD a été jugé comme bon pour 5, mauvais pour 4 et plus nuancé pour 3 IDE. Conclusion Le choix de l’utilisation de l’OHD a été imposé aux IDE et guidé par l’urgence de la 2e vague. Ce recueil a mis en avant la dynamique et la motivation des IDE à se saisir de cet outil malgré le manque d’expérience. L’OHD a été une charge en soin supplémentaire en terme de réglages et surtout de surveillance du patient. Les sentiments d’insécurité et d’inquiétude des IDE ont été systématiquement rapportés.","Dubois, A.; Badr, C.; Gergaud, J.; Nlend, M.; Bounhiol, A.; Belkacem, A.; Caraux-Paz, P.",Infectious Diseases Now,,474

Our goal was to understand the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of US youth at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We posed 2 open-ended surveys to the national MyVoice text message cohort of youth, aged 14-24 years. On March 6, 2020, 4 questions were asked regarding knowledge and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic with 3 questions repeated on March 20, 2020. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis and summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 1,174 youth, 1,087 responded to at least 1 question (response rate of 88%). The average age of respondents was 19 (SD 2.8) years with 52% female and 56% non-Hispanic White respondents. On March 6, 2020, most (70%) respondents reported knowing about COVID-19 and primarily cited the news (46%) as their source of information. Nearly all (95%) respondents reported impact by March 20, 2020, and respondents expressing worry increased from 25% to 51%. In both surveys, worried youth primarily cited concern for others (26% and 34%). Regarding preparation, respondents primarily reported doing nothing (36%) on March 6, 2020, and practicing social distancing (50%) on March 20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Many youths in our sample are engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic and most are feeling knowledgeable, are concerned about its impacts on others, and are practicing social distancing. Sustained public health efforts should focus on maintaining youth engagement with accurate public information and youth-centered messaging promoting prevention measures to protect the health and well-being of youth and their friends and family.","Waselewski, Eric; Waselewski, Marika; Harper, Chloe; Dickey, Sarah; Bell, Sue Anne; Chang, Tammy",Ann. fam. med,,474

259515,"The National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy in times of COVID-19: Building skills to ""Build Back Better""",2021,"By March 2020, China and Singapore had achieved remarkable results in the prevention and control of COVID-19, but in April Singapore's outbreak began to deteriorate, while China's remained controlled. Using detailed data from Tianjin, China, and Singapore, a stochastic discrete COVID-19 epidemic model was constructed to depict the impact of the epidemic. Parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis were developed to study the probability of imported cases inducing an outbreak in relation to different prevention and control efforts. Results show that the resumption of work and the re-opening of schools will not lead to an outbreak if the effective reproduction number is lower than 1 and approaches 0 and tracking quarantine measures are strengthened. Once an outbreak occurs, if close contacts can be tracked and quarantined in time, the outbreak will be contained. If work is resumed and schools are re-opened with the effective reproduction number greater than 1, then it is more likely that a secondary outbreak will be generated. Also, the greater the number of undetected foreign imported cases and the weaker the prevention and control measures, the more serious the epidemic. Therefore, the key to prevention of a second outbreak is to return to work and to re-open schools only after the effective reproduction number is less than 1 for a period, and when tracking quarantine measures have been strengthened. Our model provides a qualitative and quantitative basis for decision-making for the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemics and the prediction, early warning and risk assessment of secondary outbreaks.","Yang, Jie; Tang, Sanyi; Cheke, Robert A",Nonlinear Dyn,,474

We included patients consecutively admitted at Humanitas Research Hospital (Rozzano, Milan, Italy); retrospectively extracted demographic; clinical; laboratory and imaging findings at admission; used survival methods to identify factors associated with clinical deterioration (defined as intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or death), and developed a prognostic index. Overall; we analyzed 239 patients (29.3% females) with a mean age of 63.9 (standard deviation [SD]; 14.0) years. Clinical deterioration occurred in 70 patients (29.3%), including 41 (17.2%) ICU transfers and 36 (15.1%) deaths. The most common symptoms and signs at admission were cough (77.8%) and elevated respiratory rate (34.1%), while 66.5% of patients had at least one coexisting medical condition. Imaging frequently revealed ground-glass opacity (68.9%) and consolidation (23.8%). Age; increased respiratory rate; abnormal blood gas parameters and imaging findings; coexisting coronary heart disease; leukocytosis; lymphocytopenia; and several laboratory parameters (elevated procalcitonin; interleukin-6; serum ferritin; C-reactive protein; aspartate aminotransferase; lactate dehydrogenase; creatinine; fibrinogen; troponin-I; and D-dimer) were significant predictors of clinical deterioration. We suggested a prognostic index to assist risk-stratification (C-statistic; 0.845; 95% CI; 0.802â0.887). These results could aid early identification and management of patients at risk, who should therefore receive additional monitoring and aggressive supportive care.","Cecconi, Maurizio; Piovani, Daniele; Brunetta, Enrico; Aghemo, Alessio; Greco, Massimiliano; Ciccarelli, Michele; Angelini, Claudio; Voza, Antonio; Omodei, Paolo; Vespa, Edoardo; Pugliese, Nicola; Parigi, Tommaso Lorenzo; Folci, Marco; Danese, Silvio; Bonovas, Stefanos",,,474

Hospitalized patients confirmed to be infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included and classified according to in-hospital mortality (survivors/nonsurvivors) and the maximal oxygen support/ventilation supply required (nonsevere/severe). Demographics, clinical and laboratory data, and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, 160 patients were retrospectively included in the study. T-lymphocyte subset (total CD3+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD8+, CD3+ CD4+ CD8+ double positive [DP] and CD3+ CD4- CD8- double negative [DN]) absolute counts were decreased in nonsurvivors and in patients with severe disease compared to survivors and nonsevere patients (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that absolute counts of CD3+ T-lymphocytes < 524 cells/µl, CD3+ CD4+ < 369 cells/µl, and the number of T-lymphocyte subsets below the cutoff (T-lymphocyte subset index [TLSI]) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Baseline T-lymphocyte subset counts and TLSI were also predictive of disease severity (CD3+ < 733 cells/µl; CD3+ CD4+ < 426 cells/µl; CD3+ CD8+ < 262 cells/µl; CD3+ DP < 4.5 cells/µl; CD3+ DN < 18.5 cells/µl).

275050,COVID-19 pandemic in the Brazil's prison system,2021,"A probabilistic method is proposed in this study to predict the spreading profile of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United State (US) via time-variant reliability analysis. To this end, an extended susceptible-exposed-infected-vaccinated-recovered (SEIVR) epidemic model is first established deterministically, considering the quarantine and vaccination effects, and then applied to the available COVID-19 data from US. Afterwards, the prediction results are described as a time-series of the number of people infected, recovered, and dead. Upon introducing the extended SEIVR model into a limit-state function and defining the model parameters including transmission, recovery, and mortality rates as random variables, the problem is transformed into a reliability model and analyzed by the Monte Carlo sampling. The findings are subsequently given in the form of exceedance probabilities (EPs) of the three main outputs, namely, the maximum number of infected cases, the total number of recovered cases, and the total number of fatal cases. Afterwards, by incorporating time into the formulation of the reliability problem, the EPs are calculated over time and presented as 3D probability graphs, illustrating the relationship between the number of cases affected (i.e., infected, recovered, or dead), exceedance probability, and time. The results for the US demonstrate that, by the end of 2021, the number of the infected (active) cases decreases to 0.8 million and number of cases recovered and fatalities increases to 41.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively.","Shadabfar, Mahdi; Mahsuli, Mojtaba; Khoojine, Arash Sioofy; Hosseini, Vahid Reza",Results Phys,,474

Most studies target a specific viral component of the RTC such as the main protease or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In contrast, our strategy is to target &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; conserved domains of the RTC to prevent SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and to create a high barrier to viral resistance and/or evasion of antiviral drugs. We show that clinically-safe Zn-ejector drugs, disulfiram/ebselen, can target conserved Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sites in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 and nsp14 and inhibit nsp13 ATPase and nsp14 exoribonuclease activities. As the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 domain targeted by disulfiram/ebselen is involved in RNA fidelity control, our strategy allows coupling of the Zn-ejector drug with a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog that would otherwise be excised by the nsp14 proofreading domain. As proof-of-concept, we show that disulfiram/ebselen, when combined with remdesivir, can synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. We present a mechanism of action and the advantages of our multi-targeting strategy, which can be applied to any type of coronavirus with conserved Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sites. &lt;/p&gt;","Ting, Chen Cheng-Yin Fei Yi-Ping Chen Karen Sargsyan Chun Ping Chang Hanna S.; Yuan, Carmay Lim",,,474

We interviewed ED leaders who implemented telehealth programs to inform responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future emergencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September-November 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with ED leaders across the United States. We identified EDs with pandemic-related telehealth programs through literature review and snowball sampling. Maximum variation sampling was used to capture a range of experiences. We used standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: We completed 15 interviews with EDs leaders in 10 states. From March-November 2020, participants experimented with more than a dozen different types of telehealth applications including tele-isolation, tele-triage, tele-consultation, virtual post-discharge assessment, acute care in the home, and tele-palliative care. Prior experience with telehealth was key for implementation of new applications. Most new telehealth applications turned out to be temporary because they were no longer needed to support the response. The leading barriers to telehealth implementation during the pandemic included technology challenges and the need for ""hands-on"" implementation support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, EDs rapidly implemented many telehealth innovations. Their experiences can inform future responses.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Mehrotra, Ateev; Schwamm, Lee H; Zachrison, Kori S",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,474
287380,Incidence of the COVID-19 in Iraq - Implications for travellers,2020,"This study focuses on how socio-demographic status and personal attributes influence self-protective behaviours during a pandemic, with protection behaviours being assessed through three perspectives - social distancing, personal protection behaviour and social responsibility awareness. The research considers a publicly available and recently collected dataset on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and utilises a data analysis framework combining Classification and Regression Tree (CART), a data mining approach, and regression analysis to gain deep insights. The analysis reveals Socio-demographic attributes - sex, marital family status and having children - as having played an influential role in Japanese citizens' abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours. Especially women with children are noted as more conscious than their male counterparts. Work status also appears to have some impact concerning social distancing. Trust in government also appears as a significant factor. The analysis further identifies smoking behaviour as a factor characterising subjective prevention actions with non-smokers or less-frequent smokers being more compliant to the protection behaviours. Overall, the findings imply the need of public policy campaigning to account for variations in protection behaviour due to socio-demographic and personal attributes during pandemics and national emergencies.","Uddin, Shahadat; Imam, Tasadduq; Khushi, Matloob; Khan, Arif; Ali, Mohammad",Pers Individ Dif,,474
287977,Immune Alterations in a Patient with SARS-CoV-2-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020,"The burden of Alzheimer disease (AD) on the US healthcare system is substantial and increasing. AD progresses along a continuum from preclinical disease characterized by normal cognition and abnormal brain biomarkers to mild cognitive impairment and then clinically apparent dementia. Diagnosis early in the AD continuum has benefits for patients and caregivers and appears cost-effective, but often, the clinical diagnosis of AD may be delayed. Currently available biomarkers include ß-amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid tests. Collectively, they are expensive, may lead to adverse effects, are not widely available, and are not suited for primary care. Currently available treatment options, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, do not alter disease progression, but can help with some symptoms. Benefits of currently available treatments on cognition are difficult to quantify and are offset by a burden of adverse effects that often go unrecognized. More accurate diagnostic biomarkers and disease-modifying drug therapies are critical unmet needs of patients with AD despite decades of clinical research. Because many phase 3 clinical trials that enrolled patients with symptomatic AD have failed, researchers believe that disease-modifying treatment is more likely to demonstrate benefit when utilized early in the disease continuum. Within the past few years, significant achievements that will advance clinical trials in early AD include the Research Framework to define and stage the AD continuum, FDA guidance on study design in early AD, and development of scales to measure cognition that are suitable for early AD. In October 2019, the AD community was re-invigorated by unexpected news that a Biologics License Application will be submitted for aducanumab to treat AD. This article explores the current state of biomarker-driven drug development across the AD continuum and reviews investigational drugs in phase 2/3 clinical development for AD.","Marasco, Richard A",Am J Manag Care,,474
290366,A Comparison Between Chinese Children Infected with Coronavirus Disease-2019 and with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2003,2020,"The development of an obstructive luminal thrombus is pathological and considered a failure of endogenous fibrinolysis. The consequences may be fatal, or result in lasting downstream organ damage. Therefore, assessment of endogenous fibrinolytic status in an individual may identify those at risk of occlusive thrombus formation and provide prognostic information. Arterial thrombi are more platelet-rich and more resistant to fibrinolysis than venous thrombi. Several recent studies using global tests of fibrinolysis in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have shown that despite dual antiplatelet therapy, patients with impaired fibrinolytic status have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, compared to those with effective fibrinolytic function. Such data add significantly to the predictive value of established cardiovascular risk factors and conventional biomarkers. Most data reported have been obtained with the Global Thrombosis Test and the turbidimetric plasma clot lysis assay. A few small studies in patients with ischaemic stroke suggest a similar predictive role of fibrinolytic status assessment in these patients. Studies reporting an association between impaired fibrinolysis and future venous thrombotic events are limited, and in the form of case-control studies. Viscoelastic assays may have a role in the prediction of venous thromboembolic risk. Assays of fibrinolytic function should be used to obtain a more accurate risk of future thrombotic events, particularly in the setting of ACS. The availability of point-of-care tests helps facilitate this and should encourage future studies to assess personalised antithrombotic treatment combinations to optimise fibrinolytic status and reduce thrombosis risk.","Kanji, Rahim; Kubica, Jacek; Navarese, Eliano P; Gorog, Diana A",Eur J Clin Invest,,474
291009,COVID-19 among Turkish citizens returning from abroad,2020,"BACKGROUND: Airport quarantine is required to reduce the risk of entry of travelers infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, it is challenging for both high accuracy and rapid turn-around time to coexist in testing; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is time-consuming with high accuracy, while antigen testing is rapid with less accuracy. However, there are few data on the concordance between PCR and antigen testing. METHODS: Arrivals at three international airports in Japan between July 29 and September 30, 2020 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using self-collected saliva by a screening strategy with initial chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) followed by confirmatory nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) only for intermediate range antigen concentrations. RESULTS: Among the 95,457 persons entering Japan during the period, 88,924 (93.2%) were tested by CLEIA, and 0.29% (254/88,924) were found to be SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive (&#8805;4.0 pg/mL). NAAT was required for confirmatory testing in 0.58% (513/88,924) with intermediate antigen concentrations (0.67-4.0 pg/mL) whereby the virus was detected in 6.6% (34/513). This two-step strategy reduced the utilization of NAAT to one out of every 173 test subjects. The estimated performance of this strategy did not show significant increase in false negatives as compared to performing NAAT in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Point of care testing by quantitative CLEIA using self-collected saliva is less labor-intensive and yields results rapidly, thus suitable as an initial screening test. Reserving NAAT for CLEIA indeterminate cases may prevent compromising accuracy while significantly improving the logistics of administering mass-screening at large venues.","Yokota, Isao; Shane, Peter Y; Teshima, Takanori",Travel Med Infect Dis,,474

Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation form. METHODS: We searched PubMed® and Google® (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) investigations. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analysed using random effects models. RESULTS: In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59 ± 17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14 ± 26.70 years) (p value = 0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2% of the cases and ground glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09% by meta-analysis). Most studies reported normal laboratory findings (61.74% by meta-analysis). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of patients without any symptoms present with CT abnormalities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical information and chest CT images of 93 patients infected with 2019-nCov from multiple centres were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 93 cases, abnormalities in 91 cases were located at the subpleural level, presenting with ground-glass opacity (GGO; n=69, 74.2%) and consolidation (n=56, 60.2%) in multiple lobes. Other CT features included vascular dilatation (n=83, 89.2%), interlobular septal thickening (n=29, 31.2%), bronchodilatation (n=44, 47.3%), the crazy-paving sign (n=34, 36.6%), the sieve-hole sign (n=12, 12.9%), pleural thickening (n=21, 22.6%), and pleural effusion (n=8, 8.6%). Multiple lobe involvement, including the presence of consolidation, the crazy-paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural thickening and pleural effusion, was more common in critical patients with heavy/critical infection (p<0.05), whereas the presence of GGO, involvement of one or two lobes, and the halo sign were more common in patients with mild/common-type infections (p<0.05). Moreover, older age, higher body temperature, complaints of chest tightness and breathlessness, and lymphopenia was associated with heavy/critical infections.

METHODS: We mined coronavirus-related tweets from January 23rd to March 25th, 2020. We classified tweets by the socioeconomic status of the county from which they originated with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). We applied topic modeling to identify and monitor topics of concern over time. We investigated how topics varied by ADI and between hotspots and non-hotspots. RESULTS: We identified 45 topics in 269,556 unique tweets. Topics shifted from early-outbreak-related content in January, to the presidential election and governmental response in February, to lifestyle impacts in March. High-resourced areas (low ADI) were concerned with stocks and social distancing, while under-resourced areas shared negative expression and discussion of the CARES Act relief package. These differences were consistent within hotspots, with increased discussion regarding employment in high ADI hotspots. DISCUSSION: Topic modeling captures major concerns on Twitter in the early months of COVID-19. Our study extends previous Twitter-based research as it assesses how topics differ based on a marker of socioeconomic status. Comparisons between low and high-resourced areas indicate more focus on personal economic hardship in less-resourced communities and less focus on general public health messaging. CONCLUSION: Real-time social media analysis of community-based pandemic responses can uncover differential conversations correlating to local impact and income, education, and housing disparities. In future public health crises, such insights can inform messaging campaigns, which should partly focus on the interests of those most disproportionately impacted.","Su, Yihua; Venkat, Aarthi; Yadav, Yadush; Puglisi, Lisa B; Fodeh, Samah J",Comput Biol Med,,474

It is the type of RNA virus that might infect animal and human species. In the severe stage, it causes pneumonia in human beings. In this research, hand-crafted and deep microscopic features are used to classify lung infection. The proposed work consists of two phases; in phase I, infected lung region is segmented using proposed U-Net deep learning model. The hand-crafted features are extracted such as histogram orientation gradient (HOG), noise to the harmonic ratio (NHr), and segmentation based fractal texture analysis (SFTA) from the segmented image, and optimum features are selected from each feature vector using entropy. In phase II, local binary patterns (LBPs), speeded up robust feature (Surf), and deep learning features are extracted using a pretrained network such as inceptionv3, ResNet101 from the input CT images, and select optimum features based on entropy. Finally, the optimum selected features using entropy are fused in two ways, (i) The hand-crafted features (HOG, NHr, SFTA, LBP, SURF) are horizontally concatenated/fused (ii) The hand-crafted features (HOG, NHr, SFTA, LBP, SURF) are combined/fused with deep features. The fused optimum features vector is passed to the ensemble models (Boosted tree, bagged tree, and RUSBoosted tree) in two ways for the COVID19 classification, (i) classification using fused hand-crafted features (ii) classification using fusion of hand-crafted features and deep features.

METHODS: Between weeks 14 and 18 in 2020, a protected code stroke protocol including infection control screening and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was prospectively implemented for all code stroke patients upon arrival to the emergency department. If infection control screen was positive, patients received protective hygienic measures and laboratory test results were available within four hours from testing. In patients with negative screen, laboratory results were available no later than the next working day. Door-to-imaging times of patients treated with thrombolysis or thrombectomy were compared with those of patients treated during the preceding weeks 1 to 13 in 2020. RESULTS: During the 4-weeks study period, 116 consecutive code stroke patients underwent infection control screen and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2. Among 5 (4.3%) patients whose infection control screen was positive, no patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All patients with negative infection control screens had negative test results. Door-to-imaging times of patients treated with thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy were not different to those treated during the preceding weeks (12 [9-15] min versus 13 [11-17] min, pâ¯=â¯0.24).

297689,Chapter 7 - Better understanding and control of new coronavirus infection,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic all schools in Poland were closed and obliged to conduct lessons remotely. The aim of the study is to present the demographic analysis of difficulties with remote learning, as perceived by students during coronavirus pandemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In April 2020, a nationwide online survey was conducted among adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408). Quantitative and qualitative data were used. Teenagers were asked about the problems connected with remote learning. In order to examine the overall level of remote learning difficulties, a scale of remote learning difficulties (RLD) was devised (range 0-23 points). Differences connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS: More than a half of the teenagers surveyed rated the increased demands from teachers as a major problem. This answer appeared statistically more often among girls than boys (59.6% v. 53.2%). Almost every third adolescent saw the lack of consultation (31.6%) as a significant problem. Difficulties related to learning in the remote system were most often described as considerable by the oldest students (17-18-years-old) and those living in rural areas. The big problem for them was usually much higher requirements of teachers and poor organization of distance learning. The mean level on the scale of remote learning burden was M=11.9 (SD=7.1). Technical difficulties and insufficient skills in using software constituted additional problems most frequently mentioned by students. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to pay particular attention to organizing appropriate technical conditions for remote learning, especially in rural areas, where students have complained more often than in cities about equipment and problems with access to the Internet during the pandemic.","Korzycka, Magdalena; Bójko, Martyna; Radiukiewicz, Katarzyna; Dzielska, Anna; Nalecz, Hanna; Kleszczewska, Dorota; Malkowska-Szkutnik, Agnieszka; Fijalkowska, Anna",Ann Agric Environ Med,,474
299056,COVID-19's final frontier: The central Africa region,2020,"Teleconsultation has assumed a central role in the management of chronic and disabling rheumatic diseases, such as the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), during COVID-19. However, the feasibility, challenges encountered, and outcomes remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe our teleconsultation experience in a prospectively followed cohort of adult and juvenile IIM. 250 IIM enrolled into the MyoCite cohort (2017-ongoing) were offered the option of audio/visual teleconsultation using WhatsApp during the nationwide lockdown. Clinical outcomes (major/minor relapse) and prescription changes were compared between IIM subsets. Socio-demographic and clinico-serological characteristics of those who sought teleconsultation were compared with those who did not. 151 teleconsultations were sought over a 93 day period by 71 (52.2%) of 136 IIM (median age 38 years, F:M 4.5:1). Nearly one-third (38%) consulted on an emergency basis, with voice consultations being the primary medium of communication. Over a quarter (26.8%) reported relapse (15.5% minor, 11.3% major), these being more common in JDM [71.4%, OR 8.9 (1.5-51)] as compared with adult IIM, but similar across various antibody-based IIM subtypes. Patients who relapsed required more consultations [2(2-3) vs 1(1-2), p 0.009]. The demographic and socioeconomic profile of the patients seeking consultation (n = 71) was not different from those who did not (n = 65). Voice-based teleconsultations may be useful to diagnose and manage relapses in IIM during the pandemic. Patient education for meticulous and timely reporting may be improve care, and larger multicentre studies may identify subsets of IIM that require greater care and early tele-triage for effective management of the condition.","Naveen, R; Sundaram, T G; Agarwal, Vikas; Gupta, Latika",Rheumatol.Int,,474
299873,The first pregnant woman with COVID-19 in Venezuela: Pre-symptomatic transmission,2020,"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play an essential role in regulating the GC reaction and, consequently, the generation of high-affinity antibodies and memory B cells. Therefore, Tfh cells are critical for potent humoral immune responses against various pathogens and their dysregulation has been linked to autoimmunity and cancer. Tfh cell differentiation is a multistep process, in which cognate interactions with different APC types, costimulatory and coinhibitory pathways, as well as cytokines are involved. However, it is still not fully understood how a subset of activated CD4+ T cells begins to express the Tfh cell-defining chemokine receptor CXCR5 during the early stage of the immune response, how some CXCR5+ pre-Tfh cells enter the B-cell follicles and mature further into GC Tfh cells, and how Tfh cells are maintained in the memory compartment. In this review, we discuss recent advances on how antigen and cognate interactions are important for Tfh cell differentiation and long-term persistence of Tfh cell memory, and how this is relevant to the current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the development of potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Baumjohann, Dirk; Fazilleau, Nicolas",Eur J Immunol,,474

309635,COVID-19 and the impact on malaria,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 disease. There are concerns regarding limited testing capacity and the exclusion of cases from unproven screening criteria. Knowing COVID-19 risks can inform testing. This study derived and assessed a model to predict risk of SARS-CoV-2 in community-based people. METHODS: All people presenting to a community-based COVID-19 screening center answered questions regarding symptoms, possible exposure, travel, and occupation. These data were anonymously linked to SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Logistic regression was used to derive a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bootstrap sampling evaluated the model. RESULTS: A total of 9172 consecutive people were studied. Overall infection rate was 6.2% but this varied during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 infection likelihood was primarily influenced by contact with a COVID-19 case, fever symptoms, and recent case detection rates. Internal validation found that the SARS-CoV-2 Risk Prediction Score (SCRiPS) performed well with good discrimination (c-statistic 0.736, 95%CI 0.715-0.757) and very good calibration (integrated calibration index 0.0083, 95%CI 0.0048-0.0131). Focusing testing on people whose expected SARS-CoV-2 risk equaled or exceeded the recent case detection rate would increase the number of identified SARS-CoV-2 cases by 63.1% (95%CI 54.5-72.3). CONCLUSION: The SCRiPS model accurately estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based people undergoing testing. Using SCRiPS can importantly increase SARS-CoV-2 infection identification when testing capacity is limited.","van Walraven, Carl; Manuel, Douglas G; Desjardins, Marc; Forster, Alan J",J. gen. intern. med,,474
310731,COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients with Reported Allergic Reactions: Updated Evidence and Suggested Approach,2021,"A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.","Giovanetti, Marta; Benvenuto, Domenico; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo",J Med Virol,,474
313399,SARS-CoV-2-Related Kidney Injury: Current Concern and Challenges,2020,"BACKGROUND: As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerates, the supply of personal protective equipment remains under strain. To combat shortages, re-use of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended. Prior decontamination is paramount to the re-use of these typically single-use only items and, without compromising their integrity, must guarantee inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other contaminating pathogens. AIM: We provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination (infectivity loss over time during room temperature storage in a breathable bag) and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination. METHODS: Masks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus, were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles; viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID50 assay. In parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard 14683 and NIOSH regulations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three, decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude. This multi-disciplinal approach provides important information on how often a given PPE item may be safely reused.","Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F; Wielick, Constance; Jolois, Olivier; Dams, Lorène; Razafimahefa, Ravo M; Nauwynck, Hans; Demeuldre, Pierre-Francois; Napp, Aurore; Laperre, Jan; Thiry, Etienne; Haubruge, Eric",PLoS One,,474

There is still a lack of understanding of its origin, transmission, and treatment methods. Understanding the influencing factors of COVID-19 can help mitigate its spread, but little research on the spatial factors has been conducted. Therefore, this study explores the effects of urban geometry and socio-demographic factors on the COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. For each patient, the places they visited during the incubation period before going to hospital were identified, and matched with corresponding attributes of urban geometry (i.e., building geometry, road network and greenspace) and socio-demographic factors (i.e., demographic, educational, economic, household and housing characteristics) based on the coordinates. The local cases were then compared with the imported cases using stepwise logistic regression, logistic regression with case-control of time, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to identify factors influencing local disease transmission. Results show that the building geometry, road network and certain socio-economic characteristics are significantly associated with COVID-19 cases. In addition, the results indicate that urban geometry is playing a more important role than socio-demographic characteristics in affecting COVID-19 incidence. These findings provide a useful reference to the government and the general public as to the spatial vulnerability of COVID-19 transmission and to take appropriate preventive measures in high-risk areas.","Kwok, Coco Yin Tung; Wong, Man Sing; Chan, Ka Long; Kwan, Mei-Po; Nichol, Janet Elizabeth; Liu, Chun Ho; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha; Wai, Abraham Ka Chung; Chan, Lawrence Wing Chi; Xu, Yang; Li, Hon; Huang, Jianwei; Kan, Zihan",Sci Total Environ,,474

324570,Veranstaltungstipps,2020,"BACKGROUND: The reasons why some patients with COVID-19 develop pneumonia and others do not are unclear. To better understand this, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to profile circulating leukocytes from non-immunocompromised adult patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 and specifically compared those with mild symptoms with those who had developed pneumonia. METHODS: Using clinically validated antibody panels we studied leukocytes from 29 patients with PCR-proven COVID-19. Ten were hypoxic requiring ventilatory support, eleven were febrile but otherwise well, and eight were convalescing having previously required ventilatory support. Additionally, we analysed patients who did not have COVID-19 but received ventilatory support for other reasons. We examined routine Full Blood Count (FBC) specimens that were surplus to routine diagnostic requirements; normal ranges were established in a historic group of healthy volunteers. FINDINGS: We observed striking and unexpected differences in cells of the innate immune system. Levels of CD11b and CD18, which together comprise Complement Receptor 3 (CR3), were increased in granulocytes and monocytes from hypoxic COVID-19 patients, but not in those with COVID-19 who remained well, or in those without COVID-19 but ventilated for other reasons. Granulocyte and monocyte numbers were unchanged, however Natural Killer (NK) cell numbers were two-fold higher than normal in COVID-19 patients who remained well. INTERPRETATION: CR3 is central to leukocyte activation and subsequent cytokine release in response to infection. It is also a fibrinogen receptor, and its over-expression in granulocytes and monocytes of patients with respiratory failure tables it as a candidate effector of both the thrombotic and inflammatory features of COVID-19 pneumonia, and both a biomarker of impending respiratory failure and potential therapeutic target. NK cells are innate immune cells that retain immunological memory. Rapid expansion of memory NK cells targeting common antigens shared with other Coronaviruses may explain why most patients with COVID-19 do not develop respiratory complications. Understanding the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-may uncover why most infected individuals experience mild symptoms, and inform a preventive approach to COVID-19 pneumonia in the future.","Gupta, Rajeev; Gant, Vanya Alasdair; Williams, Bryan; Enver, Tariq",Int J Infect Dis,,474
325205,"More Data on Risks and Outcomes of COVID-19 in Asthma, COPD, and Bronchiectasis",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Early studies suggest that acute cerebrovascular events may be common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may be associated with a high mortality rate. Most cerebrovascular events described have been ischemic strokes, but both intracerebral hemorrhage and rarely cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) have also been reported. The diagnosis of CVST can be elusive, with wide-ranging and nonspecific presenting symptoms that can include headache or altered sensorium alone. OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation, barriers to diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of CVST in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We abstracted data on all patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 from March 1 to August 9, 2020 at Boston Medical Center. Subsequently, we reviewed the literature and extracted all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 through August 9, 2020 and included all studies with case descriptions. RESULTS: We describe the clinical features and management of CVST in 3 women with COVID-19 who developed CVST days to months after initial COVID-19 symptoms. Two patients presented with encephalopathy and without focal neurologic deficits, while one presented with visual symptoms. All patients were treated with intravenous hydration and anticoagulation. None suffered hemorrhagic complications, and all were discharged home. We identified 12 other patients with CVST in the setting of COVID-19 via literature search. There was a female predominance (54.5%), most patients presented with altered sensorium (54.5%), and there was a high mortality rate (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS: During this pandemic, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for CVST in patients with a recent history of COVID-19 presenting with non-specific neurological symptoms such as headache to provide expedient management and prevent complications. The limited data suggests that CVST in COVID-19 is more prevalent in females and may be associated with high mortality.","Nwajei, Felix; Anand, Pria; Abdalkader, Mohamad; Andreu Arasa, Vanesa C; Aparicio, Hugo J; Behbahani, Siavash; Curiale, Gioacchino; Daneshmand, Ali; Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar; Mayo, Thomas; Mian, Asim; Nguyen, Thanh; Ong, Charlene; Romero, J Rafael; Sakai, Osamu; Takahashi, Courtney; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,474

The success of delivering mass vaccination, on the scale of what would be applied to contain COVID-19, largely depends on the compliance of the public to programs mandated by public health officials. This study was aimed to evaluate the perception and possible hesitance of people in Jordan toward a tentative COVID-19 vaccine using self-administrated online survey. During the study period, a total of 1287 agreed to participate in the study. More than half of the participants (n = 734, 57%) were females and the majority (n = 893, 69%) had a University degree. Most of the participants (n = 871, 68%) believed that scientists have adequate tools to develop a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine and two-third of them (n = 861, 67%) believed that developing vaccines would end the pandemic. However, around half of them (n = 665, 52%) reported not having adequate information on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Preference of study participants to achieve immunity against COVID-19 using natural way was the most commonly reported reason to refuse vaccination (n = 826, 64%), followed by their concern about adverse effects associated with the vaccine (n = 781, 61%). In conclusion, the sampled participants showed an overall positive attitude toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Educational campaigns using television and social media are recommended to better inform the public of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccine in reaching a ""herd immunity"" based strategy to control the current pandemic.","Abu Farha, Rana K; Alzoubi, Karem H; Khabour, Omar F; Alfaqih, Mahmoud A",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,474

Case Report,2020,"The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic had a significantly different impact on mortality rates in Spanish and Portuguese provinces and cities. In this study, several small villages have been identified which were not affected at all by the Spanish influenza pandemic. These all shared a number of features in common: their villages were very small, comprising only a few hundred inhabitants; they were located in mountainous regions, with very poor transport infrastructure; and they were self-sufficient and capable of fulfilling their basic alimentary needs. Their inhabitants were conscious of the problem and acted together, effectively isolating themselves from surrounding villages. Since these villagers managed to avoid direct contact with ill people from other municipalities, the flu was not transmitted and the pandemic did not arise in their villages. In this paper, it is proposed that the human habitability spaces that meet these characteristics, I call them ""Safe Villages"" or ""Shelter Village"".

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a modified PEI method combined with MWA for the treatment of symptomatic, predominantly cystic and benign thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 201 patients who underwent treatment in our department between April 2015 and August 2018. Predominantly cystic thyroid nodules were treated by the modified PEI procedure, which included short-term boiling ethanol ablation (STBEA) and was combined with MWA. Complications, the volume reduction ratio (VRR), symptoms and cosmetic scores were recorded at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment and every 6 months thereafter. RESULTS: No major complications were observed during or after the treatment. Ten patients (4.8%) experienced temporary voice change, which resolved within 3 months. Of 200 (97.6%) out of 205 nodules showed significant volume reduction at the final follow-up. Recurrence occurred for only 5 (2.4%) nodules. The mean thyroid nodule volume decreased from 17.40 ± 3.21 mL at baseline to 1.17 ± 0.37 mL at 12 months. The greatest VRR was observed within the first 3 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The modified PEI method combined with MWA is safe and effective for the treatment of predominantly cystic benign thyroid nodules and provides a shorter operating time and lower recurrence rate than traditional treatments.","Su, Chen; Liu, Yu-Jiang; Qian, Lin-Xue",Int J Hyperthermia,,474
347963,Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic: Useful lessons from Vietnam,2020,"To complement RT-qPCR testing for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, many countries have introduced the use of rapid antigen tests. As they generally display lower real-life performances than expected, their correct positioning as frontline screening is still controversial. Despite the lack of data from daily clinical use, third generation microfluidic assays (such as the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag test) have recently been suggested to have similar performances to RT-qPCR and have been proposed as alternative diagnostic tools. By analyzing 960 nasopharyngeal swabs from 960 subjects at the emergency department admissions of a tertiary COVID-19 hospital, LumiraDx assay demonstrated a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 96-98), and a sensitivity of 85% (95% CI: 82-89) in comparison with RT-qPCR, which increases to 91% (95% CI: 86-95) for samples with a cycle threshold &#8804; 29. Fifty false-negative LumiraDx-results were confirmed by direct quantification of genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA through droplet-digital PCR (median (IQR) load = 5880 (1657-41,440) copies/mL). Subgenomic N and E RNAs were detected in 52% (n = 26) and 56% (n = 28) of them, respectively, supporting the presence of active viral replication. Overall, the LumiraDx test complies with the minimum performance requirements of the WHO. Yet, the risk of a misrecognition of patients with active COVID-19 persists, and the need for confirmatory RT-qPCR should not be amended.","Cento, Valeria; Renica, Silvia; Matarazzo, Elisa; Antonello, Maria; Colagrossi, Luna; Di Ruscio, Federica; Pani, Arianna; Fanti, Diana; Vismara, Chiara; Puoti, Massimo; Scaglione, Francesco; Perno, Carlo Federico; Alteri, Claudia",Viruses,,474

355348,MUW researcher of the month,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced dramatic changes to the healthcare systems throughout the world. Time-sensitive management of cardiovascular emergencies such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has yet to be evaluated in the context of these new policies, particularly in so-called ""hot spot"" cities. METHODS: We evaluated the early impact of the pandemic on STEMI performance in the Greater Montreal Area. A total of 167 patients from 3 different study periods were included. Patients presenting in the lockdown period from mid-March to mid-May 2020 (Group C, 53 patients) were compared to those from mid-March to mid-May 2019 (Group A, 60 patients) and the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (Group B, 54 patients). RESULTS: The number of STEMI admissions was unaffected during the lockdown. However, significantly longer delays between symptom onset and first medical contact (FMC) were noted (Group C 189.0 IQR [70.0, 840.0] min vs. Group A 103.0 IQR [42.5, 263.0] min vs. Group B 91.0 IQR [38.0, 235.5 min], P = 0.007). In contrast, additional safety protocols do not appear to have significantly affected delays between FMC and first intracoronary device activation (Group C 102 IQR [73.0, 133.0] min vs. Group A 104 IQR [87.0, 146.0] min vs. Group B 99.5 IQR [80.0, 150.0] min, P = 0.37). Patients that presented during the outbreak were more likely to be unstable with a higher incidence of Killip classes II-IV compared to groups A and B (28.3% vs. 18.3% vs. 5.6% respectively, P = 0.008). Worse in-hospital outcomes were also noted with a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (Group A 5.0% vs. Group B 11.1% vs. Group C 22.6%, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, many patients appear to have been reluctant to present to hospitals. This was associated with more unstable STEMI presentations and worse in-hospital course. Importantly, the health care system appears able to ensure timely acute cardiac care while ensuring that COVID-19 protocols are respected.","Haddad, Kevin; Potter, Brian J; Matteau, Alexis; Gobeil, François; Mansour, Samer",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,474

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presents with upper respiratory symptoms like cough, fever, and lethargy. At the same time, in later stages, critical COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and multiple organ failure from cytokine storm and coagulation hyperactivity. Primary manifestations of thrombotic events include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Initial coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients presents with elevated fibrin degradation products, especially D-dimers. In contrast, late presentations show evidence of prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT), increased platelets, and fibrinogen levels. Diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression are done by regular screening of laboratory parameters, including D-dimer and fibrinogen. Management of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients is like that of critically ill patients, including thromboprophylaxis. Coagulopathy is a poor prognostic factor, and optimum strategies should be developed for early diagnosis, prevention, and prompt treatment of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has shown beneficial results in preventing coagulopathy a reducing risk of mortality due to thrombotic events. We will discuss VTE in COVID-19 patients highlighting the role of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and interleukin-6 (IL-6).","Eljilany, Islam; Elzouki, Abdel-Naser",Vasc Health Risk Manag,,474

379551,Correspondence to 'Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 mimicking Kawasaki disease (Kawa-COVID-19): a multicentre cohort',2020,"OBJECTIVE: Various studies investigated implicit sequence learning in Parkinson's disease (PD) by means of the traditional motor Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task and found a general pattern of impaired sequence learning. However, as perceptual and motor sequences of the SRT-task were correlated in previous studies, implicit sequential knowledge acquisition that is tested independently from motor sequences remains to be determined in PD. In this study, we investigated implicit sequence learning independently from motor sequence learning in individuals with PD. To this end, we used a perceptual SRT-task that did not rely upon sequential motor knowledge. METHOD: We measured response times (RTs) of 19 participants with PD (Hoehn & Yahr II or III; mean age 65) and 18 age-matched healthy controls (HC; mean age 61.5) in a perceptual SRT-task. General learning effects and sequence-specific learning effects were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: A significant decreasing linear trend (p < .001) in RTs was revealed in both the PD and HC groups as the SRT-task progressed, indicating general learning effects. Notably, a significant, strong main effect of sequence-specific learning occurred (p < .001), irrespective of group (p = .436). Sequence-specific learning did not differ significantly between the PD (M = 156.5 ms; SD = 50.7) and HC group (M = 173.0 ms; SD = 104.2). Bayesian analyses confirmed this as evidence of absence of an effect (B10 = 3.543). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, at least in Hoehn & Yahr stages II and III, implicit sequential knowledge acquisition may be preserved in individuals with PD, when tested independently from motor sequence learning.

Analyzed turbine operates in nuclear power plant while three of four operating regimes are obtained by using optimization algorithms - SA (Simplex Algorithm), GA (Genetic Algorithm) and IGSA (Improved Genetic-Simplex Algorithm). IGSA operating regime gives the highest developed mechanical power of the whole turbine equal to 1022.48 MW, followed by GA (1020.06 MW) and SA (1017.16 MW), while in Original operating regime whole turbine develop mechanical power equal to 996.29 MW. In addition, IGSA causes the highest increase in developed mechanical power of almost all cylinders and cylinder parts in comparison to the Original operating regime. All observed optimization algorithms increases the exergy destruction of the whole turbine in comparison to Original operating regime - the lowest increase causes IGSA, followed by GA and finally SA. The highest exergy efficiency of the whole turbine, equal to 85.92% is obtained by IGSA, followed by GA (85.89%) and SA (85.82%), while the lowest exergy efficiency is obtained in Original operating regime (85.70%). Analyzed turbine, which operates by using wet steam is low influenced by the ambient temperature change. IGSA, which shows dominant performance in exergy analysis parameters of the analyzed turbine, in certain situations is overpowered by GA. Therefore, in optimization of steam turbine performance, IGSA and GA can be recommended.","Mrzljak, Vedran; Andjeli'c, Nikola; Lorencin, Ivan; vSegota, Sandi Baressi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03897v1.pdf,474

Decision making in the time of COVID-19,2020,"(1) Background: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the associations between physical activity (PA), sunshine duration (SD) and the occurrence of osteoporosis according to lifestyle status. (2) Methods: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) collected from 2009 to 2015 were used. Osteoporosis (n = 19,351) and control (n = 38,702) participants were matched in a 1:2 ratio according to age, sex, income, and region of residence. PA was classified as moderate- to high-intensity PA (MHPA) or low-intensity PA (LPA) based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). SD was classified as short (&#8804;6 h) or long (>6 h). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MHPA and long SD for the occurrence of osteoporosis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to SD (or PA), obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. (3) The adjusted OR of MHPA for osteoporosis was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.87-0.94). The results were consistent in the age/sex, SD, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption subgroups, but not the <60-year-old male and underweight subgroups. The adjusted OR of long SD for osteoporosis was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.93-1.00). The findings were consistent in the <60-year-old female, obese, nonsmoker, and <1 time a week alcohol consumption subgroups. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that both higher intensity of PA and long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis. Specifically, PA could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in individuals with most characteristics except male sex or underweight. Long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in young females, obese individuals, nonsmokers, and individuals with lower alcohol consumption.","Min, Chan-Yang; Yoo, Dae-Myoung; Choi, Hyo-Geun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,474

390581,"COVID-19 in Brazil: Historical cases, disease milestones, and estimated outbreak peak",2020,"Background: During social distancing, resident mentorship may be an unmet need. Telementorship, mentorship through video conferencing software, presents a unique approach to overcome these challenges. Aims: This study evaluated whether telementorship through video conference increased access to mentorship encounters and decreased perceived barriers to access, factors that determine likelihood to maintain mentor relationships, and quality of mentorship. Methods: A year-long randomized, prospective cohort study was conducted in 2016-2017 with pairs of resident mentors from seven different training programs and medical student mentees, randomized to telementorship or in-person mentorship. The number of quarterly encounters was monitored and demographic predictors of meeting were determined. Likert scale survey responses were analyzed with linear regression. Results: Forty-three of 46 (93.5%) volunteer mentor-mentee pairs participated. Telementorship did not alter likelihood of meeting or attitudes toward mentorship barriers (time and distance). Mentee satisfaction increased from 42.5% to 65.4% (P<0.05) throughout the year. Operating room-based practice (P<0.05) and higher postgraduate level (P=0.02) decreased the likelihood of meeting. Conclusion: Telementorship provided an equal number of encounters compared to the pairs who were asked to meet in-person. Telementorship may serve as an adjunct modality for flexible communication. Relevance for Patients: Medical mentorship is a key component to medical education. Effective mentorship increases academic research productivity, job satisfaction, and advancement of clinical skills, which translate to improved patient care.","Prionas, N. D.; Kung, T.

Where one lives (e.g., suburb, small town) may affect this risk due to variable access to resources, yet the evidence is mixed concerning the influence of place. We used a pooled, national cross-sectional sample of 66,046 lower-income tax filers to examine differences in material hardship in rural, small town, micropolitan, and urban areas. Controlling only for standard demographic variables, hardship risk appears higher in non-urban areas, yet these differences disappear after controlling for financial characteristics such as liquid assets and home ownership.

Uma possibilidade terapêutica pouco estudada é a utilização de células tronco mesenquimais derivadas do tecido adiposo (adCTM) infundidas por perfusão regional. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar os efeitos terapêuticos no uso de adCTM autólogas infundidas por meio de perfusão regional da veia digital palmar e compará-los com a infusão de placebo no membro torácico contralateral de equinos em estágio inicial de laminite crônica. A metodologia experimental foi aprovada pelo Comitê de Ética (CEUA/UFMG 282/2016). Foram utilizados seis equinos, Mangalarga Marchador, fêmeas, com peso entre 381± 11 kg, com idade média de 8,3± 4,7 anos, escore corporal 6±1 (escore 1 a 9), atendidos no EV-UFMG, e identificados como portadores de laminite crônica por meio do histórico, confirmados por exame físico e radiográfico, sendo todos classificados com grau 1 a 2 de claudicação Obel. O estudo envolveu a avaliação em dois períodos equivalentes de 30 dias, antes do tratamento e após tratamento. Cada equino recebeu em ambos os membros torácicos três tratamentos com adCTM [2 x 107 células/ suspendida em 3 ml de PBS e completadas até o volume de 20 ml com solução fisiológica NaCl 0,9% (SF) grupo adCTM], ou placebo (SF grupo placebo) no mesmo volume infundido por perfusão regional da veia digital lateral por 30 minutos, repetidos a cada 15 dias. Para verificar a perfusão sanguínea do casco, venografias digitais foram realizadas em ambos os membros torácicos. Cada projeção foi avaliada para o nível de preenchimento vascular em locais pré-determinados, pré e pós-tratamento. Como método de avaliação da taxa de crescimento do estojo córneo, foi utilizado o implante de esferas metálicas na muralha do casco, acompanhado por exames radiográficos. Para monitoração do crescimento antes da aplicação de qualquer tratamento, foram realizados dois exames radiográficos com trinta dias de intervalo (A1 e A30). Para se verificar o efeito pleno das adCTM foram considerados dois momentos também com trinta dias de intervalo, um quinze dias após a terceira aplicação de adCTM (D30) e outro trinta dias antes deste momento final (D1). A avaliação da relação espacial entre falange distal e o estojo córneo foi obtida por programa computacional. As amostras de biópsia lamelar foram coradas com hematoxilina-eosina e ácido periódico de Schiff, e foram classificadas quanto ao grau de lesão histológico, histomorfometria epidermal lamelar e testadas para um protocolo imunohistoquímico para p63 e analisadas por microscopia pré e pós-tratamento. Considerando a soma dos escores venográficos, houve uma melhora significativa no grupo adCTM 15 dias após a terceira aplicação quando comparado ao exame pré-tratamento (P < 0,03). Essa diferença também se manifestou especificamente nas variáveis perfusão de vasos dorsais lamelares (VDL, P < 0,03) e junção circunflexa-lamelar (JCL, P< 0,03). O grupo adCTM demonstrou maior distância entre a borda coronária e o ponto de inserção das esferas ao final dos tratamentos (D30) comparado ao grupo placebo (P< 0,03). Sobre a relação espacial entre a falange distal e o estojo córneo, efeitos positivos também foram verificados nos membros tratados com adCTM, promovendo maio estabilidade da falange distal comparado ao grupo placebo. Os resultados das análises do grau de lesão histológica global em tecido lamelar pré e pós-tratamento demonstraram piora no escore global do grupo placebo (P = 0,01), com destaque para perda do eixo queratinizado (P = 0,0001), hiperplasia do estrato médio (P = 0,001), homogeneidade das lamelas epidérmicas primárias (P = 0,003) e hiperqueratose (P = 0,05), enquanto o grupo adCTM não houve piora no escore global, havendo apenas um aumento para hiperplasia do estrato médio (P = 0,05). Houve diferença entre grupos no escore global pós-tratamento (P 0,05), com destaque para a variável ausência de eixo queratinizado (P 0,01). Os achados deste estudo demonstraram que o protocolo de três aplicações intravenosas de 2 x107 por perfusão regional no dígito de equinos com laminite crônica estável promove melhorias na perfusão vascular, na taxa de crescimento do casco, na relação espacial entre casco/falange distal, no processo cicatricial lamelar apenas no casco tratado com adCTM, não verificando o mesmo efeito benéfico no grupo placebo","OLIVEIRA, ALVARO DE PAULA LAGE DE",,,474

399506,Delayed Parosmia Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection: a Rare Late Complication of COVID-19,2021,"Mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are the major causes for the modulation of ongoing COVID-19 infection. Currently, the D614G substitution in the spike protein has become dominant worldwide. It is associated with higher infectivity than the ancestral (D614) variant. We demonstrate using Gaussian network model-based normal mode analysis that the D614G substitution occurs at the hinge region that facilitates domain-domain motions between receptor binding domain and S2 region of the spike protein. Computer-aided mutagenesis and inter-residue energy calculations reveal that contacts involving D614 are energetically frustrated. However, contacts involving G614 are energetically favourable, implying the substitution strengthens residue contacts that are formed within as well as between protomers. We also find that the free energy difference (Delta Delta G) between two variants is -2.6 kcal/mol for closed and -2.0 kcal/mol for 1-RBD up conformation. Thus, the thermodynamic stability has increased upon D614G substitution. Whereas the reverse mutation in spike protein structures having G614 substitution has resulted in the free energy differences of 6.6 kcal/mol and 6.3 kcal/mol for closed and 1-RBD up conformations, respectively, indicating that the overall thermodynamic stability has decreased. These results suggest that the D614G substitution modulates the flexibility of spike protein and confers enhanced thermodynamic stability irrespective of conformational states. This data concurs with the known information demonstrating increased availability of the functional form of spike protein trimer upon D614G substitution.","Yazhini, A.; Sidhanta, D.

401155,"Asthma, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and coronavirus disease 2019",2021,"Aim: The current study assessed the case fatality rate (CFR) across different income level countries of the world, and the virulence pattern of COVID-19, against the backdrop of panic and uncertainty faced by many governments, who are trying to impose draconian containment measures to control the outbreak. Subjects and Methods: Data on confirmed cases and number of deaths due to coronavirus infection were retrieved from the WHO as on 30 March 2020, and examined for the various income level countries, per the World Bank criteria. The CFR was calculated country-wise and estimated for the various groups such as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income, and the data was analyzed. Results: The overall CFR for the high income countries was 5.0%, compared with a CFR of 2.8% for low-income countries. The upper-middle-income countries showed a CFR of 4.3%, while the lower-middle-income countries stood at 3.7%. The results from our study predict that the maximum CFR in high-income countries will be contained at approximately 5% (95% CI). The CFR for the low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income countries will range between 2.8 and 4.3% (95% CI). Conclusion: COVID-19, irrespective of its transmissibility, produces a lower CFR compared with that of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, although COVID-19 has infected eight times more countries than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, and caused a higher number of deaths. The nation-wide lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus may be reconsidered, given the hardships for the population and their impact on the economic system.","Sreedharan, Jayadevan; Nair, Satish Chandrasekhar; Muttappallymyalil, Jayakumary; Gopakumar, Aji; Eapen, Neena Thomas; Satish, Karthyayani Priya; Manda, Venkatramana",Z Gesundh Wiss,,474
403286,Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women at term admitted to an East London maternity unit,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to efforts at rapid investigation and application of drugs which may improve prognosis but for which safety and efficacy are not yet established. This document attempts to provide reasonable guidance for the use of antimicrobials which have uncertain benefit but may increase risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular proarrhythmia, notably, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk. If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions. These recommendations are made while there are no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and should be revisited when further data on efficacy and safety become available.","Sapp, John L; Alqarawi, Wael; MacIntyre, Ciorsti J; Tadros, Rafik; Steinberg, Christian; Roberts, Jason D; Laksman, Zachary; Healey, Jeff S; Krahn, Andrew D",Can J Cardiol,,474
403381,"Rapid viral diagnosis and ambulatory management of suspected COVID-19 cases presenting at the infectious diseases referral hospital in Marseille, France, - January 31st to March 1st, 2020: A respiratory virus snapshot",2020,"BACKGROUND: We sought to identify the electrocardiographic and electrophysiological characteristics of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), including idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), with acute successful radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) at the superior portion of the mitral annulus (SP-MA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 437 consecutive patients who presented with VAs for RFCA, twenty-six patients with acute successful RFCA at the SP-MA were included in this study. The ratio of the amplitude of the first positive peak (if present) versus the nadir in the unipolar electrogram (EGM) was 0.00-0.03 (0.00) at the acute successful RFCA site. The time interval between the QRS onset and the maximum descending slope (D-Max) in the unipolar EGM (QRS-Uni) was 18.8 ± 13.6 ms. With bipolar mapping, the ventricular QRS (V-QRS) interval was 3.75-17.3 (11) ms, 6 (23.1%) patients showed the earliest V-QRS interval of 0 ms, and the other 20 patients (76.9%) showed a V-QRS interval of 10-54 ms. The RFCA start-to-effect time was 14.1 ± 7.2 s in 23 patients (88.5%). In the remaining 3 patients (11.5%), the mean duration of successful RFCA was not well defined due to the infrequent nature of clinical VAs during RFCA. Early (within 3 days) and late (1-year) recurrence rates were 23.1% (6 patients) and 26.9% (7 patients), respectively. VAs disappeared 3 days later due to delayed RFCA efficacy in 2 patients (7.7%). No complications occurred during the RFCA procedure or the one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: SP-MA VAs are a rare but distinct subgroup of VAs. Bipolar and unipolar EGM features can help to determine the optimal RFCA site, and the QRS-Uni interval may serve as a marker that could be used to guide RFCA.","Di, Chengye; Letsas, Konstantinos P; Gao, Peng; Wang, Qun; Wu, Yanxi; Lin, Wenhua",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,474

To address this, we generated and analyzed two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of the human minor salivary glands and gingiva (9 samples, 13,824 cells), identifying 50 cell clusters. Using integrated cell normalization and annotation, we classified 34 unique cell subpopulations between glands and gingiva. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry factors such as ACE2 and TMPRSS members were broadly enriched in epithelial cells of the glands and oral mucosae. Using orthogonal RNA and protein expression assessments, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the glands and mucosae. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and sustained SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acellular and cellular salivary fractions from asymptomatic individuals were found to transmit SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples displayed distinct viral shedding dynamics, and salivary viral burden correlated with COVID-19 symptoms, including taste loss. Upon recovery, this asymptomatic cohort exhibited sustained salivary IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these data show that the oral cavity is an important site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and implicate saliva as a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Huang, Ni; Pérez, Paola; Kato, Takafumi; Mikami, Yu; Okuda, Kenichi; Gilmore, Rodney C; Conde, Cecilia Domínguez; Gasmi, Billel; Stein, Sydney; Beach, Margaret; Pelayo, Eileen; Maldonado, Jose O; Lafont, Bernard A; Jang, Shyh-Ing; Nasir, Nadia; Padilla, Ricardo J; Murrah, Valerie A; Maile, Robert; Lovell, William; Wallet, Shannon M; Bowman, Natalie M; Meinig, Suzanne L; Wolfgang, Matthew C; Choudhury, Saibyasachi N; Novotny, Mark; Aevermann, Brian D; Scheuermann, Richard H; Cannon, Gabrielle; Anderson, Carlton W; Lee, Rhianna E; Marchesan, Julie T; Bush, Mandy; Freire, Marcelo; Kimple, Adam J; Herr, Daniel L; Rabin, Joseph; Grazioli, Alison; Das, Sanchita; French, Benjamin N; Pranzatelli, Thomas; Chiorini, John A; Kleiner, David E; Pittaluga, Stefania; Hewitt, Stephen M; Burbelo, Peter D; Chertow, Daniel; Frank, Karen; Lee, Janice; Boucher, Richard C; Teichmann, Sarah A",Nat Med,,474

Yet, structures in place to evaluate applicants may not support such aims. One potential solution to support those aims is rubric-based holistic review. Starting in 2018, our physics department implemented a rubric-based holistic review process for all applicants to our graduate program. The rubric assessed applicants on 18 metrics covering their grades, test scores, research experiences, noncognitive competencies, and fit with the program. We then compared faculty's ratings of applicants by admission status, sex, and undergraduate program over a three-year period. We find that the rubric scores show statistically significant differences between admitted and non-admitted students as hoped and that statistically significant differences based on sex or undergraduate program aligned with known disparities in GRE scores and service work expectations. Our results then suggest rubric-based holistic review as a possible route to making graduate admissions in physics more equitable.","Young, Nicholas T.; Tollefson, K.; Zegers, Remco G.

The detailed molecular mechanism involves binding to the host cell receptor and fusion at the plasma membrane or after being trafficked to late endosomes under favorable environmental conditions. A crucial event in the process is the proteolytic cleavage of the viral spike protein by the host's endogenous proteases that releases the fusion peptide enabling fusion with the host cellular membrane system. The present review details the mechanism of viral fusion with the host and highlights the therapeutic options that prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry in humans.","Mitra, Prasenjit",,,474

The reflection is still ongoing, and it is not possible for the moment to draw definitive conclusions. The experience of the groups working online, despite the initial mistrust, has proved useful, albeit in a peculiar way, different from before. In a group already formed and accustomed to sharing anxieties and problems, it was possible to maintain the vitality of relationships, the group continuing to function as a thinking container. The participants had the opportunity to reflect on the new experiences they were having at home with their children, even discovering in themselves new parenting skills. The inevitable changes in the setting have required for the psychotherapists leading the groups to pay special attention in maintaining their psychoanalytic listening skills, and they have also triggered some questions, which still need to be thought about. © 2021 Association of Child Psychotherapists.","Carpi Lapi, S.; Fattirolli, E.; Pini, M.

415849,Could COVID-19 represent a negative prognostic factor in patients with stroke?,2020,"In this perspectives piece, an interdisciplinary team of social science researchers considers the implications of Covid-19 for the politics of sustainable energy transitions. The emergency measures adopted by states, firms, and individuals in response to this global health crisis have driven a series of political, economic and social changes with potential to influence sustainable energy transitions. We identify some of the initial impacts of the ‘great lockdown’ on sustainable and fossil sources of energy, and consider how economic stimulus packages and social practices in the wake of the pandemic are likely to shape energy demand, the carbon-intensity of the energy system, and the speed of transitions. Adopting a broad multi-scalar and multi-actor approach to the analysis of energy system change, we highlight continuities and discontinuities with pre-pandemic trends. Discussion focuses on four key themes that shape the politics of sustainable energy transitions: (i) the short, medium and long-term temporalities of energy system change; (ii) practices of investment around clean-tech and divestment from fossil fuels; (iii) structures and scales of energy governance; and (iv) social practices around mobility, work and public health. While the effects of the pandemic continue to unfold, some of its sectoral and geographically differentiated impacts are already emerging. We conclude that the politics of sustainable energy transitions are now at a critical juncture, in which the form and direction of state support for post-pandemic economic recovery will be key.","Kuzemko, Caroline; Bradshaw, Michael; Bridge, Gavin; Goldthau, Andreas; Jewell, Jessica; Overland, Indra; Scholten, Daniel; Van de Graaf, Thijs; Westphal, Kirsten",Energy Res.

The immune responses to viral infection followed by cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome are serious issues that may cause death in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, developing a novel therapeutic strategy for management of COVID-19 is urgently needed to control the virus spread and improving patient survival rate and clinical outcomes.

435574,Masks and medical care: Two keys to Taiwan's success in preventing COVID-19 spread,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically describe central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, consecutive, observational study of adult patients from a tertiary referral center with confirmed COVID-19. All patients were screened daily for neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms during admission and discharge. Three-month follow-up data were collected using electronic health records. We classified complications as caused by SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, immune-mediated or critical illness-related. RESULTS: From April to September 2020, we enrolled 61 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients, 35 (57%) of whom required intensive care (ICU) management for respiratory failure. Forty-one CNS/PNS complications were identified in 28 of 61 (45.9%) patients and were more frequent in ICU compared to non-ICU patients. The most common CNS complication was encephalopathy (n = 19, 31.1%), which was severe in 13 patients (GCS &#8804; 12), including 8 with akinetic mutism. Length of ICU admission was independently associated with encephalopathy (OR = 1.22). Other CNS complications included ischemic stroke, a biopsy-proven acute necrotizing encephalitis, and transverse myelitis. The most common PNS complication was critical illness polyneuromyopathy (13.1%), with prolonged ICU stay as independent predictor (OR = 1.14). Treatment-related PNS complications included meralgia paresthetica. Of 41 complications in total, 3 were para/post-infectious, 34 were secondary to critical illness or other causes, and 4 remained unresolved. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all 5 patients investigated. CONCLUSION: CNS and PNS complications were common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in the ICU, and often attributable to critical illness. When COVID-19 was the primary cause for neurological disease, no signs of viral neurotropism were detected, but laboratory changes suggested autoimmune-mediated mechanisms.","Nersesjan, Vardan; Amiri, Moshgan; Lebech, Anne-Mette; Roed, Casper; Mens, Helene; Russell, Lene; Fonsmark, Lise; Berntsen, Marianne; Sigurdsson, Sigurdur Thor; Carlsen, Jonathan; Langkilde, Annika Reynberg; Martens, Pernille; Lund, Eva Løbner; Hansen, Klaus; Jespersen, Bo; Folke, Marie Norsker; Meden, Per; Hejl, Anne-Mette; Wamberg, Christian; Benros, Michael E; Kondziella, Daniel",J. neurol,,474

The French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) selected the most critical ones to the daily practice of a rheumatologist and a group of 10 experts from SFR and Club Rheumatism and Inflammation (CRI) boards proposed responses based on the current knowledge of May 2020. METHODS: Following the availability of the first 18 questions and statements, 1400 individuals consulted the frequently asked questions between the March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board. An additional round of review by email and video conference was organized, which included updates of the previous statements. The scientific relevance of 5 of the questions led to their inclusion in this document. Each response received a final assessment on a scale of 0-10 with 0 meaning no agreement whatsoever and 10 being in complete agreement. The mean values of these votes for each question are presented as the levels of agreement (LoA) at the end of each response. This document was last updated on April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Based on current scientific literature already published, in most circumstances, there is no contraindication to the initiation or continuation of anti-inflammatory drugs as well as DMARDs. If signs suggestive of infection (coronavirus or other) occur, treatments should be discontinued and resumed, if necessary, after 2 weeks without any symptoms. Only, some signals suggest that people taking an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroid therapy are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are allowed when there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative, and providing that precautions to protect the patient and the practitioner from viral contamination are adopted, included appropriate information to the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available data on managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic are reassuring and support continuing or initiating symptomatic as well as specific treatments of these diseases, the main target of their management remaining their appropriate control, even during this pandemic.","Richez, Christophe; Flipo, René-Marc; Berenbaum, Francis; Cantagrel, Alain; Claudepierre, Pascal; Debiais, Françoise; Dieudé, Philippe; Goupille, Philippe; Roux, Christian; Schaeverbeke, Thierry; Wendling, Daniel; Pham, Thao; Thomas, Thierry",Joint Bone Spine,,474

458477,The multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children related to sars-cov-2: A novel experience in children with a novel virus,2020,"(1) Background. This research examined the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of delivering a 6-week yoga-based meditation intervention to clinical teams of hospice professionals (HPs) at a large non-profit hospice organization. The intervention was designed to increase mind-body integration and combat burnout. This article was written for different audiences, including research scientists who study interoception, burnout, meditation, or yoga, designers of meditation interventions, and hospice organizations looking for ways to mitigate HP burnout. (2) Methods. The intervention was launched within clinical teams, beginning with a half-hour online introduction to the program and exposure to the week 1 meditation at each team's monthly all-staff meeting. Throughout the program, HPs could access the meditations on their own via their workplace computers, tablets, and smartphones. Online pre- and post-intervention surveys were submitted by 151 HPs, 76 of whom were exposed to the intervention and completed both surveys. The surveys assessed burnout using the Professional Fulfillment Index and mind-body integration using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness scales. (3) Results. Two-thirds of HPs who were present at a staff meeting where the program was introduced went on to do a meditation on their own at least once. Half of HPs expressed a desire to continue with access to the meditations after the 6-week program ended. Due to COVID-19 work from home restrictions, three-fourth of HPs did a meditation at home, 29% in a car between patient visits (not while driving), and 23% at the office. Higher interoceptive awareness was significantly related to lower burnout, particularly lower work exhaustion. Meditation frequency was significantly related to higher interoceptive awareness but not to burnout. Interpersonal disengagement was rare and temporary. (4) Conclusions. Findings showed that the yoga-based meditation intervention was feasible and acceptable and associated with higher interoceptive awareness. The results point to a role for interoceptive awareness in reducing the risk for burnout.","Heeter, Carrie; Allbritton, Marcel; Lehto, Rebecca; Miller, Patrick; McDaniel, Patricia; Paletta, Michael",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,474
461908,"Caution advised when considering ""Exceptional"" extended or single dose COVID-19 vaccination strategies",2021,"Key factors in modeling a pandemic and guiding policy-making include mortality rates associated with infections; the ability of government policies, medical systems, and society to adapt to the changing dynamics of a pandemic; and institutional and demographic characteristics affecting citizens' perceptions and behavioral responses to stringent policies. This paper traces the cross-country associations between COVID-19 mortality, policy interventions aimed at limiting social contact, and their interactions with institutional and demographic characteristics. We document that, with a lag, more stringent pandemic policies were associated with lower mortality growth rates. The association between stricter pandemic policies and lower future mortality growth is more pronounced in countries with a greater proportion of the elderly population and urban population, greater democratic freedoms, and larger international travel flows. Countries with greater policy stringency in place prior to the first death realized lower peak mortality rates and exhibited lower durations to the first mortality peak. In contrast, countries with higher initial mobility saw higher peak mortality rates in the first phase of the pandemic, and countries with a larger elderly population, a greater share of employees in vulnerable occupations, and a higher level of democracy took longer to reach their peak mortalities. Our results suggest that policy interventions are effective at slowing the geometric pattern of mortality growth, reducing the peak mortality, and shortening the duration to the first peak. We also shed light on the importance of institutional and demographic characteristics in guiding policy-making for future waves of the pandemic.","Jinjarak, Yothin; Ahmed, Rashad; Nair-Desai, Sameer; Xin, Weining; Aizenman, Joshua",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,,474

Since the end of February, Europe has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but there are major country differences in both the spread of the virus and measures taken to stop the virus. Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated the importance of societal and social psychological factors in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. By considering multiple perspectives, this study showed that country differences in Europe are major, and this will have an impact on how countries will cope with the ongoing crisis in the following months. The results indicated the importance of timely restrictions and cooperation with people.","Oksanen, Atte; Kaakinen, Markus; Latikka, Rita; Savolainen, Iina; Savela, Nina; Koivula, Aki",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,474
470377,Protective effects of eosinophils against COVID-19: More than an ACE(2) in the hole?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis using imaging techniques in individuals with intermediate atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk according to standard risk prediction tools. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop a machine-learning model based on routine, quantitative, and easily measured variables to predict the presence and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis (SA) in young, asymptomatic individuals. The risk of having SA estimated by this model could be used to refine risk estimation and optimize the use of imaging for risk assessment. METHODS: The Elastic Net (EN) model was built to predict SA extent, defined by a combined metric of the coronary artery calcification score and 2-dimensional vascular ultrasound. The performance of the model for the prediction of SA extension and progression was compared with traditional risk scores of cardiovascular disease (CVD). An external independent cohort was used for validation. RESULTS: EN-PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) yielded a c-statistic of 0.88 for the prediction of generalized subclinical atherosclerosis. Moreover, EN-PESA was found to be a predictor of 3-year progression independent of the baseline extension of SA. EN-PESA assigned an intermediate to high cardiovascular risk to 40.1% (n = 1,411) of the PESA individuals, a significantly larger number than atherosclerotic CVD (n = 267) and SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation) (n = 507) risk scores. In total, 86.8% of the individuals with an increased risk based on EN-PESA presented signs of SA at baseline or a significant progression of SA over 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The EN-PESA model uses age, systolic blood pressure, and 10 commonly used blood/urine tests and dietary intake values to identify young, asymptomatic individuals with an increased risk of CVD based on their extension and progression of SA. These individuals are likely to benefit from imaging tests or pharmacological treatment.

476313,Early Risk Factors for the Duration of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Viral Positivity in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived scaffolds have shown promise as tissue-engineered grafts for promoting cartilage repair. However, there has been a lack of focus on fine-tuning the frictional properties of scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering as well as understanding their interactions with synovial fluid constituents. Proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) and hyaluronan (HA) are macromolecules within synovial fluid that play key roles as boundary mode lubricants during cartilage surface interactions. The overall objective of this study was to characterize the role PRG4 and HA play in the lubricating function of collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) scaffolds for cartilage repair. As a first step towards this goal, we aimed to develop a suitable in vitro friction test to establish the boundary mode lubrication parameters for collagen-GAG scaffolds articulated against glass in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) bath. Subsequently, we sought to leverage this system to determine the effect of physiological synovial fluid lubricants, PRG4 and HA, on the frictional properties of collagen-GAG scaffolds, with scaffolds hydrated in PBS and bovine synovial fluid (bSF) serving as negative and positive controls, respectively. At all compressive strains examined (Îµ = 0.1-0.5), fluid depressurization within hydrated collagen-GAG scaffolds was >99% complete at ½ minute. The coefficient of friction was stable at all compressive strains (ranging from a low 0.103 ± 0.010 at Îµ = 0.3 up to 0.121 ± 0.015 at Îµ = 0.4) and indicative of boundary-mode conditions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that PRG4 from recombinant human (rh) and bovine sources adsorbed to collagen-GAG scaffolds and the coefficient of friction for scaffolds immersed in rhPRG4 (0.067 ± 0.027) and normal bSF (0.056 ± 0.020) solution decreased compared to PBS (0.118 ± 0.21, both p < 0.05, at Îµ = 0.2). The ability of the adsorbed rhPRG4 to reduce friction on the scaffolds indicates that its incorporation within collagen-GAG biomaterials may enhance their lubricating ability as potential tissue-engineered cartilage replacements. To conclude, this study reports the development of an in vitro friction test capable of characterizing the coefficient of friction of ECM-derived scaffolds tested in a range of synovial fluid lubricants and demonstrates frictional properties as a potential design parameter for implants and materials for soft tissue replacement.","Matheson, Austyn R; Sheehy, Eamon J; Jay, Gregory D; Scott, W Michael; O039,; Brien, Fergal J; Schmidt, Tannin A",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,,474

The rapid outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is largely due to its high transmission capacity. Studies implied that the cold chain logistics would be a potential route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The low temperature condition of the cold chain is conducive to survival and transmission of virus. Thus, the virus disinfection in cold chain should not be neglected for controlling COVID-19. However, due to the low temperature feature of the cold-chain, the virus disinfecting methods suitable in cold chain are limited. Here the high-energy electron beam irradiation is proposed to disinfect the SARS-CoV-2 in cold chain logistics. We evaluated the impact of high-energy electron beam irradiation on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped virus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and explored the possible mechanism of the action of high-energy electron beam irradiation on PEDV. The irradiation dose of 10 kGy inactivated 98.1 % PEDV on the both top and bottom surfaces of various packaging materials under cold chain frozen condition. High-energy electron beam inactivated PEDV by inducing damages on viral genome or even capsid.","Liu, Yan; Shao, Yang; Wang, Lu; Lu, Weilai; Li, Shihua; Xu, Diandou; Fu, Yu Vincent",,,474

Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax are uncommon complications of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Herein, we describe a fatal case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax. PATIENT CONCERNS: Subcutaneous emphysema was found in neck, bilateral chest walls, abdomen wall, groin area, and scrotum of a 67-year-old man. Extensive air-space opacities, subcutaneous emphysema and a small amount of pneumothorax were found in his chest X-ray scan. Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement with ejection fraction 20%. DIAGNOSIS: This resident of Wuhan with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Liver dysfunction, myocardial injury, and coagulation disorder were suggested by laboratory findings. Pneumonia, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax were confirmed with chest X-ray. Heart failure was revealed by echocardiography. INTERVENTIONS: He was transferred to intensive care unit, where invasive ventilation was used for him during the whole hospitalization. Prone position ventilation, vasoconstrictor, antibacteria, and antiviral therapy were given. OUTCOMES: He died on the twelfth day after admission.

Assessment of verbal STM/WM is critical for identifying and addressing these delays, but standard assessment procedures require face-to-face (FTF) administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and validity of remote testing methods (teleassessment) of verbal STM/WM in youth with CIs as a method of addressing COVID-19-related restrictions on FTF test administration. Method Tests of verbal STM/WM for nonwords, digit spans, letter-number sequences, sentences, and stories were individually administered by speech-language pathologists over a teleassessment platform to 28 youth (aged 9-22 years) with CIs and 36 same-aged normal-hearing peers. Examiners, parents, and participants completed quality and satisfaction ratings with the teleassessment procedure. Teleassessment scores were compared to results of tests obtained at FTF visits an average of 1.6 years earlier. Results Quality and satisfaction ratings for teleassessment were high and in almost all cases did not differ between the CI and normal-hearing samples. Youth with CIs scored lower than normal-hearing peers on measures of verbal STM/WM, and scores for digit span and letter-number sequencing did not differbetween teleassessment and FTF methods. Correlations across teleassessment and FTF visits were strong for digit span, letter-number sequencing, and sentence memory, but were more modest for nonword repetition. Conclusion With some caveats, teleassessment of verbal STM/WM was feasible and valid for youth with CIs.","Kronenberger, William G; Montgomery, Caitlin J; Henning, Shirley C; Ditmars, Allison; Johnson, Courtney A; Herbert, Carolyn J; Pisoni, David B",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,,474

One method of transmission occurs when the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, contaminates solids. Understanding and controlling the interaction with solids is thus potentially important for limiting the spread of the disease. We review work that describes the prevalence of the virus on common objects, the longevity of the virus on solids, and surface coatings that are designed to inactivate the virus. Engineered coatings have already succeeded in producing a large reduction in viral infectivity from surfaces. We also review work describing inactivation on facemasks and clothing, and discuss probable mechanisms of inactivation of the virus at surfaces.","Hosseini, Mohsen; Behzadinasab, Saeed; Benmamoun, Zachary; Ducker, William A",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,,474
484810,[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and coronavirus: research update on pathogenesis of the infection induced by this indissoluble bond],2020,"INTRODUCTION: France has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, burn out and the high proportion of post-traumatic stress disorder proved to be the most expected troubles caused by this pandemic and the confinement. Medico-psychological emergency units (CUMP) have been solicited at the very early stage of the pandemic because CUMP units are very well known by the French government and systematically associated to emergency plans. METHODS: In this article we describe the process which has been developed to cope with the psychological needs in the general population. At a first level, platforms of volunteers specialised into listening were available. Then those platforms could directly mobilise the CUMP in case of psychiatric disorders. It ran over the whole first wave and it has been reactivated because of the second confinement in France. RESULTS: During the first wave, approximately 1% of all the calls made on the national Covid number required to be redirected to the listening platforms. Of this group, 4% were related to reactive pathology or a psychiatric decompensating that required adapted and specialised care. CONCLUSION: The high rates of psychological distress detected in the general population in recent scientific literature seem discrepant with our findings of relatively low reorientation towards the CUMP. Nevertheless, our study highlights that the response of the CUMP network in France during the first wave was supportive. The second wave displays its adaptability to the public health policies.","Prieto, Nathalie; Vignaud, Philippe; Darbon, Remy; Cheucle, Eric; Philippe, Jean-Marc",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,474
484957,Inpatient Mortality According to Level of Respiratory Support Received for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Infection: A Prospective Multicenter Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the onset of TD and treatment efficacy in NSCLC patients who initiated anti-PD-1 blockade (Nivolumab®) and to assess the impact of TD severity and subtype on nivolumab efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed at a referral oncology center between July 20, 2015 and June 30, 2018. Patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIB/IV NSCLC in progression after one or two lines of treatment and who initiated Nivolumab were included. Thyroid function (TSH ± fT4, fT3) was monitored and patients were classified according to TD status [TD(+) versus TD(-)], severity [moderate thyroid dysfunction: TSH level between 0.1 and 0.4 or 4.0 and 10 mIU/L and severe thyroid dysfunction: TSH &#8804; 0.1 or &#8805; 10mUI/L) and subtype (isolated hypothyroidism, isolated hyperthyroidism and hyperthyroidism then hypothyroidism)]. Clinical endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Among 194 eligible patients, 134 patients (median age, 63 yo; 70.1% male) were included. Forty (29.9%) patients were classified in TD(+) and had a longer OS of 29.8 months (95% CI 18.8-NR) versus 8.1 months (95% CI 5.5-11.5) in TD(-) group (p < 0.001). PFS was also longer (8.7 months (95% CI 5.3-15.1) in TD(+) versus 1.7 months (95% CI 1.6-1.9) in TD(-) group (p < 0.001). In Cox proportional hazards analysis, TD remained an independent predictive factor of OS/PFS. Severity and subtype of TD were not correlated with OS/PFS. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that TD induced by Nivolumab appears to be an independent predictive factor of survival, irrespective of TD severity and subtype.","Thuillier, Philippe; Joly, Claire; Alavi, Zarrin; Crouzeix, Geneviève; Descourt, Renaud; Quere, Gilles; Kerlan, Véronique; Roudaut, Nathalie",,,474

486314,Acute Polyneuropathy in an Outpatient Context During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Brief Case Serie Report,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread changes in all health care settings including academic radiology departments. The purpose of this survey-based study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on radiology resident training and education workflow in Canada in terms of the nature, scale, and heterogeneity of the changes, preparedness and adaptation, and perceptions of the present and future of radiology training. METHODS: A 30-question web-based survey was sent to 17 radiology residency program directors across Canada. A separate 32-question survey was sent to 460 residents currently enrolled in a radiology residency in Canada. These surveys were open for 3 weeks. RESULTS: We received responses from 16 program directors and 80 residents (response rates 94.1% and 17.4%, respectively). Most respondents agreed that objectives were being met for knowledge and interpretation but less so for case volumes and technical skills. Less time was allotted for on-site activities (eg, readouts) with more time for off-site activities (eg, videoconferencing). Daytime rotations were at least partly cancelled. Most respondents felt these changes were met with enthusiasm by both faculty and residents. However, there were perceived challenges including lack of training on virtual platforms for delivery of teaching and decreased staff-resident interaction, with short- and long-term anxiety reported. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 has dramatically changed radiology resident training in Canada, with increased virtual learning at the expense of cancelled rotations and the resultant reduction in case volumes and staff-resident interaction. Although adopted with enthusiasm, these changes present substantial challenges and anxiety regarding the future of radiology resident education.","Warnica, William; Moody, Alan; Probyn, Linda; Bartlett, Eric; Singh, Navneet; Pakkal, Mini",Can Assoc Radiol J,,474

489254,The reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 in Peru: An opportunity for effective changes,2020,"Comprehensive and accurate comparisons of transcriptomic distributions of cells from samples taken from two different biological states, such as healthy versus diseased individuals, are an emerging challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its k nearest neighboring cells across a range of k values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these subpopulations yields biological insights that would otherwise be undetected using conventional computational approaches.","Zhao, Jun; Jaffe, Ariel; Li, Henry; Lindenbaum, Ofir; Sefik, Esen; Jackson, Ruaidhrí; Cheng, Xiuyuan; Flavell, Richard A; Kluger, Yuval",Proc.

492909,Enjoined and Incarcerated: Complications with Incarcerated People Seeking Economic Relief under the CARES Act (preprint),2021,"PURPOSE: The European Geriatric Medicine Society (EuGMS) is launching a second interim guidance whose aim is to prevent the entrance and spread of COVID-19 into long-term care facilities (LTCFs). METHODS: The EuGMS gathered experts to propose a guide of measures to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs. It is based on the specific features of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in LTCFs, residents' needs, and on experiences conducted in the field. RESULTS: Asymptomatic COVID-19 residents and staff members contribute substantially to the dissemination of COVID-19 infection in LTCFs. An infection prevention and control focal point should be set up in every LTCF for (1) supervising infection prevention and control measures aimed at keeping COVID-19 out of LTCFs, (2) RT-PCR testing of residents, staff members, and visitors with COVID-19 symptoms, even atypical, and (3) isolating subjects either infected or in contact with infected subjects. When a first LCTF resident or staff member is infected, a facility-wide RT-PCR test-retest strategy should be implemented for detecting all SARS-CoV-2 carriers. Testing should continue until no new COVID-19 cases are identified. The isolation of residents should be limited as much as possible and associated with measures aiming at limiting its negative effects on their mental and somatic health status. CONCLUSIONS: An early recognition of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 may help to diagnose COVID-19 residents and staff more promptly. Subsequently, an earlier testing for SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic and asymptomatic LTCF staff and residents will enable the implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control. The negative effects of social isolation in residents should be limited as much as possible.","Blain, Hubert; Rolland, Yves; Schols, Jos M G A; Cherubini, Antonio; Miot, Stéphanie; O039,; Neill, Desmond; Martin, Finbarr C; Guérin, Olivier; Gavazzi, Gaëtan; Bousquet, Jean; Petrovic, Mirko; Gordon, Adam L; Benetos, Athanase",Eur Geriatr Med,,474

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form RNA structures, yet as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome at single-nucleotide resolution in infected cells. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis shows that several features of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic structure are conserved across ß-coronaviruses, and we pinpoint regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on the viral life cycle, facilitate primer design, and guide the identification of RNA drug targets against COVID-19.","Huston, Nicholas C; Wan, Han; Strine, Madison S; de Cesaris Araujo Tavares, Rafael; Wilen, Craig B; Pyle, Anna Marie",Mol Cell,,474

Therefore, the prognosis of the disease may be more favourable in people who were under oral anticoagulant treatment before the COVID-19 diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the effects of chronic DOAC use on ICU admission and mortality in hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 infection. METHOD: Between 1 September and 30 November 2020, 2760 patients hospitalized in our hospital due to COVID-19 were screened. A total of 1710 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups as those who use DOAC due to any cardiovascular disease before the COVID-19 infection and those who do not. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the DOAC group and 1631 patients in the non-DOAC group. Median age of all study patient was 62 (52-71 IQR) and 860 (50.5%) of them were female. The need for intensive care, in-hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation were observed at higher rates in the DOAC group.

Here, we explored 61,485 sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in real-time polymerase chain reaction based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n = 30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including the 3'-end mismatch to the primer-pair of 11 well-characterized primer sets. Noteworthily, CDC (USA) recommended the N2 primer set contained a lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions were located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in the RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain, respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions, mostly (n = 10) within the highly flexible linker region, were revealed, and the rest was within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequence of high-frequency mutations (&#8805;20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that a high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) co-occuring mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 comprises an average of 1.2 mutations per strain compared to 4.4 and 0.4 in Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively. Despite being proposed as the alternative target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, the ongoing evolution of the N protein may challenge these endeavors, thus needing further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.","Rahman, M Shaminur; Islam, M Rafiul; Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Islam, Israt; Hoque, M Nazmul; Akter, Salma; Rahaman, Md Mizanur; Sultana, Munawar; Hossain, M Anwar",J Med Virol,,474
501675,Sustainable border control policy in the COVID-19 pandemic: A math modeling study,2021,"The goal of this research is to develop and implement a highly effective deep learning model for detecting COVID-19. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on EfficientNet, named ECOVNet, to detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. To make the proposed model more robust, we have used one of the largest open-access chest X-ray data sets named COVIDx containing three classes—COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. For feature extraction, we have applied an effective CNN structure, namely EfficientNet, with ImageNet pre-training weights. The generated features are transferred into custom fine-tuned top layers followed by a set of model snapshots. The predictions of the model snapshots (which are created during a single training) are consolidated through two ensemble strategies, i.e., hard ensemble and soft ensemble, to enhance classification performance. In addition, a visualization technique is incorporated to highlight areas that distinguish classes, thereby enhancing the understanding of primal components related to COVID-19. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed ECOVNet model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves detection performance with 100% recall for COVID-19 and overall accuracy of 96.07%. We believe that ECOVNet can enhance the detection of COVID-19 disease, and thus, underpin a fully automated and efficacious COVID-19 detection system.","Nihad Karim, Chowdhury Kabir Muhammad Ashad Rahman Md Muhtadir Rezoana Noortaz",PeerJ Computer Science,,474

501708,COVID-19 and refugee camps,2021,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an ongoing medical challenge with multiple organs involvement, including the cardiovascular system. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has been described in the context of COVID-19 in two different scenarios: as a direct complication of the infection, and as an indirect outcome secondary to psychological burden of quarantine and social isolation (i.e., stress induced cardiomyopathy). Confirming the diagnosis of TTS in COVID-19 may be challenging due to the limited use of coronary angiography consistent with the recommended guidelines aimed to minimize contact with infected individuals. The use of natriuretic peptide as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in this context may not be reliable since this peptide is already elevated in severe cases of COVID-19 regardless of TTS diagnosis. A relatively high incidence of complications has been reported in these cases, probably related to the severity of the underlying infectious disease. Although quarantine-induced stress cardiomyopathy is a reasonable outcome of the powerful stress during the current pandemic, conflicting results have been reported, and further studies are encouraged to determine the true incidence.","Moady, Gassan; Atar, Shaul",,,474

Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome in infected cells may represent a powerful tool to identify cellular proteins hijacked by viruses for their life cycle and develop host-oriented antiviral therapeutics. Here we report the proteomic characterization of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein in infected Vero E6 cells. We identified 24 high-confidence proteins mainly playing a role in RNA metabolism and translation, including RNA helicases and scaffold proteins involved in the formation of stress granules, cytoplasmic aggregates of messenger ribonucleoproteins that accumulate as a result of stress-induced translation arrest. Analysis of stress granules upon SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that these structures are not induced in infected cells, neither eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, an upstream event leading to stress-induced translation inhibition. Notably, we found that G3BP1, a stress granule component that associates with the Nucleoprotein, is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, we showed that the Nucleoprotein-interacting RNA helicase DDX3X colocalizes with viral RNA foci and its inhibition by small molecules or small interfering RNAs significantly reduces viral replication. Altogether, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 subverts the stress granule machinery and exploits G3BP1 and DDX3X for its replication cycle, offering groundwork for future development of host-directed therapies.","Ciccosanti, Fabiola; Di Rienzo, Martina; Romagnoli, Alessandra; Colavita, Francesca; Refolo, Giulia; Castilletti, Concetta; Agrati, Chiara; Brai, Annalaura; Manetti, Fabrizio; Botta, Lorenzo; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Piacentini, Mauro; Fimia, Gian Maria",Antiviral Res,,474

One of the major challenges of acute viral infections is the treatment of advanced disease. Thus, extending the window of therapeutic intervention is critical. Here, we explore the benefit of combination therapy with a mAb and remdesivir in a non-human primate model of Marburg virus (MARV) disease. While rhesus monkeys are protected against lethal infection when treatment with either a human mAb (MR186-YTE; 100%), or remdesivir (80%), is initiated 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) with MARV, no animals survive when either treatment is initiated alone beginning 6 dpi. However, by combining MR186-YTE with remdesivir beginning 6 dpi, significant protection (80%) is achieved, thereby extending the therapeutic window. These results suggest value in exploring combination therapy in patients presenting with advanced filovirus disease.","Cross, Robert W; Bornholdt, Zachary A; Prasad, Abhishek N; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Agans, Krystle N; Deer, Daniel J; Abelson, Dafna M; Kim, Do H; Shestowsky, William S; Campbell, Lioudmila A; Bunyan, Elaine; Geisbert, Joan B; Fenton, Karla A; Zeitlin, Larry; Porter, Danielle P; Geisbert, Thomas W",Nat Commun,,474
510167,6-month multidisciplinary follow-up and outcomes of patients with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS-TS) at a UK tertiary paediatric hospital: a retrospective cohort study,2021,"Background Fear of illness, economic damage, and stigma have had a devastating impact on the travel industry and have caused a significant reduction in both business and leisure travel. This study examines passengers' social and emotional perspectives during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, building on a prior quantitative study that identified factors that predict a person's willingness to fly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This study used a qualitative method with a phenomenological perspective and hermeneutic design. Fifteen adults from the United States participated in a personal interview designed to capture demographics, individual safety measures, feelings, and concerns involving air travel during the pandemic. Personal interview transcripts were then inspected by the researchers using a constant comparison method. Results The personal experiences of participants were dominated by projections of trust issues and emotional heuristics, protective behaviors, and fear of confrontations with others, and a fear of the unknown. These themes emerged even in participants who continued to fly during the pandemic. Conclusion Insights into travelers’ emotions, trust, and fears may help airlines and other segments of the travel industry to develop targeted messaging that supports the trust and safety issues confronted by frequent travelers.","Lamb, Tracy L.; Ruskin, Keith J.; Rice, Stephen Khorassani Leili Winter Scott R.; Truong, Dothang",Journal of Air Transport Management,,474
510168,6-month multidisciplinary follow-up and outcomes of patients with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS-TS) at a UK tertiary paediatric hospital: a retrospective cohort study,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than a million lives worldwide within a short time span. Due to the unavailability of specific antiviral drugs or vaccine, the infections are causing panic both in general public and among healthcare providers. Therefore, an urgent discovery and development of effective antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19 is highly desired. Targeting the main protease (Mpro) of the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 has great potential for drug discovery and drug repurposing efforts. Published crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro further facilitated in silico investigations for discovering new inhibitors against Mpro. The present study aimed to screen several libraries of synthetic flavonoids and benzisothiazolinones as potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors using in silico methods. The short-listed compounds after virtual screening were filtered through SwissADME modeling tool to remove molecules with unfavorable pharmacokinetics and medicinal properties. The drug-like molecules were further subjected to iterative docking for the identification of top binders of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Finally, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations were performed for the evaluation of the dynamic behavior, stability of protein-ligand complex, and binding affinity, resulting in the identification of thioflavonol, TF-9 as a potential inhibitor of Mpro. The computational studies further revealed the binding of TF-9 close to catalytic dyad and interactions with conserved residues in the S1 subsite of the substrate binding site. Our in-silico study demonstrated that synthetic analogs of flavonoids, particularly thioflavonols, have a strong tendency to inhibit the main protease Mpro, and thereby inhibit the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2.

510484,Covid-19 and the N95 respirator shortage: Closing the gap,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are a high-risk population in the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, and examined risk factors for mortality in this population. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study of 205 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and with a pathological diagnosis of a malignant tumour in nine hospitals within Hubei, China, from Jan 13 to March 18, 2020. All patients were either discharged from hospitals or had died by April 20, 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and cancer histories were compared between survivors and non-survivors by use of &#967;2 test. Risk factors for mortality were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and Mar 18, 2020, 205 patients with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (median age 63 years [IQR 56-70; range 14-96]; 109 [53%] women). 183 (89%) had solid tumours and 22 (11%) had haematological malignancies. The median duration of follow-up was 68 days (IQR 59-78). The most common solid tumour types were breast (40 [20%] patients), colorectal (28 [14%]), and lung cancer (24 [12%]). 54 (30%) of 182 patients received antitumour therapies within 4 weeks before symptom onset. 30 (15%) of 205 patients were transferred to an intensive care unit and 40 (20%) died during hospital admission. Patients with haematological malignancies had poorer prognoses than did those with solid tumours: nine (41%) of 22 patients with haematological malignancies died versus 31 (17%) of 183 patients with solid tumours (hazard ratio for death 3·28 [95% CI 1·56-6·91]; log rank p=0·0009). Multivariable regression analysis showed that receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset (odds ratio [OR] 3·51 [95% CI 1·16-10·59]; p=0·026) and male sex (OR 3·86 [95% CI 1·57-9·50]; p=0·0033) were risk factors for death during admission to hospital. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had a high case-fatality rate. Unfavourable prognostic factors, including receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset and male sex, might help clinicians to identify patients at high risk of fatal outcomes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of silymarin (SLM) against DTX-induced central and peripheral neurotoxicities in rats. Rats received 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight SLM orally for seven consecutive days after receiving a single injection of 30 mg/kg body weight DTX on the first day. SLM significantly decreased brain lipid peroxidation level and ameliorated brain glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in DTX-administered rats. SLM attenuated levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B), tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activity of p38&#945; mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38&#945; MAPK) whereas caused an increase in levels of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the brain and sciatic nerve of DTX-induced rats. In addition, SLM improved the histological structure of the brain and sciatic nerve tissues and decreased the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the sciatic nerve whereas increased cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression in the brain induced by DTX. Additionally, SLM markedly up-regulated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in the brain and sciatic nerve tissues of DTX-induced rats. Our results show that SLM can protect DTX-induced brain and sciatic nerve injuries by enhancing the antioxidant defense system and suppressing apoptosis and inflammation.","Yardim, Ahmet; Kucukler, Sefa; Özdemir, Selçuk; Çomakli, Selim; Caglayan, Cuneyt; Mehmet Kandemir, Fatih; Çelik, Hamit",Gene,,474

590062,Safety and adherence to venom immunotherapy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-11-26,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a great transition in the modalities of health care services, such as the telemedicine landscape, with some speed. Because of the lack of vaccines or effective therapies, social distancing and quarantine were the only widely accessible precautions, creating a compelling reason for alternatives for in-person care. Many countries applied teleconsultation or provided online applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is not currently known whether this available service has satisfied the patients' needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim To detect the preferred modality of health services by the Saudi population during COVID-19 and to assess the satisfaction with respect to the provided health services in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting all accessible populations in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from participants using an electronic pre-structured questionnaire. The tool covered participants' socio-demographic data, participants’ medical and family history, COVID-19 infection, health problems during the pandemic, received services, modalities of available services, and their satisfaction regarding the provided health service. Results A total of 2102 participants completed the study questionnaire. Exactly 773 (36.8%) respondents had a health problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most-reported modality of health services used was calling the 937 number, which is call center of the Ministry of Health (34.7%), followed by using health applications to get an appointment (33.9%). Also, 447 (88.7%) participants reported that the provided medical services were helpful. Regarding their satisfaction, 156 (31%) were just satisfied with the provided services and 280 (55.6%) were highly satisfied. Conclusions In conclusion, the current study showed a high level of public satisfaction regarding different modalities of health services provided during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. This satisfaction was moderately high among telehealth users and those who had hospital visits for health care.","Assiri, Amer H; Mahnashi, Naif A; Alkhttabi, Nora F; Alqahtani, Khalid M; Alqahtani, Mushary S; Alhajri, Meshal A",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367796/,474

Methods: The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar were examined with the searches restricted to the years 2019 and 2020. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. Conclusion: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence generated was graded as low. However, these variables alone could not explain most of the variability in disease transmission.","Mecenas, P.; Bastos, R.; Vallinoto, A.; Normando, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.14.20064923v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064923,474

The main findings from this study show that, compared to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mutations E484A/G/K/Q/R/V, Q493K/L/R, S494A/P/R, L452R and F490S are predicted to be markedly resistant to neutralization by LY-CoV555, while mutations K417E/N/T, D420A/G/N, N460I/K/S/T, T415P, and Y489C/S are predicted to confer LY-CoV016 escaping advantage to the viral protein. A challenge of our global in silico results against relevant experimental data resulted in an overall 90% agreement. Thus, the results presented provide a molecular-based rationale for all relative experimental findings, constitute a fast and reliable tool for identifying and prioritizing all present and newly reported circulating spike SARS-CoV-2 variants with respect to antibody neutralization, and yield substantial structural information for the development of next-generation vaccines and monoclonal antibodies more resilient to viral evolution.","Laurini, Erik; Marson, Domenico; Aulic, Suzana; Fermeglia, Alice; Pricl, Sabrina",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642465/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99827-3,474
598592,Cholestatic Jaundice as a Manifestation of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND/AIM: SARS‐CoV‐2 is one of the coronavirus families that emerged at the end of 2019. It infected the respiratory system and caused a pandemic worldwide. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been safely used as antibacterial agents for decades. The antiviral activity of FQs was observed. Moreover, substitution on the C‐7 position of ciprofloxacin enhanced its antiviral activity. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the antiviral activity of 7‐(4‐(N‐substituted‐carbamoyl‐methyl)piperazin‐1yl)‐chalcone in comparison with ciprofloxacin against SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease (M(pro)). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vero cells were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. After treatment with ciprofloxacin and the chalcone at the concentrations of 1.6, 16, 160 nmol/L for 48 h, SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load was detected using real‐time qPCR, SARS‐CoV‐2 infectivity was determined using plaque assay, and the main protease enzyme activity was detected using in vitro 3CL‐protease inhibition assay. The activity of the chalcone was justified through molecular docking within SARS‐CoV‐2 M(pro), in comparison with ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: The new chalcone significantly inhibited viral load replication where the EC50 was 3.93 nmol/L, the plaque formation ability of the virus was inhibited to 86.8% ± 2.47. The chalcone exhibited a significant inhibitory effect against SARS‐CoV‐2 M(pro) in vitro in a dose‐dependent manner.

602076,Mobility and COVID-19 mortality across Scandinavia: A modeling study,2021-03-27,"Abstract Background EPs® 7630 is a proprietary aqueous-ethanolic extract from roots of Pelargonium sidoides DC and has been demonstrated to dispose among others of antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and tissue-protective activity. It is an approved medicinal product in more than 50 countries for the treatment of airway infections such as acute bronchitis, common cold, and sinusitis. Purpose While the pharmacological effects of EPs® 7630 have extensively been evaluated in diverse in vitro test systems, the number of publications reporting results from in vivo models is limited. Study design In the present study antitussive, secretolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects of EPs® 7630 were assessed in animal experiments following oral administration at human equivalent doses. Methods Antitussive effects were evaluated using ammonia- and citric acid-induced models of cough in mice (20, 40, 120 mg/kg) and guinea pigs (10, 20, 45 mg/kg), respectively. For the determination of secretolytic activity tracheobronchial secretion of intraperitoneally injected phenol red was determined in mice, while antiinflammatory action was assessed in an acute bacterial bronchitis model in rats. Results A significant and dose-dependent reduction of cough frequency was observed in both cough models, which was accompanied by a prolongation of cough latency time. Similarly, the extract exerted a marked secretolytic activity in mice. Induction of acute bacterial bronchitis caused characteristic histopathological changes in lung tissue adjacent to trachea and bronchi. The degree of these lesions was significantly reduced in rats treated with EPs® 7630 at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg. This protective effect at least partially seems to be mediated by an up-regulation of superoxide dismutase and a subsequent protective effect against oxidative stress as indicated by a reduced serum level of malondialdehyde. Conclusion The present data further support the therapeutic use of EPs® 7630 in respiratory tract infections and provide a basis for detailed studies on its bioactive constituents as well as their in vivo mode of action.","Bao, Yanyan; Gao, Yingjie; Koch, Egon; Pan, Xin; Jin, Yahong; Cui, Xiaolan",Phytomedicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711315000707; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711315000707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925973/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2015.03.004,474

Interval chest radiograph is recommended following community-acquired pneumonia, however its utility in monitoring recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia remains unclear. METHODS: Prospective single-centre observational cohort study. Patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (admission duration ≥48 h and oxygen requirement ≥40% or critical care admission) underwent face-to-face assessment 4–6 weeks post-discharge. Primary outcome: radiological resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Oedema score <5). Secondary outcomes: clinical outcomes, symptom questionnaires, mental health screening (Trauma Screening Questionnaire, GAD-7, PHQ-9), physiological testing (4-metre gait speed (4MGS), 1-minute sit-to-stand test (STS)). RESULTS: 119 patients assessed between 3(rd) June and 2(nd) July 2020 at median (IQR) 61 (51–67) days post-discharge. Mean±sd age 58.7±14.4 years, body mass index 30.0 (25.9–35.2) kg·m(−2), 62% male, 68% ethnic minority. Despite radiographic resolution of pulmonary infiltrates in 87%, mMRC breathlessness scores were above pre-COVID baseline in 46% and patients reported persistent fatigue (68%), sleep disturbance (57%) and breathlessness (32%). Screening thresholds were breached for post-traumatic stress disorder (25%), anxiety (22%) and depression (18%). 4MGS was slow (<0.8 m·s(−1)) in 38%, 35% desaturated by ≥4% during STS. Of 56 thoracic computed tomography scans performed, 75% demonstrated COVID-related interstitial and/or airways disease. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent symptoms, adverse mental health outcomes and physiological impairment are common 2 months after severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Follow-up chest radiograph is a poor marker of recovery, therefore holistic face-to-face assessment is recommended to facilitate early recognition and management of post-COVID sequelae.","D'Cruz, Rebecca F.; Waller, Michael D.; Perrin, Felicity; Periselneris, Jimstan; Norton, Sam; Smith, Laura-Jane; Patrick, Tanya; Walder, David; Heitmann, Amadea; Lee, Kai; Madula, Rajiv; McNulty, William; Macedo, Patricia; Lyall, Rebecca; Warwick, Geoffrey; Galloway, James B.; Birring, Surinder S.; Patel, Amit; Patel, Irem; Jolley, Caroline J.",ERJ Open Res,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00655-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575312/,474

We made the following findings: The majority of IGs are upregulated in the first 12 hours post-infection (PI), and maintained until 48 hours PI in human microvascular EC infected by middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (an EC model for COVID-19). The expressions of IGs are modulated in 21 human EC transcriptomic datasets by various PAMPs/DAMPs, including LPS, LPC, shear stress, hyperlipidemia and oxLDL. Upregulation of many IGs such as nucleic acid sensors are shared between ECs infected by MERS-CoV and those stimulated by PAMPs and DAMPs. Human heart EC and mouse aortic EC express all four types of coronavirus receptors such as ANPEP, CEACAM1, ACE2, DPP4 and virus entry facilitator TMPRSS2 (heart EC); most of coronavirus replication-transcription protein complexes are expressed in HMEC, which contribute to viremia, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular comorbidities of COVID-19. ECs have novel trained immunity (TI), in which subsequent inflammation is enhanced. Upregulated proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL6, CSF1 and CSF3 and TI marker IL-32 as well as TI metabolic enzymes and epigenetic enzymes indicate TI function in HMEC infected by MERS-CoV, which may drive cytokine storms. Upregulated CSF1 and CSF3 demonstrate a novel function of ECs in promoting myelopoiesis. Mechanistically, the ER stress and ROS, together with decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes, facilitate a proinflammatory response and TI. Additionally, an increase of the regulators of mitotic catastrophe cell death, apoptosis, ferroptosis, inflammasomes-driven pyroptosis in ECs infected with MERS-CoV and the upregulation of pro-thrombogenic factors increase thromboembolism potential. Finally, NRF2-suppressed ROS regulate innate immune responses, TI, thrombosis, EC inflammation and death. These transcriptomic results provide novel insights on the roles of ECs in coronavirus infections such as COVID-19, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), inflammation, transplantation, autoimmune disease and cancers.","Shao, Ying; Saredy, Jason; Xu, Keman; Sun, Yu; Saaoud, Fatma; Drummer, Charles; Lu, Yifan; Luo, Jin J.; Lopez-Pastrana, Jahaira; Choi, Eric T.; Jiang, Xiaohua; Wang, Hong; Yang, Xiaofeng",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.653110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248940/,474

Some areas require stricter forms of regulation while others call for deregulation. The challenge for the regulatory authorities is to manage these potentially conflicting demands in regulation and define coherently their overall regulatory rationale. The precision regulation approach can be a helpful approach. It is defined here as a streamlined approach to regulation to deliver the right methods of regulation for the right group of people at the right time. This problem-solving innovation in regulation triggered by the recent epidemiologic crisis in South Korea demonstrates the emergence of the precision regulation approach. South Korea has implemented streamlined fast-track services for the biotechnology industry to produce test kits swiftly. This article expands the definition of precision regulation from AI regulation literature, and positions the term as a new regulatory rationale, not as a regulatory tool, using the case study from South Korea.","Lee, Sora; Kang, Woojin",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33598446/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.628073,474

Nanoparticle immunogens presenting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) in repetitive arrays are being advanced as second-generation vaccine candidates, as they feature robust manufacturing characteristics and have shown promising immunogenicity in preclinical models. Here, we used previously reported deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to guide the design of stabilized variants of the RBD. The selected mutations fill a cavity in the RBD that has been identified as a linoleic acid binding pocket. Screening of several designs led to the selection of two lead candidates that expressed at higher yields than the wild-type RBD. These stabilized RBDs possess enhanced thermal stability and resistance to aggregation, particularly when incorporated into an icosahedral nanoparticle immunogen that maintained its integrity and antigenicity for 28 days at 35-40°C, while corresponding immunogens displaying the wild-type RBD experienced aggregation and loss of antigenicity. The stabilized immunogens preserved the potent immunogenicity of the original nanoparticle immunogen, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Our findings may improve the scalability and stability of RBD-based coronavirus vaccines in any format and more generally highlight the utility of comprehensive DMS data in guiding vaccine design.","Ellis, Daniel; Brunette, Natalie; Crawford, Katharine H.

Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and materials Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. Results In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan. Conclusions Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.","Ruthberg, Jeremy S.; Quereshy, Humzah A.; Jella, Tarun; Kocharyan, Armine; D'Anza, Brian; Maronian, Nicole; Otteson, Todd D.",Am J Otolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32386898/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070920301964; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070920301964?v=s5,474

We hypothesized that gender would moderate the relationship between PH and depressiveness or stress levels, such that PH would negatively correlate with psychological distress in women but correlate positively in men. The present study was online and questionnaire-based. N = 230 participants aged 15–73 from the general population took part in the study. The results of moderation analysis allowed for full acceptance of the hypothesis for depression as a factor, but for stress the hypothesis was only partially confirmed, since the relationship between PH time perspective and stress was not significant for men (although it was positive, as expected). The findings are pioneering in terms of including PH time perspective in predicting psychological distress during the COVID-19 lock-down and have potentially significant implications for practicing clinicians, who could include the development of more adaptive time perspectives and balance them in their therapeutic work with people experiencing lock-down-related distress.","Bodecka, Marta; Nowakowska, Iwona; Zajenkowska, Anna; Rajchert, Joanna; Kaźmierczak, Izabela; Jelonkiewicz, Irena",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012936/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305869; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920305869,474

We aimed to test the hypotheses that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 138 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Forty-three patients died within 90 days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.24). The association attenuated and became statistically insignificant after adjustment for co-morbidities (sex, age, CVD, diabetes, BMI, and eGFR adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.22, 95% CI: 0.82; 1.80). In conclusion, we found that low vitamin K status was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 in sex- and age-adjusted analyses, but not in analyses additionally adjusted for co-morbidities. Randomized clinical trials would be needed to clarify a potential role, if any, of vitamin K in the course of COVID-19.","Linneberg, Allan; Kampmann, Freja Bach; Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Andersen, Liv Rabøl; Jørgensen, Henrik Løvendahl; Sandholt, Håkon; Jørgensen, Niklas Rye; Thysen, Sanne Marie; Benfield, Thomas",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207745/,474

This noninvasive platform is integrated into protective masks toward collecting airborne virus in the exhaled breath over the wearing period. A viral sample was sprayed into the collector to model airborne dispersion, and then the enriched pathogen was extracted from the collector for further analytical evaluation. To validate this design, qualitative colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and antibody-based dot blot assays were performed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

619311,Vertical transmission of COVID-19 in a 1-day-old neonate,2020-09-17,"Objective. In physiological conditions arterial blood lactate concentration is equal or lower than central venous. The aim of this study was to explore if the COVID-19 induced lung cells damage was mirrored by an arterial lactatemia higher than the central venous one; then if the administration of immunosuppressant drugs (i.e. canakinumab) could normalize such abnormal lactate a-cv difference. Methods. Prospective cohort study started on March 25th 2020 for a duration of 10 days, enrolling 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation consecutively admitted to the ICU of the Rimini Hospital, Italy. Arterial and central venous blood samples were contemporary collected to calculate the difference between arterial and central venous lactate (Delta a-cv lactate) concentration within 24 h from tracheal intubation (T0), and 24 hours after canakinumab administration (T1). Results. At the T0 19/21 (90.5%) patients showed a pathologic Delta a-cv lactate (median 0.22 mmol/L; IQR 0.07-0.36), suggesting severe inflammation. In the 13 patients undergoing canakinumab administration, at the T1 Delta a-cv lactate decreased in 92.3% of cases, being the decrease statistically significant (T0: median 0.15, IQR 0.07-0.25 mmol/L; T1: median -0.01, IQR -0.09-0.04 mmol/L; p=0.002). Conclusion. A reversed Delta a-cv lactate is likely to be one of the effects of COVID-19 related cytokine storm, that could reflect a derangement in the lung cells mitochondrial metabolism induced by inflammation or other uncoupling mediators. Delta a-cv lactate decrease may reflect the anti-inflammatory activity of canakinumab.

The last few years have brought many clinically significant new data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of SAT. Several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were demonstrated not only to increase the risk of SAT, but also to correlate with SAT clinical course and determine the risk of recurrence. The world-wide epidemic of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has provided new observations that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be a potent SAT-triggering factor, and that the clinical course of SAT in patients affected by COVID-19 is different from a typical one.

This abnormal thrombotic diathesis can lead to pulmonary embolism, stroke, and intracardiac thrombosis. CASE SUMMARY: We present two cases of unusual intracardiac thrombosis in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. In both cases, imaging tests (such as transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), computed tomography scan of the chest, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) showed evidence of unusual intracardiac thrombosis with thrombi adherent to regularly contracting walls. DISCUSSION: This evidence confirms that COVID-19 induces a hypercoagulable state which can result in intracardiac thrombosis. Therefore, TTE is indicated in all COVID-19 patients for early diagnosis, and prompt anticoagulant therapy is to be considered as a thromboprophylaxis strategy.","Calvi, Emiliano; Bernardi, Nicola; Cimino, Giuliana; Pascariello, Greta; Faggiano, Pompilio; Gavazzi, Emanuele; Vizzardi, Enrico; Metra, Marco",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192222/,474
625720,"COVID-19 and dengue, co-epidemics in Ecuador and other countries in Latin America: Pushing strained health care systems over the edge",2020-04-05,"Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions (FORL), previously known as `neck lesions,' are commonly known in domestic, but also in non-domestic cats. They are characterized by odontoclastic resorptive processes, which take place at the dental root and at the periodontium. Chronic inflammation of gingiva and periodontium is believed to be an important etiological factor in the development of FORL. In this context, various feline viruses have been discussed to play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of these lesions. The aim of this project was to determine in a blinded study the incidence of FORL in 10 cats which were infected for several years with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), but were otherwise free of feline viral infections (feline leukemia virus, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, feline syncytium-forming virus). Nine age-matched controls were kept under identical conditions, but free of FIV. Subgingival resorptive lesions were found in six of 10 FIV-positive cats, but in three of nine controls only. FIV-positive cats had significantly more often gingivae with an increased tendency for bleeding upon probing than FIV-negative cats (p=0.0055), and they had slightly more often hyperplastic gingivae (p=0.0867). In conclusion, signs characteristic of FORL such as subgingival lesions, granulomatous or hyperplastic gingivae with a tendency for bleeding, were found significantly more often in FIV-positive cats than in the controls (p=0.0198). Therefore, it was concluded that FIV infection is an important factor for the occurrence of FORL, possibly through immune suppression or changes of the (sub)gingival micro-environment. However, non-infected control cats also showed some evidence of FORL in the absence of all tested viral infections. Therefore, factors other than viral infections must also play a role in the development of FORL in cats.","Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Berger, Marianne; Sigrist, Brigitte; Schawalder, Peter; Lutz, Hans",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242798001639; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242798001639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9839881/,474
626753,What are the factors influencing the COVID-19 outbreak in Latin America?,2020-04-11,"Using mobile applications in science education has proven to be effective as it adds multiple benefits including learning gains, motivation to learn, and collaborative learning. However, some teachers are reluctant to use this technology for reasons derived from different factors. Hence, it is important to identify what factors affect teachers’ intentions to use mobile applications, in order to take actions aiming to encourage them to use this technology in their classes. Accordingly, this study proposes a model to predict science teachers’ intentions to use mobile applications in the teaching process. Our model merges the Technology Acceptance Model, the Flow Theory, and the Theory of Planned Behavior. It includes 11 hypotheses that were tested with 1203 pre-service and in-service science teachers from different cities in Turkey. Additionally, the study investigates the mediating role of attitude and perceived usefulness on teachers’ intentions to use mobile apps. Further, it examines the moderating role of the sample type on teachers’ behavioral intentions. The results indicate that all 11 hypotheses were significant to explain teachers’ intentions to use mobile applications. Finally, the study raises theoretical and practical implications to guide stakeholders to undertake actions to enrich educational settings through the use of mobile applications.","Ateş, Hüseyin; Garzón, Juan",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10671-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462627/,474

Because it is considered an immunosuppressant, continuation of ibrutinib is often debated when patients have an active infection, and this becomes an especially difficult decision in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Here, we describe a patient with CLL who was on ibrutinib then developed severe COVID‐19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation. We elected to continue ibrutinib the same day he was intubated, reasoning that BTK inhibition in myeloid immune cells has been shown to reduce or even reverse influenza‐mediated acute lung injury and that ITK inhibition in T cells has correlated with reduction in viral replication, and therefore may have an advantage in this setting. Ibrutinib also has been shown to block Src family kinases, which potentially could result in reduction of viral entry and the inflammatory cytokine response in the lungs. The patient was extubated after 9 days with a complex hospital course and eventually discharged on room air. The only way to rationally inform these decisions and explore similar potentially promising leads in this pandemic is to conduct carefully done clinical trials.","Lin, Adam Yuh; Cuttica, Michael J.; Ison, Michael G.; Gordon, Leo I.",EJHaem,https://doi.org/10.1002/jha2.98; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043320/,474

The provision of electricity to off-grid communities is therefore a long-standing developmental goal. Yet, many off-grid electrification projects neglect mid- and long-term operation and maintenance costs. When this is the case, electricity services are unlikely to be affordable to the communities that are the project’s primary target. Here we show that, compared with diesel-powered electricity generation systems, solar photovoltaic systems are more affordable to no less than 36% of the unelectrified populations in East Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. We do so by developing geo-referenced estimates of affordability at a high level of resolution (1 km(2)).

As a highly valued product, it has its own regulations based on the ISO 3518 standard, which clearly informs producers, distributors, and consumers of the requirements to be met. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of products called sandalwood oil based on the information provided by the manufacturer of the oils on Polish, German, and English websites. METHODS: A Google search was utilized to collect data on sandalwood oil offered by producers and distributors in Polish and foreign markets. Information from 50 websites in each of the aforementioned languages, including the description of sandalwood oil properties on websites, method for using it, safety limitations, and presence of a product description consistent with the INCI recommendations, was gathered using Microsoft Excel software and was analyzed. The information that enabled us to estimate the quality of the oils was the botanical name of the oil-bearing plant and the price. Good-quality oils were considered to be oils with the botanical name Santalum album in the description and with a price not considerably less than the price of white sandalwood oils sold by reliable distributors who control the quality of the oils by chromatography. Ultimately, the lower price limit for one milliliter of the oil was established as PLN 21. Results and Conclusions. Good-quality sandalwood oils derived from the Santalum album plant at a price equal to or greater than the chromatographically tested items amounted to a negligible percentage of products sold online. Without knowing the botanical name of the essential oil plant and the price range of unadulterated sandalwood oil, the likelihood of buying a reliable product is low on all of the analyzed websites, with the lowest probability being observed on the Polish websites.","Hartman-Petrycka, Magdalena; Lebiedowska, Agata",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335846/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9934143,474

Virus-containing aerosols may intrude into an uncontaminated area from a confined source space under certain ventilated conditions. The penetration factor, which is the most direct parameter for evaluating the invasion process, can effectively reflect the penetration fraction of aerosols and the shielding efficiency of buildings. Based on the observed concentrations of aerosols combined with a widely used concentration model, four numerical calculations of the penetration factor are proposed in this study. A theoretical time-correction P est was applied to a size-dependent P avg by proposing a correction coefficient r, and the error analysis of the real-time P(t) and the derived P d were also performed. The results indicated that P avg supplied the most stable values for laboratory penetration simulations. However, the time-correction is of little significance under current experimental conditions. P(t) and P d are suitable for rough evaluation under certain conditions due to the inevitability of particles detaching and re-entering after capture. The proposed optimal penetration factor and the error analysis of each method in this study can provide insight into the penetration mechanism, and also provide a rapid and accurate assessment method for preventing and controlling the spread of the epidemic.","Wang, Wenlu; Yoneda, Minoru",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140113; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720336342; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720336342?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32559547/,474

We hypothesize that vulnerable populations have disproportionately lost access to care in pediatric ophthalmology during the pandemic. Methods: We examined patient demographics for visits in the pediatric ophthalmology department from 3/18/19-5/31/19 (pre-COVID period) and from 3/16/20 to 5/31/20 (COVID period). We used Pearson’s χ2 tests to compare proportions of overall and telehealth visits by our demographics of interest, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. Results: During the pre-COVID period, 9793 visits occurred with 0.3% (27/9793) of visits conducted virtually. In the COVID period, 4240 visits occurred with 69.3% (2939/4240) of visits conducted virtually. Interpreters were listed as needed at 9.6% (945/9793) of pre-COVID period visits, compared to 7.1% (299/4240) of COVID period visits (P < 0.001).

This work analyzes mRNA expression data from SARS infections through meta-analysis of gene signatures, possibly identifying therapeutic targets associated with major SARS infections. Methods This work defines 37 gene signatures representing SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections in human lung cultures and/or mouse lung cultures or samples and compares them through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). To do this, positive and negative infectious clone SARS (icSARS) gene panels are defined from GSEA-identified leading-edge genes between two icSARS-CoV derived signatures, both from human cultures. GSEA then is used to assess enrichment and identify leading-edge icSARS panel genes between icSARS gene panels and 27 other SARS-CoV gene signatures. The meta-analysis is expanded to include five MERS-CoV and three SARS-CoV2 gene signatures. Genes associated with SARS infection are predicted by examining the intersecting membership of GSEA-identified leading-edges across gene signatures. Results Significant enrichment (GSEA p<0.001) is observed between two icSARS-CoV derived signatures, and those leading-edge genes defined the positive (233 genes) and negative (114 genes) icSARS panels. Non-random significant enrichment (null distribution p<0.001) is observed between icSARS panels and all verification icSARSvsmock signatures derived from human cultures, from which 51 over- and 22 under-expressed genes are shared across leading-edges with 10 over-expressed genes already associated with icSARS infection. For the icSARSvsmock mouse signature, significant, non-random significant enrichment held for only the positive icSARS panel, from which nine genes are shared with icSARS infection in human cultures. Considering other SARS strains, significant, non-random enrichment (p<0.05) is observed across signatures derived from other SARS strains for the positive icSARS panel. Five positive icSARS panel genes, CXCL10, OAS3, OASL, IFIT3, and XAF1, are found across mice and human signatures regardless of SARS strains. Conclusion The GSEA-based meta-analysis approach used here identifies genes with and without reported associations with SARS-CoV infections, highlighting this approach’s predictability and usefulness in identifying genes that have potential as therapeutic targets to preclude or overcome SARS infections.","Park, Amber; Harris, Laura K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.14.382697,474

How these profound changes have affected sexuality, contraception and voluntary terminations of pregnancy is still largely undescribed. The main objective of this study was therefore to find out whether the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown affected the demand for legal abortion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study period was divided into three phases: the pre-pandemic (January and February 2020); lockdown (March and April); and post-lockdown (May and June). The number and characteristics of women requesting pregnancy termination each month during that time were compared with the stats for the same months in the preceding three years (2017-2019). RESULTS: Immediately after national lockdown, the number of voluntary abortions markedly declined (-40.45%). The effect was more evident in women below 20 years of age (-66.67%), employed versus unemployed women (-42.71% vs. -21.05), and non-Italian versus Italian citizens (-53.01 vs. -32.85). No difference was found in the mean time from request to execution of the procedure, or in the type of the procedure used. CONCLUSION(S): National lockdown reduced the number of unwanted pregnancies, especially in younger women. The Italian health service's response to the demand appears to have been unaffected by the pandemic. However, as the demand for abortion is still high, probably due to unplanned pregnancies among cohabitants within a stable relationship, contraception guidance should be improved among women traditionally deemed low-risk in terms of sexual behaviour.","Guzzetti, Sara; Massarotti, Claudia; Gazzo, Rossella; Paolucci, Roberta; Vallerino, Gabriele; Sirito, Rodolfo; Anserini, Paola; Cagnacci, Angelo",Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,https://doi.org/10.1080/13625187.2021.1957092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342528/,474

However, the multifaceted nature of AMR often complicates the development and implementation of comprehensive policies. In this study, we describe the policy context and explore experts’ perspectives on the challenges, facilitators, and strategies for combating AMR in Singapore. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 participants. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed thematically, adopting an interpretative approach. Participants reported that the Ministry of Health (MOH) has effectively funded AMR control programs and research in all public hospitals. In addition, a preexisting One Health platform, among MOH, Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (restructured to form the Singapore Food Agency and the Animal & Veterinary Service under NParks in April 2019), National Environment Agency, and Singapore’s National Water Agency, was perceived to have facilitated the coordination and formulation of Singapore’s AMR strategies. Nonetheless, participants highlighted that the success of AMR strategies is compounded by various challenges such as surveillance in private clinics, resource constraints at community-level health facilities, sub-optimal public awareness, patchy regulation on antimicrobial use in animals, and environmental contamination. This study shows that the process of planning and executing AMR policies is complicated even in a well-resourced country such as Singapore. It has also highlighted the increasing need to address the social, political, cultural, and behavioral aspects influencing AMR. Ultimately, it will be difficult to design policy interventions that cater for the needs of individuals, families, and the community, unless we understand how all these aspects interact and shape the AMR response.","Singh, Shweta Rajkumar; Chua, Alvin Qijia; Tan, Sok Teng; Tam, Clarence C.; Hsu, Li Yang; Legido-Quigley, Helena",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics8040201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671826/,474
643020,COVID-19 outcomes in patients with hematologic disease,2020-05-06,"OBJECTIVES: Tocilizumab has been proposed as a candidate therapy for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially among those with higher systemic inflammation. Here, we investigate the association between tocilizumab use and mortality in a large cohort of hospitalized patients. METHODS: Cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain. The primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit admission (ICU) or death. We used inverse-probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time-varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between tocilizumab use and the outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1,229 patients were analyzed, with 261 patients (61 deaths) in the tocilizumab group and 969 patients (120 deaths) in the control group. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between tocilizumab use and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16–0.72, p=0.005) and ICU admission or death (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19–0.81, p=0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg/L, but not among those with CRP ≤150 mg/L. Exploratory subgroup analyses yielded point estimates that were consistent with these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In this large observational study, tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of death or ICU or death in patients with higher CRP levels. While the results of ongoing clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 will be important to establish its safety and efficacy, our findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials.","Martínez-Sanz, Javier; Muriel, Alfonso; Ron, Raquel; Herrera, Sabina; Pérez-Molina, José A.; Moreno, Santiago; Serrano-Villar, Sergio",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20305735?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20305735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32979572/,474
643069,Potential repurposing of Favipiravir in COVID-19 outbreak based on current evidence,2020-04-28,"The current synthesis of the ‘hygiene hypothesis’ suggests that the recent increase in chronic inflammatory disorders is at least partly attributable to immunodysregulation resulting from lack of exposure to microorganisms that have evolved an essential role in the establishment of the immune system. This document provides a background for discussion of the following propositions. 1. The essential role of these organisms is an example of ‘evolved dependence’. 2. The most relevant organisms are those that co-evolved with mammals, and already accompanied early hominids in the Paleolithic. 3. More recently evolved ‘childhood infections’ are not likely to have evolved this role, and recent epidemiology supports this contention. 4. This mechanism is interacting with other modern environmental changes that also lead to enhanced inflammatory responses [inappropriate diet, obesity, psychological stress, vitamin D deficiency, pollution (dioxins), etc.]. 5. The range of chronic inflammatory disorders that is affected is potentially larger than usually assumed [allergies, autoimmunity, inflammatory bowel disease, but also vascular disease, some cancers, depression/anxiety (when accompanied by raised inflammatory cytokines), and perhaps neurodegenerative disorders and type 2 diabetes].","Rook, G A W",Clin Exp Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04133.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20415854/,474

The aim of this study was to investigate the respiratory viruses in children admitted to a university hospital with acute respiratory tract infection during the last 8 years by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A total of 3162 respiratory samples collected from children between April 2011 and April 2018 tested by a multiplex real‐time PCR assay. Two different commercial assays were used during the study period, ""AusDiagnostics/Respiratory Pathogens 12 (AusDiagnostics)"" used between April 2011 and December 2015, which changed to ""Fast Track Diagnostics/Respiratory Pathogens 21 (Fast Track Diagnostics)"" after January 2016 to cover more viruses. Nucleic acid extraction was done by EZ1 Advanced XL platform (QIAGEN). Respiratory pathogens detected in 1857 of the 3162 (58.7%) samples. The most prevalent viruses during the 8‐year period were rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV; 36.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 19%), and influenza virus A/B (14.7%). Rhinovirus was the main contributor to the RV/EV group as shown by the assay used during the 2016‐2018 period. RV/EV and adenoviruses detected throughout the year. Influenza virus was most frequently detected during January to March when both RSV and metapneumovirus were also in circulation. The coinfection percentage was 10.2%. Rhinovirus was the most common virus in coinfections while RSV plus rhinovirus/enterovirus were the most frequent combination. RSV and metapneumovirus showed a similar seasonal distribution to the influenza virus, which made it necessary to use a virological diagnostic assay during the influenza season.","Appak, Özgür; Duman, Murat; Belet, Nurşen; Sayiner, Ayça Arzu",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30570759/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25379,474

This study explored the concurrent and convergent validity of the C3t as a simple, objective assessment of impairment that is reflective of disease severity in Huntington’s, that is not reliant on clinical expertise for administration. METHODS: One-hundred-and-five participants presenting with pre-manifest (n = 16) or manifest (TFC-Stage-1 n = 39; TFC-Stage-2 n = 43; TFC-Stage-3 n = 7) Huntington’s disease completed the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale and the C3t at baseline. Of these, thirty-three were followed up after 12 months. Regression was used to estimate baseline individual and composite clinical scores (including cognitive, motor, and functional ability) using baseline C3t scores. Correlations between C3t and clinical scores were assessed using Spearman’s R and visually inspected in relation to disease severity using scatterplots. Effect size over 12 months provided an indication of longitudinal behaviour of the C3t in relation to clinical measures. RESULTS: Baseline C3t scores predicted baseline clinical scores to within 9–13% accuracy, being associated with individual and composite clinical scores. Changes in C3t scores over 12 months were small ([Formula: see text] ≤ 0.15) and mirrored the change in clinical scores. CONCLUSION: The C3t demonstrates promise as a simple, easy to administer, objective outcome measure capable of predicting impairment that is reflective of Huntington’s disease severity and offers a viable solution to support remote clinical monitoring. It may also offer utility as a screening tool for recruitment to clinical trials given preliminary indications of association with the prognostic index normed for Huntington’s disease.

Raised sNfL levels have been reported in adults infected with pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Levels in children infected with COVID-19 have not as yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether sNfL is elevated in children contracting COVID-19. METHODS: Between May 22 and July 22, 2020, a network of outpatient pediatricians in Bavaria, Germany, the Coronavirus antibody screening in children from Bavaria study network (CoKiBa), recruited healthy children into a cross-sectional study from two sources: an ongoing prevention program for 1–14 years, and referrals of 1–17 years consulting a pediatrician for possible infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We determined sNfL levels by single molecule array immunoassay and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status by two independent quantitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 2652 included children, 148 (5.6%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 infection. Neurological symptoms—headache, dizziness, muscle aches, or loss of smell and taste—were present in 47/148 cases (31.8%). Mean sNfL levels were 5.5 pg/ml (SD 2.9) in the total cohort, 5.1 (SD 2.1) pg/ml in the children with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 5.5 (SD 3.0) pg/ml in those without. Multivariate regression analysis revealed age—but neither antibody status, antibody levels, nor clinical severity—as an independent predictor of sNfL. Follow-up of children with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (n = 14) showed no association with sNfL. CONCLUSIONS: In this population study, children with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 showed no neurochemical evidence of neuronal damage.","Geis, Tobias; Brandstetter, Susanne; Toncheva, Antoaneta A.; Laub, Otto; Leipold, Georg; Wagner, Ralf; Kabesch, Michael; Kasser, Severin; Kuhle, Jens; Wellmann, Sven",J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10554-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893540/,474

METHODS: The flow field was visualized using three protective device settings (an aerosol box, and an aerosol bag with and without sealed working channels) and four suction settings (no suction, wall suction, and a HEPA filter evacuator at flow rates of 415 liters per minute [LPM] and 530 LPM). All 12 subgroups were compared with a no intervention group. The primary outcome, aerosol concentration, was measured at the head, trunk, and foot of a mannequin. RESULTS: The mean aerosol concentration was reduced at the head (p < 0.001) but increased at the feet (p = 0.005) with an aerosol box compared with no intervention. Non-sealed aerosol bags increased exposure at the head and trunk (both, p < 0.001). Sealed aerosol bags reduced aerosol concentration at the head, trunk, and foot of the mannequin (p < 0.001). A sealed aerosol bag alone, with wall suction, or with a HEPA filter evacuator reduced the aerosol concentration at the head by 7.15%, 36.61%, and 84.70%, respectively (99.9% confidence interval [CI]: -4.51–18.81, 27.48–45.73, and 78.99–90.40); trunk by 70.95%, 73.99%, and 91.59%, respectively (99.9% CI: 59.83–82.07, 52.64–95.33, and 87.51–95.66); and feet by 69.16%, 75.57%, and 92.30%, respectively (99.9% CI: 63.18–75.15, 69.76–81.37, and 88.18–96.42), compared with an aerosol box alone.

This study aimed to assess the effects of liver injuries on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1520 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, were enrolled. Chronic liver disease (CLD) was confirmed by consensus diagnostic criteria. Laboratory test results were compared between different groups. scRNA-seq data and bulk gene expression profiles were used to identify cell types associated with liver injury. RESULTS: A total of 10.98% of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 developed liver injury after admission that was associated with significantly higher rates of mortality (21.74%, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit admission (26.71%, p < 0.001). Pre-existing CLDs were not associated with a higher risk. However, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis were associated with higher risks, supported by evidences from single cell and bulk transcriptome analysis that showed more TMPRSS2(+) cells in these tissues. By generating a model, we were able to predict the risk and severity of liver injury during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that liver injury occurring during therapy as well as pre-existing CLDs like fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with the severity of disease and mortality, but the presence of other CLD is not associated. We provide a risk-score model that can predict whether patients with COVID-19 will develop liver injury or proceed to higher-risk stages during subsequent hospitalizations.

The analysis focuses on the number of daily new COVID-19 cases per ten thousand people during a period covering at least 250 days after the confirmation of the tenth case. Dynamic analysis is performed by constructing Minimal Spanning Trees (MST) and identifying groups of similarity in contagions evolution in 95 time windows of a 150-day amplitude that moves one day at a time. The number of times countries belonged to a similar performance group in constructed time windows was the intensity measure considered. Groups' composition is not stable, indicating that the COVID-19 evolution needs to be treated as a dynamic problem in the context of complex systems. Three communities were identified by applying the Louvain algorithm. Identified communities analysis according to each country's socioeconomic characteristics and variables related to the disease sheds light on whether there is any suggested course of action. Even when strong testing and tracing cases policies may be related with a more stable dynamic of the disease, results indicate that communities are conformed by countries with diverse characteristics. The best option to counteract the harmful effects of a pandemic may be having strong health systems in place,with contingent capacity to deal with unforeseen events and available resources capable of a rapid expansion of its capacity.","Alvarez, E.; Brida, J.

OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the existing evidence of the prevalence of mental health status during the epidemic and provide the basis for mental health education. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature search was conducted in nine databases from December 2019 to October 2020. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, and the random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42020208619. RESULTS: About 27 studies were included in the analysis with a total of 706,415 participants combined, and 14 mental health problems were gathered. Meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression was 39% (95% CI: 27–51%) and that of anxiety was 36% (95% CI: 26–46%). Subgroup analysis indicated that the prevalence of depression and anxiety varied among nations and due to the survey date. The prevalence of depression (60%, 95% CI: 46–74%) and anxiety (60%, 95% CI: 46–74%) in non-Chinese college students was higher than those in Chinese college students (26%, 95% CI: 21–30% and 20%, 95% CI: 14–26%). The proportion of depression (54%, 95% CI: 40–67%) and anxiety (37%, 95% CI: 26–48%) was higher after March 1 than before it (21%, 95% CI: 16–25% and 19%, 95% CI: 13–25%). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis results presented that the prevalence of depression (39%) or anxiety (36%) among college students greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the mental health of college students is affected by the nations and the survey date.

Objectives: We conducted an analysis of the changes of inpatient and day patient mental health care utilization in an association of psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We used the statistics database of the association of nine psychiatric hospitals of the Rhineland Regional Council (Landschaftsverband Rheinland, LVR). We compared the case numbers of spring 2019 and spring 2020 and analyzed alterations in the diagnostic spectrum. Finally, we analyzed the age, gender, and diagnoses of patients tested positive for COVID-19. Results: A total of 25,612 inpatient psychiatric hospital admissions were assessed. Case rates decreased by 25% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes varied between diagnostic groups, and there were even increases in case numbers for certain diagnoses. Women and patients of higher ages were overrepresented among psychiatric inpatients with COVID-19. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in considerable reductions in the total number of mental health-care admissions and in changes in the diagnostic spectrum. The results may be explainable by deferrals of elective hospital admissions during the acute phase of the pandemic and by destabilizing effects of the pandemic and social distancing on people with mental disorders.","Zielasek, Jürgen; Vrinssen, Jürgen; Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, Euphrosyne",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.593307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996706/,474

Twenty-eight community pharmacists across Canada performed a telephone consultation with 643 older adults whose primary care records indicated that they had not received their influenza vaccination from their usual practitioner. Of these 643 adults, 169 (26.3%) had been vaccinated in another setting. Of the remaining 474, 313 (66%) agreed to receive the vaccine. Of those who refused vaccination, 69 provided a rationale for not wanting it, including that the flu shot “causes the flu” (n = 25), “doesn’t work” (n = 25), “is too painful” (n = 10), and other (n = 10). Overall, of the 643 individuals who had not received their vaccination from their usual health care provider in the first wave of vaccinations, 75.4% (n = 485) ultimately received their vaccination in the 2019–2020 season.

The available data shows that those who are black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) bear the brunt of this risk; however, missing data on race/ethnicity from federal, state, and local agencies impedes nuanced understanding of health disparities. In this commentary, we summarize the link between racism and COVID-19 disparities and the extent of missing data on race/ethnicity in critical COVID-19 reporting. In addition, we provide an overview of the current literature on missing demographic data in the US and hypothesize how racism contributes to nonresponse in health reporting broadly.

Recent studies suggest that RIPK1 inhibition would fundamentally improve the therapy of RIPK1-dependent organ damage in stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Additionally, it could ameliorate or prevent multi-organ failure induced by cytokine release in the context of hyperinflammation, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we searched for a RIPK1 inhibitor and present the aromatic antiepileptic and FDA-approved drug primidone (Liskantin®) as a potent inhibitor of RIPK1 activation in vitro and in a murine model of TNFα-induced shock, which mimics the hyperinflammatory state of cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we detected for the first time RIPK1 activation in the respiratory tract epithelium of hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the performance of skin testing and basophil activation testing to PEG, polysorbate 80, and the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines in patients with a history of PEG allergy. METHODS: Three known individuals with PEG allergy and 3 healthy controls were recruited and evaluated for hypersensitivity to the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines, and to related compounds by skin testing and basophil activation, as measured by CD63 upregulation using flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine induced positive skin test results in patients with PEG allergy, whereas the result of traditional PEG skin testing was negative in 2 of 3 patients. One patient was found to be cosensitized to both the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines because of cross-reactive PEG and polysorbate allergy. The BNT162b2 vaccine, but not PEG alone, induced dose-dependent activation of all patients' basophils ex vivo. Similar basophil activation could be induced by PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin, suggesting that PEGylated lipids within nanoparticles, but not PEG in its native state, are able to efficiently induce degranulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate PEG, as covalently modified and arranged on the vaccine lipid nanoparticle, as a potential trigger of anaphylaxis in response to BNT162b2, and highlight shortcomings of current skin testing protocols for allergy to PEGylated liposomal drugs.","Troelnikov, Alexander; Perkins, Griffith; Yuson, Chino; Ahamdie, Aida; Balouch, Summaya; Hurtado, Plinio R; Hissaria, Pravin",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.04.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991580/,474
666671,Serologic Aspects of COVID-19: recommendations for use in the clinical setting,2021-03-31,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent disease with a progression that is modulated by the immune system. Systemic therapy is used in the advanced stage and until 2017 consisted only of antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has shown strong anti-tumour activity in a subset of patients and the combination of the anti-PDL1 antibody atezolizumab and the VEGF-neutralizing antibody bevacizumab has or will soon become the standard of care as a first-line therapy for HCC, whereas the anti-PD1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab are used after TKIs in several regions. Other immune strategies such as adoptive T-cell transfer, vaccination or virotherapy have not yet demonstrated consistent clinical activity. Major unmet challenges in HCC checkpoint immunotherapy are the discovery and validation of predictive biomarkers, advancing treatment to earlier stages of the disease, applying the treatment to patients with liver dysfunction and the discovery of more effective combinatorial or sequential approaches. Combinations with other systemic or local treatments are perceived as the most promising opportunities in HCC and some are already under evaluation in large-scale clinical trials. This Review provides up-to-date information on the best use of currently available immunotherapies in HCC and the therapeutic strategies under development.","Sangro, Bruno; Sarobe, Pablo; Hervás-Stubbs, Sandra; Melero, Ignacio",Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00438-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850328/,474
666812,Household infection: The predominant risk factor for close contacts of patients with COVID-19,2020-06-24,"Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous phenomena that recur daily in a self-sustaining, entrainable, and oscillatory manner, and orchestrate a wide range of molecular, physiological, and behavioral processes. Circadian clocks are comprised of a hierarchical network of central and peripheral clocks that generate, sustain, and synchronize the circadian rhythms. The functioning of the peripheral clock is regulated by signals from autonomic innervation (from the central clock), endocrine networks, feeding, and other external cues. The critical role played by circadian rhythms in maintaining both systemic and tissue-level homeostasis is well established, and disruption of the rhythm has direct consequence for human health, disorders, and diseases. Circadian oscillations in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic processes are known to affect efficacy and toxicity of several therapeutic agents. A variety of modeling approaches ranging from empirical to more complex systems modeling approaches have been applied to characterize circadian biology and its influence on drug actions, optimize time of dosing, and identify opportunities for pharmacological modulation of the clock mechanisms and their downstream effects. In this review, we summarize current understanding of circadian rhythms and its influence on physiology, pharmacology, and therapeutic interventions, and discuss the role of chronopharmacometrics in gaining new insights into circadian rhythms and its applications in chronopharmacology.","Ayyar, Vivaswath S.; Sukumaran, Siddharth",J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-021-09751-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797011/,474

This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the efficacy of a stepping exergame program on gait speed, balance, mobility, reaction time, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes, quality of life, and daily life functioning in people with MNCD residing in long-term care facilities. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks, three times weekly, 15 min of exergaming versus watching preferred music videos. The exergame device consisted of a pressure-sensitive step training platform on which participants performed stepping movements to play the games. The device automatically adapted the training level to the participants’ capabilities. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), step reaction time test (SRTT), Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Dementia Quality of Life (DQoL), and Katz Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. A Quade’s non-parametric ANCOVA controlling for baseline values with post hoc Bonferroni correction (p < 0.00625) was used to analyze pre- and post-differences between the groups. Partial eta-squared (η(2)p) effect sizes were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-five of 55 randomized inpatients with mild to moderate MNCD (Mini-Mental State Examination score = 17.2 ± 4.5; aged 70–91; 35 women) completed the study. The exergame group (n = 23) demonstrated improvements in gait speed (p < 0.001, η(2)(p) = 0.41), total SPPB (p < 0.001, η(2)(p) = 0.64), SRTT (p<0.001, η(2)(p) = 0.51), MoCA (p<0.001, η(2)(p) = 0.38), and reductions in CSDD (p<0.001, η(2)(p) = 0.43) compared to the control group (n = 22). There were no differences in NPI (p = 0.165, η(2)(p) = 0.05), DQoL (p = 0.012, η(2)(p) = 0.16), and ADL (p = 0.008, η(2)(p) = 0.16) post-intervention scores between the experimental and control group, albeit DQol and ADL measures showed large effect sizes in the exergame group. The mean attendance rate was 82.9% in the exergame group and 73.7% in the music control group. There were no study-related adverse events reported by the participants, nor observed by the research team. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot RCT suggest that an individually adapted exergame training improves lower extremity functioning, cognitive functioning and step reaction time and symptoms of depression in inpatients with MNCD residing in long-term care facilities.

However, little is known about whether users have experienced increased daily fatigue as a result of the disruptions caused by pandemic. Drawing on the cognitive activation theory of stress (CATS), this study proposed that two typical characteristics of social media platforms (SMP), information quality and media richness, are associated with event disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic (EDC), and then induce social media fatigue. To address this, this study used the experience sampling method (ESM), collecting 550 matched cases from 110 users of the WeChat application in mainland China over five consecutive days. Through multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM), this study discovered three main findings: (1) daily information quality is negatively related to event disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn decreases daily social media fatigue; (2) daily media richness is positively associated with such event disruptions, which ultimately increases daily social media fatigue; (3) these effects were stronger for users who reported higher (vs. lower) levels of health consciousness.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the functional virus host cell receptor expressed by organs and tissues, seems to have an important role in the pathophysiology and presentation of this disease. In pancreas, this receptor is expressed in both exocrine glands and islets, being a potential target for the virus and subsequent pancreatic injury. There are few articles reporting pancreatic injury in COVID-19 patients but most of them do not report acute pancreatitis. Diagnosing acute pancreatitis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the need to rule out other etiologies as well the notable heterogeneous presentations.

This study reports the first molecular detection of BCoV in a diarrhea outbreak in dairy cows in the Central Region, Thailand. BCoV was molecularly detected from bloody diarrheic cattle feces by using nested PCR. Agarose gel electrophoresis of three diarrheic fecal samples yielded from the 25 samples desired amplicons that were 488 base pairs and sequencing substantiated that have BCoV. The sequence alignment indicated that nucleotide and amino acid sequences, the three TWD isolated in Thailand, were more quite homologous to each other (amino acid at position 39 of TWD1, TWD3 was proline, but TWD2 was serine) and closely related to OK-0514-3strain (virulent respiratory strain; RBCoV).The amino acid sequencing identities among TWD1, TWD2,TWD3, and OK-0514-3 strain were 96.0 to 96.6%, those at which T3I, H65N, D87G, H127Y, andQ136R were changed.

Main suspect: vascular endothelium”,2021-06-07,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of disease-modifying agents on disease progression in Parkinson’s disease is largely assessed in clinical trials using clinical rating scales. These scales have drawbacks in terms of their ability to capture the fluctuating nature of symptoms while living in a naturalistic environment. The SPHERE (Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in a Residential Environment) project has designed a multi-sensor platform with multimodal devices designed to allow continuous, relatively inexpensive, unobtrusive sensing of motor, non-motor and activities of daily living metrics in a home or a home-like environment. The aim of this study is to evaluate how the SPHERE technology can measure aspects of Parkinson’s disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a small-scale feasibility and acceptability study during which 12 pairs of participants (comprising a person with Parkinson’s and a healthy control participant) will stay and live freely for 5 days in a home-like environment embedded with SPHERE technology including environmental, appliance monitoring, wrist-worn accelerometry and camera sensors. These data will be collected alongside clinical rating scales, participant diary entries and expert clinician annotations of colour video images. Machine learning will be used to look for a signal to discriminate between Parkinson’s disease and control, and between Parkinson’s disease symptoms ‘on’ and ‘off’ medications. Additional outcome measures including bradykinesia, activity level, sleep parameters and some activities of daily living will be explored. Acceptability of the technology will be evaluated qualitatively using semi-structured interviews.

In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. RESULTS: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. DISCUSSION: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Pan, Lei; Mu, Mi; Yang, Pengcheng; Sun, Yu; Wang, Runsheng; Yan, Junhong; Li, Pibao; Hu, Baoguang; Wang, Jing; Hu, Chao; Jin, Yuan; Niu, Xun; Ping, Rongyu; Du, Yingzhen; Li, Tianzhi; Xu, Guogang; Hu, Qinyong; Tu, Lei",Am J Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287140/,474

METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had a hospital encounter within the Mount Sinai Health System (New York City) between 27 February 2020 and 15 October 2020 were evaluated for inclusion. Troponin levels assessed between 72 h before and 48 h after the COVID-19 diagnosis were used to stratify the study population by the presence of acute and chronic myocardial injury, as defined by the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Among 4695 patients, those with chronic myocardial injury (n = 319, 6.8%) had more comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease and heart failure, while acute myocardial injury (n = 1168, 24.9%) was more associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers. Both types of myocardial injury were strongly associated with impaired survival at 6 months [chronic: hazard ratio (HR) 4.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.44-5.06; acute: HR 4.72, 95% CI 4.14-5.36], even after excluding events occurring in the first 30 days (chronic: HR 3.97, 95% CI 2.15-7.33; acute: HR 4.13, 95% CI 2.75-6.21). The mortality risk was not significantly different in patients with acute as compared with chronic myocardial injury (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.94-1.36), except for a worse prognostic impact of acute myocardial injury in patients <65 years of age (P-interaction = 0.043) and in those without coronary artery disease (P-interaction = 0.041). CONCLUSION Chronic and acute myocardial injury represent two distinctive patterns of cardiac involvement among COVID-19 patients.

Aberrant neuroimmune activation is associated with dysregulation of memory and emotion, though the precise mechanisms at play are complex and highly context dependent. Sex differences in neuroimmune activation and function further complicate our understanding of its roles in cognitive and affective regulation. METHODS: Here, we characterized the physiological sickness and inflammatory response of the hippocampus following intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of a synthetic viral mimic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), in both male and female C57Bl/6N mice. RESULTS: We observed that poly I:C induced weight loss, fever, and elevations of cytokine and chemokines in the hippocampus of both sexes. Specifically, we found transient increases in gene expression and protein levels of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, TNFα, CCL2, and CXCL10, where males showed a greater magnitude of response compared with females. Only males showed increased IFNα and IFNγ in response to poly I:C, whereas both males and females exhibited elevations of IFNβ, demonstrating a specific sex difference in the anti-viral response in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that type I interferons are one potential node mediating sex-specific cytokine responses and neuroimmune effects on cognition. Together, these findings highlight the importance of using both males and females and analyzing a broad set of inflammatory markers in order to identify the precise, sex-specific roles for neuroimmune dysregulation in neurological diseases and disorders.","Posillico, Caitlin K.; Garcia-Hernandez, Rosa E.; Tronson, Natalie C.",J Neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-021-02235-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34488804/,474
