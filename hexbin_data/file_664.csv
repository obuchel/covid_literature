2957,"Rhinovirus Biology, Antigenic Diversity, and Advancements in the Design of a Human Rhinovirus Vaccine",2017-12-05,"Human rhinovirus (HRV) remains a leading cause of several human diseases including the common cold. Despite considerable research over the last 60 years, development of an effective vaccine to HRV has been viewed by many as unfeasible due, in part, to the antigenic diversity of circulating HRVs in nature. Over 150 antigenically distinct types of HRV are currently known which span three species: HRV A, HRV B, and HRV C. Early attempts to develop a rhinovirus vaccine have shown that inactivated HRV is capable of serving as a strong immunogen and inducing neutralizing antibodies. Yet, limitations to virus preparation and recovery, continued identification of antigenic variants of HRV, and logistical challenges pertaining to preparing a polyvalent preparation of the magnitude required for true efficacy against circulating rhinoviruses continue to prove a daunting challenge. In this review, we describe HRV biology, antigenic diversity, and past and present advances in HRV vaccine design.","Stobart, Christopher C.; Nosek, Jenna M.; Moore, Martin L.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5723287/,664

14225,Natural Inspired Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) Doped with Ammonium Carbonate (AC) as Biopolymer Electrolyte,2020-10-26,"Porcine teschovirus (PTV) is an OIE-listed pathogen with 13 known PTV serotypes. Heterologous PTV serotypes frequently co-circulate and co-infect with another swine pathogen, causing various symptoms in all age groups, thus highlighting the need for a pan-PTV diagnostic tool. Here, a recombinant protein composed of a highly conserved “RNNQIPQDF” epitope on the GH loop of VP1, predicted in silico, and a tandem repeat of this epitope carrying the pan DR (PADRE) and Toxin B epitopes was constructed to serve as a PTV detection tool. This recombinant GST-PADRE-(RNNQIPQDF)(n)-Toxin B protein was used as an immunogen, which effectively raised non-neutralizing or undetectable neutralizing antibodies against PTV in mice. The raised antiserum was reactive against all the PTV serotypes (PTV–1–7) tested, but not against members of the closely related genera Sapelovirus and Cardiovirus, and the unrelated virus controls. This potential pan-PTV diagnostic reagent may be used to differentiate naturally infected animals from vaccinated animals that have antibodies against a subunit vaccine that does not contain this epitope or to screen for PTV before further subtyping. To our knowledge, this is the first report that utilized in silico PTV epitope prediction to find a reagent broadly reactive to various PTV serotypes.","Tsai, Tung-Hsuan; Chang, Chia-Yi; Wang, Fun-In",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693897/,664
14857,Modernizing the Toolkit for Arthropod Bloodmeal Identification,2021-01-06,"The 6 kDa early secreted antigen target (ESAT6) is a low molecular weight and highly immunogenic protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with relevance in the diagnosis of tuberculosis and subunit vaccine development. The gene encoding the ESAT6 protein is located in the M. tuberculosis-specific genomic region known as the region of difference (RD)1. There are 11 M. tuberculosis-specific RDs absent in all of the vaccine strains of BCG, and three of them (RD1, RD7, and RD9) encode immunodominant proteins. Each of these RDs has genes for a pair of ESAT6-like proteins. The immunological characterizations of all the possible proteins encoded by genes in RD1, RD7 and RD9 have shown that, besides ESAT-6 like proteins, several other proteins are major antigens useful for the development of subunit vaccines to substitute or supplement BCG. Furthermore, some of these proteins may replace the purified protein derivative of M. tuberculosis in the specific diagnosis of tuberculosis by using interferon-gamma release assays and/or tuberculin-type skin tests. At least three subunit vaccine candidates containing ESAT6-like proteins as antigen components of multimeric proteins have shown efficacy in phase 1 and phase II clinical trials in humans.","Mustafa, Abu Salim",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7825740/,664

Some types may be more invasive in human tissue than others. Many microbes are free-living in the environment—in water, soil and air and on equipment—as a part of the normal microbial flora on the Earth. Most of them are not dangerous and live in peaceful symbiosis with other living beings and may also be transferred between living species, from man to animal or man to plants and environment—and vice versa. New and old human pathogenic microbes are increasing all over the world. Some agents, like drug-resistant bacteria and highly pathogenic viruses, are more dangerous than others, and some microbes may cause chronic devastating diseases. Transmission routes depend on the robustness of the microbe in the environment, virulence, infectious dose, anatomical site in the body, etc. Pathogenic microbes are spread by contact, air, water, food, beverages, contaminated equipment and environment and are more seldom vector-borne, by insects or animals. The following chapter is focused on the most frequent pathogenic microbes, their preselected localization in the body, transmission routes and survival in the environment.","Andersen, Bjørg Marit",Prevention and Control of Infections in Hospitals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122329/,664

Elle comporte 3 phases : la mise en évidence de dysfonctionnements, la proposition de mesures correctives puis l’évaluation des ajustements induits. L’EPP est difficile sans outil pertinent. Notre objectif est d’illustrer l’intérêt d’un TB pour réaliser une EPP. MATÉRIELS ET MÉTHODES: Notre TB existe depuis Juillet 2005, incluant 24 paramètres dont le diagnostic, l’antibiothérapie et la date d’hospitalisation. Lors de la 1(re) phase d’EPP, le TB a été utilisé pour étudier les modalités thérapeutiques des PAC, révélant une hétérogénéité d’antibiothérapie non justifiée (Med Mal Inf 2008;9:457-64). La 2(e) phase a consisté en l’écriture de notre protocole thérapeutique, visant à réduire les prescriptions de fluoroquinolones (FQ) et de céphalosporines de 3(e) génération (C3G). Nous rapportons ici la 3(e) phase d’EPP, utilisant le TB pour comparer l’application du protocole sur 2 périodes : avant (d’octobre à janvier 2005 et 2006) et après (d’octobre 2008 au 20 février 2009) sa mise en place. L’utilisation de plusieurs lignes thérapeutiques, suggérant l’inadéquation de l’antibiothérapie initiale, a été répertoriée. RÉSULTATS: Les PAC représentaient 178 hospitalisations avant l’application du protocole, et 81 après. Le taux de conformité avec le protocole était respectivement de 101/178 (57 %), et de 52/81 (64 %). Le nombre d’antibiothérapies contenant des FQ et/ou des C3G de manière inadéquate était de 45/178 (25 %) durant la première période, et de 19/81 (23 %) durant la seconde période. Plusieurs lignes thérapeutiques étaient utilisées 28/178 fois (16 %) et 12/81 fois (15 %). La durée d’hospitalisation était respectivement de 9 ± 5 et 8 ± 5 jours, une évolution défavorable étant observée dans 8/178 (5 %) et 1/81 cas (1,2 %). CONCLUSION: Un TB permet l’exécution rapide de 2 des 3 phases de l’EPP. Nos résultats suggèrent une appropriation partielle de notre protocole, la réduction des FQ et des C3G apparaissant sans impact sur la morbi-mortalité.","De Salvador, F.; Pulcini, C.; Cua, E.; Farhad, R.; Bernard, E.; Roger, P.-M.",Med Mal Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131632/,664
32922,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: let the virus be its own demise,2020-05-26,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a central role in modern days technology. From simple thermostat controllers to more advanced autonomous cars, their versatility makes them perfect candidates for many applications, in particular for safety critical ones. Thus, their certification is a key issue and formal methods are good candidates to assess safety and produce associated certificates. Hybrid systems show continuous-time dynamics depending on mode that is required in several stages of the architecture of Cyber-Physical Systems. Our work addresses the problem of formally verifying hybrid systems using refinement and proof with Event-B. Our previous work [14] presented formally verified generic architecture patterns for designing centralised hybrid systems, based on our generic approach [15]. We extend this work and give a formally verified architecture pattern aimed at modelling distributed hybrid systems, featuring multiple plants and multiple controllers. We validate the approach and illustrate the use of the defined pattern on an extension of a very common case study, borrowed from literature.","Dupont, Guillaume; Aït-Ameur, Yamine; Pantel, Marc; Singh, Neeraj K.",Rigorous State-Based Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242035/,664

In addition to the capacity for self-renewal and multipotential differentiation, MSCs also have the following characteristics. MSCs can exert immunomodulatory functions through interaction with innate or adaptive immune cells, MSCs with poor immunogenicity can be used for allogeneic transplantation, and MSCs can ""home"" to inflammation and tumour sites. Based on these biological properties, MSCs demonstrate broad clinical application prospects in the treatment of tissue injury, autoimmune diseases, transplantation, cancer and other inflammation-related diseases. In this review we describe the biological characteristics of MSCs and discuss the research advances of MSCs in regenerative medicine, immunomodulation, oncology, and COVID-19, to fully understand the range of diseases in which MSC therapy may be beneficial.","Lou, Songyue; Duan, Yongtao; Nie, Huizong; Cui, Xujie; Du, Jialing; Yao, Yongfang",Biochimie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2021.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711361/,664

Compliance with these restrictions is vital and depends greatly on the level of trust in the institutions central to their development and implementation. The objectives of this study were to assess: (1) the effects of the Dutch lockdown measures imposed in March 2020 on trust in government and trust in science; and (2) whether these differ across social groups. We draw on unique data from the high-quality Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel, which comprises a true probability sample of Dutch households (average participation rate: 80.4%). Our data were collected on an ongoing basis from December 2017 to March 2020 (n = 2219). Using the implementation of lockdown measures in mid-March as a natural experiment, we employed difference-in-differences analyses to assess the causal effect of the Dutch lockdown measures on trust in government and trust in science. We estimated that the imposition of the measures caused an 18% increase (95% confidence interval (CI):15%-21%)) in trust in government and a 6% increase (95% CI: 4%-8%) in trust in science. The impact on trust in government was greater among the participants aged 65 and older and those with poor self-assessed health, although the relevant CIs were wide and, in the case of self-assessed health, included the null. No differential effects were observed for trust in science. Our study indicates that the strict public-health measures imposed in the Netherlands during an acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic generated trust in the institutions involved in drafting and implementing them, especially among those with a higher risk of serious health outcomes. This suggests that, to prevent a major public-health crisis, people appreciate firm government intervention during the acute phase of an infectious disease pandemic.","Oude Groeniger, Joost; Noordzij, Kjell; van der Waal, Jeroen; de Koster, Willem",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725488/,664

Early reports confirmed the heavy burden of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with mortality rates reaching up to 35%. Because most transplant recipients harbored multiple comorbidities known to be associated with a severe course of COVID-19, the true impact of immunosuppression by itself remained an unsolved issue. Transplant societies have initially recommended to postpone non urgent renal transplantations, while trying to maintain life-saving transplant programs, such as heart, lung and liver transplantations. The pandemic thus resulted in an unprecedented and sudden drop of transplant activity worldwide. Moreover, the best treatment strategy in infected patients was challenging. Both reduction of immunosuppression and use of targeted therapies aiming at counteracting SARS-CoV-2 infection were the two faces of the therapeutic armamentarium. Recent controlled studies have better delineated the basis of mitigating and management strategies to improve patients' outcome. Nevertheless, and given the persistence of circulating virus, evidence-based recommendations in SOT recipients remain unclear. The resumption of transplant activity should be tailored with careful selection of both donors and recipients. Transplant decision should be made on a case-by-case basis after thorough assessment of the risks and benefits.","Zaidan, Mohamad; Legendre, Christophe",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208691/,664
72913,Lymphopenia and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Among Hospitalized Obstetric Patients.,2020-05-19,"Background: England, UK has one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality globally. Until recently, testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus focused mainly on healthcare and care home settings. As such, there is far less understanding of community transmission. Protocol: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) programme is a major programme of home testing for COVID-19 to track progress of the infection in the community. REACT-1 involves cross-sectional surveys of viral detection (virological swab for RT-PCR) tests in repeated samples of 100,000 to 150,000 randomly selected individuals across England. This examines how widely the virus has spread and how many people are currently infected. The age range is 5 years and above. Individuals are sampled from the England NHS patient list. REACT-2 is a series of five sub-studies towards establishing the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in England as an indicator of historical infection. The main study (study 5) uses the same design and sampling approach as REACT-1 using a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG antibodies in repeated samples of 100,000 to 200,000 adults aged 18 years and above. To inform study 5, studies 1-4 evaluate performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 LFIAs (study 1) and different aspects of feasibility, usability and application of LFIAs for home-based testing in different populations (studies 2-4). Ethics and dissemination: The study has ethical approval. Results are reported using STROBE guidelines and disseminated through reports to public health bodies, presentations at scientific meetings and open access publications. Conclusions: This study provides robust estimates of the prevalence of both virus (RT-PCR, REACT-1) and seroprevalence (antibody, REACT-2) in the general population in England. We also explore acceptability and usability of LFIAs for self-administered testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a home-based setting, not done before at such scale in the general population.","Riley, Steven; Atchison, Christina; Ashby, Deborah; Donnelly, Christl A; Barclay, Wendy; Cooke, Graham S; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16228.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997297/,664

77459,Patient Perspectives on Audio-Only Virtual Prenatal Visits Amidst the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pandemic.,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic gastrectomy is a widely accepted procedure for treating early gastric cancers. This procedure is less invasive than conventional open approaches, and the oncologic outcomes are comparable. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery, developed to reduce the invasiveness of traditional laparoscopy, is applied to various abdominal surgical procedures. However, its application to laparoscopic gastrectomy for the treatment of gastric cancer has not been reported, mainly because of difficulties achieving adequate lymphadenectomy and reconstruction. The authors report their initial clinical experience with single-incision laparoscopic gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. METHODS A single vertical 2.5-cm intraumbilical incision was made, and three laparoscopic trocars were placed within the umbilicus. A 2-mm mini-loop retractor was inserted in the left upper and middle abdomen, and a roll of gauze was attached to its tip. This instrument is an atraumatic and useful tool for retracting various organs. Gastric mobilization and adequate dissection of lymph nodes were performed. The stomach and duodenum then were transected intracorporeally using linear staplers. Intracorporeal anastomosis was performed for reconstruction. RESULTS All seven single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomies with lymphadenectomy were performed without the use of additional trocars or conversion to laparotomy. The median time for gastric mobilization with lymphadenectomy was 155 min (range, 130-183 min). The median operative time was 344 min (range, 282-385 min), and the median estimated blood loss was 25 ml (range, 0-100 ml). A median total of 67 lymph nodes were retrieved. No serious perioperative complications occurred, and no mortalities were observed in this case series. CONCLUSIONS The authors' initial experience with single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy showed that it is a feasible and safe procedure for early gastric cancer and gives a favorable cosmetic result. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing successful single-incision laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","Omori, Takeshi; Oyama, Tsukasa; Akamatsu, Hiroki; Tori, Masayuki; Ueshima, Shigeyuki; Nishida, Toshirou",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1563-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21298524/,664

MATERIAL AND METHODS 374 cervical lymph nodes from 67 patients were evaluated. The B-mode ultrasonography and the elastography findings were compared with the final histopathological diagnosis. Radiological variables were used to construct nomogram and clinical utility of the nomogram was cross-validated. RESULTS In univariate analysis, status of the hilum, Long Axis Diameter, Short axis diameter, colour virtual touch imaging grade (VTI) and shear wave velocity were significant in predicting metastasis in the cervical lymph nodes. In multivariable analysis, it was found that predominance of red over yellow area on colour VTI was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. A multiple logistic regression performed to ascertain the effects of on the likelihood that patients had lymph node metastasis on histopathology was statistically significant, χ2(10) = 44.96, p < 0.001. The model was able to correctly classify 93.28% of cases and the concordance index (c-index) was estimated to be 0.8773. A nomogram was thus established to predict metastasis in cervical lymph nodes.

This review aimed to highlight the main findings on significant associations between neuroimaging and NPSs, the pathophysiology to elucidate possible underlying mechanisms, and methodological issues to aid future research. Research papers published from January 1990 to October 2015 were identified in the databases PsycInfo, Embase, PubMed and Medline, using key words related to NPSs and imaging techniques. In addition to a semi-systematic search in the databases, we also performed hand searches based on reported citations identified to be of interest. Delusions, apathy and depression symptoms were particularly associated with brain changes in AD. The majority of studies disclosed an association between frontal lobe structural and/or metabolic changes and NPSs, implicating, interestingly, for all 12 NPSs studied, the anterior cingulate cortex although temporal, subcortical and parietal regions, and insula were also involved. Given the high degree of connectivity of these brain areas, frontal change correlates of NPSs may help in the understanding of neural network participation. This review also highlights crucial methodological issues that may reduce the heterogeneity of results to enable progress on the pathophysiological mechanisms and aid research on NPS treatments in AD. Based on a broad review of the current literature, a global brain pattern to support the huge heterogeneity of neuroimaging correlates of NPSs in AD and methodological strategies are suggested to help direct future research.","Boublay, N; Schott, A M; Krolak-Salmon, P",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.13076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27435186/,664

We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This two-center retrospective study was performed at two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N = 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified. One sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patient without diabetes was randomly selected for each patient with diabetes. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the mortality in these patients. RESULTS Of 1,561 COVID-19 patients, 153 (9.8%) had diabetes, with a median age of 64.0 (interquartile range 56.0-72.0) years. A higher proportion of intensive care unit admission (17.6% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) and more fatal cases (20.3% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.017) were identified in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than in the matched patients. Multivariable Cox regression analyses of these 306 patients showed that hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 2.50, 95% CI 1.30-4.78), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.19-4.23), and chronic pulmonary disease (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.90) were independently associated with in-hospital death. Diabetes (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.99) was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital death after adjustment. Among patients with diabetes, nonsurvivors were older (76.0 vs. 63.0 years), most were male (71.0% vs. 29.0%), and were more likely to have underlying hypertension (83.9% vs. 50.0%) and cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs. 14.8%) (all P values <0.05). Age ≥70 years (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.03-5.56) and hypertension (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.14-8.44) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death of patients with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients with diabetes had worse outcomes compared with the sex- and age-matched patients without diabetes. Older age and comorbid hypertension independently contributed to in-hospital death of patients with diabetes.","Shi, Qiao; Zhang, Xiaoyi; Jiang, Fang; Zhang, Xuanzhe; Hu, Ning; Bimu, Chibu; Feng, Jiarui; Yan, Su; Guan, Yongjun; Xu, Dongxue; He, Guangzhen; Chen, Chen; Xiong, Xingcheng; Liu, Lei; Li, Hanjun; Tao, Jing; Peng, Zhiyong; Wang, Weixing",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409504/,664

Using linked data, we describe changes in respiratory virus testing among children born in Western Australia in 1996-2012. We extracted data on respiratory specimens from these children from birth to age 9 years. We estimated testing rates by age, year, Aboriginal status and geographical location. Predictors of testing among children hospitalised at least once before their 10th birthday were identified using logistic regression. We compared detection methods for respiratory viruses from nasal/nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens by age and year. Of 83 199 virology testing records in 2000-2012, 80% were nasal/NP specimens. Infants aged <1 month had the highest testing rates. Testing rates in all children increased over the study period with considerable yearly fluctuations. Among hospitalised children, premature children <32 weeks gestation had over three times the odds of being tested (95% CI 3·47-4·13) than those born at term. Testing using molecular methods increased from 5% to 87% over the study period. Proportion of positive samples increased from 36·3% to 44·4% (P < 0·01); this change was greatest in children aged 2-9 years. These findings will assist in interpreting results from future epidemiology studies assessing the pathogen-specific burden of disease.","Lim, F J; Blyth, C C; Keil, A D; DE Klerk, N; Moore, H C",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268817000413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249635/,664

Previous investigations had not yielded a diagnosis and his symptoms were progressing. The patient described worsened symptoms when stood up (platypnoea), with profound hypoxia until laid supine (orthodeoxia). Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome due to a right-to-left interatrial shunt was diagnosed on contrast-enhanced transoesophageal echocardiography with the patient undergoing successful percutaneous patent foramen ovale closure. Patent foramen ovale is often asymptomatic with a population prevalence of around 20%-30%. Anatomical shifts postpneumonectomy can open, or worsen a previously closed interatrial communication leading to right-to-left shunting of blood. Platypnoea-orthodeoxia is under-recognised, impairing quality of life and patient outcome. Investigations can be falsely reassuring, or poorly sensitive for the causative pathology. Percutaneous closure is safe with high success rates and this case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for shunts, particularly in postpneumonectomy patients.","Steward, Matthew; Hall, Anthony; Sayers, Ross; Dickson, Christopher",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-245699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34598972/,664

Favourable haemodynamic effects and organ-protective properties could render xenon an attractive anaesthetic for OPCAB surgery. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether xenon anaesthesia for OPCAB surgery is non-inferior to sevoflurane anaesthesia with regard to intraoperative vasopressor requirements. METHODS Forty-two patients undergoing elective OPCAB surgery were enrolled in this prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial. Patients were randomized to either xenon (50-60 vol%) or sevoflurane (1.1-1.4 vol%) anaesthesia. Primary outcome was intraoperative noradrenaline requirements necessary to achieve predefined haemodynamic goals. Secondary outcomes included safety variables such as the occurrence of adverse events (intraoperatively and during a 6-month follow-up after surgery) and the perioperative cardiorespiratory and inflammatory profile. RESULTS Baseline and intraoperative data did not differ between groups. Xenon was non-inferior to sevoflurane, as xenon patients required significantly less noradrenaline intraoperatively to achieve the predefined haemodynamic goals {geometric mean 428 [95% confidence interval (CI) 312, 588] vs 1702 [1267, 2285] µg, P<0.0001}. No differences were found for safety. Significantly more sevoflurane patients developed postoperative delirium (POD) (hazard ratio 4.2, P=0.044). The average arterial pressure was lower in the sevoflurane group {median75 [interquartile range (IQR) 6] vs 72 [4] mmHg, P=0.002}. No differences were found for other haemodynamic parameters, the respiratory profile and the perioperative release of inflammatory cytokines, troponin T, serum protein S-100β and erythropoietin. CONCLUSIONS Compared with sevoflurane, xenon anaesthesia allows a significant reduction in vasopressor administration in OPCAB surgery. Moreover, xenon anaesthesia was associated with a lower risk for POD, a finding that has to be confirmed in larger studies.

We describe the rationale, aims, and design for a new study, ""A SMART Approach to Treating Tobacco Use Disorder in Persons with HIV (SMARTTT),"" a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial. METHODS In HIV clinics within three health systems in the northeastern United States, PWH with tobacco use disorder are randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with or without contingency management (NRT vs. NRT + CM). Participants with response (defined as exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO)-confirmed smoking abstinence at week 12), continue the same treatment for another 12 weeks. Participants with non-response, are re-randomized to either switch medications from NRT to varenicline or intensify treatment to a higher CM reward schedule. Interventions are delivered by clinical pharmacists embedded in HIV clinics. The primary outcome is eCO-confirmed smoking abstinence; secondary outcomes include CD4 cell count, HIV viral load suppression, and the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index 2.0 score (a validated measure of morbidity and mortality based on laboratory data). Consistent with a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design and grounded in implementation science frameworks, we will conduct an implementation-focused process evaluation in parallel. Study protocol adaptations related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been made.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the Alphacoronavirus family, induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and significant IFN-I production after infection. However, how TGEV evades the IFN-I antiviral response despite the marked induction of endogenous IFN-I has remained unclear. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α), a highly conserved ER stress sensor with both kinase and RNase activities, is involved in the IFN response. In this study, IRE1α facilitated TGEV replication via downmodulating the host microRNA (miR) miR-30a-5p abundance. miR-30a-5p normally enhances IFN-I antiviral activity by directly targeting the negative regulators of Janus family kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1), and SOCS3. Furthermore, TGEV infection increased SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, which dampened the IFN-I antiviral response and facilitated TGEV replication. Importantly, compared with mock infection, TGEV infection in vivo resulted in decreased miR-30a-5p levels and significantly elevated SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in the piglet ileum. Taken together, our data reveal a new strategy used by TGEV to escape the IFN-I response by engaging the IRE1α-miR-30a-5p/SOCS1/3 axis, thus improving our understanding of how TGEV escapes host innate immune defenses.IMPORTANCE Type I interferons (IFN-I) play essential roles in restricting viral infections. Coronavirus infection induces ER stress and the interferon response, which reflects different adaptive cellular processes. An understanding of how coronavirus-elicited ER stress is actively involved in viral replication and manipulates the host IFN-I response has remained elusive. Here, TGEV inhibited host miR-30a-5p via the ER stress sensor IRE1α, which led to the increased expression of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling cascades, namely, SOCS1 and SOCS3. Increased SOCS1 or SOCS3 expression impaired the IFN-I antiviral response, promoting TGEV replication. These findings enhance our understanding of the strategies used by coronaviruses to antagonize IFN-I innate immunity via IRE1α-mediated manipulation of the miR-30a-5p/SOCS axis, highlighting the crucial role of IRE1α in innate antiviral resistance and the potential of IRE1α as a novel target against coronavirus infection.","Ma, Yanlong; Wang, Changlin; Xue, Mei; Fu, Fang; Zhang, Xin; Li, Liang; Yin, Lingdan; Xu, Wanhai; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00728-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30185587/,664

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo, simple randomized study. SAMPLE POPULATION Large colon segments from adult horses (n = 18). METHODS Pelvic flexures were harvested from 18 horses and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 closure techniques (n = 6 per technique). A 10-cm enterotomy was made in each pelvic flexure and closed with the assigned technique. Closure time, luminal diameter via contrast radiographs, and bursting pressure were recorded for each specimen and compared between techniques using 1-way ANOVA with Duncan post hoc test at P < .05. RESULTS There was a significant difference in closure time (P = .034) with 1-layer closure faster than both the traditional 2-layer closure (P=.024) and the 2-layer closure with suture line reversal (P = .030). There was no significant difference in luminal diameter or bursting pressure between the 3 closure techniques. CONCLUSIONS Two-layer closure with suture line reversal may be an alternative to traditional 2-layer closure for closure of the pelvic flexure based on ex vivo bursting pressure testing and closure time. A 1-layer simple continuous closure resisted bursting pressure not different to both 2-layer closure techniques.

All subjects were tested consecutively using the ProMIS III simulator until they reached proficiency performing laparoscopic suturing. Simulator metrics, critical error scores, observed structured assessment of technical skills scores, and Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery scores were recorded. RESULTS Group A (high aptitude) achieved proficiency after a mean of 7 attempts (range, 4-10). In group B (low aptitude), 30% achieved proficiency after a mean of 14 attempts (range, 10-16). In group B, 40% demonstrated improvement but did not attain proficiency, and 30% failed to progress. CONCLUSIONS Distinct learning curves for laparoscopic suturing can be mapped on the basis of fundamental ability. High aptitude is directly related to earlier completion of the learning curve.

The etiology may be related to leukocyte antibodies or biologically active compounds in transfused plasma, injuring susceptible recipient's lungs. The authors have hypothesized that transfusion could have less severe effects that are not always appreciated clinically and have shown subtly decreased pulmonary oxygen gas transfer in healthy volunteers after transfusion of fresh and 21-day stored erythrocytes. In this study, the authors tested the same hypothesis in surgical patients. METHODS Ninety-one patients undergoing elective major spine surgery with anticipated need for erythrocyte transfusion were randomly allocated to receive their first transfusion of erythrocytes as cell salvage (CS), washed stored, or unwashed stored. Clinicians were not blinded to group assignment. Pulmonary gas transfer and mechanics were measured 5 min before and 30 min after erythrocyte transfusion. RESULTS The primary outcome variable, gas transfer, as assessed by change of PaO2/FIO2, with erythrocyte transfusion was not significant in any group (mean ± SD; CS: 9 ± 59; washed: 10 ± 26; and unwashed: 15 ± 1) and did not differ among groups (P = 0.92).

METHODS Our retrospective, multicentric study included 1304 patients who underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy for gynecological malignancies. The patients were categorized into the following five groups based on treatment type: transperitoneal laparoscopy (group A, n = 198), extraperitoneal laparoscopy (group B, n = 681), robot-assisted transperitoneal laparoscopy (group C, n = 135), robot-assisted extraperitoneal laparoscopy (group D, n = 44), and laparotomy (group E, n = 246). RESULTS The prevalence of cancer types differed according to the surgical approach: there were more ovarian cancers in group E and more cervical cancers in groups B and D (p < 0.001). Estimated blood loss was higher in group E (844.2 mL) than in groups treated with minimally invasive interventions (115.8-141.5 mL, p < 0.005). For infrarenal dissection, fewer nodes were removed in group C compared with the other approaches (16 vs. 21 nodes, respectively, p < 0.05). The average operative time ranged from 169 min for group A to 247 min for group E (p < 0.001). Length of hospital stay was 14 days for group E versus 3.5 days for minimally invasive procedures (p < 0.05).

Findings from clinical studies to date, suggest that multiple factors are likely to contribute to the variability seen in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, despite this accumulating evidence, current identified factors do not explain the full extent of disease onset. Thus, the role of additional factors needs to be explored further.One such factor is exposure to adverse childhood experiences. However, the degree of this association is unknown. This systematic review will examine the literature investigating the associations between adverse childhood experiences and the risk of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Articles investigating associations between exposure to adverse childhood experiences and the risk of Alzheimer's disease will be identified systematically by searching CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsycInfo using Ebscohost.

156287,Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CLpro cysteine protease: development of an ion-pair model for catalysis.,2008,"The aim of this study is to compare different methods due to the difficulties in identifying coryneform bacteria to species level and to determine antibiotic resistance profiles. Isolates identified as Turicella otitidis (n:45) by VITEK 2 Compact and Corynebacterium mucifaciens (n:1) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), isolated from blood and catheter cultures between 2015 and 2017 were included in the study. For identification of the isolates, conventional tests and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were performed. Antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by Etest. The isolates identified as T. otitidis with VITEK 2 Compact could not be identified by MALDI-TOF MS and described as C. mucifaciens/Corynebacterium afermentans spp. by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. One isolate identified as C. mucifaciens by MALDI-TOF MS could not be identified with VITEK 2 Compact and described as C. mucifaciens by 16S rDNA sequence analysis and conventional methods. All isolates (n:45) described as C. mucifaciens/C. afermentans spp. by 16S rDNA sequence analysis were identified as C. afermentans subsp. afermentans with conventional methods. All 45 isolates identified as C. afermentans subsp. afermentans were resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin and were susceptible to vancomycin and daptomycin, whereas 31 (69%) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SXT). The isolate identified as C. mucifaciens was susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, daptomycin, and TMP-SXT; it was resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. In this study, we reported 45 C. afermentans isolates misidentified as T. otitidis in routine laboratory processes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to include the highest number of C. afermentans blood isolates.","Ölmez, Serpil; Tuncer, Özlem; Parlak, Mehmet; Bıçakçıgil, Asiye; Gürsoy, Nafia Canan; Otlu, Barış; Güdücüoğlu, Hüseyin; Sancak, Banu",Microbial drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.1089/mdr.2020.0039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411575/,664
158714,Novel inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus entry that act by three distinct mechanisms.,2013,"Background: It has been noted that olfactory and gustatory disturbances may precede or accompany the typical features of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Hence, a high index of suspicion is required when patients report sudden loss of smell or taste, in order to facilitate timely diagnosis and isolation. Aims/objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of olfactory and gustatory disturbances in COVID-19 positive patients from a cohort representative of Melbourne, Australia. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted on patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Standardised phone consultations and online follow-up questionnaires were performed to assess clinical features of COVID-19, with a focus on smell and taste disorders. Results: The most frequent symptoms experienced were taste and smell disturbances with 74% experiencing either smell or taste disturbance or both. Post-recovery, 34% of patients continued to experience ongoing hyposmia and 2% anosmia, whereas 28% continued to suffer from hypogeusia or ageusia. Conclusion and significance: This study presents the high rates of improvement of both olfactory and gustatory disturbance in a short-lived period. It also highlights the importance of these symptoms in prompting appropriate testing, quarantine precautions, initiate early olfactory retraining and the potential for continued sensory disturbance.","Horvath, Lukas; Lim, Jason Wei Jun; Taylor, James W; Saief, Tasfia; Stuart, Rhonda; Rimmer, Joanne; Michael, Philip",Acta oto-laryngologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00016489.2020.1855366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307905/,664
160057,Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Viral Shedding in Pediatric Patients Infected With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Under the Surface.,2020-08-28,"A 32-year-old captive female Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) was diagnosed with a hypermature resorbed cataract in the right eye and a mature cataract with phacolytic uveitis in the left eye. No other systemic or neurologic physical abnormalities were detected. The patient was considered blind from bilateral cataracts, and with a reduced quality of life, surgery was indicated to remove the mature cataract in the left eye. Before surgery, the phacolytic uveitis was treated in the left eye for 1 week with topical and systemic anti-inflammatory and antibiotic medication. Unilateral phacoemulsification was performed on the left eye while under general anesthesia. The individual recovered uneventfully and regained vision in the left eye. The bird was returned to its enclosure 8 days after the surgical procedure. No abnormalities were noted in behavior or reintegration. Three weeks after the phacoemulsification was performed in the left eye, the individual presented with active uveitis, without vision loss, suspected secondary to incisional infection, which was managed with topical and systemic anti-inflammatory and antibiotic medication. At day 41 the patient was discharged with no disease conditions affecting the left eye, and the flamingo's vision was considered significantly improved compared with initial presentation. Phacoemulsification was safe and effective in removing the lens, resolving phacolytic uveitis, and restoring vision in spite of the postsurgical incisional infection. Some adaptations in the surgical approach and medical management are recommended on the basis of morphology, feeding habits, and behavior of this aquatic avian species to avoid postsurgical incisional infection and uveitis.","Garcés Torres, Rodrigo S; Bliss, Cassandra D; Alcántar Hernández, Benjamin E",Journal of avian medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1647/19-00007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256551/,664

METHODS Searches of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were performed in October 2020 in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Search terms included ""hip"", ""fracture"", and ""COVID-19"". The criteria for inclusion were published clinical articles reporting the mortality rate associated with COVID-19 in hip fracture patients. In total, 53 articles were identified and following full text screening 28 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria. RESULTS A total of 28 studies reported the mortality of COVID-19-positive patients, of which 21 studies reported the prevalence of COVID-19-positive patients and compared the mortality rate to COVID-19-negative patients. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 13% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11% to 16%) and was associated with a crude mortality rate of 35% (95% CI 32% to 39%), which was a significantly increased risk compared to those patients without COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 7.11, 95% CI 5.04 to 10.04; p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to be male (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.96; p = 0.002). The duration of follow-up was reported in 20 (71.4%) studies. A total of 17 studies reported whether a patient presented with COVID-19 (n = 108 patients, 35.1%) or developed COVID-19 following admission (n = 200, 64.9%), of which six studies reported a mean time to diagnosis of post-admission COVID-19 at 15 days (2 to 25). CONCLUSION The prevalence of COVID-19 was 13%, of which approximately one-third of patients were diagnosed on admission, and was associated with male sex. COVID-19-positive patients had a crude mortality rate of 35%, being seven times greater than those without COVID-19. Due to the heterogenicity of the reported data minimum reporting standards of outcomes associated with COVID-19 are suggested.

169327,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): epidemiology and vaccinology in Nigeria,2021,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has been declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Besides claiming over 3 million lives worldwide, COVID-19 led to unprecedented disruption in industrial productivity, trading, and global food supply, resulting in loss of livelihood. Despite initial success in curbing the spread of diseases through a lockdown and rapid vaccine development, human lives are threatened by sudden outbreaks from new strains of the virus. This motivates the conceptualization of effective interdiction rules to inform human mobility in a manner that the damage to lives as well as the economy could be minimized. In this work, we present three interdiction rules that employ machine learning-based network inference on daily infected cases to infer the influence of contagion between neighboring zones. The proposed rules leverage network science concepts such as coloring and clustering to attain time-varying partial or complete travel restrictions. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that these strategies yield lower infection spread than greedy and random migration-based tie elimination approaches as well as a balance between contagion mitigation and economic gain.","Roy, S.; Biswas, P.; Ghosh, P.",Ieee Access,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3095252,664
170372,A Discernable Increase in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 R.1 Lineage Carrying an E484K Spike Protein Mutation in Japan,2021-04-07,"Objectives: Colchicine has been proposed as a COVID-19 treatment, but its effect on time to recovery is unknown. We aimed to determine whether colchicine is effective at reducing time to recovery and COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths among people in the community. Design: Prospective, multicentre, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive Platform Randomised Trial of Treatments in the Community for Epidemic and Pandemic Illnesses (PRINCIPLE). Setting: National trial run remotely from a central trial site and at multiple primary care centres across the United Kingdom. Participants: Adults aged [≥]65, or [≥]18 years with comorbidities or shortness of breath, and unwell [≤]14 days with suspected COVID-19 in the community. Interventions: Participants were randomised to usual care, usual care plus colchicine (500g daily for 14 days), or usual care plus other interventions. Main outcome measures: The co-primary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery, and hospitalisation/death related to COVID-19, within 28 days, analysed using Bayesian models. The hypothesis for the time to recovery endpoint is evaluated first, and if superiority is declared on time to recovery, the hypothesis for the second co-primary endpoint of hospitalisation/death is then evaluated. To determine futility, we pre-specified a clinically meaningful benefit in time to first reported recovery as a hazard ratio of 1.2 or larger (equating to approximately 1.5 days benefit in the colchicine arm, assuming 9 days recovery in the usual care arm). Results: The trial opened on April 2, 2020, with randomisation to colchicine starting on March 04, 2021 and stopping on May 26, 2021, because the pre-specified time to recovery futility criterion was met. The primary analysis model included 2755 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, randomised to colchicine (n=156), usual care (n=1145), and other treatments (n=1454). Time to first self-reported recovery was similar in the colchicine group compared with usual care with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.919 [95% credible interval 0.72 to 1.16] and an estimated increase of 1.14 days [-1.86 to 5.21] in median time to self-reported recovery for colchicine versus usual care. The probability of meaningful benefit in time to recovery was very low at 1.8%. Results were similar in comparisons with concurrent controls. COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were similar in the colchicine group versus usual care, with an estimated odds ratio of 0.76 [0.28 to 1.89] and an estimated difference of -0.4% [-2.7% to 2.4]. One serious adverse event occurred in the colchicine group and one in usual care.. Conclusions: Colchicine did not improve time to recovery in people at higher risk of complications with COVID-19 in the community.

A DCE examining the public's preferences for alternative environmental management plans on the high seas, in the area of the Flemish Cap, was carried out in Canada, Scotland and Norway in late 2019 and was rerun in early May 2020 shortly after the Covid-19 pandemic had officially peaked in the three countries. The same choice set sequence is tested across the two periods, using different but nationally representative samples in each case. Entropy balancing, a multivariate reweighting method, is used to achieve covariate balance between the pre and post Covid samples in the analysis.

181067,Diagnostic Strategies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection: Operational Recommendations for Health Professionals,2021,"Multiple effective vaccines are currently being deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by SARS-COV-2), and are viewed as the major factor in marked reductions in disease burden in regions around the world with moderate to high coverage of these vaccines. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs is, however, significantly threatened by the emergence of new SARS-COV-2 variants that, in addition to being more transmissible and potentially more virulent than the wild (resident) strain, may at least partially evade existing vaccines. A new two-strain (one resident, the other wild) and two-group (vaccinated or otherwise) mechanistic mathematical model is designed and used to assess the impact of the vaccine-induced cross-protective efficacy on the spread the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Analysis of the model, which is fitted using COVID-19 mortality data for the US, shows that vaccine-induced herd immunity can be achieved if 61% of the American population is fully vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Parameter sensitivity analysis suggests three main factors that significantly affect the COVID-19 burden in the US, namely (a) daily vaccination rate, (b) the level of cross-protection the vaccines offer against the variant, and (c) the relative infectiousness of the dominant variant relative to the wild strain. This study further suggests that a new variant can cause a significant disease surge in the US if (i) the vaccine coverage against the wild strain is low (roughly < 50%), (ii) the variant is much more transmissible (e.g., twice more transmissible) than the wild-type strain, or (iii) the level of cross-protection offered by the vaccine is relatively low (e.g., less than 70%). A new variant will not cause such surge in the US if it is only moderately more transmissible (e.g., 1:56 more transmissible) than the wild strain, at least 66% of the population of the US is fully vaccinated, and the three vaccines being deployed in the US (Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) offer a moderate level of cross-protection against the variant.","Mancuso, M.; Eikenberry, S.; Gumel, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.21259782v1?rss=1,664
184013,Putative cis-acting stem-loops in the 5' untranslated region of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus can substitute for their mouse hepatitis virus counterparts.,2006,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used safely for over 60 years in rheumatic patients. However, following its recent use in COVID-19 disease, its safety has been questioned, following controversial reports of cardiac toxicity1, possibly related to a prolongation of the QT interval2. Objectives: To explore the influence of chronic treatment with hydroxychloroquine on QT interval in rheumatic patients, and the possible effects of drug-todrug interference3. Methods: 12-lead electrocardiogram tracings were recorded with standard equipment in 229 ambulatory patients (SLE = 53, RA = 52, SSc = 56, UCTD = 38, Others = 30). The present analysis was performed on corrected QT intervals (QTc) calculated according to Framingham formula (QTc = QT+0.154 (1-RR)), with ULN = 449 ms in males, and 467 ms in females. Estimated glomerular filtrate rate (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine with the CKD-EPI equation. The influence on QTc values of demographic variables, chronic (≥3 months) HCQ treatment, and of the use of selected comedications -Statins, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPI), Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) -were evaluated by parametric or non parametric statistical methods, as appropriate. All statistic al analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS statistical package version 25. QTc duration was not associated with the use of Statins, ACEi, ARBs, or SSRIs (p = 0.454, 0.276, 0.475, and 0.131 respectively), but was significantly prolonged in patients treated with HCQ (421.26 ± 19.19 vs 410.55 ± 21.18 msec, p < 0.001), PPIs (420.57 ± 21.45 vs 410.89 ± 18.12 ms, p < 0.001), and CCBs (424.22 ± 25.97 vs 415.59 ± 19.62 ms, p < 0.033). Furthermore, as reported in Fig. 1, our data show a trend -albeit not statistically significant -towards an additive effect on QT prolongation of the association of PPIs and CCBs with HCQ, even more evident in the case of association of the 3 drug classes. Conclusion: In this study, the QTc interval was significantly prolonged in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine as compared to controls, although significant prolongation was extremely infrequent. Furthermore, our data revealed signs of drug-drug interference, suggesting that regular monitoring of the electrocardiogram is advisable in these patients, often undergoing cotreatment with multiple drugs.","Antivalle, M.; La Paglia, G.; Ditto, M.

We investigated the relationship between willingness to receive vaccination and sources of health information among those who did not want to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Methods: This prospective cohort study collected data using a self-administered questionnaire survey. The baseline survey was conducted during December 22-25, 2020, and the follow-up survey during February 18-19, 2021. Participants were aged 20-65 years and worked at the time of the baseline survey (N=33,087). After excluding 6,051 invalid responses, we included responses from 27,036 participants at baseline. In total, 19,941 people responded to the follow-up survey (74% follow-up rate). We excluded 7,415 participants who answered ""yes"" to the question ""If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, would you like to get it?"" in the baseline survey. We finally analyzed 12,526 participants. Results: The odds ratio for change in willingness to be vaccinated from ""no"" to ""yes"" differed by source of health information. Compared with workers that used TV as a source of information, significantly fewer people who reported getting information from the Internet and friends/colleagues were willing to get the vaccine. Conclusions: It is important to approach workers who do not watch TV when implementing workplace vaccination programs. It is likely that willingness to be vaccinated can be increased through an active company policy whereby the top management recommend vaccination, coupled with an individual approach by occupational health professionals.","Hiraoka, K.; Nagata, T.; MORI, T.; Ando, H.; Hino, A.; Tateishi, S.; Tsuji, M.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.15.21260609v1?rss=1,664
185675,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus evades antiviral signaling: role of nsp1 and rational design of an attenuated strain.,2007,"Objectives Data and data visualization are integral parts of (clinical) decision-making in general and stewardship (antimicrobial stewardship, infection control, and institutional surveillance) in particular. However, systematic research on the use of data visualization in stewardship is lacking. This study aimed at filling this gap by creating a visual dictionary of stewardship through an assessment of data visualization in stewardship research. Methods A random sample of 150 data visualizations from published research articles on stewardship were assessed. The visualization vocabulary (content) and design space (design elements) were combined to create a visual dictionary. Additionally, visualization errors, chart junk, and quality were assessed to identify problems in current visualizations and to provide improvement recommendations. Results Despite a heterogeneous use of data visualization, distinct combinations of graphical elements to reflect stewardship data were identified. In general, bar (n=54; 36.0%) and line charts (n=42; 28.1%) were preferred visualization types. Visualization problems comprised colour scheme mismatches, double y-axis, hidden data points through overlaps, and chart junk. Recommendations were derived that can help to clarify visual communication, improve colour use for grouping/stratifying, improve the display of magnitude, and match visualizations to scientific standards. Conclusions Results of this study can be used to guide data visualization creators in designing visualizations that fit the data and visual habits of the stewardship target audience. Additionally, the results can provide the basis to further expand the visual dictionary of stewardship towards more effective visualizations that improve data insights, knowledge, and clinical decision-making.","Keizer, Julia; Luz, Christian F.; Sinha, Bhanu; van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette; Albers, Casper; Beerlage-de Jong, Nienke; Glasner, Corinna",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.444819,664

METHODS The plasma levels of anti-SARS coronavirus IgG antibody of 57 normal subjects, 127 physicians and nurses worked in SARS wards for one month and 73 SARS patients with different course of SARS were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Plasma anti-SARS coronavirus IgG antibody was not detected in normal subjects and the clinical personnel. After 0-7 days, 8-10 days, 11-14 days, 15-20 days of onset of disease, the positive rates were 0.33%, 52%, 86% respectively, and the general positive rate was 61%. CONCLUSION The specificity and sensitivity of ELISA to detect plasma anti-SARS IgG antibody were satisfactory. Cases with positive reaction could be diagnosed as patients already infected by the virus. The specific IgG antibody didn't emerge in some patients in the early stage of the disease, and the negative results didn't indicate that they were not infected.

Inadequate information on the factors affecting these services could be barrier to a reduction of maternal deaths in lowincome countries. Objective To assess the uptake of antenatal, postnatal and skilled care during childbirth. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in eight villages of Nawalparasi district in southern Nepal. A total of 447 women who had given birth within the preceding 24 months were recruited using multistage random sampling. Data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Chi-square tests were used to assess association between variables. Result Over 70% of women had gone for at least four antenatal care check-ups while only 14.3% had at least three postnatal check-ups in their last pregnancies. The proportion of institution delivery was 54%. Women's literacy was associated with the uptake of antenatal services (p=< 0.001), postnatal care (p=0.04) and institutional delivery (p=< 0.001). Knowledge of antenatal (p=< 0.001) and postnatal care was also associated with uptake of respective services (p=< 0.001). Conclusion The uptake and knowledge of antenatal care was much better than of postnatal care. Home delivery rates were still very high.

189649,Nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,2005,BACKGROUND The first total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 1994 by Gagner and Pomp. Their comments coupled with the inherent technical difficulties stifled development of the technique. In the last decade there has been a renewed interest in the technique with high volume centres publishing large series. We present our experience with the first operation completed at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital. METHOD Pre-operative CT confirmed a resectable head of pancreas mass. The gastroduodenal artery (GDA) was noted to arise from the right hepatic artery which ran parallel and anterior to the bile duct. Five ports were used. After excluding metastases we proceeded to dissect the hepatoduodenal ligament. A combination of hook diathermy and Harmonic ACE+7® (Ethicon®) was used. We then entered the lesser sac and ligated the right gastroepiploic vessels and right gastric vessels. The stomach was transected with an Endo GIA® Black 60 mm (Covidien®). The duodenum was kocherized. The GDA was ligated with a Haemolok® (Teleflex®) clip. A retropancreatic tunnel was created the pancreas was transected with the energy device. The jejenum was transected 10 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz with an Endo GIA® Purple 45 mm and passed posterior to the SMA. The pancreaticojejenostomy was done as per Blumgart with a duct to mucosa anastomosis. The hepaticojejenostomy was completed with 4/0 PDS (Ethicon®) continuous. The gastrojejenostomy was completed with 3/0 Maxon (Covidien®). The specimen was retrieved via a 5 cm midline incision. Two pencil drains were placed. RESULTS The patient was transferred to ICU postoperatively. She developed a short period of delirium which resolved spontaneously. No bile or pancreatic leaks were noted. She was discharged on day 28. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is technically feasible despite the steep learning curve.

189855,Ultrastructure and origin of membrane vesicles associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication complex.,2006,"A multiplex reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) procedure was developed for the simultaneous detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in preweaning pigs with diarrhoea. The membrane gene of PEDV and the nucleocapsid gene of TGEV were chosen as targets. The PCR products of PEDV and TGEV had molecular sizes of 412 and 612 base pairs, respectively. Primers from PEDV did not react with any TGEV tested and vice versa. In addition, the primers did not react with other pig viruses. The multiplex RT-PCR was able to detect 10 tissue culture-infective doses 50 per cent (TCID50)/ml of PEDV or TGEV with each of the primer sets for PEDV and TGEV, respectively. The RNAS of PEDV and TGEV were detected directly in intestinal and faecal samples from pigs infected experimentally with either virus. The results of the assay correlated well with the results of virus isolation. None of the five control specimens was positive. PEDV was detected in 10 intestinal and nine faecal samples, and among the nine positive faecal samples two were culture-negative. TGEV was also detected in 10 intestinal and nine faecal samples, and among the nine positive faecal samples, three were culture-negative.","Kim, O; Choi, C; Kim, B; Chae, C",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10872784/,664
190122,Immunological characterization of the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,2004,"OBJECTIVE The effect of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak on the willingness of laypersons to provide bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using standard CPR (SCPR) or compression-only CPR (CCPR) was evaluated. The preferred type of SCPR in the post-SARS era was assessed. METHODS A descriptive study was conducted through telephone interviews. Persons who attended a CPR course from January 2000 through February 2003 answered a structured questionnaire. The respondents' willingness to perform SCPR or CCPR during a witnessed cardiac arrest of an average adult stranger or that of a family member in the pre-SARS and the post-SARS era was surveyed. RESULTS Data for 305 respondents were processed. For the scenario of cardiac arrest of an average stranger, more respondents would perform CCPR than SCPR in the pre-SARS era (83.6% vs. 61.3%, p <0.001) and in the post-SARS era (77.4% vs. 28.9%, p <0.001). In the scenario of the cardiac arrest of a family member, more would perform CCPR than SCPR in the pre-SARS era (92.8% vs. 87.2%, p <0.001) and in the post-SARS era (92.8% vs. 84.9%, p <0.001). After SARS, more respondents were unwilling to perform SCPR (p <0.001) and CCPR (p <0.001) on strangers. After SARS, more respondents were unwilling to perform SCPR on a family member (p = 0.039), but there was no difference in the preference to perform CCPR (p = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS Concerns about SARS adversely affected the willingness of respondents to perform SCPR or CCPR on strangers and to perform SCPR on family members. Compression-only CPR was preferred to SCPR to resuscitate strangers experiencing cardiac arrest after the emergence of SARS.","Lam, Kin-Kwan; Lau, Fei-Lung; Chan, Wai-Kwong; Wong, Wing-Nam",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18019100/,664
190292,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus group-specific open reading frames encode nonessential functions for replication in cell cultures and mice.,2005,"This analysis of the Canadian health system reviews recent developments in organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health reforms and health system performance. Life expectancy is high, but it plateaued between 2016 and 2017 due to the opioid crisis. Socioeconomic inequalities in health are significant, and the large and persistent gaps in health outcomes between Indigenous peoples and the rest of Canadians represent a major challenge facing the health system, and society more generally. Canada is a federation: the provinces and territories administer health coverage systems for their residents (‎referred to as ""medicare"")‎, while the federal government sets national standards, such as through the Canada Health Act, and is responsible for health coverage for specific subpopulations. Health care is predominantly publicly financed, with approximately 70% of health expenditures financed through the general tax revenues. Yet there are major gaps in medicare, such as prescription drugs outside hospital, long-term care, mental health care, dental and vision care, which explains the significant role of employer-based private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments. The supply of physicians and nurses is uneven across the country with chronic shortages in rural and remote areas. Recent reforms include a move towards consolidating health regions into more centralized governance structures at the provincial/ territorial level, and gradually moving towards Indigenous self-governance in health care. There has also been some momentum towards introducing a national programme of prescription drug coverage (‎Pharmacare)‎, though the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 may shift priorities towards addressing other major health system challenges such as the poor quality and regulatory oversight of the long-term care sector. Health system performance has improved in recent years as measured by in-hospital mortality rates, cancer survival and avoidable hospitalizations. Yet major challenges such as access to non-medicare services, wait times for specialist and elective surgical care, and fragmented and poorly coordinated care will continue to preoccupy governments in pursuit of improved health system performance.","Marchildon, Gregory P; Allin, Sara; Merkur, Sherry",Health systems in transition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527903/,664
190366,Rapid Antigen Detection Test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: How to Use It Properly?,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) may result in hearing loss, chronic otitis and cholesteatoma. With advances in treatment options, the identification of patients with obstructive ETD is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study was to validate a Danish translation of the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7). METHODS All participants underwent tympanometry, otomicroscopy and completed the ETDQ-7. We included 34 ears from patients with obstructive ETD who had abnormal tympanometry curves but no history of cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis. As a control group, 48 otherwise healthy ears with a normal tympanometry curve were included from patients with known sensorineural hearing loss or normal hearing. RESULTS A Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 indicated a good internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire. The mean ETDQ-7 score in the obstructive ETD group was 31 versus 13.5 in the control group (p = 0.00). A receiver operating characteristics analysis produced an area under the curve of 94%, showing excellent discriminatory abilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS The ETDQ-7 has previously been validated in English, German, Dutch and Portuguese, demonstrating good clinical relevance. The Danish translation of the ETDQ-7 has produced similar results and may be valuable in diagnosing obstructive ETD and in monitoring the effect of balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube.

Data on the COVID-19 epidemic that were analyzed in this study were obtained from the official websites of the National Health Commission of China and the Health Commissions of 31 provinces in China. From January 26 to February 25, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each region was counted daily using data from our database. Curve fitting of daily scatter plots of the relationship between epidemic growth rate (GR) with average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) was conducted using the loess method. The heterogeneity across days and provinces was calculated to assess the necessity of using a longitudinal model. Fixed-effect models with polynomial terms were developed to quantify the relationship between variations in the GR and AT or ARH. An increased AT markedly reduced the GR when the AT was lower than -5°C, the GR was moderately reduced when the AT ranged from -5°C to 15°C, and the GR increased when the AT exceeded 15°C. ARH increased the GR when it was less than 72% and reduced the GR when it exceeded 72%. The temperature and relative humidity curves were not linearly associated with the GR of COVID-19. The GR was moderately reduced when the AT ranged from -5°C to 15°C. When the AT was lower or higher than -5°C to 15°C, the GR of COVID-19 increased. An increased ARH increased the GR when the ARH was lower than 72% and reduced the GR when the ARH exceeded 72%.","Qin, Lei; Sun, Qiang; Shao, Jiani; Chen, Yang; Zhang, Xiaomei; Li, Jian; Chen, Mingchih; Shia, Ben-Chang; Wu, Szu-Yuan",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34306336/,664
192160,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ORF6 antagonizes STAT1 function by sequestering nuclear import factors on the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membrane.,2007,"Canine parvovirus (CPV) is an emerging DNA virus that was first observed to cause disease in canines in 1978 and has since become a ubiquitous pathogen worldwide. CPV emerged from feline panleukopenia parvovirus (FPLV) or a closely related virus, differing at several key amino acid residues. Here we characterize the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of CPV. Although FPLV has remained an endemic infection in its host populations, we show that, since the 1970s, the newly emerged CPV has undergone an epidemic-like pattern of logistic/exponential growth, effectively doubling its population size every few years. This rapid population growth was associated with a lineage of CPV that acquired a broader host range and greater infectivity. Recombination played no role in the emergence of CPV. Rather, any preexisting variation in the donor species and the subsequent rapid adaptation of the virus to canines were likely dependent on a high rate of mutation and the positive selection of mutations in the major capsid gene. Strikingly, although these single-stranded viruses have a DNA genome and use cellular replication machinery, their rate of nucleotide substitution is closer to that of RNA viruses than to that of double-stranded DNA viruses.","Shackelton, Laura A; Parrish, Colin R; Truyen, Uwe; Holmes, Edward C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15626758/,664

Postoperative open (group 1) and percutaneous needle (group 2) patients were included. All patients were reviewed and surveyed by telephone. The comparison results of both techniques were analyzed using 2 for parametric results and by the Fisher test for nonparametric results. RESULTS It was found that patients in group 2 expressed greater satisfaction, where 21.8% (n = 12) were fully satisfied with the percutaneous procedure, unlike those in group 1 where total satisfaction was only manifested at 3.8% (n = 2).

Here we describe evidence supporting the structure and a cis-acting function in defective interfering (DI) RNA replication of stem-loop III, the third of four predicted higher-order structures mapping within the 210-nucleotide (nt) 5' UTR of the 32-kb bovine coronavirus (BCoV) genome. Stem-loop III maps at nt 97 through 116, has a calculated free energy of -9.1 kcal/mol in the positive strand and -3.0 kcal/mol in the negative strand, and has associated with it beginning at nt 100 an open reading frame (ORF) potentially encoding an 8-amino-acid peptide. Stem-loop III is presumed to function in the positive strand, but its strand of action has not been established. Stem-loop III (i) shows phylogenetic conservation among group 2 coronaviruses and appears to have a homolog in coronavirus groups 1 and 3, (ii) has in all coronaviruses for which sequence is known a closely associated short, AUG-initiated intra-5' UTR ORF, (iii) is supported by enzyme structure-probing evidence in BCoV RNA, (iv) must maintain stem integrity for DI RNA replication in BCoV DI RNA, and (v) shows a positive correlation between maintenance of the short ORF and maximal DI RNA accumulation in BCoV DI RNA. These results indicate that stem-loop III in the BCoV 5' UTR is a cis-acting element for DI RNA replication and that its associated intra-5' UTR ORF may function to enhance replication. It is postulated that these two elements function similarly in the virus genome.","Raman, Sharmila; Bouma, Peter; Williams, Gwyn D; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12767992/,664

Among individuals with serious coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS and evaluate therapeutic strategies. We report two cases of ARDS in two aged African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that had pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. We also report a comparatively mild COVID-19 phenotype characterized by minor clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic changes in the two surviving, aged AGMs and four rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Notable increases in circulating cytokines were observed in three of four infected, aged AGMs but not in infected RMs. All the AGMs had increased levels of plasma IL-6 compared with baseline, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2. Together, our results indicate that both RMs and AGMs are capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that aged AGMs may be useful for modeling severe disease manifestations, including ARDS.","Blair, Robert V; Vaccari, Monica; Doyle-Meyers, Lara A; Roy, Chad J; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Fahlberg, Marissa; Monjure, Chris J; Beddingfield, Brandon; Plante, Kenneth S; Plante, Jessica A; Weaver, Scott C; Qin, Xuebin; Midkiff, Cecily C; Lehmicke, Gabrielle; Golden, Nadia; Threeton, Breanna; Penney, Toni; Allers, Carolina; Barnes, Mary B; Pattison, Melissa; Datta, Prasun K; Maness, Nicholas J; Birnbaum, Angela; Fischer, Tracy; Bohm, Rudolf P; Rappaport, Jay",Am. j. pathol,,664

Data Sources: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS or COVID-19 and pregnancy. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion criteria were hospitalized pregnant women with a confirmed coronavirus related-illness, defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or COVID-19. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions, so that a pooled proportion may not coincide with the actual raw proportion in the results. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, preeclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results: Nineteen studies including 79 hospitalized women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8%, and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%), and dyspnea (27.0%). For all coronavirus infections, the pooled proportion of miscarriage was 64.7% (8/12; 95% confidence interval, 37.9-87.3), although reported only for women affected by SARS in two studies with no control group; the pooled proportion of preterm birth <37 weeks was 24.3% (14/56; 95% confidence interval, 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (6/34; 95% confidence interval, 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (2/19; 95% confidence interval, 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (2/29; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-24.4), although reported only for women affected by SARS; 84% (50/58) were delivered by cesarean; the pooled proportion of perinatal death was 11.1% (5/60; 95% confidence interval, 84.8-19.6), and 57.2% of newborns (3/12; 95% confidence interval, 3.6-99.8) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and to explore the risk factors affecting the disease duration in Jiangan Fangcang shelter hospital, Wuhan, China. Methods: Clinical characteristics of 409 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. We describe the clinical characteristics and distribution of discharge time or transfer time for each patient. Then we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify potential risk factors for progression from non-severe to severe COVID-19 or death. Results: The median disease duration of all patients was 23 days (IQR 19-28). The main symptoms of the patient were fever (95.6%), cough (74.3%), tiredness (21.5%), and so on. Comorbidities mainly included hypertension (30.6%) diabetes (17.6%) and heart disease (12.5%). The univariate Cox regression analysis showed that old age, number of symptoms, the combination of hypertension, heart disease and pulmonary disease were associated with the progression of disease. The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that old age (HR: 7.294; 95% CI: 1.442-36.888; P = 0.016), the combination of hypertension (HR: 2.230; 95% CI: 1.090-4.562; P = 0.028) and heart disease (HR: 2.650; 95% CI: 1.079-6.510; P = 0.034) were independent risk factors for progression of COVID-19. Conclusions: The age of the patient, the combination of hypertension and heart disease were independent risk factors for the progression of COVID-19. Cautions should be raised for patients with these risk factors.","Lv, Zhengtong; Lv, Shubin",Int J Biol Sci,,664

217501,Alternative interpretation to the findings reported in visualization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 invading the human placenta using electron microscopy,2020,"In the presence of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and other new viral agents, one of the fundamental problems in science is the evaluation of environmental and social weaknesses of cities/regions to the exposure of infectious diseases for preventing and/or containing new COVID-19 outbreaks and the diffusion of other viral agents that generate a negative impact on public health and economy of countries. The current monitoring of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is mainly based on reproduction number (R0) and fatality rates. However, this approach is a real-time monitoring of transmission dynamics for mitigating the numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. Reproduction number does not provide information to cope with future epidemics or pandemics. The main goal of this study is to propose the Index c (as contagions) that quantifies, ex-ante, the environmental risk of exposure of cities/regions to future epidemics of the COVID-19 and similar vital agents. This Index c synthetizes environmental, demographic, climatological and health risk factors of cities/regions that indicate their exposure to infectious diseases. Index c has a range from 1 (environmental and social weakness of urban areas leading to high levels of exposure to infectious diseases) to 0 (environment that reduces the risk of exposure to infectious diseases in society). The statistical evidence here, applied on case study of Italy, seems in general to support the predictive capacity of the Index c as a particularly simple but superior indicator in detecting the global correlation between potential risk of exposure of cities/regions to infectious diseases and actual risk given by infected individuals and deaths of the COVID-19. The Index c can support a proactive environmental strategy to help policymakers to prevent future pandemics similar to the COVID-19.","Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,,664

METHODS: In this retrospective study, twenty-eight confirmed and seven highly suspected cases of COVID-19 were enrolled in Ningbo first hospital from January 26, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The initial and follow-up chest CT imaging features, epidemiological history, and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 57.3 ± 15.3 years (range: 27-96 years), including 25 females and 10 males. On CT images, 89.3% (25/28) confirmed and 100% (7/7) suspected patients had ground-glass opacities (GGOs), and GGOs with mixed consolidations were observed in 35.7% (10/28) confirmed and 42.9% (3/7) suspected cases, most of these lesions were distributed under the peripheral of both lungs. 17 confirmed and 4 suspected cases had a history of participating in Ningbo Tian-tong Temple rituals and all had GGOs in their lungs during the initial CT scan. As of March 25, 2020, the lung lesions of our cases were significantly resolved and all patients have been discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSION: The most common chest CT features are multiple bilateral and peripheral GGOs with mixed consolidations or not in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Chest CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring treatment response of this disease. There was no reported death in our cases.","Jiang, Maoqing; Chen, Ping; Li, Tianfu; Tang, Yifan; Chen, Xueqin; Chen, Xiaomin; Ruan, Xinzhong",Clin Imaging,,664

The potential impact of bevacizumab on the efficacy and safety of partial splenic embolization (PSE) in the management of chemotherapy-induced hypersplenism (CIH) has never been investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study with gastrointestinal cancer patients who have undergone PSE for the treatment of thrombocytopenia resulting from hypersplenism. Pre- and post-PSE platelet count (PC), the percentage of patients who resumed systemic therapy, and complication rates were compared between patients exposed and not exposed to bevacizumab. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were eligible. Colorectal cancer was the predominant neoplasm (60%), and 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab were the most commonly provided drugs (70%, 65%, and 65% of patients, respectively). After PSE, 80% of patients recovered PC &#8805; 100 × 109/L (100K). Systemic therapy was resumed in 81% of patients. Seventy-one patients exposed to bevacizumab had a median PC before PSE of 77.5K and after PSE of 167.0K, with a mean difference of 108K (P < .0001). Thirty-nine patients not exposed to bevacizumab had a median PC of pre-PSE of 73.0K and post-PSE of 187.0K, with a mean difference of 117.7K (P < .0001). Both groups had similar values of percentages of patients with PC post-PSE &#8805; 100K (83% vs. 74%; P = .463), resumption of systemic therapy (85% vs. 74%; P = .213), and complication rates. A linear association between splenic infarction rate and increment in PC was found (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: PSE is a safe and effective procedure in the management of CIH, regardless of the provision of bevacizumab. Splenic infarction rate should be optimized to enhance patient outcomes.","Jácome, Alexandre A; Ohinata, Aki; Mahvash, Armeen; Overman, Michael J; Kee, Bryan; Fogelman, David; Morris, Van K; Johnson, Benny; Rothschild, Nicole D; Wolff, Robert A; Eng, Cathy",,,664

METHODS: We studied a cohort of 494,753 adults in 6,515 NHs in France exposed to COVID-19 pandemic (from March 1st to May 31st, 2020) and compared with the 2014-2019 cohorts using data from the French National Health Data System. The main outcome was death. Excess deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated. RESULT: There were 13,505 excess deaths. Mortality increased by 43% (SMR: 1.43). The mortality excess was higher among males than females (SMR: 1.51 and 1.38) and decreased with increasing age (SMRs in females: 1.61 in the 60-74 age group, 1.58 for 75-84, 1.41 for 85-94, and 1.31 for 95 or over; Males: SMRs: 1.59 for 60-74, 1.69 for 75-84, 1.47 for 85-94, and 1.41 for 95 or over). No mortality displacement effect was observed up until August 30th,2020. By extrapolating to all NH residents nationally (N = 570,003), we estimated that they accounted for 51% of the general population excess deaths (N = 15,114 out of 29,563). CONCLUSION: NH residents accounted for half of the total excess deaths in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The excess death rate was higher among males than females and among younger than older residents.","Canouï-Poitrine, Florence; Rachas, Antoine; Thomas, Martine; Carcaillon-Bentata, Laure; Fontaine, Roméo; Gavazzi, Gaëtan; Laurent, Marie; Robine, Jean-Marie",Age ageing,,664

The objective of this trial was to determine the characteristics, clinical significance and therapeutic consequences of these arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 113 consecutive patients (mean age 64.1 ± 14.3 years, 30 (26.5%) female) with positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV2 as well as radiographically confirmed pulmonary involvement admitted to the ICU from March to May 2020 were included and observed for a cumulative time of 2321 days. Fifty episodes of sustained atrial tachycardias, five episodes of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and thirty bradycardic events were documented. Sustained new onset atrial arrhythmias were associated with hemodynamic deterioration in 13 cases (35.1%). Patients with new onset atrial arrhythmias were older, showed higher levels of Hs-Troponin and NT-proBNP, and a more severe course of disease. The 5 ventricular arrhythmias (two ventricular tachycardias, two episodes of ventricular fibrillation, and one torsade de pointes tachycardia) were observed in 4 patients. All episodes could be terminated by immediate defibrillation/cardioversion. Five bradycardic events were associated with hemodynamic deterioration. Precipitating factors could be identified in 19 of 30 episodes (63.3%), no patient required cardiac pacing. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between patients with or without bradycardic events. CONCLUSION: Relevant arrhythmias are common in severely ill ICU patients with COVID-19. They are associated with worse courses of disease and require specific treatment.

Aside from COVID-19, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and the first among Hispanic Americans. The Hispanic population is the largest minority group in the United States, which is rapidly growing in size. Unfortunately, U.S. Hispanics and other minority groups experience many different health disparities, resulting in poor survival outcomes and a reduced quality of life. Factors such as genomic mutations, lower socioeconomic status, lack of education, reduced access to health care, comorbidities, and environmental factors all contribute to these health-care inequalities. In the context of blood cancer health disparities, Hispanic patients are often diagnosed at a younger age and have worse outcomes compared with non-Hispanic individuals. In this commentary, we highlight the existing knowledge about cancer health disparities in the Hispanic population, with a focus on chronic and acute leukemia. In our experience at the U.S./Mexican border, analysis of several different blood cancers demonstrated that younger Hispanic patients with acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia have higher incidence rates and worse prognoses. A combined approach, involving improved health-care access and better knowledge of the underlying factors, will allow for more timely diagnoses and the development of intervention strategies aimed at reducing or eliminating the disparities.","Bencomo-Alvarez, Alfonso E; Rubio, Andres J; Gonzalez, Mayra A; Eiring, Anna M",Cold Spring Harb. mol. case stud,,664

261172,Characteristics and outcomes of 241 births to women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection at five New York city medical centers,2020,"BACKGROUND: To this end, the influence of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their neonates is not completely clear. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Besides, it investigates the likelihood of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from pregnant women to their neonates. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in three medical centers during the period from March to November 2020. Data were collected from the available medical records in the respective hospitals using a standardized questionnaire on maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes. All pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection across the three hospitals and their neonates were eligible to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics were presented as a median and interquartile range (IQR) or frequencies and percentages as appropriate using SPSS 24.0 software. RESULTS: This study has identified a total of 288 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection over the study period of a median age of 30 years and median GA at diagnosis 38 weeks (IQR: 39 -33) as well as 27% of them were obese (n=78). The majority of pregnant women were symptomatic with cough (n=92, 31.9%) being the most frequent COVID-19 symptom followed by fever and dyspnea (n=36, 12.5%). Two-hundred and four pregnant delivered (70.84%) and caesarean sections were prevalent among 35.8% of them. The most common adverse pregnancy outcome was premature (n=31, 15.5%), followed by fetal distress (n=13, 6.5%), preeclampsia (n=4, 2.0%), and one pregnant woman died. The laboratory results exhibit that temperature higher than 38 (n=27), leukopenia (n=19), neutropenia (n=54), ALT (n=12), AST (n=31), and thrombocytopenia (n=35) were less frequent among pregnant women while lymphopenia (n=126), hemoglobin levels lower than 13.0 (n=218), deceased albumin levels (n=195) were most frequent among them. However, a small proportion of pregnant women were admitted to the ICU (3.8%). The most frequent maternal treatments were antibiotics (n=81), antiviral (n=49), and corticosteroid (n=24). Of 204 neonates, four had died and all the remaining neonates were alive. The median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (IQR: 35-40). Most neonates had normal laboratory results. However, 14 had lymphopenia (7.0%), 22 had neutropenia (11.0%), and 11 had thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Four infants had low hemoglobin levels of less than 13.0 (2.0%) and 81 had hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., total bilirubin of higher than 23; 40.5%). Approximately less than one-half of neonates required admission to the NICU (n=86, 43%), 7% of them required respiratory support of mechanical ventilation, and none of them get infected with COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study suggests that the majority of pregnant women had mild or moderate disease symptoms. Nevertheless, this study did not find any evidence of possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from mothers to their babies. This study may provide a baseline for further studies focusing on investigating long-term maternal and neonate's outcomes and possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mothers to their newborn babies.","Al-Matary, Abdulrahman; Almatari, Faeza; Al-Matary, Mariam; AlDhaefi, Alaa; Alqahtani, Mohammed Hassan S; Alhulaimi, Emad Ahmad; AlOtaiby, Shahad; Almehiny, Khowlah; John, Lincy Soosan; Alanazi, Faisal Samah; Azad, Aisha; Aldandan, Faisal K",J Infect Public Health,,664

Active commuting (walking/bicycling to get from one place to another) may benefit health through increased physical activity, but most evidence of its correlates come from urban studies. This study aimed to investigate associations between active commuting, socio-demographic characteristics, behaviours, total physical activity and health in a regional/rural Australian state. METHODS: This study used data from the 2016 Tasmanian Population Health Survey, a representative cross-sectional self-report survey of 6,300 adults in Tasmania, Australia. Logistic regression modelling investigated associations between socio-demographic, behavioural and health characteristics and past week active commuting frequency. RESULTS: In multivariable models, being younger, having tertiary qualifications, living in a socio-economically advantaged area, being physically active, having a healthy body mass index, and good/excellent self-rated health were associated with engaging in more active commuting. Inner regional dwellers were no more likely than outer regional dwellers to actively commute after covariate adjustment. CONCLUSION: Strategies to promote active commuting in regional/rural areas might consider targeting older adults, those less educated, those living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas, those less physically active, those with poorer health, and those with higher body mass index. Research could further investigate why these groups appear to be less active for commuting purposes. SO WHAT?: Increasing physical activity and active commuting may help to reduce rates of preventable common diseases in regional/remote areas.","Stanesby, Oliver; Long, Michael; Ball, Kylie; Blizzard, Leigh; Cocker, Fiona; Greaves, Stephen; Harpur, Siobhan; Johnston, Fay; Jose, Kim; Marshall, Elaine; Palmer, Andrew J; Sharman, Melanie; Venn, Alison; Williams, Julie; Cleland, Verity",Health promotion journal of Australia :official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,,664

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The women diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized at a tertiary hospital were included. They completed the Introductory Data Form, the Female Sexual Function Index-(FSFI), and the Short Form-36 Quality of Life Scale (SF-36). RESULTS: 15 women between the ages of 19-49 who completed the treatment protocol, discharged at least 14 days before, and who had not been diagnosed as sexual dysfunction sexually active earlier were included to the study. It was detected that weekly sexual intercourse before and after COVID-19 significantly differed (p=0.047). The frequency of relationships decreased statistically after COVID-19. The mean value of the FSFI satisfaction score differs from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p=0.012). The mean satisfaction score before COVID-19 was 3.47, and after COVID-19 was 2.93. The score of the subgroups of FSFI did not differ from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p>0.050). The median value of SF-36 pain differs from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual satisfaction in women decreased after COVID-19 disease, and the quality of life scores did not change in a statistically significant way.","Kaya, Yeliz; Kaya, Coskun; Tahta, Tugba; Kartal, Tugba; Tokgöz, V Yavuz",Int J Clin Pract,,664
273450,Predicting the recombination potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: The home environment is an important facilitator of young child movement behaviors, including physical activity (PA), sleep, and screen-time. Household chaos, characterized by crowding, noise, and disorder in the home, may hinder efforts to obtain adequate amounts of movement behaviors. The COVID-19 outbreak impacted many families, and social distancing during this time may create conditions for more household chaos. Family routines can help establish order in the home and encourage an appropriate balance of movement behaviors, such as less screen-time and more sleep. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between household chaos and young child movement behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, and the role of family routines in this relationship. METHODS: A national online survey including 1836 mothers of preschoolers (3.0-5.9 years) was conducted during May 2020. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, family routines, and the preschooler's movement behaviors during the outbreak. Mothers completed a household chaos questionnaire and were grouped into chaos categories (low, moderate/low, moderate/high, and high) for analysis. Linear regression was used to assess the association between chaos category, family routines, and movement behaviors with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Mothers were 35.9 ± 4.1 years of age, middle income (47.8%), and preschoolers were 3.8 ± 0.8 years of age. Most mothers reported their preschooler was less physically active (38.9%), slept the same amount of time (52.1%), and increased their screen-time (74.0%) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Preschoolers in the high chaos households performed less total PA (ß = - 0.36 days/week, 95% CI:-0.62 to - 0.09, p = 0.008), slept less (ß = - 0.42 h, 95% CI:-0.59 to - 0.25, p = 0.001) and had more screen-time (ß = 0.69 h, 95% CI:0.45 to 0.92, p = 0.001) compared to those in low chaos households. In most chaos categories, having a bed-time ritual was related to more child sleep, and mothers who viewed routines as ""less/not important"" reported more preschooler screen-time compared to mothers who viewed routines as ""very important"". CONCLUSION: Promoting bed-time rituals and prioritizing routines, even somewhat, may be related to an improved balance of child movement behaviors. Innovative measures are needed to support families during periods of disruption such as that experienced in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kracht, Chelsea L; Katzmarzyk, Peter T; Staiano, Amanda E",BMC Public Health,,664
277652,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"BACKGROUND: RT-qPCR is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment, time consuming, high cost and skilled staff limit the use of these techniques. A more rapid and high-throughput method is essential. METHODS: We analyzed clinical data and nasopharyngeal samples, collected during September 2020, from patients attended at the emergency department of a secondary hospital and in two primary healthcare centers in Madrid. The performance of the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 AG Rapid Test Device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was compared to RT-qPCR. RESULTS: 255 nasopharyngeal swabs, including 150 from the emergency department and 105 from primary helthcare centers, were tested. 184 patients were symptomatic (72.1 %). Amongst the 60 positive RT-qPCR samples, 40 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 73.3 %. All the samples detected positive with the rapid antigen test were also positive with RT-qPCR. The median cycle threshold was 23.28 (IQR 18.5-30.16). Patients with less than seven days onset of symptoms showed a higher viral load, and sensitivity for rapid antigen test (86.5 %), compared to those with more days (sensitivity of 53.8 %)(pâ¯<â¯0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid antigen test evaluated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads. This assay seems to be an effective strategy for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic for the rapid identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","Linares, Manuel; Pérez-Tanoira, Ramón; Carrero, Ana; Romanyk, Juan; Pérez-García, Felipe; Gómez-Herruz, Peña; Arroyo, Teresa; Cuadros, Juan",J Clin Virol,,664

We employed cross-lagged panel models to analyze a sample of 4232 unique participants aged 65 years and older from three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Physical activity and social participation were tested as potential mediators between physical and cognitive function. Our findings revealed a reciprocal relationship between physical and cognitive function and a reciprocal relationship between physical and cognitive decline. Moreover, physical activity was confirmed to mediate the bidirectional association between physical and cognitive function, whereas social participation did not seem to be a mediator. A vicious cycle linking physical and cognitive decline may exist in Chinese older adults. However, leading a physically active lifestyle could be an effective intervention to slow physical and cognitive aging, thereby toning down the vicious cycle.","Zhao, Xiaohang; Jin, Lei; Sun, Skylar Biyang",Int J Aging Hum Dev,,664

285083,Ingavirin might be a promising agent to combat Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"Carbenoxolone (CBX) is a semi-synthetic plant derivative with pleiotropic pharmacological properties like anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities. Though approved for treatment of gastric ulcers, its use is limited due to adverse effects such as cytotoxicity. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a natural, non-toxic protein with high water-solubility and low immunogenicity, and is widely used as a nanocarrier for targeted drug delivery. In the present study, controlled release BSA-CBX nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by desolvation method to reduce drug cytotoxicity. These NPs showed desirable physicochemical properties such as particle size (â¼240 nm), polydispersity index (0.08), zeta potential (-7.12 mV), drug encapsulation efficiency (72 %), and were stable for at least 3 months at room temperature. The drug was released from the BSA-CBX NPs in a biphasic manner in vitro following non-fickian diffusion. Computational analysis determined that the binding between BSA and CBX occurred through van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds with 93 % steric stability. Further, the cytotoxic assays demonstrated â¼1.8-4.9-fold reduction in cytotoxicity using three human cell lines (A549, MCF-7, and U-87). Subsequently, this novel CBX formulation with BSA as an efficient carrier can potentially be used for diverse biomedical applications.","Bharathala, Subhashini; Kotarkonda, Lakshmi Kanth; Singh, Vijay Pal; Singh, Rajni; Sharma, Pankaj",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,664
285260,How Could In Vitro Antiviral Activity Be Applied to Optimize the Dosing Regimens of Candidates for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)?,2020,"Objective: As of January 2020, there were 2,519 confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases with 866 deaths across 27 countries. Most of these cases (2,121) were reported in KSA. Since the initial identification of MERS, few studies have investigated the role of comorbidities that could potentially lead to mortality in cases of the infectious disease. This study aimed to examine the association between comorbidities and MERS mortality in KSA. Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study. We retrieved the data published by the World Health Organization (WHO) between January 2017 and November 2019, and analysed the association between comorbidities and mortality. Results: We found 572 MERS-CoV cases reported by WHO in KSA during the defined period. Of these, 387 (68%) had a history of chronic illness. The overall mortality rate was found to be 25%. Diabetes mellitus was the most prevalent comorbidity-the mortality rate in the diabetics was 32% as opposed to 12% in the non-diabetics (p-value <0.01). Hypertension was second, with a mortality rate of 35%, as opposed to 15% in the non-hypertensive patients (p-value <0.001). The mortality rate in cases with cardiovascular disease was 39% as opposed to 21% in those without cardiovascular disease (p-value <0.05). Conclusion: Our study shows that MERS-CoV had a significant case fatality rate in patients with comorbidities. Thus, it will be beneficial if future clinical trials for MERS-CoV examine the impact of improved societal infection control measures such as social distancing and masks, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, on the prevalence and incidence of MERS and its clinical outcomes.","Alotaibi, Mohammad H; Bahammam, Salman A",,,664
287697,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging technology is being developed to enable non-invasive mapping of the latency distribution of cortical projection pathways in white matter, and correlative clinical neurophysiological techniques would be valuable for mutual verification. Interhemispheric interaction through the corpus callosum can be measured with interhemispheric facilitation and inhibition using transcranial magnetic stimulation. OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for determining the latency distribution of the transcallosal fibers with transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS: We measured the precise time courses of interhemispheric facilitation and inhibition with a conditioning-test paired-pulse magnetic stimulation paradigm. The conditioning stimulus was applied to the right primary motor cortex and the test stimulus was applied to the left primary motor cortex. The interstimulus interval was set at 0.1 ms resolution. The proportions of transcallosal fibers with different conduction velocities were calculated by measuring the changes in magnitudes of interhemispheric facilitation and inhibition with interstimulus interval. RESULTS: Both interhemispheric facilitation and inhibition increased with increment in interstimulus interval. The magnitude of interhemispheric facilitation was correlated with that of interhemispheric inhibition. The latency distribution of transcallosal fibers measured with interhemispheric facilitation was also correlated with that measured with interhemispheric inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The data can be interpreted as latency distribution of transcallosal fibers. Interhemispheric interaction measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising technique to determine the latency distribution of the transcallosal fibers. Similar techniques could be developed for other cortical pathways.","Ni, Zhen; Leodori, Giorgio; Vial, Felipe; Zhang, Yong; Avram, Alexandru V; Pajevic, Sinisa; Basser, Peter J; Hallett, Mark",Brain Stimul,,664

After second vaccination, BNT162b2 generated higher peak levels than ChAdOX1. Antibody levels declined faster at older ages than younger ages with BNT162b2, but were similar across ages with ChAdOX1. With both vaccines, prior infection significantly increased antibody peak level and half-life. Protection was estimated to last for 0.5-1 year after ChAdOx1 and >1 year after BNT162b2, but could be reduced against emerging variants. Reducing the dosing interval to 8 weeks for both vaccines or further to 3 weeks for BNT162b2 may help increase short-term protection against the Delta variant.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. RESULTS: In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy).

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. RESULTS: In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies.

The presence of the virus within peritoneal fluid and the peritoneal tissues is not known. We report an asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patient who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with negative peritoneal sampling for SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a standard 3 port laparoscopic surgery samples peritoneal fluid, peritoneal brushings, and surgical smoke plum were collected. Specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction targeting SARS-CoV-2 were used to detect the presence of the virus in the samples. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on multiple samples of the peritoneum in an asymptomatic patient. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 was not found in the peritoneum of a single patient with asymptomatic infection. Further studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 surgical candidates are needed to address safety concerns.","Romero-Velez, Gustavo; Pereira, Xavier; Zenilman, Ariela; Camacho, Diego",Surg. laparosc. endosc. percutaneous tech,,664
302818,Preclinical development of a molecular clamp-stabilised subunit vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2021,"In the current age of overwhelming information and massive production of textual data on the Web, Event Detection has become an increasingly important task in various application domains. Several research branches have been developed to tackle the problem from different perspectives, including Natural Language Processing and Big Data analysis, with the goal of providing valuable resources to support decision-making in a wide variety of fields. In this paper, we propose a real-time domain-specific clustering-based event-detection approach that integrates textual information coming, on one hand, from traditional newswires and, on the other hand, from microblogging platforms. The goal of the implemented pipeline is twofold: (i) providing insights to the user about the relevant events that are reported in the press on a daily basis;(ii) alerting the user about potentially important and impactful events, referred to as hot events, for some specific tasks or domains of interest. The algorithm identifies clusters of related news stories published by globally renowned press sources, which guarantee authoritative, noise-free information about current affairs;subsequently, the content extracted from microblogs is associated to the clusters in order to gain an assessment of the relevance of the event in the public opinion. To identify the events of a day d we create the lexicon by looking at news articles and stock data of previous days up to d−1 Although the approach can be extended to a variety of domains (e.g. politics, economy, sports), we hereby present a specific implementation in the financial sector. We validated our solution through a qualitative and quantitative evaluation, performed on the Dow Jones’ Data, News and Analytics dataset, on a stream of messages extracted from the microblogging platform Stocktwits, and on the Standard & Poor’s 500 index time-series. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal in extracting meaningful information from real-world events and in spotting hot events in the financial sphere. An added value of the evaluation is given by the visual inspection of a selected number of significant real-world events, starting from the Brexit Referendum and reaching until the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.","Carta, Salvatore Consoli Sergio Piras Luca Podda Alessandro Sebastian Recupero Diego Reforgiato",PeerJ Computer Science,,664

302984,The Liver in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) Infection,2020,"Recent reports have suggested COVID-19 relapse or reinfection may lead to readmission, which may cause a diagnostic challenge between recently infected patients and reinfections. Compounding this problem is the post-viral lung sequela that may be expected after COVID-19 pneumonia, similar to both SARS and MERS. Although chest imaging may play a role in the diagnosis of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, reinfection or relapse of COVID-19 will have similar imaging findings. A ""new-baseline"" imaging can be obtained from COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital discharge or clinical recovery. This new reference can not only determine if readmissions are from relapse or reinfection of COVID-19, resolving COVID-19 or potentially a different viral infection (influenza), but also for long term sequela of COVID-19 lung infection. Strategic use of imaging before discharge may be helpful in the subset of the population at the highest risk of a secondary viral infection such as influenza. Determining the residual abnormalities in post-discharge imaging can guide us in the long-term management of patients for many years to come.","Katal, Sanaz; Myers, Lee; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,,664

Multimodal monitoring of patients with COVID-19 may delineate the specific features of COVID-19-related encephalopathy and guide clinical management. Objectives: To investigate clinical, biological, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in association with electroencephalographic (EEG) features for patients with COVID-19, and to better refine the features of COVID-19-related encephalopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted in Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, enrolled 78 hospitalized adults who received a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) and underwent EEG between March 30 and June 11, 2020. Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay or, in the case of associated pneumonia, on a computed tomography scan of the chest. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data on the clinical and paraclinical features of the 78 patients with COVID-19 were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results: Of 644 patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19, 78 (57 men [73%]; mean [SD] age, 61 [12] years) underwent EEG. The main indications for EEG were delirium, seizure-like events, and delayed awakening in the intensive care unit after stopping treatment with sedatives. Sixty-nine patients showed pathologic EEG findings, including metabolic-toxic encephalopathy features, frontal abnormalities, periodic discharges, and epileptic activities. Of 57 patients who underwent brain MRI, 41 showed abnormalities, including perfusion abnormalities, acute ischemic lesions, multiple microhemorrhages, and white matter-enhancing lesions. Fifty-five patients showed biological abnormalities, including dysnatremia, kidney failure, and liver dysfunction, the same day as the EEG. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis were negative for SARS-Cov-2 for all tested patients. Nine patients who had no identifiable cause of brain injury outside COVID-19 were further isolated; their brain injury was defined as COVID-19-related encephalopathy. They represented 1% (9 of 644) of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Six of these 9 patients had movement disorders, 7 had frontal syndrome, 4 had brainstem impairment, 4 had periodic EEG discharges, and 3 had MRI white matter-enhancing lesions. Conclusions and Relevance: The results from this cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suggest there are clinical, EEG, and MRI patterns that could delineate specific COVID-19-related encephalopathy and guide treatment strategy.","Lambrecq, Virginie; Hanin, Aurélie; Munoz-Musat, Esteban; Chougar, Lydia; Gassama, Salimata; Delorme, Cécile; Cousyn, Louis; Borden, Alaina; Damiano, Maria; Frazzini, Valerio; Huberfeld, Gilles; Landgraf, Frank; Nguyen-Michel, Vi-Huong; Pichit, Phintip; Sangare, Aude; Chavez, Mario; Morélot-Panzini, Capucine; Morawiec, Elise; Raux, Mathieu; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Rufat, Pierre; Galanaud, Damien; Corvol, Jean-Christophe; Lubetzki, Catherine; Rohaut, Benjamin; Demeret, Sophie; Pyatigorskaya, Nadya; Naccache, Lionel; Navarro, Vincent",JAMA Netw Open,,664

Schools were tasked with providing remote instruction to students, and many of these children continued to require mental and behavioral health services provided by school psychologists. In this study, 675 school psychologists were surveyed across the United States to examine how their roles and responsibilities changed as a result of COVID-19. Participants reported the perceived impact of COVID-19 on students? mental health and difficulty serving students and families, as well as their concerns and recommendations pertaining to school reentry. Overall, respondents in this study reported that their roles and responsibilities notably changed because of COVID-19. Participants noted their belief that children and educators will need increased mental health support upon returning to school. Implications for future practice and research are discussed.","Schaffer, Gary E.; Power, Elizebeth M.; Fisk, Amy K.; Trolian, Teniell L.",Psychology in the Schools,,664

This research statement presents an analysis of the Dutch public debate on Corona-apps by using the framework of Orders of Worth by Boltanski and Thévenot (1991). It argues that this framework can help us to move beyond the dichotomy of privacy vs. public health by recognizing a plurality of conceptions of the common good in the debate about contact-tracing apps.

We examined the association between COVID-19 at delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal complications, and severe illness, whether these associations differ by race/ethnicity; and described discharge status by COVID-19 diagnosis and maternal complications. METHODS: Data from 703 hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database during March-September 2020 were included. Adjusted risk ratios overall and stratified by race/ethnicity were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Proportion not discharged home was calculated by maternal complications, stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 489,471 delivery hospitalizations, 6,550 (1.3%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis. In adjusted models, COVID-19 was associated with increased risk for: acute respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 34.4), death (aRR = 17.0), sepsis (aRR = 13.6), mechanical ventilation (aRR = 12.7), shock (aRR = 5.1), intensive care unit admission (aRR = 3.6), acute renal failure (aRR = 3.5), thromboembolic disease (aRR = 2.7), adverse cardiac event/outcome (aRR = 2.2) and preterm labor with preterm delivery (aRR = 1.2). Risk for any maternal complications or for any severe illness did not significantly differ by race/ethnicity. Discharge status did not differ by COVID-19; however, among women with concurrent maternal complications, a greater proportion of those with (versus without) COVID-19 were not discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the importance of implementing recommended mitigation strategies to reduce risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and further inform counseling and clinical care for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ko, Jean Y; DeSisto, Carla L; Simeone, Regina M; Ellington, Sascha; Galang, Romeo R; Oduyebo, Titilope; Gilboa, Suzanne M; Lavery, Amy M; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Shapiro-Mendoza, Carrie K",Clin. infect. dis,,664

A dedicated radiologist reviewed CTPA images to assess PTE presence/extension.From March 1 to April 30, 2020, 45 patients were included (34 men, median age 67 years, interquartile range [IQR] 60-76). Twenty-seven (60%) had PTE signs at CTPA, 17/27 (63%) with bilateral involvement, none with main branch PTE. In 33/45 patients (73%) patients LL-US was performed before CTPA, with 3 patients having superficial vein thrombosis (9%, none with CTPA-confirmed PTE) and 1 patient having deep vein thrombosis (3%, with CTPA-confirmed PTE).

338993,Mutational heterogeneity in spike glycoproteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2021,"Since its emergence in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global pandemic within a matter of months. While subunit vaccines are one of the prominent options for combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the immunogenicity of spike protein-based antigens remains unknown. When immunized in mice, the S1 domain induced much higher IgG and IgA antibody levels than the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and more efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 when adjuvanted with alum. It is inferred that a large proportion of these neutralization epitopes are located in the S1 domain but outside the RBD and that some of these are spatial epitopes. This finding indicates that expression systems with posttranslational modification abilities are important to maintain the natural configurations of recombinant spike protein antigens and are critical for effective COVID-19 vaccines. Further, adjuvants prone to a Th1 response should be considered for S1-based subunit COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.","Wang, Yunfei; Wang, Lichun; Cao, Han; Liu, Cunbao",J. med. virol,,664

The video is aimed at presenting the surgical management of persistent groin pain and inability to walk after transobturator sling placement and subsequent partial removal. METHODS: The featured patient is a 31-year-old woman unable to walk after transobturator sling implantation 2 years before. She reported left thigh pain immediately after surgery that was not responsive to postoperative medication. Six months later, suburethral portion excision was performed but no pain relief was obtained. She was unable to walk, and needed a wheelchair. Electromyography showed axonal injury of the left obturator nerve. After providing proper informed consent, the patient was admitted for combined transvaginal and transcutaneous transobturator tape arm removal. RESULTS: The featured procedure was completed in 120 min and blood loss was <100 ml. No surgical complications were observed. The patient is currently doing left leg rehabilitation, has regained the ability to walk with the aid of a crutch, and the need for chronic pain control medication is greatly reduced. CONCLUSION: This represents a valid surgical approach for the late management of this mesh-related complication.","Milani, Rodolfo; Barba, Marta; Manodoro, Stefano; Locatelli, Luca; Palmieri, Stefania; Frigerio, Matteo",Int Urogynecol J,,664
339780,In silico identification and validation of triarylchromones as potential inhibitor against main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To measure temporal trends in survival over time in people with severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring critical care (high dependency unit or ICU) management, and to assess whether temporal variation in mortality was explained by changes in patient demographics and comorbidity burden over time. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort; based on data reported to the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System. The primary outcome was in-hospital 30-day all-cause mortality. Unadjusted survival was estimated by calendar week of admission, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted survival, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, major comorbidities, and geographical region. SETTING: One hundred eight English critical care units. PATIENTS: All adult (18 yr +) coronavirus disease 2019 specific critical care admissions between March 1, 2020, and June 27, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one thousand eighty-two critical care patients (high dependency unit n = 15,367; ICU n = 5,715) were included. Unadjusted survival at 30 days was lowest for people admitted in late March in both high dependency unit (71.6% survival) and ICU (58.0% survival). By the end of June, survival had improved to 92.7% in high dependency unit and 80.4% in ICU. Improvements in survival remained after adjustment for patient characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, and major comorbidities) and geographical region. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a substantial improvement in survival amongst people admitted to critical care with coronavirus disease 2019 in England, with markedly higher survival rates in people admitted in May and June compared with those admitted in March and April. Our analysis suggests this improvement is not due to temporal changes in the age, sex, ethnicity, or major comorbidity burden of admitted patients.","Dennis, John M; McGovern, Andrew P; Vollmer, Sebastian J; Mateen, Bilal A",Crit. care med,,664

The study involved 76 patients. Patients of group 1 had their teeth whitened by the Amazing White Universal Extra photochemical activation system, and group 2 had their teeth whitened by the Beyond Polus system. Each group was divided into 3 more subgroups depending on the method of remineralization and the applied toothpaste (SENSITIVE ULTRA and SENSODYNE Rapid Relief). To assess teeth hyperesthesia before, immediately after and 14 days after the bleaching procedure, we used the prevalence index of teeth hyperesthesia, the intensity index of teeth hyperesthesia, and the Schiff sample. We also used a digital rating scale for patients. 100 teeth extracted for orthodontic indications were subjected to histological examination. The occurrence of hyperesthesia of teeth during professional bleaching was revealed in 100% of cases. Significant structural changes were registered in the enamel and dentin of the teeth, most pronounced during photo-whitening. The treatment based on zinc-substituted hydroxyapatite carbonate in combination with laserophonophoresis against the background of use the toothpaste SENSODYNE Rapid Relief had the greatest remineralizing effect.","Uspenskaya, O A; Trefilova, O V; Shevchenko, E A",Stomatologiia (Mosk),,664

In addition, richer prefectures with higher incomes were better able to contain the virus at the early stages of community transmission.

When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, it acquired deletions surrounding the FCS. We studied the viral transcriptome in Vero cell-derived SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability of the FCS. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the FCS region: a 12 amino acid deletion (678TNSPRRAR&#8595;SVAS689) that contains the underlined FCS and a 5 amino acid deletion (675QTQTN679) that is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions from 11 infected HAE-ALI cultures of both healthy and lung disease donors revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the FCS stably in 9 HAE-ALI cultures but with 2 exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are retained at a high rate of >40% after infection of &#8805;13 days. Our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is likely donor dependent.IMPORTANCE Polarized human airway epithelia at an air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) are an in vitro model that supports efficient infection of SARS-CoV-2. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin cleavage site (FCS) at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV. However, FCS deletion mutants have been identified in patients and in vitro cell cultures, and how the airway epithelial cells maintain the unique FCS remains unknown. We found that HAE-ALI cultures were capable of suppressing two prevalent FCS deletion mutants (&#916;678TNSPRRAR&#8595;SVAS689 and &#916;675QTQTN679) that were selected during propagation in Vero cells. While such suppression was observed in 9 out of 11 of the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from independent donors, 2 exceptions that retained a high rate of FCS deletions were also found. Our results present evidence of the donor-dependent properties of human airway epithelia in the evolution of the FCS during infection.","Zou, Wei; Xiong, Min; Hao, Siyuan; Zhang, Elizabeth Yan; Baumlin, Nathalie; Kim, Michael D; Salathe, Matthias; Yan, Ziying; Qiu, Jianming",mBio (Online),,664

In this study, we report the findings of a survey investigating the rapid transition to emergency remote teaching in the early weeks of the pandemic at public and private post-secondary institutions in the United States. Participants consisted of 897 faculty and administrators at 672 U.S. institutions. Findings reveal that with few exceptions nearly all reporting institutions transitioned to emergency teaching and learning approaches. Administrators reported that faculty with and without online teaching experience pivoted to online teaching, and nearly all administrators indicated that those who did not have online teaching experience were in the process of learning how to teach online. Regardless of whether faculty had previous experience teaching online or not, many faculty reported that they were using new teaching methods. A majority of faculty reported making changes to their assignments or exams as a result of transitioning to a new mode of delivery. Nearly half reported lowering the expected volume of work for students (including dropping assignments or exams) and/or shifting to a pass/fail model for this semester. The primary areas where faculty and administrators identified a need for assistance related to student support, greater access to online digital materials, and guidance for working from home. This study provides an early snapshot of efforts towards teaching and learning continuity at a large scale and provides some insights for future research and practice.","Johnson, Nicole; Veletsianos, George; Seaman, Jeff",Online Learn.

As deterministic models based on predicted population changes have been problematic, there remains a need for more precise and reliable prediction of use. Here, we develop three new time-series methods to predict red cell use 4 to 52 weeks ahead. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From daily aggregates of red blood cell (RBC) units issued from 2005 to 2011 from the NHS Blood and Transplant, we generated a new set of non-overlapping weekly data by summing the daily data over 7 days and derived the average blood use per week over 4-week and 52-week periods. We used three new methods for linear prediction of blood use by computing the coefficients using Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) algorithm. RESULTS: We optimized the time-window size, order of the prediction, and order of the polynomial fit for our data set. By exploiting the annual periodicity of the data, we achieved significant improvements in long-term predictions, as well as modest improvements in short-term predictions. The new methods predicted mean RBC use with a standard deviation of the percentage error of 2.5% for 4 weeks ahead and 3.4% for 52 weeks ahead. CONCLUSION: This paradigm allows short- and long-term prediction of RBC use and could provide reliable and precise prediction up to 52 weeks ahead to improve the efficiency of blood services and sufficiency of blood supply with reduced costs.","Nandi, Anita K; Roberts, David J; Nandi, Asoke K",Transfusion,,664

The mental health impacts of the pandemic, the recession, and the resulting social dislocation will depend on the extent to which care systems will become overwhelmed and on the strategic investments made across the system to effectively respond. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the impact of strengthening the mental health system through technology-enabled care coordination on mental health and suicide outcomes. METHODS: A system dynamics model for the regional population catchment of North Coast New South Wales, Australia, was developed that incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and suicidal behavior. The model reproduced historic time series data across a range of outcomes and was used to evaluate the relative impact of a set of scenarios on attempted suicide (ie, self-harm hospitalizations), suicide deaths, mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations, and psychological distress over the period from 2021 to 2030. These scenarios include (1) business as usual, (2) increase in service capacity growth rate by 20%, (3) standard telehealth, and (4) technology-enabled care coordination. Each scenario was tested using both pre- and post-COVID-19 social and economic conditions. RESULTS: Technology-enabled care coordination was forecast to deliver a reduction in self-harm hospitalizations and suicide deaths by 6.71% (95% interval 5.63%-7.87%), mental health-related ED presentations by 10.33% (95% interval 8.58%-12.19%), and the prevalence of high psychological distress by 1.76 percentage points (95% interval 1.35-2.32 percentage points). Scenario testing demonstrated that increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth had substantially lower impacts. This pattern of results was replicated under post-COVID-19 conditions with technology-enabled care coordination being the only tested scenario, which was forecast to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health and suicide. CONCLUSIONS: The use of technology-enabled care coordination is likely to improve mental health and suicide outcomes. The substantially lower effectiveness of targeting individual components of the mental health system (ie, increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth) reiterates that strengthening the whole system has the greatest impact on patient outcomes. Investments into more of the same types of programs and services alone will not be enough to improve outcomes; instead, new models of care and the digital infrastructure to support them and their integration are needed.","Iorfino, Frank; Occhipinti, Jo-An; Skinner, Adam; Davenport, Tracey; Rowe, Shelley; Prodan, Ante; Sturgess, Julie; Hickie, Ian B",J Med Internet Res,,664
382764,In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"Supervised learning, while prevalent for information cascade modeling, often requires abundant labeled data in training, and the trained model is not easy to generalize across tasks and datasets. Semi-supervised learning facilitates unlabeled data for cascade understanding in pre-training. It often learns fine-grained feature-level representations, which can easily result in overfitting for downstream tasks. Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning is designed to alleviate these two fundamental issues in linguistic and visual tasks. However, its direct applicability for cascade modeling, especially graph cascade related tasks, remains underexplored. In this work, we present Contrastive Cascade Graph Learning (CCGL), a novel framework for cascade graph representation learning in a contrastive, self-supervised, and task-agnostic way. In particular, CCGL first designs an effective data augmentation strategy to capture variation and uncertainty. Second, it learns a generic model for graph cascade tasks via self-supervised contrastive pre-training using both unlabeled and labeled data. Third, CCGL learns a task-specific cascade model via fine-tuning using labeled data.

The impact of these on living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) activity and outcome is not known. We performed LDLT only for sick or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in this period, with special COVID protocols. Methods: Patients undergoing LDLT counseling, evaluation and transplant in the period March to June 2020 (group A) under COVID-19 restrictions and special protocols were included. LDLT activity and outcomes among these patients was compared to those in the same period in 2019 (group B). Results: In the period March 15-June 10, we performed 39 and 23 (59%) LDLTs in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The adult patients with cirrhosis in-group A (n=20) had significantly higher MELD score, 19.8±7.0 versus 16.1±5.6 in-group B (n=36), p=0.034. Early recipient mortality was similar in 2019 (2/39) and 2020 (2/23). One out of 23 post-transplant recipients, 3/71 recipients and donors during evaluation, and 8/125 health care workers (HCWs) developed COVID-19, all of whom recovered uneventfully. Conclusion: LDLT activity substantially reduced during the COVID era. The incidence and outcome of COVID-19 among the waiting or transplanted patients and HCWs was similar to the general population. The outcome after LDLT in the COVID era was similar to non-COVID times. These data suggest that LDLT may be extended to more stable patients with strict protocols.","Soin, Arvinder S; Choudhary, Narendra S; Yadav, Sanjay K; Saigal, Sanjiv; Saraf, Neeraj; Rastogi, Amit; Bhangui, Prashant; Srinivasan, Thiagarajan; Mohan, Neelam; Saha, Sujeet K; Gupta, Ankur; Chaudhary, Rohan J; Yadav, Kamal; Dhampalwar, Swapnil; Govil, Deepak; Gupta, Nikunj; Vohra, Vijay",,,664

The former measurements were used to determine the dissociation degree of CTAB in a confined geometry, in a thin common black film (CBF). The latter measurements allowed us to determine the electrolyte concentration at which a Newton black film (NBF) is formed and to study the influence the foam film type (CBF or NBF) has on the stability of the respective foam. Last but not least, CBFs were studied in a temperature gradient and it was found that water diffuses from cold to hot regions which can be explained with a negative Soret coefficient of HO. All of these examples demonstrate that - curves provide much more information about foam films than simply the interaction forces.","Schulze-Schlarmann, Judith; Buchavzov, Natalie; Stubenrauch, Cosima",Soft Matter,,664
388826,Antibody profile in symptomatic/asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected Saudi persons,2021,"Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) disproportionally affect Hispanic and Latino populations, yet Hispanics/Latinos are substantially underrepresented in AD/ADRD clinical research. Diverse inclusion in trials is an ethical and scientific imperative, as underrepresentation reduces the ability to generalize study findings and treatments across populations most affected by a disease. This paper presents findings from a narrative literature review (Nâ=â210) of the current landscape of Hispanic/Latino participation in clinical research, including the challenges, facilitators, and communication channels to conduct culturally appropriate outreach efforts to increase awareness and participation of Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD clinical research studies. Many challenges identified were systemic in nature: lack of culturally relevant resources; staffing that does not represent participants' cultures/language; eligibility criteria that disproportionately excludes Hispanics/Latinos; and too few studies available in Hispanic/Latino communities. The paper also details facilitators and messaging strategies to improve engagement and interest among Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD research, starting with approaches that recognize and address the heterogeneity of the Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and then, tailor outreach activities and programs to address their diverse needs and circumstances. The needs identified in this article represent longstanding failures to improve engagement and interest among Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD research; we discuss how the field can move forward learning from the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Massett, Holly A; Mitchell, Alexandra K; Alley, Leah; Simoneau, Elizabeth; Burke, Panne; Han, Sae H; Gallop-Goodman, Gerda; McGowan, Melissa",J Alzheimers Dis,,664

Post-Exposure Prophylaxis With Ribavirin Plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Healthcare Workers,2020,"Background COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the high prevalence of delirium and delirium-related symptoms in COVID-19 patients, data and evidence-based recommendations on the pathophysiology and management of delirium are limited. Objective We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19-related delirium literature to provide a synthesis of literature on the prevalence, pathoetiology, and management of delirium in these patients. Methods Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, LitCovid, WHO-COVID-19, and Web of Science electronic databases were conducted. Grey literature was also reviewed, including preprint servers, archives, and websites of relevant organizations. Search results were limited to the English language. We included literature focused on adults with COVID-19 and delirium. Papers were excluded if they did not mention signs or symptoms of delirium. Results 229 studies described prevalence, pathoetiology, and/or management of delirium in adults with COVID-19. Delirium was rarely assessed with validated tools. Delirium affected >50% of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The etiology of COVID-19 delirium is likely multifactorial, with some evidence of direct brain effect. Prevention remains the cornerstone of management in these patients. To date, there is no evidence to suggest specific pharmacological strategies. Discussion Delirium is common in COVID-19 and may manifest from both indirect and direct effects on the central nervous system. Further research is required to investigate contributing mechanisms. As there is limited empirical literature on delirium management in COVID-19, management with non-pharmacological measures and judicious use of pharmacotherapy is suggested.","Hawkins, Michael; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Bonato, Sarah; Rajaratnam, Thiyake; Ravindran, Mithunan; Gosse, Paula; Sheehan, Kathleen Ann",J Psychosom Res,,664
390656,Rationale of the WHO document on Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) readiness and response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and of the Italian Decalogue for Prevention Departments,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Good social connection is associated with better health and wellbeing. However, social connection has distinct considerations for people living in long-term care (LTC) homes. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize research literature linking social connection to mental health outcomes, specifically among LTC residents, as well as research to identify strategies to help build and maintain social connection in this population during COVID-19. DESIGN: Scoping review. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of LTC homes, care homes, and nursing homes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Embase and Embase Classic (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid), and AgeLine (EBSCO) for research that quantified an aspect of social connection among LTC residents; we limited searches to English-language articles published from database inception to search date (July 2019). For the current analysis, we included studies that reported (1) the association between social connection and a mental health outcome, (2) the association between a modifiable risk factor and social connection, or (3) intervention studies with social connection as an outcome. From studies in (2) and (3), we identified strategies that could be implemented and adapted by LTC residents, families and staff during COVID-19 and included the articles that informed these strategies. RESULTS: We included 133 studies in our review. We found 61 studies that tested the association between social connection and a mental health outcome. We highlighted 12 strategies, informed by 72 observational and intervention studies, that might help LTC residents, families, and staff build and maintain social connection for LTC residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Published research conducted among LTC residents has linked good social connection to better mental health outcomes. Observational and intervention studies provide some evidence on approaches to address social connection in this population. Although further research is needed, it does not obviate the need to act given the sudden and severe impact of COVID-19 on social connection in LTC residents.","Bethell, Jennifer; Aelick, Katelynn; Babineau, Jessica; Bretzlaff, Monica; Edwards, Cathleen; Gibson, Josie-Lee; Hewitt Colborne, Debbie; Iaboni, Andrea; Lender, Dee; Schon, Denise; McGilton, Katherine S",J.

391911,Prevalence of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Evaluation of a Rapid MEDsan IgG Test in Children Seeking Medical Care,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Employees in non-healthcare occupations may be in several ways exposed to infectious agents. Improved knowledge about the risks is needed to identify opportunities to prevent work-related infectious diseases. The objective of the current study was to provide an updated overview of the published evidence on the exposure to pathogens among non-healthcare workers. Because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we also aimed to gain more evidence about exposure to several respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane between 2009 and 8 December 2020. The protocol was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019107265). An additional quality assessment was applied according to the Equator network guidelines. RESULTS: The systematic literature search yielded 4620 papers of which 270 met the selection and quality criteria. Infectious disease risks were described in 37 occupational groups; 18 of them were not mentioned before. Armed forces (n=36 pathogens), livestock farm labourers (n=31), livestock/dairy producers (n=26), abattoir workers (n=22); animal carers and forestry workers (both n=16) seemed to have the highest risk. In total, 111 pathogen exposures were found. Many of these occupational groups (81.1%) were exposed to respiratory tract pathogens. CONCLUSION: Many of these respiratory tract pathogens were readily transmitted where employees congregate (workplace risk factors), while worker risk factors seemed to be of increasing importance. By analysing existing knowledge of these risk factors, identifying new risks and susceptible risk groups, this review aimed to raise awareness of the issue and provide reliable information to establish more effective preventive measures.","Acke, Sofie; Couvreur, Simon; Bramer, Wichor M; Schmickler, Marie-Noëlle; De Schryver, Antoon; Haagsma, Juanita A",Occup. environ. med,,664

The identification of risk factors on progression to the severity stages is essential in providing more efficient and suitable management to COVID-19 patients. However, there is insufficient study on risk factors for severity stages of COVID-19 patients. In this study, 2959 confirmed COVID-19 patients were analyzed while using national data, COVID-19 patients Clinical Epidemiological Information provided from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The epidemiological variable, hospital room, periods from confirmation to release, initial symptom and vital signs, underlying comorbidities, and initial blood variables were used to verify the relation with progression to severity stages of COVID-19 and severe COVID-19. The chi-square test, welch test, multiple regression and logistic regression analysis were performed. The ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission rate of patients having characteristics, such as older age, male, abnormal BMI (Body Mass Index), high heart rate, high body temperature, fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, change of consciousness, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, dementia, abnormal hemoglobin, abnormal hematocrit, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, and abnormal white blood cell were high. The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were older age, shorter hospitalization, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, dyspnea, change of consciousness, and dementia. Whereas, significant predictors for progression to severity stages of COVID-19 were older age, longer period from confirmation to release, higher BMI, higher body temperature, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, fever, no sore throat, dyspnea, no headache, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), and dementia. Therefore, classifying patients with a high risk of severe stage of COVID-19 and managing patients by considering the risk factors could be helpful in the efficient management of COVID-19 patients.","Kim, Seon-Rye; Nam, Seoul-Hee; Kim, Yu-Rin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,664

METHOD: Logistic regression analyses were conducted using cross-sectional data from the 2019 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey (N = 9,819; 48% male; avg. grade level = 9th grade [SD = 1.9]) to analyze the association between sleep duration and digital self-harm. A Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) analysis was used to assess whether depressive symptoms attenuate this association. RESULTS: Bivariate results indicated that longer sleep duration was associated with lower incidence of digital self-harm. Multivariate results showed that sleep duration was inversely associated with engaging in digital self-harm, net of all covariates. Depressive symptoms attenuated the influence of sleep duration on digital self-harm by 50.72%. CONCLUSIONS: Both insufficient sleep and depressive symptoms were associated with engagement in digital self-harm among adolescents. Prospective research is needed, however, to confirm this pathway. Practitioners and clinicians should consider discussing digital self-harm with adolescents and parents, especially if adolescents are experiencing poor sleep and depressive symptoms.","Semenza, Daniel C; Meldrum, Ryan C; Testa, Alexander; Jackson, Dylan B",Child and adolescent mental health,,664

It contained a sociodemographic section, the Professional Quality of Life questionnaire V, the work engagement scale, and the scale of self-care behaviors for clinical psychologists. Results show that healthcare workers have an average quality of life with high levels of compassion satisfaction and average levels of compassion fatigue and burnout. Data also indicate that the sample frequently engaged in self-care practices and had high levels of work engagement. The regression analyses reveal that gender, the number of patients per week, the perceived fairness of the salary, among other variables are possible predictors of professional quality of life, frequency of self-care practices, and engagement. This study contributes to the understanding of these variables among healthcare professionals in Ecuador.

435081,Inhibitors of Protein Glycosylation Are Active against the Coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,2021,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 can reportedly exist on inanimate surfaces for a long duration, but there is limited data available from Italian COVID-19 hospital wards, especially for non-intensive care units hosting patients that do not require mechanical ventilation. Identification of the extent of environmental contamination can help in understanding possible virus transmission routes, limit hospital infections and protect healthcare workers. Thus, we investigated virus contamination on surfaces of the acute COVID-19 ward of an Italian hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ward surfaces, including four points inside and six points outside the patients' rooms were sampled by swabs, seven hours after routine sanitation. To minimize the risk of underestimation of virus detection, two different sensitive molecular methods were used comparatively, and specific internal controls were added to enhance the efficiency of all the analysis steps. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 contamination was detected in only three out of all the collected samples, i.e., on two floors and one-bathroom sink, likely reflecting aerosol and saliva contamination, respectively. The overall level of contamination was low, and the floors exhibited a very low level of SARS-CoV-2 presence, evidenced by only one of the two methods used. CONCLUSIONS: The existence of SARS-CoV-2 on hospital surfaces may be limited, although it was reported to persist for a longer duration on surfaces under controlled laboratory conditions. Thus, effective transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by surfaces/fomites within the hospital ward may be a rare event. However, the results highlight the importance of assessing method sensitivity and including controls when investigating low-level virus contamination so as to avoid the risk of underestimation of virus presence.","D039,; accolti, M; Soffritti, I; Passaro, A; Zuliani, G; Antonioli, P; Mazzacane, S; Manfredini, R; Caselli, E",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,664
435100,Novel ELISA Protocol Links Pre-Existing SARS-CoV-2 Reactive Antibodies With Endemic Coronavirus Immunity and Age and Reveals Improved Serologic Identification of Acute COVID-19 via Multi-Parameter Detection,2021,"Asia is a major pig producer of the world, and at present, African swine fever virus (ASFV) continues to significantly impact the Asian pig industry. Since more than 50% of the world's pig population is in Asia, ASFV outbreaks in Asia will affect the global pig industry. Prior to the introduction of ASF, several outbreaks of major swine viruses occurred in Asia over the last two decades, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). The rapid spreading of those viruses throughout Asia involve many factors such as the various pig production systems and supply chains ranging from back-yard to intensive industrial farms, animal movement and animal product trading within and among countries, and consumer behaviors. ASF has notoriously been known as a human-driven disease. Travelers and international trading are the major ASFV-carriers for the transboundary transmission and introduction to naïve countries. Globalization puts the entire pig industry at risk for ASF and other infectious diseases arising from Asian countries. Disease control strategies for the various pig production systems in Asia are challenging. In order to ensure future food security in the region and to prevent the deleterious consequences of ASF and other major viral disease outbreaks, disease control strategies and production systems must be improved and modernized.","Kedkovid, Roongtham; Sirisereewan, Chaitawat; Thanawongnuwech, Roongroje",Porcine Health Manag.,,664

A Commentary,2021,"BACKGROUND: A substantial amount of COVID-19-related data is generated by Twitter users every day. Self-reports of COVID-19 symptoms on Twitter can reveal a great deal about the disease and its prevalence in the community. In particular, self-reports can be used as a valuable resource to learn more about common symptoms and whether their order of appearance differs among different groups in the community. These data may be used to develop a COVID-19 risk assessment system that is tailored toward a specific group of people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the most common symptoms reported by patients with COVID-19, as well as the order of symptom appearance, by examining tweets in Arabic. METHODS: We searched Twitter posts in Arabic for personal reports of COVID-19 symptoms from March 1 to May 27, 2020. We identified 463 Arabic users who had tweeted about testing positive for COVID-19 and extracted the symptoms they associated with the disease. Furthermore, we asked them directly via personal messaging to rank the appearance of the first 3 symptoms they had experienced immediately before (or after) their COVID-19 diagnosis. Finally, we tracked their Twitter timeline to identify additional symptoms that were mentioned within ±5 days from the day of the first tweet on their COVID-19 diagnosis. In total, 270 COVID-19 self-reports were collected, and symptoms were (at least partially) ranked. RESULTS: The collected self-reports contained 893 symptoms from 201 (74%) male and 69 (26%) female Twitter users. The majority (n=270, 82%) of the tracked users were living in Saudi Arabia (n=125, 46%) and Kuwait (n=98, 36%). Furthermore, 13% (n=36) of the collected reports were from asymptomatic individuals. Of the 234 users with symptoms, 66% (n=180) provided a chronological order of appearance for at least 3 symptoms. Fever (n=139, 59%), headache (n=101, 43%), and anosmia (n=91, 39%) were the top 3 symptoms mentioned in the self-reports. Additionally, 28% (n=65) reported that their COVID-19 experience started with a fever, 15% (n=34) with a headache, and 12% (n=28) with anosmia. Of the 110 symptomatic cases from Saudi Arabia, the most common 3 symptoms were fever (n=65, 59%), anosmia (n=46, 42%), and headache (n=42, 38%).

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development has been progressing, but acceptance of the new vaccines by healthcare workers (HCWs) was not well known prior to approval of COVID-19 vaccines in China. What is added by this report? We found that before vaccine approval, Beijing HCWs expressed moderate willingness to get vaccinated. Factors positively influencing willingness included free vaccination and belief that the vaccine has been fully evaluated. A negatively influencing factor was presence of an underlying disease. Trust in vaccines in general was positively associated with willingness to get new vaccines. What are the implications for public health practice? COVID-19 vaccines should be provided at no cost to HCWs. Effective measures should be taken to enhance acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs in China.","Luodan, Suo Rui Ma Zhongzhan Wang Tian Tang Haihong Wang Fang Liu Jinfeng Tang Xinghui Peng Xue Guo Li Lu Xinghuo Pang",China CDC Weekly,,664

Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in 95 patients.RESULTSAntibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks after symptom onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the third month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely coinfection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival.CONCLUSIONThe measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival. The presence of partially cross-reactive antibodies with other betacoronaviruses is likely to impact on serological assay specificity and interpretation.TRIAL REGISTRATIONCOVID-19 Patients Characterization, Biobank, Treatment Response and Outcome Predictor (COVID-BioB).

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study including consecutive kidney transplant recipients in a single referral transplant centre. Participants were tested for anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies 2-4 weeks after a second vaccine dose. Primary outcome was rate of seropositivity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Of 308 kidney transplant recipients included, only 112 (36.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies 2-4 weeks after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Median antibody titre was 15.5 AU/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 3.5-163.6). Factors associated with antibody response were higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio (OR) 1.025 per mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.014-1.037, p < 0.001), lower mycophenolic acid dose (OR 2.347 per 360 mg decrease, 95%CI 1.782-3.089, p < 0.001), younger age (OR 1.032 per year decrease, 95%CI 1.015-1.05, p < 0.001) and lower calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) blood level (OR 1.987, 95%CI 1.146-3.443, p 0.014). No serious adverse events resulting from the vaccine were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients demonstrated an inadequate antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Immunosuppression level was a significant factor in this response. Strategies to improve immunogenicity should be examined in future studies.","Rozen-Zvi, Benaya; Yahav, Dafna; Agur, Timna; Zingerman, Boris; Ben-Zvi, Haim; Atamna, Alaa; Tau, Noam; Mashraki, Tiki; Nesher, Eviatar; Rahamimov, Ruth",Clin. microbiol. infect,,664

The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics defining the disease are mainly from Europe and Asia. The disease symptomatology is similar to the prevalent diseases in our environment, this could result in the delay in prompt identification and appropriate management of suspected cases toward combating community transmission. This study evaluates the prevalence, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of positive cases of COVID -19. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data on the socio-demographic, clinical characteristics and the results of the SARS-CoV-2 test of participants at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research [NIMR] Modified Drive-through Centre for COVID-19 test sample collection over two months [24th February 2020- 27th April 2020] were retrieved from the electronic medical records (EMR). Data obtained were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0. RESULTS: A total number of 481 clients were evaluated in this review. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population was 14.6%. The mean age of the positive cases was 42.2 [±15.9] years. The common symptoms reported by the positive cases were fever (40.0%), cough (32.9%), sore throat (17.1%) and running nose (15.7%). Fever depicted statistical significance with positive cases with the majority being of mild to moderate clinical severity.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted even greater expansion and implementation of teledermatology. This review discusses the research examining the potential impact of teledermatology addressing disparities in care. Recent Findings: Teledermatology appears to increase access to dermatology given expanded means to deliver care. Specifically, recent studies have found increased access among Medicaid-insured, resource-poor urban and rural, and elderly populations. Teledermatology implementation also facilitates education among providers at different levels of training. Still, as some patients have inconsistent access to the required technology, increased reliance on telemedicine may also potentially increase disparities for some populations. Summary: Teledermatology may serve to reduce disparities in health care access in many underserved and marginalized communities. Future research should continue to study implementation, especially given the expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, teledermatology may play an important role in ensuring equitable care access for all.","Maddukuri, Spandana; Patel, Jay; Lipoff, Jules B",Curr Dermatol Rep,,664

However, media practitioners, watchdogs and politicians in Hungary and abroad criticized the measures for their adverse effects on the right to information, the freedom of expression, and especially for their potential chilling effect on the work of journalists. This interview-based study examines how journalists in digital newsrooms have perceived the measures imposed during the pandemic, and how those have impacted their daily work. As evidence from digital newsrooms shows, the malign policy had only limited adverse effects on the work of newsrooms.

Preliminary data suggest that MM patients have an impaired response to vaccination. This prospective study analyzed the humoral and cellular immune responses to two doses of BNT162b2 in 72 MM patients, including 48 receiving anti-CD38 immunotherapy. Results evidenced that MM patients display lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies and decreased neutralization of alpha and delta variants when compared to healthy controls. They also showed decreased numbers of circulating IFN{gamma}-producing Spike SARS-CoV-2 specific T lymphocytes. This defective immune response was particularly marked in patients receiving anti-CD38 immunotherapy. Furthermore, a retrospective investigation of MM patients among COVID-19-related death in the Paris area suggested a limited efficacy of BNT162b2 in patients treated with anti-CD38. Overall, these results show a decreased immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in MM patients and stress the need for novel strategies to improve SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals.","Henriquez, Soledad; Zerbit, Jeremie; Bruel, Timothee; Ouedrani, Amani; Planas, Delphine; Deschamps, Paul; Staropoli, Isabelle; Hadjadj, Jerome; Varet, Bruno; Suarez, Felipe; Ermak, Natalia; Bouscary, Didier; Willems, Lise; Fouquet, Guillemette; Decroocq, Justine; Franchi, Patricia; Deau-Fischer, Benedicte; Terrier, Benjamin; Tamburini, Jerome; Chatenoud, Lucienne; Schwartz, Olivier; Vignon, Marguerite",,,664

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hearing loss among somatosensory tinnitus patients with temporomandibular disorders and to assess the influence of tinnitus on patients' quality of life. Method An otolaryngologist examined 585 patients in order to detect and evaluate the presence of tinnitus. Subjects were evaluated using the Portuguese version of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. An analysis of the somatic component of tinnitus was performed. Tinnitus was rated according to its onset (at least 6 months) and intensity with a visual analog scale. The sample was composed of 100 patients with somatosensory tinnitus divided into two groups: Group 1 (with temporomandibular disorder, n = 85) and Group 2 (without temporomandibular disorder, n = 15). The audiological evaluation was composed of pure-tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, tympanometry, and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions. The impact of tinnitus on quality of life was assessed by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory adapted and validated to Portuguese language. Results Pure-tone audiometry did not differ with statistical significance between groups (p = .29), neither did the high-frequency audiometry results (p = .74). Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores also did not show any differences between Groups 1 and 2 (p = .67). Conclusions Subjects with somatosensory tinnitus, who also have temporomandibular disorders, do not seem to have hearing impairment. Also, they do not have a higher quality of life handicap when compared to those without tinnitus and temporomandibular disorder.","Hilgenberg-Sydney, Priscila Brenner; Saldanha, Aline Dantas Diógenes; Lopes, Andréa Cintra; Conti, Paulo César Rodrigues",Am J Audiol,,664

It has killed numerous people, caused great suffering, and turned many people's lives upside down. This study seeks to investigate the role of some pollutants and the meteorological parameters in the transmission of the virus (SARS-CoV-2). The number of infections identified in Saudi Arabia, a country with a hot climate, was studied for a period between March 9, 2020 and November 19, 2020, which was characterized by a single wave with a peak of 4,919 cases on June 17, 2020. Based on count data models, we observed that air pollution and meteorological parameters considerably influenced the daily evolution of infections in most affected cities of Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, Jeddah, and Makkah) where the prevalence of the disease was relatively high during summer 2020. Our study suggests that air pollution could be a significant risk factor for respiratory infections and virus transmission. On the other hand, meteorological factors and high concentration of air pollutants should be taken into account by public decision-makers in Saudi Arabia when seeking to limit COVID-19 transmission.","Ben Maatoug, Abderrazek; Triki, Mohamed Bilel; Fazel, Hesham",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Mentorship helps assure safe passage into the specialty, and it influences the arc of professional development across the career continuum. Even before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, technology and social networking were transforming mentorship in otolaryngology. Now, in an increasingly virtual world, where in-person interactions are the exception, mentorship plays an even more pivotal role. Mentors serve as trusted guides, helping learners navigate accelerating trends toward early specialization, competency-based assessments, and key milestones. However, several structural barriers render the playing field unlevel. For medical students, cancellation of visiting clerkships, in-person rotations, and other face-to-face interactions may limit access to mentors. The pandemic and virtual landscape particularly threaten the already-leaky pipeline for underrepresented medical students. These challenges may persist into residency and later career stages, where structural inequities continue to subtly influence opportunities and pairings of mentors and mentees. Hence, overreliance on serendipitous encounters can exacerbate disparities, even amid societal mandates for equity. The decision to take deliberate steps toward mentoring outreach and engagement has profound implications for what otolaryngology will look like in years to come. This article introduces the concept of new age mentoring, shining a light on how to modernize practices. The key shifts are from passive to active engagement; from amorphous to structured relationships; and from hierarchical dynamics to bidirectional mentoring. Success is predicated on intentional outreach and purposefulness in championing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the progressively technology-driven landscape.","Ahmadmehrabi, Shadi; Farlow, Janice L; Wamkpah, Nneoma S; Esianor, Brandon I; Brenner, Michael J; Valdez, Tulio A; Malekzadeh, Sonya; Bradford, Carol R; Francis, Howard W",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

METHODS: The data of 39,693 Brazilian adults were collected through an online questionnaire between April 24th and May 24th, 2020. Information about physical activity (weekly frequency and daily duration), TV viewing, and computer/tablet use (daily duration) before and during the pandemic period were reported. The correlates adopted were sex, age group, highest academic achievement, skin color, per capita income, country macro region, working status during the quarantine, and adherence to the quarantine. Logistic regression models were created. RESULTS: The incidence of physical inactivity (<150 min/week), high TV viewing (&#8805;4h/d), and computer/tablet use (&#8805;4h/d), were, respectively, 70.4%, 31.4%, and 37.9% during the COVID-19 pandemic. The younger age group showed higher incidences of physical inactivity (78%) and high computer/tablet use (59%), while middle-age adults (30-59 y) showed a higher incidence of TV viewing (34%). People who adhered to stricter measures of quarantine presented a higher incidence of excessive screen time. CONCLUSION: High incidences of physical inactivity and excessive screen time were identified in specific population subgroups during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.","Silva, Danilo R; Werneck, André O; Malta, Deborah C; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, Célia L",Ann. epidemiol,,664
484736,Non-invasive Vocal Biomarker is Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus called as SARS-CoV-2. This viral disease is known to infect the respiratory system, eventually leading to pneumonia. Crystallographic studies of the viral structure reveal its mechanism of infection as well as active binding sites and the druggable targets as scope for treatment of COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: The role of tea polyphenols in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 was established in this study. STUDY DESIGN: Molecular docking interactions of tea polyphenols with some of the possible binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 were performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From various studies on the SARS-CoV-2 reported in the literature, we chose possible drug targets (Chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA dependant RNA polymerase, Papain like protease, Spike RBD and ACE2 receptor with spike RBD) which are vital proteins. These receptors were docked against two tea polyphenols, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea and Theaflavin digallate (TF3) from black tea. These polyphenols have been previously reviewed for their antiviral activities, especially against single-stranded RNA viruses. Two antiviral drugs, Remdesivir and Favipiravir were studied for comparative docking results. RESULTS: A comparative study of docking scores and the type of interactions of EGCG, TF3 with the possible targets of COVID-19 showed that the tea polyphenols had good docking scores with significant in-silico activity. CONCLUSION: These results can provide a lead in exploring both the tea polyphenols in prophylaxis as well as treatment of COVID-19.","Mhatre, Susmit; Naik, Shivraj; Patravale, Vandana",Comput Biol Med,,664
484737,Non-invasive Vocal Biomarker is Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection,2021,"To avoid spreading the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), health authorities have forced people to reorganize their working and private lives and to avoid open and public spaces as much as possible. This has also been the case for women both during pregnancy and after delivery. Here, we investigated the associations between subjective beliefs in risk of infections and health anxiety, depression, stress, and other perinatal dimensions. To this end, we assessed 103 women (mean age: 28.57 years) during pregnancy and after delivery. They completed a series of questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, perinatal information, health anxiety, post-partum depression, and stress. Sixty-six participants (64.1%) were in the pre-partum stage, and 37 (35.9%) were post-partum. Health anxiety was unrelated to depression or stress. Knowing and being close to infected people was associated with higher health anxiety. Strict following of the safety recommendations was associated with greater health anxiety, depression, and stress. Postponing or cancelling routine medical check appointments was observed among participants with high health anxiety scores. Higher illness severity, overall health anxiety scores, and lower stress scores predicted those participants who postponed or cancelled their routine medical check appointments. Post-partum stage and a larger number of children were associated with higher stress scores, but not with depression or stress. The results are of practical and clinical importance; it appears that health anxiety, which is to say fear of getting infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy or at the post-partum stage, was associated with postponing or cancelling routine medical check appointments, but not with stress or depression.","Shayganfard, Mehran; Mahdavi, Fateme; Haghighi, Mohammad; Sadeghi Bahmani, Dena; Brand, Serge",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,664

Telehealth services are emerging element in these proactive medical sciences. It helps the remote patients to share their confidential data through secured transmission. In this paper, amino acid guided matrix encoding scheme has been proposed. White blood cell count or Leukocute count is a dominant indicator of patients' health condition, even amid COVID-19. An abnormal growth in leukocyte count is mainly caused due to an infection, cancer, or any other severe symptoms. It initiates internal haematological inflammations, cardiovascular diseases, Type II diabetes, etc. Therefore, tracking leukocyte count may for disease diagnosis and further treatments. The leukocyte count is generally done in different pathologies, and the data evaluation needs the expertise of a pathologist.

This new condition is heterogenous but resembles Kawasaki disease (KD), a well-known but poorly understood and clinically heterogenous pediatric inflammatory condition for which weak associations have been found with a myriad of viral illnesses. Epidemiological data clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is the trigger for MIS-C, which typically occurs about 1 mo after infection. These findings support the hypothesis of viral triggers for the various forms of classic KD. We further suggest that rare inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) altering the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie the pathogenesis of MIS-C in some children. The discovery of monogenic IEIs underlying MIS-C would shed light on its pathogenesis, paving the way for a new genetic approach to classic KD, revisited as a heterogeneous collection of IEIs to viruses.","Sancho-Shimizu, Vanessa; Brodin, Petter; Cobat, Aurélie; Biggs, Catherine M; Toubiana, Julie; Lucas, Carrie L; Henrickson, Sarah E; Belot, Alexandre; Tangye, Stuart G; Milner, Joshua D; Levin, Michael; Abel, Laurent; Bogunovic, Dusan; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Zhang, Shen-Ying",J. exp. med,,664

However, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with neurological disorders. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and its effect on neurological symptoms in patients with preexisting neurological disorder and COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) and medRxiv databases for reports of patients with both preexisting neurological disorders and COVID-19. Studies reporting data on changes in the symptoms of preexisting neurological disorders and/or the severity of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles with 2278 patients with preexisting neurological disorder and COVID-19 were identified. Of 232 patients, 74 (31.9 %) showed exacerbation of preexisting neurological symptoms of dementia (55/92; 59.5 %), Parkinson's disease (10/17; 58.8 %), epilepsy (1/1; 100 %), and unspecified neurological disorders (8/106; 7.5 %).

Methods: The study analyzed 10 asymptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 cases to determine whether asymptomatic infection is possible. We conducted in-depth interviews with patients and guardians; interviews with primary physicians; review of medical records and drug utilization review (DUR) reports; and base station-based location tracking. Results: Among the 98, confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Busan, the study analyzed 10 (10.2%) asymptomatic patients at diagnosis. The Results confirmed that two (2.0%) patients reported to be asymptomatic during the initial epidemiological investigation, but turned symptomatic before diagnosis as per the in-depth interview results. Four cases (4.0%) of early detection led to confirmed diagnosis during the incubation period and presentation of symptoms after diagnosis. In addition, the remaining four patients (4.0%), having no subjective symptoms nor specific findings on chest radiography and Computed Tomography, remained asymptomatic until the isolation order was lifted. With regard to whether transmission during the asymptomatic period is possible, it was found that one out of 23 household contacts of the confirmed patients was identified as an additional confirmed case after coming in close contact with an index patient during the presymptomatic period. Conclusion: Among the 98 confirmed cases, asymptomatic infection was confirmed in four cases (4.0%). In addition, there was one additional confirmed case in which the patient was a family member who came in close contact with an index patient during the incubation period, thereby confirming that transmission during the asymptomatic period is possible. The possibility of transmission during the asymptomatic period has been confirmed; therefore, it is necessary to review the measures for expanding contact tracing that is currently being applied starting one day prior to the onset of symptoms.","Lee, Miyoung; Eun, Youngduck; Park, Kyounghee; Heo, Jeonghun; Son, Hyunjin",Epidemiol Health,,664

DESIGN: Nationwide linkage cohort study. SETTING: Scotland, UK, 1 March to 6 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers aged 18-65 years, their households, and other members of the general population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Admission to hospital with covid-19. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 158 445 healthcare workers, most of them (90 733; 57.3%) being patient facing, and 229 905 household members. Of all hospital admissions for covid-19 in the working age population (18-65 year olds), 17.2% (360/2097) were in healthcare workers or their households. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and comorbidity, the risk of admission due to covid-19 in non-patient facing healthcare workers and their households was similar to the risk in the general population (hazard ratio 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.26) and 0.86 (0.49 to 1.51), respectively). In models adjusting for the same covariates, however, patient facing healthcare workers, compared with non-patient facing healthcare workers, were at higher risk (hazard ratio 3.30, 2.13 to 5.13), as were household members of patient facing healthcare workers (1.79, 1.10 to 2.91). After sub-division of patient facing healthcare workers into those who worked in ""front door,"" intensive care, and non-intensive care aerosol generating settings and other, those in front door roles were at higher risk (hazard ratio 2.09, 1.49 to 2.94). For most patient facing healthcare workers and their households, the estimated absolute risk of hospital admission with covid-19 was less than 0.5%, but it was 1% and above in older men with comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers and their households contributed a sixth of covid-19 cases admitted to hospital.

498296,Surgical Infection Society Guidance for Operative and Peri-Operative Care of Adult Patients Infected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"BACKGROUND: Protracted viral shedding is common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and up to 40% display signs of pulmonary fibrosis on computed tomography (CT) after hospital discharge. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) who die in intensive care units (ICU) have a lower viral clearance in the respiratory tract than ICU patients discharged alive, and that protracted viral shedding in respiratory samples is associated with patterns of fibroproliferation on lung CT. We, therefore, conducted a retrospective observational study, in 2 ICU of Lyon university hospital. RESULTS: 129 patients were included in the study, of whom 44 (34%) died in ICU. 432 RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were performed and 137 CT scans were analyzed. Viral load was significantly higher in patients deceased as compared to patients alive at ICU discharge (p < 0.001), after adjustment for the site of viral sampling and RT-PCR technique. The median time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation on RT-PCR was 19 days [CI95 %:15-21] in patients alive at ICU discharge and 26 days [CI95 %:17-infinity] in non-survivors at ICU discharge. Competitive risk regression identified patients who died in ICU and age as independent risk factors for longer time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation on RT-PCR, while antiviral treatment was independently associated with shorter time. None of the CT scores exploring fibroproliferation (i.e., bronchiectasis and reticulation scores) were significantly associated with time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation. CONCLUSIONS: Viral load in respiratory samples is significantly lower and viral shedding significantly shorter in ICU survivors of COVID-19 associated acute respiratory failure. Protracted viral shedding is unrelated to occurrence of fibrosis on lung CT.","Bitker, L; Dhelft, F; Chauvelot, L; Frobert, E; Folliet, L; Mezidi, M; Trouillet-Assant, S; Belot, A; Lina, B; Wallet, F; Richard, J C",Ann Intensive Care,,664

501526,The emerging role of microRNAs in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Favipiravir has discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, concerns about teratogenicity and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. This analysis used available data to simulate the intracellular pharmacokinetics of the favipiravir active metabolite [favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP)]. METHODS: Published in vitro data for intracellular production and elimination of FAVI-RTP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were fitted with a mathematical model describing the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP as a function of favipiravir concentration. Parameter estimates were then combined with a published population pharmacokinetic model in Chinese patients to predict human intracellular FAVI-RTP. In vitro FAVI-RTP data were adequately described as a function of concentrations with an empirical model, noting simplification and consolidation of various processes and several assumptions. RESULTS: Parameter estimates from fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP (peak to trough ratio of â¼1 to 1) when driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile, compared with the plasma profile of parent favipiravir (ratio of â¼2 to 1). This approach has important assumptions, but indicates that, despite rapid clearance of the parent from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life. CONCLUSIONS: Population mean intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to be maintained above the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 9 days with a 1200 mg twice-daily regimen (following a 1600 mg twice-daily loading dose on day 1). Further evaluation of favipiravir as part of antiviral combinations for SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.","Pertinez, Henry; Rajoli, Rajith K R; Khoo, Saye H; Owen, Andrew",J Antimicrob Chemother,,664

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rationale for repurposing functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs), several of which are approved medicines, for the treatment of SAR-CoV-2 infections. COMMENT: We propose and discuss the FIASMAs' lysosomotropism as a possible explanation for their observed in vitro activities against viruses, and more specifically against infections caused by coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Successful in vitro-to-in vivo translation of FIASMAs requires that their pharmacokinetics (dosing regimen and drug-drug interactions) are matched with viral kinetics. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Drug repurposing to ensure rapid patient access to effective treatment has garnered much attention in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The observed lysosomotropic activity of small-molecule FIASMA compounds suggests that their repurposing as potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is promising.","Le Corre, Pascal; Loas, Gwenolé",J. clin. pharm. ther,,664

507913,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Spike Protein Based Novel Epitopes Induce Potent Immune Responses in vivo and Inhibit Viral Replication in vitro,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading in all the areas of the world. This ongoing pandemic has clear impacts in terms of the relevance of psychological needs. Psychological needs such as self-esteem, self-actualization, and relatedness only become relevant once basic physiological needs and safety and survivor needs have been satisfied. Because psychological constructs are not objectively existing constituents of reality but rather efforts to represent it, they tend to become more or less relevant and salient as a function of prevailing conditions. Starting from this premise, the current paper focuses on the relevance that fears with an interpersonal basis (i.e. the fear of missing out and the fear of not mattering) have during a period in which physical distancing or “social distancing” has been implicated as a crucial important public health intervention that can help stop transmission of the coronavirus. We underscore how the current health crisis impacts the self and identity of people who are confronted with the discrepancy between their usual psychological needs and current realities.","Casale, Silvia; Flett, Gordon L.",Clin.

Lung-protective ventilation is the current standard of care in patients with ARDS, but it might lead to hypercapnia, which is independently associated with worse outcomes. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy to avoid progression of clinical severity and limit further ventilator-induced lung injury, but its use in COVID-19 has not been described yet. Acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is common among critically ill COVID-19 patients. In centers with available dialysis, low-flow ECCO2R (<500 mL/min) using RRT platforms could be carried out by dialysis specialists and might be an option to efficiently allocate resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with hypercapnia as the main indication. Here, we report the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of ECCO2R using an RRT platform to provide either standalone ECCO2R or ECCO2R combined with RRT in four hypercapnic patients with moderate ARDS.

However, there is wide variation in transport education among fellowship programs. Using the flipped classroom methodology, we developed a video and case-based transport education curriculum. METHODS: A national needs assessment identified safety, communication skills, and physiology as the most important aspects of transport management. Three 10-minute video modules and two 20-minute case-based discussions were developed to address this content. Using the flipped classroom format, seven NPM fellows from all three postgraduate years of training took part in the curriculum by individually viewing each video followed by participation in group case-based discussions. Cognitive and affective outcomes were assessed using a knowledge and attitude pretest, individual video module posttests, and a postcurriculum follow-up survey. RESULTS: NPM fellows showed significant improvements in transport knowledge and reported increased confidence in their ability to perform important transport roles. Case discussions were adaptable to learners who had different levels of training and had variable transport experience. Case discussions were successfully executed both in person and by video telecommunications during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: This transport curriculum addressed a national education gap in NPM fellowship training. Using the flipped classroom methodology, cognitive and affective objectives were achieved by improving knowledge and confidence in transport skills among NPM learners. The video and case-based formats were easily implemented, applicable to multiple types of learners, and adaptable to different environments.","Gisondo, Carly M.; Weiner, Gary; Stanley, Kate",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33598540/,664

The PEDV membrane protein (M) plays crucial roles in viral assembly, viral budding and host immune regulation, most likely by interacting with host cell proteins that have yet to be identified. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) using an M-specific monoclonal antibody, coupled with LC-MS/MS, was employed to identify M protein-interacting proteins in PEDV-infected cells. Three viral proteins (S, E and ORF3) and 218 host cell proteins were identified as putative M-interacting partners. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the identified host cell proteins were related to 131 signal pathways and 10 biological processes. In addition, interaction between translation initiation factor 3(eIF3L) and M protein was validated by Co-IP. Down-regulation of eIF3L expression significantly increased viral production, which suggests that eIF3L could be a negative regulator in PEDV replication. This interactome study of the PEDV M protein will serve to clarify its function during viral replication.","Wang, Ruiyang; Yu, Ruisong; Chen, Bingqing; Si, Fusheng; Wang, Jian; Xie, Chunfang; Men, Chengfang; Dong, Shijuan; Li, Zhen",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113520303643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605758/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108729; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113520303643?v=s5,664

599504,Efficacy of “Essential Iodine Drops” against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2021-07-09,"ETHNO–PHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The genus Artemisia spp. is well known for its anti–infectious properties and its high content in anti–infectious compounds, like the well–known sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua L.). Another Artemisia species, Artemisia campestris subsp. glutinosa (Besser) Batt., field wormwood, has been traditionally used as medicinal plant in the Mediterranean region. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to investigate the anti–HIV activity of field wormwood, to identify the compounds responsible for this activity and their structure and mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of isolated compounds and extracts was evaluated in HIV–1 infections of lymphoblastoid cells. We also evaluated the mechanism of action of isolated compounds. Viral entry was studied comparing the inhibitory effect of isolated compounds on wild type HIV–1 and VSV pseudotyped HIV–1. To assess the viral transcriptional effect, plasmids encoding luciferase reporter genes under the control of the whole genome of HIV–1 or NF–κB or Sp1 transcription factors were transfected in the presence of the compounds under evaluation. Finally, antioxidant activity was assessed by quantitation of reduced and total glutathione in treated cell cultures. RESULTS: Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Artemisia campestris subsp. glutinosa (Besser) Batt. subsp. glutinosa displayed anti–HIV activity in vitro, although ethanolic extract was more powerful (IC(50) 14.62 μg/mL). Bio–guided ethanolic extract fractionation leads to the isolation and characterization of two terpenes, damsin and canrenone, and four flavonoids, 6, 2’, 4’–trimethoxyflavone, acerosin, cardamonin and xanthomicrol. All the isolated compounds inhibited HIV–1 replication in vitro with IC(50) values between the middle nanomolar and the low micromolar range. Their anti–HIV mechanism of action is due to the bloking of viral entry and/or transcription inhibition, without correlation with the antioxidant activity, through interference with the cellular transcription factors NF–κB and Sp1, which are targets that are not currently reached by antiretroviral therapy. CONCLUSION: We describe here the anti–HIV activity of field wormwood, Artemisia campestris subsp. glutinosa (Besser) Batt., and the isolation and study of the mechanism of action of two terpenes and four flavonoids, responsible, at least in part, for its activity, through the inhibition of two different cellular targets affecting the HIV replication cycle. The activity of these compounds in cellular targets could explain why plant extracts can be used in the treatment of different diseases. Besides, the presence of several compounds with dual and different mechanisms of action could prove useful in the treatment of HIV–1 infection, since it could aid to overcome drug resistances and simplify drug therapy. This work is a further step in understanding the anti–infectious activity of wormwood species and their use in treating infectious diseases.","Ticona L, Apaza; P, Bermejo; JA, Guerra; MJ, Abad; M, Beltrán; R, Martín–Lázaro; J, Alcamí; LM, Bedoya",J Ethnopharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874120330452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758575/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113163; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874120330452?v=s5,664

601034,Mixed mold infection with Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus microsporus in a Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patient,2021-01-27,"Long-term care for older adults is in transition. Organizations offering long-term care for older adults are expected to provide person-centered care (PCC) in a complex context, with older adults aging in place and participating in society for as long as possible, staff shortages and the slow adoption of technological solutions. To address these challenges, these organizations increasingly use scientific knowledge to evaluate and innovate long-term care. This paper describes how co-creation, in the sense of close, intensive, and equivalent collaboration between science, care practice, and education, is a key factor in the success of improving long-term care for older adults. Such co-creation is central in the Academic Collaborative Center (ACC) Older Adults of Tilburg University. In this ACC, Tilburg University has joined forces with ten organizations that provide care for older adults and CZ zorgkantoor to create both scientific knowledge and societal impact in order to improve the quality of person-centered care for older adults. In the Netherlands, a “zorgkantoor” arranges long-term (residential) care on behalf of the national government. A zorgkantoor makes agreements on cost and quality with care providers and helps people that are in need of care to decide what the best possible option in their situation is. The CZ zorgkantoor arranges the long-term (residential) care in the south and southwest of the Netherlands. This paper describes how we create scientific knowledge to contribute to the knowledge base of PCC for older adults by conducting social scientific research in which the perspectives of older adults are central. Subsequently, we show how we create societal impact by facilitating and stimulating the use of our scientific knowledge in daily care practice. In the closing section, our ambitions for the future are discussed.","Luijkx, Katrien; van Boekel, Leonieke; Janssen, Meriam; Verbiest, Marjolein; Stoop, Annerieke",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17239014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287307/,664

The phylogenetic analysis showed that TGEV JS2012 was placed between the Purdue and the Miller clusters. Analysis of recombination confirmed that TGEV JS2012 is a natural recombinant strain between Miller M6 and Purdue 115. Similar to Miller M6, virulent Purdue and China strain TS, in S gene the JS2012 maintained genetic integrity and the characteristics of the TGEV virulent strains. In vivo, TGEV JS2012 caused 100% mortality in newborn piglets, indicating the strong pathogenicity of this isolate.

Despite differences in clinical and behavioral characteristics, these disorders have shared pathologies and face common challenges in designing early-phase trials that are predictive of late-stage success. Here, we discuss exploratory clinical trials in neurodegenerative dementias. These are generally phase 1b or phase 2a trials that are designed to assess pharmacologic effects and rely on biomarker outcomes, with shorter treatment durations and fewer patients than traditional phase 2 studies. Exploratory trials can establish go/no-go decision points, support proof of concept and dose selection, and terminate drugs that fail to show target engagement with suitable exposure and acceptable safety profiles. Early failure saves valuable resources including opportunity costs. This is especially important for programs in academia and small biotechnology companies but may be applied to high-risk projects in large pharmaceutical companies to achieve proof of concept more rapidly at lower costs than traditional approaches. Exploratory studies in a staged clinical development program may provide promising data to warrant the substantial resources needed to advance compounds through late-stage development. To optimize the design and application of exploratory trials, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation and the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration convened an advisory panel to provide recommendations on outcome measures and statistical considerations for these types of studies and study designs that can improve efficiency in clinical development.","Friedman, Lauren G.; McKeehan, Nicholas; Hara, Yuko; Cummings, Jeffrey L.; Matthews, Dawn C.; Zhu, Jian; Mohs, Richard C.; Wang, Deli; Hendrix, Suzanne B.; Quintana, Melanie; Schneider, Lon S.; Grundman, Michael; Dickson, Samuel P.; Feldman, Howard H.; Jaeger, Judith; Finger, Elizabeth C.; Ryan, J.

These vaccines are relatively simple to manufacture, but more immunogenic formulations are considered a priority. We developed tetrabranched derivatives for this purpose based on a novel peptide welding technology (PWT). PWTs provide molecular scaffolds for the efficient synthesis of ultrapure peptide dendrimers, which allow the delivery of multiple ligands within a single macromolecular structure. Peptide vaccines incorporating T-cell epitopes derived from melanoma and B-cell epitopes derived from human immunodeficiency virus, synthesized using this approach, elicited primary immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Subcutaneous administration of the B-cell epitope-based vaccines also elicited more potent humoral responses than subcutaneous administration of the corresponding peptides alone. Highly immunogenic peptide epitope-based vaccines can therefore be generated quickly and easily using a novel PWT.","Nicoli, Francesco; Pacifico, Salvatore; Gallerani, Eleonora; Marzola, Erika; Albanese, Valentina; Finessi, Valentina; Llewellyn-Lacey, Sian; Price, David A.; Appay, Victor; Marconi, Peggy; Guerrini, Remo; Caputo, Antonella; Gavioli, Riccardo",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069535/,664

Due to the lack of specific medication and vaccination, drug-repurposing attempts has emerged as a promising approach and identified several human proteins interacting with the virus. This study aims to provide a comprehensive molecular profiling of the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The list of immune cell-enriched proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from The Human Protein Atlas. Genomic alterations were identified using cBioPortal. Survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Analyses of protein expression and tumor infiltration levels were carried out by TIMER. KEY FINDINGS: 14 human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 were enriched in immune cells. Among these proteins, USP13 had the highest frequency of genomic alterations. Higher USP13 levels were correlated with improved survival in breast and lung cancers, while resulting in poor prognosis in ovarian and gastric cancers. Furthermore, copy number variations of USP13 significantly affected the infiltration levels of distinct subtypes of immune cells in head & neck, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers. Although our results suggested a tumor suppressor role for USP13 in lung cancer, in other cancers, its role seemed to be context-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE: It is critical to identify and characterize human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 in order to have a better understanding of the disease and to develop better therapies/vaccines. Here, we provided a comprehensive molecular profiling the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13, which will be useful for future studies.","Süt, Burcu Biterge",Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735883/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002432052030922X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118170; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002432052030922X,664

Sequencing revealed that wild-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 675 nucleotides encoding a protein of 224 amino acids with a predicted M (r) of 25.1–25.3 kDa. Attenuated-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 624 nucleotides encoding a protein of 207 amino acids with a predicted M (r) of 23.4 kDa. The coding region of the ORF3 gene of attenuated-type PEDVs including attenuated DR13, KPED-9, and P-5V had 51 nucleotide deletions that were not found in the ORF3 genes of wild-type PEDVs including CV777, Br1/87, LZC, parent DR13, and 12 field samples. In addition, attenuated-type PEDVs have previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, 51 nucleotide deletions appear to be meaningful and may be significant for PEDV pathogenicity, because they lead to changes in the predicted amino acid sequences of attenuated-type PEDVs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the partial ORF3 gene including 51 nucleotide deletions revealed that all PEDVs fell into two types, wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs. Wild-type PEDVs containing parent DR13 and 12 field samples had RT-PCR products of 245 bp in size, while attenuated-type PEDVs containing PEDV vaccine strains (attenuated DR13, KPED-9, P-5V) had products of 194 bp. In addition, all PEDV vaccine strains were used as live virus vaccine, because they previously exhibited a reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, large deletion region, which is comprise 17 amino acid deletions caused by 51 nucleotide deletions and is seen in all PED live vaccine strains, may be important site for PEDV pathogenicity, and we can use it for differentiation of wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs.","Park, Seong-Jun; Moon, Hyoung-Joon; Luo, Yuzi; Kim, Hye-Kwon; Kim, Eun-Mi; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Song, Dae-Sub; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Lee, Chul-Seung; Park, Bong-Kyun",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17932736/,664

We aimed to systematically review the relationship of austerity policies with food insecurity including foodbank use in the UK. METHODS: We undertook a narrative systematic review (CRD42020164508) and searched seven databases, grey literature, and reference lists through September 2020. Studies with austerity policies (including welfare reform) as exposure and food insecurity (including foodbank use as a proxy) as study outcome were included. We included quantitative longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. Two reviewers assessed eligibility, extracted data directly from studies, and undertook quality assessment. FINDINGS: Eight studies were included: two individual-level studies totalling 4129 participants and six ecological studies. All suggested a relationship between austerity and increased food insecurity. Two studies found that austerity policies were associated with increased food insecurity in European countries including the UK. Six studies found that the welfare reform aspect of UK austerity policies was associated with increased food insecurity and foodbank use. Sanctions involving delays to benefits as a response to a claimant not actively seeking work may increase food insecurity, with studies finding that increases of 100 sanctions per 100,000 people may have led to increases of between 2 and 36 food parcels per 100,000 population. INTERPRETATION: UK austerity policies were consistently linked to food insecurity and foodbank use. Policymakers should consider impacts of austerity on food insecurity when considering how to reduce budget deficits.

617680,Methyltransferase-like 3 modulates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 RNA N6-methyladenosine modification and replication,2020-10-14,"INTRODUCTION: Over 40,000 cases of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China. The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan. Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients. METHODS: We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province. RESULTS: The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years. The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket. Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission. Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days. CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively. The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%). Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment. DISCUSSION: In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan. Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people. Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.","Wang, Lizhen; Duan, Yueting; Zhang, Wenming; Liang, Juan; Xu, Jianxiang; Zhang, Yongqing; Wu, Changgang; Xu, Yangling; Li, Hua",Clin Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.2147/clep.s249903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308494/,664

The fast spread of COVID-19 has led to a dangerous threat to worldwide health. Also in the last two decades, several viral epidemics have been listed like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002/2003, the influenza H1N1 in 2009 and recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In this research, an automated system is created to differentiate between the COVID-19, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics by using their genomic sequences recorded in the NCBI GenBank in order to facilitate the diagnosis process and increase the accuracy of disease detection in less time. The selected database contains 76 genes for each epidemic. Then, some features are extracted like a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the seven moment invariants to two different classifiers. These classifiers are the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and the trainable cascade-forward back propagation neural network where they give satisfying results to compare. To evaluate the performance of classifiers, there are some effective parameters calculated. They are accuracy (ACC), F1 score, error rate and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) that are 100%, 100%, 0 and 1, respectively, for the KNN algorithm and 98.89%, 98.34%, 0.0111 and 0.9754, respectively, for the cascade-forward network.","Naeem, Safaa M; Mabrouk, Mai S; Marzouk, Samir Y; Eldosoky, Mohamed A",Brief Bioinform,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793981/,664

As the pandemic has continued to evolve over a period of several months, many cases of unusual presentations are now emerging, which pose a greater challenge for physicians in terms of quickly identifying COVID-19 patients based on initial signs and symptoms. In this report, we present one such unusual presentation in a patient with sudden intraperitoneal hemorrhage and spontaneous splenic rupture with COVID-19 as the likely etiology and contributing factor. The patient was a 75-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of severe left-sided abdominal pain for several days without any preceding trauma. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a large amount of fluid in the abdomen, which raised suspicion of bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy revealed splenic rupture with hemoperitoneum, and the patient subsequently underwent an emergent splenectomy. The patient’s COVID-19 antigen test returned positive during the surgery and was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. COVID-19 has been found to result primarily in respiratory symptoms through its ability to invade endothelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 affinity. It is speculated that this mechanism may cause a predisposition to micro-thromboses, which can eventually lead to manifestations such as large lymphoid organ thrombosis. Based on this case presentation and the evolving literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spontaneous splenic rupture is an emergent differential diagnosis that should be considered in COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain and nausea.","Knefati, Mohammed; Ganim, Ismail; Schmidt, Jozef; Makkar, Abhilash; Igtiben, Stephanie; Landa, Eric; Tarawneh, Ahmad; Hicks, Courtney; Zimmerman, Stacy; Sukpraprut-Braaten, Suporn",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211811/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15310,664

However, new SARS-CoV-2 variants are threatening this success via mutations that lessen the efficacy of antigen-specific antibodies. One simple approach to assisting with this issue is focusing on strategies that build on the non-specific protection afforded by the innate immune response. The BCG vaccine has been shown to provide broad protection beyond tuberculosis disease, including against respiratory viruses, and ongoing studies are investigating its efficacy as a tool against SARS-CoV-2. Gamma delta (γδ) T cells, particularly the Vδ2 subtype, undergo rapid expansion after BCG vaccination due to MHC-independent mechanisms. Consequently, γδ T cells can produce diverse defenses against virally infected cells, including direct cytotoxicity, death receptor ligands, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. They can also assist in stimulating the adaptive immune system. BCG is affordable, commonplace and non-specific, and therefore could be a useful tool to initiate innate protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, considerations must also be made to BCG vaccine supply and the prioritization of countries where it is most needed to combat tuberculosis first and foremost.","Morrison, Alexandra L.; Sharpe, Sally; White, Andrew D.; Bodman-Smith, Mark",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.743924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567010/,664

One way to bridge the relationship between the forensic scientist and the police investigator is through an Intelligence Analyst (IA) who is part of the forensic services operation. The IA offers the ability to walk between the role of scientist and law enforcement, receiving data after completion of scientific analyses and translating the information into actionable intelligence. The additional bridging and translating services represent a paradigm shift with increased emphasis on investigative contributions from forensic analysis. Forensic intelligence incorporates forensic data early in an investigation in a holistic case approach that incorporates possible datasets and information that could be relevant to the investigation.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 613 patients hospitalized (integrated health system involving three hospitals) for RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and April 25, 2020. Intervention was treatment with HCQ-AZM in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, non-lethal arrhythmias, and length of hospital stay. Secondary measures included in-hospital corrected QT (QTc) interval parameters and serum biomarkers levels. RESULTS: Propensity-matched groups were composed of 173 patients given HCQ-AZM and 173 matched patients who did not receive treatment. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–2.89; p = 0.2), PEA arrest (OR 1.68, CI 0.68–4.15; p = 0.27), or incidence of non-lethal arrhythmias (10.4% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.28). Length of hospital stay (10.5 ± 7.4 vs. 5.8 ± 6.1; p < 0.001), peak CRP levels (252 ± 136 vs. 166 ± 124; p < 0.0001), and degree of QTc interval prolongation was higher for the HCQ-AZM group (28 ± 32 vs. 9 ± 32; p < 0.0001), but there was no significant difference in incidence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias (2.8% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.52). HCQ-AZM was stopped in 10 patients because of QT interval prolongation and 1 patient because of drug-related polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: In this propensity-matched study, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality, life-threatening arrhythmias, or incidence of PEA arrest between the HCQ-AZM and untreated control groups. QTc intervals were longer in patients receiving HCQ-AZM, but only one patient developed drug-related ventricular tachycardia.

633143,Protective Adaptive Immunity Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Implications for Vaccines,2020-06-01,"Recent years have witnessed the development and advancement of many nonparenteral biologics and vaccines for human use. This chapter discusses various nonparenteral routes of administration. The oral route of administration is the most preferred and patient compliant method of them all. Transdermal, buccal, and pulmonary routes are also discussed. We have developed novel technologies using nanoparticles and microparticles to deliver vaccines by the oral and transdermal route of administration. These new technologies enable the formulation of vaccine particles containing vaccine antigens, without loss of their biological activity during the formulation process. Also, multiple antigens, targeting ligands and adjuvants can all be encapsulated within the same particle. When administered orally, these particles are designed to withstand the acidic environment of the stomach and are targeted to the Peyer’s patches and the gut-associated mucosal immune system. Because these vaccines are particulate in nature, they are readily taken up by phagocytic antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as M cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the Peyer’s patches of the intestines, resulting in a strong immune response and antibody production. Of particular interest is the fact that the particles release the antigen in a slow and sustained manner over a prolonged time period, intracellularly into APCs, resulting in strong mucosal and systemic immunity after oral administration, without the need for added adjuvants that are typically present in current vaccine preparations. Because no needles are required for oral vaccines, this method of vaccine delivery is inexpensive and suitable for mass vaccination in the developing world as well as for the developed world. This chapter discusses studies conducted on a wide array of vaccines, including infectious disease vaccines and cancer vaccines. This method of vaccine delivery enables the delivery of a wide spectrum of vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic use, including oral and transdermal vaccines for cancer such as human papillomavirus, melanoma, ovarian, breast, and prostate with encouraging results. With respect to cancer therapy, a comparison is made between the conventional cancer therapy and immunotherapy. With a wide range of nanocarriers available for delivery of biologics, vaccines, and cancer therapies, nanotechnology not only has gained the well-deserved limelight but has also attracted the attention of regulatory bodies, although it presents certain challenges that must be considered before marketing such nanocarriers.","D’Souza, Martin J.; Gala, Rikhav P.; Ubale, Ruhi V.; D’Souza, Bernadette; Vo, Trinh Phuong; Parenky, Ashwin C.; Mulla, Nihal S.; D’Sa, Sucheta; D’Souza, Marissa; Braz-Gomes, Kim; D’Souza, Nigel; Chiriva-Internati, Maurizio; Zughaier, Susu","Novel Approaches and Strategies for Biologics, Vaccines and Cancer Therapies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124166035000055; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124166035000055,664

Case Report All patients had positive PCR tests for COVID-19,three of four patients had dyspnea and desaturation with ground glass areas on thorax CT.One patient only complained of impaired sense of smell.Three patients with signs of pneumonia were hospitalized and one patient was treated on an outpatient basis.While one of the patients received a combine therapy with favipiravir.hydroxychloroquine,azithromycin,3 patients received only favipiravir treatment.Three consecutive days of 1000 mg/day methylprednisolone treatment were used in 3 patients with signs of pneumonia and dyspnea,because symptoms did not improve.Death was not observed in any of the cases.The complaint of the patient,who had symptoms of impaired sense of smell,resolved within 5 days.Three patients with persistent dyspnea,desaturation,and radiological symptoms showed improvement in symptoms and radiological findings after pulse steroid therapy.In one of the cases,it was observed that the lesions caused interseptal thickening in the control tomography scan performed after three months. Summary There is limited data about the treatment and long-term results of Covid-19 infection.High dose steroid therapy may be a safe chose for the treatment of COVID-19 infection with signs of pneumonia in organ transplant recipients.However, further studies are needed to determine whether the disease leaves sequelae fibrotic areas in the lung or triggers /accelerates the CLAD process seen after lung transplantation.","Türkkan, S.; Sahin, M.

While ADP by Kupffer cells deplete circulating tumors, mechanisms targeting non-circulating tumors remain unclear. Using intravital imaging in a model of B cell lymphoma, we establish here the dominance and limitations of ADP in the bone marrow (BM). We found that tumor cells were stably residing in the BM with little evidence for recirculation. To elucidate the mechanism of depletion, we designed a dual fluorescent reporter to visualize phagocytosis and apoptosis. ADP by BM-associated macrophages was the primary mode of tumor elimination but was no longer active after one hour, resulting in partial depletion. Moreover, macrophages were present at low density in tumor-rich regions, targeting only neighboring tumors. Overcoming spatiotemporal bottlenecks in tumor-targeting Ab therapy thus represents a critical path towards the design of optimized therapies.","Grandjean, Capucine L.; Garcia, Zacarias; Lemaître, Fabrice; Bréart, Béatrice; Bousso, Philippe",Sci Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608271/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd6167,664

SARS-CoV-2 is proposed to cause AKI in the patients through various mechanisms. We are, nevertheless, far from a comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the kidney injury in this infection. AKI has been shown to be a marker of disease severity and also a negative prognostic factor for survival. Unfortunately, no effective preventive strategy to decrease the risk of kidney damage in these patients has yet been identified. In this hypothesis, we highlight the potential protective effects of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in preventing the proximal tubular damage caused by the virus through disrupting the virus-endosome fusion and also interfering with the lysosomal proteases. Our proposed mechanisms could pave the way for further in vitro studies and subsequent clinical trials.","Habibzadeh, Parham; Mofatteh, Mohammad; Ghavami, Saeid; Roozbeh, Jamshid",European Journal of Pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173487; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299920305793; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299920305793?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805256/,664

We detail the state of knowledge about the organisation of the UK puppy trade, which includes irresponsible and illegal breeding of puppies throughout Europe and their often-illegal movement into the UK. In 2017, we conducted an analysis of hundreds of online advertisements in Scotland, 12 expert interviews, a stakeholder survey of 53 participants, and 40 focus groups across Great Britain. Our data suggest an organised illicit market running in parallel to the legal trade. We speculate as to whether at some point along the supply chain organised crime groups are responsible for the suffering and death of the puppies and the economic and emotional damage to ‘consumers’.

The current public health emergency has required rapid implementation of increased handwashing in the general public; however, rapidly changing health behavior, especially on this scale, is difficult. This study considers attitudes and affective responses to handwashing as possible factors predicting COVID-19 related changes to handwashing behavior, future intentions, and readiness to change during the early stages of the pandemic in the United States. Income was explored as a potential moderator to these relationships. To explore these issues, data from 344 community participants were analyzed. Results indicate that stronger affective responses toward handwashing relate to increases in handwashing since the outbreak of COVID-19, and both attitudes and affect uniquely predict handwashing intentions. Income significantly moderated the relationship between affect and readiness to change. Those with low income were more influenced by both affective responses and attitudes. These results suggest messages targeting both cognitions and affective responses are needed to increase the handwashing behavior during a global pandemic and these variables are critical in increasing readiness to change in low-income individuals.","Clemens, Kelly S.; Matkovic, John; Faasse, Kate; Geers, Andrew L.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488444/,664

Prescribed and dispensed medications can be monitored through data linkage for each patient. We hypothesised that changes in patient care resulting from COVID-19, changed the way patients access their prescribed medication. Objective To develop an efficient approach for evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on drug dispensing patterns. Methods Retrospective observational study using national patient-level dispensing records in Wales-UK. Total dispensed drug items between 01-Jan-2016 and 31-Dec-2019 (counterfactual pre-COVID-19) were compared to 2020 (COVID-19 year). We compared trends of dispensed items in three main British National Formulary (BNF) sections(Cardiovascular system, Central Nervous System, Immunological & Vaccine) using European Age-Standardized rates. We developed an online tool to enable monitoring of changes in dispensing as the pandemic evolves. Result Amongst all BNF chapters, 52,357,639 items were dispensed in 2020 compared to 49,747,141 items in 2019 demonstrating a relative increase of 5.25% in 2020(95%CI[5.21,5.29]). Comparison of monthly patterns of 2020 and 2019 dispensed items showed a notable difference between the total number of dispensed drug items each month, with an average difference (D) of +290,055 and average Relative Change (RC) of +5.52%. The greatest RC was observed in a substantial March-2020 increase (D=+1,501,242 and RC=+28%), followed by second peak in June (D=+565,004, RC=+10.97%). May was characterised by lower dispensing (D=-399,244, RC=-5.9%). Cardiovascular categories were characterised, across all age groups, by dramatic March-2020 increases, at the epidemic peak, followed by months of lower than expected dispensing, and gradual recovery by September. The Central Nervous System category was similar, but with only a short decline in May, and quicker recovery. A stand-out grouping was Immunological and Vaccine, which dropped to very low levels across all age groups, and all months (including the March dispensing peak). Conclusions Aberration in clinical service delivery during COVID-19 led to substantial changes in community pharmacy drug dispensing.

Our study aimed to investigate clinical features of Staphylococcus aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia (SA-VAP) and, if bronchoalveolar lavage samples were available, lung bacterial community features in ICU patients with or without COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across two medical ICUs of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy), who developed SA-VAP between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020 (thereafter referred to as cases). After 1:2 matching based on the simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, cases were compared with SA-VAP patients without COVID-19 (controls). Clinical, microbiological, and lung microbiota data were analyzed. RESULTS: We studied two groups of patients (40 COVID-19 and 80 non-COVID-19). COVID-19 patients had a higher rate of late-onset (87.5% versus 63.8%; p = 0.01), methicillin-resistant (65.0% vs 27.5%; p < 0.01) or bacteremic (47.5% vs 6.3%; p < 0.01) infections compared with non-COVID-19 patients. No statistically significant differences between the patient groups were observed in ICU mortality (p = 0.12), clinical cure (p = 0.20) and microbiological eradication (p = 0.31). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, SAPS II and initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy were independently associated with ICU mortality. Then, lung microbiota characterization in 10 COVID-19 and 16 non-COVID-19 patients revealed that the overall microbial community composition was significantly different between the patient groups (unweighted UniFrac distance, R(2) 0.15349; p < 0.01). Species diversity was lower in COVID-19 than in non COVID-19 patients (94.4 ± 44.9 vs 152.5 ± 41.8; p < 0.01). Interestingly, we found that S. aureus (log(2) fold change, 29.5), Streptococcus anginosus subspecies anginosus (log(2) fold change, 24.9), and Olsenella (log(2) fold change, 25.7) were significantly enriched in the COVID-19 group compared to the non–COVID-19 group of SA-VAP patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, COVID-19 seemed to significantly affect microbiological and clinical features of SA-VAP as well as to be associated with a peculiar lung microbiota composition.

639816,Epidemic and Emerging Coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome),2016-12-16,"Summary Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35–60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

Scientists and pharmaceutical companies have promptly responded by advancing potential therapeutics into clinical trials at an exponential rate. Initial encouraging results have been realized using remdesivir and dexamethasone. Yet, the research continues so as to identify better clinically relevant therapeutics that act either as prophylactics to prevent the infection or as treatments to limit the severity of COVID-19 and substantially decrease the mortality rate. Previously, we reviewed the potential therapeutics in clinical trials that block the early stage of the viral life cycle. In this review, we summarize potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics that block/inhibit the post-entry stages of the viral life cycle. The review presents not only the chemical structures and mechanisms of the potential therapeutics under clinical investigation, i.e., listed in clinicaltrials.gov, but it also describes the relevant results of clinical trials. Their anti-inflammatory/immune-modulatory effects are also described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. At the molecular level, the therapeutics target viral proteins or processes that facilitate the post-entry stages of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral proteases such as papain-like protease (PL(pro)) and main protease (M(pro)).

We employ Granger causality tests, and the static and dynamic connectedness spillover index methodology. We find that the shocks in oil prices are Granger-caused mainly by price changes of grains, live cattle, and wheat, while supply shock granger causes variations mostly in grain prices. We find that, from the point of view of static connectedness, for both, price and volatility spillovers, the livestock is the largest transmitter, while the lean hogs are the major receiver. Our dynamic analysis evidences that connectedness increases during the financial crisis period.

The aim of this study was to analyze the recovery of immune response after a bronchiolitis episode. METHODS: Forty-nine infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis diagnosis were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were processed. Twenty-seven pro-inflammatory biomarkers linked to innate immunity, inflammation, and epithelial damage, as well as nitrites and lipid mediators, were evaluated in the NPA supernatant by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and Luminex. Also, 11 genes were analyzed in NPA cells by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: A widespread statistically significant decline of multiple pro-inflammatory parameters and cytokines were detected in the recovery period after respiratory infection: interferon-α2 (IFNα2), IFNγ, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-γ-inducible protein-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), and MIP-1β. Supporting these results, a decreased nuclear factor-κB gene expression was observed (P = 0.0116). A significant diminution of cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4) soluble levels (P = 0.0319) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression were observed in the recovery sample. In children classified by post-bronchiolitis wheezing, LTC4 remains elevated in the NPA supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: After bronchiolitis, cytokines and biomarkers linked to innate immune response in NPA decrease significantly in the recovery period accompanied by a drop in LTC4 levels; however, this reduction was lower in infants with post-bronchiolitis wheezing.","Sastre, Beatriz; García-García, María Luz; Calvo, Cristina; Casas, Inmaculada; Rodrigo-Muñoz, José Manuel; Cañas, José Antonio; Mora, Inés; del Pozo, Victoria",Pediatr Res,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0606-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600771/,664

Among them, 150 neonates had perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and 2 neonates had late postnatal exposure. Stable infant-mother dyads were roomed-in with precautions to support breastfeeding. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. There was a high incidence of prematurity (23%), low birth weight (31%), intrauterine fetal distress (16%), perinatal asphyxia (6%), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (24%), and mortality (1.3%) among neonates with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In this sub-group, 20 neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample(s). A recent official publication by the World Health Organization emphasizes that the perinatal SARS-CoV-2-exposed neonates found RT-PCR positive once in upper respiratory (non-sterile) sample must document viral persistence in another non-sterile sample for confirmation of mother-to-child virus transmission. With this approach, only one neonate was confirmed intrapartum transmission. A telephonic follow-up in discharged neonates at 1 month of age or 1 month postexposure recorded them all to be asymptomatic and doing well. Conclusion: Neonates with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure constitute a high-risk group and it is not uncommon to get a positive RT-PCR report in upper respiratory sample(s) from these babies. Majority of them do not demonstrate viral persistence. Clinical outcomes are favorable in breastfed infants roomed-in with their asymptomatic-mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers following appropriate safety protocols.","Gupta, Priyanka; Khatana, Vijay Pratap; Prabha, Rashmie; Jha, Inderkant; Singh, Mitasha; Pandey, Anil Kumar; Kesri, Ashima",Eur J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-021-04206-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379196/,664

Yet, little is understood about the levels of English language proficiency among the next generation of older migrants in Australia. Utilising a modified cohort-component model incorporating detailed language proficiency transition probabilities, we project birthplace populations by levels of English language proficiency to mid-century. Our results show that although Asian-born migrants tend to have lower levels of English proficiency, the majority of older migrants with poor proficiency are currently from a predominantly European background. In the future, we project a strong shift in the population of poor English speakers toward an Asian-born dominance as some European-born migrant groups dwindle in size and cohort flow increases population growth among older Asian migrants. Specifically, most of the population growth among older migrants with poor English proficiency occurs among Chinese and Mainland Southeast Asian migrants. However, we demonstrate that population growth among the total migrant population with poor proficiency is considerably lower than populations with good proficiency or from English-speaking households. Over the projection horizon, the total older migrant population with poor English proficiency increases by under 80,000 compared with an increase of 726,000 with good levels of proficiency and 518,000 in English-speaking households. However, we caution against conflating improved English language proficiency with a policy shift away from ethno-specific aged care services as culture, which is more than language, strongly influences perceptions of quality of aged care.","Temple, Jeromey; Wilson, Tom; Brijnath, Bianca; Utomo, Ariane; McDonald, Peter",J Int Migr Integr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12134-021-00836-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131412/,664

The aim of this study is to investigate whether short-term treatment with a supplementary or very high-dose intravenous vitamin C reduces organ failure in post-cardiac arrest patients. METHODS: This is a double-blind, multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted in 7 intensive care units (ICUs) in The Netherlands. A total of 270 patients with cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation will be randomly assigned to three groups of 90 patients (1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site and age). Patients will intravenously receive a placebo, a supplementation dose of 3 g of vitamin C or a pharmacological dose of 10 g of vitamin C per day for 96 h. The primary endpoint is organ failure at 96 h as measured by the Resuscitation-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (R-SOFA) score at 96 h minus the baseline score (delta R-SOFA). Secondary endpoints are a neurological outcome, mortality, length of ICU and hospital stay, myocardial injury, vasopressor support, lung injury score, ventilator-free days, renal function, ICU-acquired weakness, delirium, oxidative stress parameters, and plasma vitamin C concentrations. DISCUSSION: Vitamin C supplementation is safe and preclinical studies have shown beneficial effects of high-dose IV vitamin C in cardiac arrest models. This is the first RCT to assess the clinical effect of intravenous vitamin C on organ dysfunction in critically ill patients after cardiac arrest. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03509662.

Rapid and accurate detection is a key component of strategies to contain spread of infection, and the efficient diagnosis of influenza-like-illness is essential to protect health infrastructure in the event of a major influenza outbreak. METHODS: We developed a multiplexed PCR (MT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous diagnosis of respiratory viruses causing influenza-like illness, including the specific recognition of influenza A haemagglutinin subtypes H1, H3, and H5. We tested several hundred clinical specimens in two diagnostic reference laboratories and compared the results with standard techniques. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of these assays was higher than individual assays based on direct antigen detection and standard PCR against a range of control templates and in several hundred clinical specimens. The MT-PCR assays provided differential diagnoses as well as potentially useful quantitation of virus in clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: MT-PCR is a potentially powerful tool for the differential diagnosis of influenza-like illness in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.","Szewczuk, Elektra; Thapa, Kiran; Anninos, Terry; McPhie, Kenneth; Higgins, Geoff; Dwyer, Dominic E; Stanley, Keith K; Iredell, Jonathan R",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20459845/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-113,664

Efficient management, and innovations such as short-term forecasting and machine vision, demand high-resolution geographic datasets of PV installations. However, official and public sources have notable deficiencies: spatial imprecision, gaps in coverage and lack of crucial meta data, especially for small-scale solar panel installations. We present the results of a major crowd-sourcing campaign to create open geographic data for over 260,000 solar PV installations across the UK, covering an estimated 86% of the capacity in the country. We focus in particular on capturing small-scale domestic solar PV, which accounts for a significant fraction of generation but was until now very poorly documented. Our dataset suggests nameplate capacities in the UK (as of September 2020) amount to a total of 10.66 GW explicitly mapped, or 13.93 GW when missing capacities are inferred. Our method is applied to the UK but applicable worldwide, and compatible with continual updating to track the rapid growth in PV deployment.","Stowell, Dan; Kelly, Jack; Tanner, Damien; Taylor, Jamie; Jones, Ethan; Geddes, James; Chalstrey, Ed",Sci Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188212/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00739-0,664

Descriptive data from this black market channel are derived from studies analyzing the online availability of different medications procured over the internet and their methodology is quite heterogeneous. Our aim was to develop a comprehensive and specific risk assessment for selecting high patient safety risk medications from the online pharmaceutical market. A rapid tool was developed based upon the two quality and safety standard resolutions in pharmaceutical practice, published by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, and was illustrated on eye drops. We developed five dimensions in support of the risk assessment including intrinsic, extrinsic and potential risks of counterfeiting. The five criteria were integrated in a comprehensively weighted risk-scoring format. The probability of procuring the product from the internet was also assessed based on the number of relevant links within the first twenty search engine results and the cost of the products. With the application of the tool a dorzolamide & timolol combination eye drop represented the highest overall patient safety risk score. In consideration of our literature review of the past 20 years, there is no current, standardized methodology to effectively identify pharmaceutical products associated with high patient safety risks. Notably, the fully comprehensive analysis of the internet pharmaceutical market and the test purchase of all online available medicines is unrealistic. Therefore, we developed a method to aid online surveillance researches and targeted international organizational led joint actions against the uncontrolled sale of falsified and substandard medications (e.g.: Operation Pangea).","Vida, Róbert György; Merczel, Sára; Jáhn, Eszter; Fittler, András",Saudi Pharm J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424264/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2020.10.018,664
661708,Identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus‐2 inhibitors through in silico structure‐based virtual screening and molecular interaction studies,2021-06-15,"The natural anti-Gal antibody is one of the multiple natural anti-carbohydrate antibodies produced in humans against a wide range of carbohydrate antigens on GI bacteria. The antibody is unique to humans, apes, and Old World monkeys, and it binds specifically to a mammalian carbohydrate antigen called the α-gal epitope that is synthesized in nonprimate mammals, lemurs (prosimians) and New World monkeys by the glycosylation enzyme α1,3GT. The α1,3GT gene (GGTA1) appeared in mammals >100 million years ago, prior to the split between marsupial and placental mammals. This gene has been conserved in its active form, in all mammals, except for Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Inactivation of the α1,3GT gene in ancestral Old World primates occurred 20–30 million years ago and could have been associated with epidemics of enveloped viruses in the Eurasia-Africa continent. It is suggested that prior to such epidemics, few ancestral Old World primates acquired deletion point mutations that inactivated the α1,3GT gene and eliminated α-gal epitopes. This resulted in loss of immune tolerance to the α-gal epitope and thus, in production of the anti-Gal antibody against antigens on bacteria colonizing the GI tract. This accidental inactivation of the α1,3GT gene in very small populations is analogous to the highly rare blood type “Bombay” individuals who do not synthesize blood group H (O antigen) because of inactivation of the α1,2-fucosyltransferase gene. The loss of immune tolerance to blood group H antigen has resulted in production of natural anti-blood group H antibodies in the blood group Bombay individuals. It is suggested that anti-Gal protected against infections by enveloped viruses presenting α-gal epitopes, which were lethal to the parental primate populations that conserved active α1,3GT and thus, synthesized α-gal epitopes. Alternative causes for the elimination of Old World primates synthesizing α-gal epitopes could be bacteria or protozoa parasites presenting α-gal or α-gal-like epitopes, and bacterial toxins, or detrimental viruses that used α-gal epitopes in these primates as “docking receptors.” Ultimately, any of these proposed selective processes could result in extinction of Old World primates synthesizing α-gal epitopes on their cells. These ancestral primates were replaced by offspring populations lacking α-gal epitopes and producing the anti-Gal antibody, which continues to be produced by Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. New World monkeys and lemurs were protected from pathogens of the Old World by oceanic barriers, thus they continue to synthesize α-gal epitopes and lack the ability to produce the anti-Gal antibody. This scenario of few individuals in a large population having a mutation(s) that inactivates a glycosyltransferase gene thus, resulting in production of evolutionary advantageous natural antibodies against the eliminated carbohydrate antigen, may reflect one of the mechanisms inducing changes in the carbohydrate profile of various mammalian populations.","Galili, Uri",The Natural Anti-Gal Antibody As Foe Turned Friend In Medicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128133620000026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128133620000026,664

674955,The emerging role of microRNAs in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection,2020-11-13,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays. Furthermore, these studies also highlight the role of APCs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection.","Cong, Yu; Hart, Brit J.; Gross, Robin; Zhou, Huanying; Frieman, Matthew; Bollinger, Laura; Wada, Jiro; Hensley, Lisa E.; Jahrling, Peter B.; Dyall, Julie; Holbrook, Michael R.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566060/,664

These include non-specific symptoms (e.g., headaches and fatigue) which were found to be affected by psychological processes in other disorders (e.g., post-concussion syndrome, PCS, after mild traumatic brain injury). The current study assessed the impact of diagnosis threat (i.e., information regarding the long-term neurological impact of COVID-19) and suggestibility on endorsed symptoms of both recovered patients and healthy controls. METHOD: Recovered patients (n = 90) and healthy controls (n = 210) described their cognitive functioning after being randomly assigned to: (a) Experimental group: These participants read an article that explored long-term neurological symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. (b) Control group: These participants read an article providing general information regarding the disease. RESULTS: Recovered patients, but not healthy controls, endorsed more symptoms in the experimental condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, suggestibility was correlated with endorsement of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Post COVID-19 neurological symptoms may, at least partially, be affected by non-neurological factors such as diagnosis threat. Information regarding long-term effects of COVID-19 may skew reported symptoms with highly suggestible individuals particularly susceptible to these effects.

METHODS: Single‐center retrospective cohort study of adult HCT recipients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. RESULTS: Twenty‐eight consecutive transplantation and cellular therapy patients (autologous, n = 12; allogeneic, n = 15; chimeric antigen receptor T‐cell therapy [CAR‐T], n = 1) with COVID‐19 were identified. The median age was 57 years. The median time from HCT to COVID‐19 diagnosis was 656 days (interquartile range [IQR], 33‐1274). Patients were followed for a median of 59 days (IQR, 40‐88). Among assessable patients (n = 19), 10 (53%) had documented virological clearance; median time to clearance was 34 days (range, 21‐56). Out of 28, 12 (43%), 6 (21%), and 10 (36%) patients had mild, moderate, and severe/critical disease, respectively.

Shikimic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxy-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid), a natural organic compound, is generally utilized as a starting material for industrial synthesis of the antiviral oseltamivir, a drug against the H1N1 influenza virus. It is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), and most alkaloids of plants and microorganisms. Plant and microbial sources are the only sources of shikimic acid. Being a deadly viral disease, influenza causes the death of around half a million people each year. A neuraminidase present on the surface of the virus is the most important factor for viral reproduction by contributing to the release of viruses from infected host cells and hence the treatment of influenza can only be possible by neuraminidase inhibitors. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or Tamiflu derived from shikimic acid pathway have been found to be potent influenza viral neuraminidase inhibitors against most influenza strains.","Priyanka Singh; Gupta, Ena; Neha Mishra; Mishra, Pragya",Phytochemicals as Lead Compounds for New Drug Discovery,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128178904000160; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128178904000160,664

Although most infections are mild, patients with severe and critical COVID-19 infections face deterioration of respiratory function and may also have extrapulmonary manifestations, mostly affecting the kidney, digestive tract, heart, and nervous system. Here, we prospectively evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in urine samples obtained from patients with COVID-19 receiving critical care. Among 51 included patients, we found higher serum creatinine levels, a longer hospital stay, and more frequent need for dialysis in urine-positive patients. These findings could suggest that, in predisposed patients, a direct viral cytopathic effect may contribute to a more severe disease phenotype.","de Souza, Sérgio Pinto; Silveira, Marcelo Augusto Duarte; Souza, Bruno Solano de Freitas; Cabral, Julia Barros; de Melo, Erica Batista dos Santos Galvão; Nonaka, Carolina Kymie Vasques; Coelho, Fernanda Oliveira; da Hora Passos, Rogério",J Int Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211015555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990155/,664
685685,The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS - COV - 2) pandemic and fragmented QRS,2020-07-22,"IMPORTANCE: Healthcare workers are presumed to be at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to occupational exposure to infected patients. However, no epidemiological study has examined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of healthcare workers during the early phase of community transmission. OBJECTIVE: To determine the baseline prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of previously undiagnosed healthcare workers and a comparison group of non-healthcare workers. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: A large U.S. university and two affiliated university hospitals PARTICIPANTS: 546 health care workers and 283 non-health care workers with no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection EXPOSURE: Healthcare worker status and role MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): SARS-CoV-2 infection status as determined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among healthcare workers (7.3%) than in non-healthcare workers (0.4%), representing a 7.0% greater absolute risk (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7%, 9.3%). The majority of infected healthcare workers (62.5%) worked as nurses. Positive tests increased across the two weeks of cohort recruitment in line with rising confirmed cases in the hospitals and surrounding counties. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a prospective cohort conducted in the early phases of community transmission, healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than non-healthcare workers, attesting to the occupational hazards of caring for patients in this crisis. Baseline data reported here will enable us to monitor the spread of infection and examine risk factors for transmission among healthcare workers.

Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beta-coronavirus infections have been associated with tachyarrhythmias and signs and symptoms of heart failure. The emergence of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, has rapidly developed into a pandemic, and a large number of infected patients have been reported to have underlying cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: Since there are only scant published data regarding cardiovascular burden in the wake of viral epidemics, this study aimed to evaluate cardiac involvement in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 40 adult inpatients at two centers in Germany. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were included in the study, which focused on the potential cardiac involvement of SARS-CoV‑2. It was based on laboratory parameters as well as electro- and echocardiographic values to determine the impact of SARS-CoV‑2 virus on heart tissues. RESULTS: The conducted investigations confirmed the relationship between the presence of acute cardiac injury and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Myocardial injury and impaired myocardial function due to COVID-19 are common; however, no correlation was established between cardiac laboratory or echocardiographic values and mortality. Cardiovascular monitoring upon COVID-19 infection is crucial to determine the burden of cardiac involvement.","Saleh, Ahmed; Matsumori, Akira; Abdelrazek, Sherif; Eltaweel, Sara; Salous, Amjad; Neumann, Franz-Josef; Antz, Matthias",Herz,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00059-020-05001-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33216154/,664

The sample consisted of three males and one female – Latvian citizens, aged 36–68 years, with higher education and different sailing experience. In the context of a case study grounded on arts-based research methods, the freehand drawings of self-portraits or something important during the day were obtained using individual diaries containing daily reports on the sailing experience. After the journey, individual drawings prompted interviews organized for each participant. The results were triangulated with data from the logbook. In their drawings, participants focused more on the environment rather than on self-representation, that is, telling the story about “here and now” in terms of specific time (journey), place (boat), and their relationship with nature, as well as dealing with problems during the trip. The psychological experience of transoceanic sailing matched the three general dimensions (dynamics, context, and content of experience) of the conceptual framework constructed for this study. The three dimensions of experience were equivalently represented in research data; however, only dynamics and context were fully delineated in all theoretical subcategories. As to the potential of arts-based research for the enhancement of sailors’ well-being, the findings show both direct and indirect evidence concerning their psychological and existential well-being. Further research is still needed to confirm the findings on a broader scale and in other contexts.","Pipere, Anita; Mārtinsone, Kristīne; Regzdiņa-Pelēķe, Laura; Grišķeviča, Ingūna",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162914/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.572028,664
687711,CRISPR-Cas System: The Powerful Modulator of Accessory Genomes in Prokaryotes,2021,"Coronaviruses, which have been enveloped nonsegmented positive‐sense RNA viruses, were first mentioned in the mid‐1960s and can attack people as well as a wide range of animals (including mammals and birds). Three zoonotic coronaviruses have been identified as the cause of large‐scale epidemics over the last two decades: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS). Epithelial cells in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract are the principal targeted cells, and viral shedding occurs via these systems in diverse ways such as through fomites, air, or feces. Patients infected with the novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) reported having visited the Wuhan seafood wholesale market shortly before disease onset. The clinical data on established 2019‐nCoV cases reported so far indicate a milder disease course than that described for patients with SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV. This study aimed to review radiation inactivation of these viruses in the food industry in three sections: visible light, ionizing radiation (alpha ray, beta ray, X‐ray, gamma ray, neutron, plasma, and ozone), and nonionizing radiation (microwave, ultraviolet, infrared, laser light, and radiofrequency). Due to the obvious possibility of human‐to‐human and animal‐to‐human transmission, using at least one of these three methods in food processing and packaging during coronavirus outbreaks will be critical for preventing further outbreaks at the community level.","Shahi, Sharifeh; Khorvash, Reza; Goli, Mohammad; Ranjbaran, Seyed Mohsen; Najarian, Afsaneh; Mohammadi Nafchi, Abdorreza",Food Sci Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.2539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646553/,664
