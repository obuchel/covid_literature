5222,"Health—exploring complexity: an interdisciplinary systems approach HEC2016: 28 August–2 September 2016, Munich, Germany",2016-08-13,"Previous genetic analyses indicated that translational frameshifting in the −1 direction occurs within the run of six adenines in the sequence 5′-TTAAAAAACTC-3′ at nucleotide positions 305–315 in IS 1, where the two out-of-phase reading frames insA and B′-insB overlap, to produce transposase with a polypeptide segment Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu at residues 84–87. IS 1 mutants with a 1 by insertion, which encode mutant transposases with an amino acid substitution within the polypeptide segment at residues 84–87, did not efficiently mediate cointegration, except for an IS 1 mutant which encodes a mutant transposase with a Leu-Arg-Lys-Leu segment instead of Leu-LysLys-Leu. An IS 1 mutant with the DNA segment 5′-CTTAAAAACTC-3′ at positions 305–315 carrying the termination codon TAA in the B′-insB reading frame could still mediate cointegration, indicating that codon AAA for Lys corresponding to second, third and fourth positions in the run of adenines is the site of frameshifting. The β-galactosidase activity specified by several IS 1- lacZ fusion plasmids, in which B′-insB is in-frame with lacZ, showed that the region 292–377 is sufficient for frameshifting. The protein produced by frameshifting from the IS 1-lacZ plasmid in fact contained the polypeptide segment Leu - Lys - Lys - Leu encoded by the DNA segment 5′-TTAAAAAACTC-3′, indicating that −1 frameshifting does occur within the run of adenines.","Sekine, Yasuhiko; Nagasawa, Hiromichi; Ohtsubo, Eiichi",Mol Gen Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088211/,504

We argue that ethical communication must not only he effective, so that pandemic plans can be successfully implemented, communications should also take specific account of the needs of the disadvantaged, so that they are not further disenfranchised. This will require particular attention to the role of the mainstream media which may disadvantage the vulnerable through misrepresentation and exclusion.","Lee, Connal; Rogers, Wendy A.",Monash Bioeth Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099310/,504

Despite developments in research related to the grief and loss of foster parents, more research would be helpful in building a stronger understanding and knowledge base for helping foster parents manage the removals of foster children in their home. This study included ten foster parents from the United States and explored their experience with loss and the stress associated with the expected or unexpected removal of a foster child from their home. The findings of the data analysis yielded three overarching themes: (1) managing or coping with ambiguous loss; (2) systemic impacts of a move or removal on a family; (3) need for helpful preparation or support for dealing with the loss of foster child. Implications include better preparation and support for foster parents dealing with moves and removals of foster children, as well as considering less abrupt removals of children from foster homes.","Newquist, Jennifer; Ladd, Linda D.; Cooley, Morgan E.",Child Adolesc Social Work J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223846/,504
11420,Safety of Major Abdominal Operations in the Elderly: A Study of Geriatric-Specific Determinants of Health,2020-04-21,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects generated by an intensivist in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) on the process of care and patient outcomes. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational study conducted in the 16-bedded PICU of a tertiary referral center. Two years (2013–2015) period of the PICU without an intensivist and the following two years (2015–2017) when it was attended by an intensivist who was also the first ever graduate of the fellowship program in Turkey were compared. RESULTS: Number of patients followed in PICU increased more than 2-fold. Number of mechanically ventilated patients increased more than 2-folds and presence of intensivist reduced the mechanical ventilation duration by 59%. Presence of intensivist reduced the mortality rates by 2.18 times. It was shown that management of PICU beds by an intensivist resulted in increased number of patients per year per PICU bed, increased care of true critical care patients who are in need of more intensive therapies and invasive procedures including extracorporeal treatment options, decreased length of stay, decreased number and rate of nosocomial infections, and decreased mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: What transforms a unit full of critically ill patients to an intensive care unit is a dedicated intensivist. The current study demonstrated that intensivist is the crucial component of the PICUs.","Kesici, Selman; Bayrakci, Benan",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223883/,504

12652,Understanding long-term HIV survivorship among African American/Black and Latinx persons living with HIV in the United States: a qualitative exploration through the lens of symbolic violence,2020-08-28,"BACKGROUND: Differential expression (DE) analysis of transcriptomic data enables genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes associated with biological conditions of interest. Such analysis often provides a wide list of genes that are differentially expressed between two or more groups. In general, identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) can be subject to further downstream analysis for obtaining more biological insights such as determining enriched functional pathways or gene ontologies. Furthermore, DEGs are treated as candidate biomarkers and a small set of DEGs might be identified as biomarkers using either biological knowledge or data-driven approaches. METHODS: In this work, we present a novel approach for identifying biomarkers from a list of DEGs by re-ranking them according to the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) criteria using repeated cross-validation feature selection procedure. RESULTS: Using gene expression profiles for 199 children with sepsis and septic shock, we identify 108 DEGs and propose a 10-gene signature for reliably predicting pediatric sepsis mortality with an estimated Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) score of 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning based refinement of DE analysis is a promising tool for prioritizing DEGs and discovering biomarkers from gene expression profiles. Moreover, our reported 10-gene signature for pediatric sepsis mortality may facilitate the development of reliable diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for sepsis.","Abbas, Mostafa; EL-Manzalawy, Yasser",BMC Med Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453705/,504
13192,Are long telomeres better than short? Relative contributions of genetically predicted telomere length to neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease risk and population health burden,2020-10-08,"The most frequent cause of acute cough (lasting up to 3 weeks) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks) is a viral infection, which is mostly a self-limiting disease in otherwise healthy persons. Some herbal compounds, the antitussive dextromethorphan and ambroxol are effective for symptom relief. Antibiotics are ineffective and should not be used due to resistance development. If after appropriate diagnostic procedures the cause of chronic cough, i.e. cough lasting more than 8 weeks, cannot be attributed to a well-established respiratory disease, it meets the definition of a disease in its own right, chronic idiopathic (unexplained) cough (CIH). This is caused by hypersensitivity of the cough reflex. Thus, even weak low threshold stimuli, e.g. changing temperature, extensive speaking and odors can trigger the cough reflex. In the case of nonresponse to guideline-conform treatment the definition of chronic refractory cough is met.","Kardos, Peter",Pneumologe (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7545797/,504

Their toxicity towards organisms and humans has recently been addressed as an important issue. In this study, a metabolomic approach was employed to obtain an insight into the effect of CNDs (either pristine or doped with nitrogen and nitrogen/sulfur) on zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to concentrations corresponding to lethal concentration (LC) LC(50) (550, 400, and 150 μg mL(−1)), LC(50/2) (275, 200, and 75 μg mL(−1)), and LC(50/4) (138, 100, and 38 μg mL(−1)) of the three CNDs (non-doped, N-doped, and N,S-codoped, respectively) to scrutinize the interactions of the CNDs with the larvae. Numerous differences in the metabolic pathways were recorded in all cases. Seven metabolic pathways were detected in the control larvae. When the larvae were exposed to concentrations equal to LC(50), LC(50/2), and LC(50/4) of non-doped CNDs, 12, 12, and 3 metabolic pathways were detected, respectively. In the case of N-doped CNDs, 4, 7, and 4 pathways were detected, while in the case of N,S-codoped CNDs, 8, 5, and 5 pathways were detected when exposed to concentrations of LC(50), LC(50/2), and LC(50/4), respectively. In all cases, certain metabolic pathways were altered while others were either down-regulated or up-regulated. Some of these changes include the activation of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, butanoate metabolism, D-glutamine, and D-glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation pathways. Moreover, the deactivation of starch and sucrose metabolism, the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, among others, were recorded. Our findings underline the importance to further study the impact of CNDs on marine organisms. As zebrafish has been shown to share many similarities with humans in bioprocesses and genome, it can be assumed that CNDs may also pose a threat to human health.","G.

19153,Operating in a Climate Crisis: A State-of-the-Science Review of Life Cycle Assessment within Surgical and Anesthetic Care,2021-07-12,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is considered the most important human pathogen due to its role in infections and cellular malignancies. It has been reported that this Oncolytic virus infects 90% world’s population. EBNA1 is required for DNA binding and survival of the virus and is considered an essential drug target. The biochemical and structural properties of this protein are known, but it is still unclear which residues impart a critical role in the recognition of dsDNA. Intending to disclose only the essential residues in recognition of dsDNA, this study used a computational pipeline to generate an alanine mutant of each interacting residue and determine the impact on the binding. Our analysis revealed that R469A, K514A, Y518A, R521A and R522A are the key hotspots for the recognition of dsDNA by the EBNA1. The dynamics properties, i.e. stability, flexibility, structural compactness, hydrogen bonding frequency, binding affinity, are altered by disrupting the protein-DNA contacts, thereby decreases the binding affinity. In particular, the two arginine substitution, R521A and R522A, significantly affected the total binding energy. Thus, we hypothesize that these residues impart a critical role in the dsDNA recognition and pathogenesis. This study would help to design structure-based drugs against the EBV infections.","Hashmi, Huma Farooque; Waseem, Muhammad; Ali, Syed Shujait; Hussain, Zahid; Chen, Kaoshan",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8275655/,504

However, the influence of EPO on mitochondria and cognition during development remains unexplored. We previously observed that EPO stimulates hippocampal-specific neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis early in postnatal development in mice. Here we show that EPO promotes mitochondrial respiration in developing postnatal hippocampus by increasing mitochondrial content and enhancing cellular respiratory potential. Ultrastructurally, mitochondria profiles and total vesicle content were greater in presynaptic axon terminals, suggesting that EPO enhances oxidative metabolism and synaptic transmission capabilities. Behavioural tests of hippocampus-dependent memory at early adulthood, showed that EPO improves spatial and short-term memory. Collectively, we identify a role for EPO in the murine postnatal hippocampus by promoting mitochondrial function throughout early postnatal development, which corresponds to enhanced cognition by early adulthood.","Jacobs, Robert A.; Aboouf, Mostafa A.; Koester-Hegmann, Christina; Muttathukunnel, Paola; Laouafa, Sofien; Arias-Reyes, Christian; Thiersch, Markus; Soliz, Jorge; Gassmann, Max; Schneider Gasser, Edith M.",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8342552/,504
20234,A Worker-Centered Personal Health Record App for Workplace Health Promotion Using National Health Care Data Sets: Design and Development Study,2021-08-04,"Evolutionary selection ensures specificity and efficiency in dynamic metastable macromolecular machines that repair DNA damage without releasing toxic and mutagenic intermediates. Here we examine non‐homologous end joining (NHEJ) as the primary conserved DNA double‐strand break (DSB) repair process in human cells. NHEJ has exemplary key roles in networks determining the development, outcome of cancer treatments by DSB‐inducing agents, generation of antibody and T‐cell receptor diversity, and innate immune response for RNA viruses. We determine mechanistic insights into NHEJ structural biochemistry focusing upon advanced small angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) results combined with X‐ray crystallography (MX) and cryo‐electron microscopy (cryo‐EM). SAXS coupled to atomic structures enables integrated structural biology for objective quantitative assessment of conformational ensembles and assemblies in solution, intra‐molecular distances, structural similarity, functional disorder, conformational switching, and flexibility. Importantly, NHEJ complexes in solution undergo larger allosteric transitions than seen in their cryo‐EM or MX structures. In the long‐range synaptic complex, X‐ray repair cross‐complementing 4 (XRCC4) plus XRCC4‐like‐factor (XLF) form a flexible bridge and linchpin for DNA ends bound to KU heterodimer (Ku70/80) and DNA‐PKcs (DNA‐dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit). Upon binding two DNA ends, auto‐phosphorylation opens DNA‐PKcs dimer licensing NHEJ via concerted conformational transformations of XLF‐XRCC4, XLF–Ku80, and LigIV(BRCT)–Ku70 interfaces. Integrated structures reveal multifunctional roles for disordered linkers and modular dynamic interfaces promoting DSB end processing and alignment into the short‐range complex for ligation by LigIV. Integrated findings define dynamic assemblies fundamental to designing separation‐of‐function mutants and allosteric inhibitors targeting conformational transitions in multifunctional complexes.","Hammel, Michal; Tainer, John A.",Protein Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8376411/,504

Hydrogels perform functions relevant to a range of biomedical purposes—they can deliver drugs or cells, regenerate hard and soft tissues, adhere to wet tissues, prevent bleeding, provide contrast during imaging, protect tissues or organs during radiotherapy, and improve the biocompatibility of medical implants. These capabilities make hydrogels useful for many distinct and pressing diseases and medical conditions and even for less conventional areas such as environmental engineering. In this review, we cover the major capabilities of hydrogels, with a focus on the novel benefits of injectable hydrogels, and how they relate to translational applications in medicine and the environment. We pay close attention to how the development of contemporary hydrogels requires extensive interdisciplinary collaboration to accomplish highly specific and complex biological tasks that range from cancer immunotherapy to tissue engineering to vaccination. We complement our discussion of preclinical and clinical development of hydrogels with mechanical design considerations needed for scaling injectable hydrogel technologies for clinical application. We anticipate that readers will gain a more complete picture of the expansive possibilities for hydrogels to make practical and impactful differences across numerous fields and biomedical applications.","Correa, Santiago; Grosskopf, Abigail K.; Lopez Hernandez, Hector; Chan, Doreen; Yu, Anthony C.; Stapleton, Lyndsay M.; Appel, Eric A.",Chem Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8461619/,504

If such approaches are to become more widely adopted, they must be feasible and acceptable to food service managers. Among possible early adopters, managers of food services in post-secondary education institutions may have unique insights on implementation of such approaches, as they have dual mandates to support student health and maintain profitability. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this exploratory study was to examine current knowledge, practice, facilitators, and barriers to uptake of nudge strategies promoting FV in a sample of post-secondary food service managers. METHODS: A qualitative telephone interview study was undertaken with food service managers across Canada (n = 10 institutions), recruited from a national professional organization. One or more representatives from each institution completed the interview. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and underwent framework descriptive and interpretative content analysis in NVivo (QSR International). Münscher's Taxonomy of Choice Architecture and the Ottawa Model for Research Use guided development and analysis. RESULTS: Managers from 9 universities and 1 technical college participated. Local context, governance, and resources varied widely. Eight of 10 institutions used some form of FV nudging as part of their marketing and health promotion, most commonly to reduce the effort associated with choosing FV. Nudging strategies aimed at increasing the range and composition of FV offerings, providing a social reference (opinion leaders) for choosing FV, and changing consequences with loyalty cards were also common. Other nudging strategies were used infrequently. Cost, operational ease of implementation, and students’ privacy and choices were critical issues in adoption. CONCLUSIONS: The results can inform development and testing of locally adapted nudge interventions. It is critical that managers be involved from the outset of any planned academic implementation study.","Bains, Kiran; DeMarco, Natalie; Brauer, Paula; Yi, Sunghwan",Curr Dev Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490100/,504

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective multicenter observational study was conducted in 30 ICUs in France and Spain. All consecutive patients presenting with septic shock were eligible. The use of tracheal intubation was described across the participating ICUs. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with early intubation (before H8 following vasopressor onset). RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-nine patients were enrolled. Two hundred and nine patients were intubated early (24%, range 4.5–47%), across the 18 centers with at least 20 patients included. The cumulative intubation rate during the ICU stay was 324/859 (38%, range 14–65%). In the multivariate analysis, seven parameters were significantly associated with early intubation and ranked as follows by decreasing weight: Glasgow score, center effect, use of accessory respiratory muscles, lactate level, vasopressor dose, pH and inability to clear tracheal secretions. Global R-square of the model was only 60% indicating that 40% of the variability of the intubation process was related to other parameters than those entered in this analysis. CONCLUSION: Neurological, respiratory and hemodynamic parameters only partially explained the use of tracheal intubation in septic shock patients. Center effect was important.

In this paper, we propose to model this task of monitoring as a special case of object detection. However, real-time scene parsing through object detection running on edge devices is very challenging, due to limited memory and computing power of embedded devices. To deal with these challenges, we used a few popular object detection algorithms such as YOLOv3, YOLOv3Tiny, SSD and Faster R-CNN and evaluated them on Moxa3K benchmark dataset. The results obtained from these evaluations help us to determine methods that are more efficient, faster, and thus are more suitable for real-time object detection specialized for this task.","Roy, Biparnak; Nandy, Subhadip; Ghosh, Debojit; Dutta, Debarghya; Biswas, Pritam; Das, Tamodip",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382322/,504

Consumer functional responses provide a useful tool to examine relationships between consumption rates and ecologically relevant prey densities, whilst also accounting for abiotic factors that likely influence consumption rates. We investigated how temperature influences the consumer functional response of the amphipod Gammarus lacustris towards the cercariae of three freshwater trematodes (Diplostomum, Apatemon and Trichobilharzia). Amphipods displayed different functional responses towards the parasites, with Type II responses for Diplostomum and Type I responses for Apatemon prey. Temperature did not alter the consumption rate of the amphipod predator. Trichobilharzia was likely consumed at similar proportions as Diplostomum; however, this could not be fully evaluated due to low replication. Whilst Type II responses of invertebrate predators are common to various invertebrate prey types, this is the first time a non-filter feeding predator has been shown to exhibit Type I response towards cercarial prey. The prey-specific consumption patterns of amphipods were related to cercarial distribution in the water column rather than to the size of cercariae or temperature influence. The substantial energy flow into food webs by non-host consumer organisms highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that modulate functional responses and direct predation in the context of parasitic organisms.

In this study, we report the autopsy findings from the lungs and lymphatic organs of twelve COVID-19 decedents that evaluated histopathological changes, immune cell signature, and inflammatory factor expression in the lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes. Here we show that the major pulmonary alternations included diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial fibrosis, and exudative inflammation featured with extensive serous and fibrin exudates, macrophage infiltration, and abundant production of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IP-10, TNFα and IL-1β). The spleen and hilar lymph nodes contained lesions with tissue structure disruption and immune cell dysregulation, including lymphopenia and macrophage accumulation. These findings provide pathological evidence that links injuries of the lungs and lymphatic organs with the fatal systematic respiratory and immune malfunction in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Qian; Shi, Yu; Cai, Jun; Duan, Yaqi; Wang, Rongshuai; Zhang, Hongyan; Ruan, Qiurong; Li, Jiansha; Zhao, Lei; Ping, Yifang; Chen, Rong; Ren, Liang; Fei, Xiaochun; Zhang, Heng; Tang, Rui; Wang, Xi; Luo, Tao; Liu, Xindong; Huang, Xuequan; Liu, Zhenhua; Ao, Qilin; Ren, Yong; Xiong, Jing; He, Zhicheng; Wu, Haibo; Fu, Wenjuan; Zhao, Pengnan; Chen, Xinwei; Qu, Guoqiang; Wang, Yunyun; Wang, Xi; Liu, Jia; Xiang, Dongfang; Xu, Sanpeng; Zhou, Xiaowei; Li, Qingrui; Ma, Jinghong; Li, Heng; Zhang, Jie; Huang, Sizhe; Yao, Xiaohong; Zhou, Yiwu; Wang, Chaofu; Zhang, Dingyu; Wang, Guoping; Liu, Liang; Bian, Xiu-Wu",Natl Sci Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543449/,504

Whereas male political leaders historically drew on their traditional role as the male head of household to display forms of masculine protectionism toward citizens, women leaders are now able to draw on their traditional motherly role—for example, as the member of the household who traditionally cares for the sick—to display forms of feminine protectionism. As a result, international women leaders have managed to leverage women's role in the home to their advantage in the political sphere. Significantly, an appreciation of traditionally feminine attributes in women political leaders has been displayed in much media coverage, providing more favorable coverage of female political leaders than was previously the case.","Johnson, Carol; Williams, Blair",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7578628/,504

Increasing basal energy expenditure has been proposed as a strategy to fight obesity yet raises efficiency and safety concerns. Here, we show that mice deficient for a muscle-specific enzyme of very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis display increased basal energy expenditure and protection against high-fat diet–induced obesity. Mechanistically, muscle-specific modulation of the very-long-chain fatty acid pathway was associated with a reduced content of the inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid cardiolipin and a blunted coupling efficiency between the respiratory chain and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) synthase, which was restored by cardiolipin enrichment. Our study reveals that selective increase of lipid oxidative capacities in skeletal muscle, through the cardiolipin-dependent lowering of mitochondrial ATP production, provides an effective option against obesity at the whole-body level.","Prola, Alexandre; Blondelle, Jordan; Vandestienne, Aymeline; Piquereau, Jérôme; Denis, Raphaël G.

For the context of this study, it is important to note that the Chinese authorities implemented the strictest lockdown after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Drawing on the data from a county-level city in Hubei province, this study examines changes in the quantity and nature of 110 service calls before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The results indicate that the average weekly call numbers before and after the lockdown were higher than during the lockdown. Meanwhile, different call types produced different patterns, though the weekly call totals decreased during the lockdown. There was a significant decrease in crime, traffic, and dispute calls, but a substantial increase in calls related to domestic violence, public security, and other issues. Changes in the frequency of different call types pose challenges to police departments.

As it is often not obvious in which context problematic statements occur, it is challenging to assess their practical impact. While some flaws may turn out to be bad practice but not undermine the overall security level, others could have a serious impact. Distinguishing them requires knowledge of the designated app purpose. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based system that is capable of generating natural language text describing the purpose and core functionality of Android apps based on their actual code. We design a dense neural network that captures the semantic relationships of resource identifiers, string constants, and API calls contained in apps to derive a high-level picture of implemented program behavior. For arbitrary applications, our system can predict precise, human-readable keywords and short phrases that indicate the main use-cases apps are designed for. We evaluate our solution on 67,040 real-world apps and find that with a precision between 69% and 84% we can identify keywords that also occur in the developer-provided description in Google Play. To avoid incomprehensible black box predictions, we apply a model explaining algorithm and demonstrate that our technique can substantially augment inspections of Android apps by contributing contextual information.","Feichtner, Johannes; Gruber, Stefan",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978970/,504

Intra-operative regional infiltration of long-acting local anaesthetic (LA) has been shown to be efficacious in reducing post-operative pain after general anaesthesia, yet few studies have explored the optimal timing of its use. METHOD: Patients undergoing day-case breast/general surgical operations under a single consultant surgeon were randomised to receive LA infiltration (Levobupivicaine) before the initial incision, or during wound closure. All patients were given a propofol-based general anaesthetic. Primary outcomes were intra-operative/post-operative fentanyl requirements, and numerical pain scores (at 1 and 3 hours post-operatively). The study ran from October 2019 but was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-parametric statistical tests were used. RESULTS: 25 patients were randomised. Those receiving pre-incisional LA had lower fentanyl requirements intra-operatively (mean; 150mcg vs 186mcg, p < 0.05) but similar requirements post-operatively. Mean pain scores were lower in the pre-incisional LA group at 1 hour (1.2 vs 2.3, p < 0.05) and 3 hours post-operatively (0.7 vs 1.3, p > 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-incisional infiltration of LA led to a significantly reduced requirement for intra-operative fentanyl, and significantly lower pain scores at 1 hour post-operatively. Larger studies should interrogate this effect at individual procedure level and assess for differences in rates of chronic pain.","Jones, C; Baker-Wilding, R; Coombs, N",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135943/,504

Therefore, it is essential to establish a student health management concept for their health promotion. Due to their young age, students generally belong to a rather healthy population group. However, they may also suffer from health problems. Especially the effects of the Corona pandemic on the students should be considered. OBJECTIVES: The following article aimed how the context of the Corona pandemic influences health-related behaviors and stresses among students at Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a literature research, a questionnaire was created in order to assess students’ behaviors on the topics physical activity, nutrition, perceived stress, and addictive substance consumption. In all, 1281 students participated in the online survey. The results were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: As a result of the Corona pandemic, students move less in their daily lives, have to reorganize their meal planning due to legal regulations, and are exposed to higher stress levels, e.g., due to changes in exam performance or the loss of a part-time job. The consumption of addictive substances remains virtually unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The Corona pandemic is causing positive and negative changes in health behaviors and burdens among students. Nevertheless, further research is needed to look more comprehensively at the impact of the pandemic on students.","Ehrentreich, Saskia; Metzner, Linda; Deraneck, Sandra; Blavutskaya, Zlata; Tschupke, Sandra; Hasseler, Martina",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8381696/,504

OBJECTIVE To determine the contribution of reaction characteristics, allergic comorbidities, and demographics, in predicting FA in individuals experiencing food-related adverse reactions. METHODS Adult and school-age participants in the standardised EuroPrevall population surveys, with self-reported FA, were included. Penalised multivariable regression was used to assess the association of patient history determinants with 'probable' FA, defined as a food-specific case history supported by relevant IgE sensitisation. RESULTS In adults (N=844), reproducibility of reaction (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.29-1.41]), oral allergy symptoms (OAS) (4.46 [4.19-4.75]), allergic rhinitis (AR) comorbidity (2.82 [2.68-2.95]), asthma comorbidity (1.38 [1.30-1.46]), and male sex (1.50 [1.41-1.59]), were positively associated with probable FA. Gastrointestinal symptoms (0.88 [0.85-0.91]) made probable FA less likely. The AUC of a model combining all selected predictors was 0.85 after cross-validation. In children (N=670), OAS (2.26 [2.09-2.44]) and AR comorbidity (1.47 [CI 1.39-1.55]) contributed most to prediction of probable FA, with a combined cross-validation-based AUC of 0.73. When focusing on plant foods, the dominant source of FA in adults, the paediatric model also included gastrointestinal symptoms (inverse association), and the AUC increased to 0.81. CONCLUSIONS In both adults and school-age children from the general population, reporting of OAS, and AR comorbidity, appear to be the strongest predictors of probable FA.

61041,COVID-19 and 'conversations not had' with people with frailty in acute settings.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Cleft palate is a common craniofacial defect, which occurs when the palate fails to fuse during development. During fusion, the palatal shelves migrate towards the embryonic midline to form a seam. Apoptotic elimination of medial edge epithelium (MEE) cells along this seam is required for the completion of palate fusion. METHODS Whole exome sequencing (WES) of six Chinese cleft palate families was applied to identify novel cleft palate-associated gene variants. Palatal fusion and immunofluorescence studies were performed in a murine palatal shelf organ culture model. Gene and protein expression were analyzed by qPCR and immunoblotting in murine MEE cells during seam formation in vivo. Mechanistic immunoprecipitation studies were performed in murine MEE cells in vitro. RESULTS WES identified Bcl-2 associated anthanogene 6 (BAG6) as a novel cleft palate-associated gene. In murine MEE cells, we discovered upregulation of Bag6 and the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) during seam formation in vivo. Using a palatal shelf organ culture model, we demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 enhances MEE cell apoptosis by promoting p300's acetylation of FoxO1, thereby promoting transcription of the pro-apoptotic Fas ligand (FasL). Subsequent gain- and loss-of-function studies in the organ culture model demonstrated that FasL is required for Bag6/acFoxO1-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Bax/caspase-3 signaling, MEE apoptosis, and palate fusion. Palatal shelf contact was shown to enhance Bag6 nuclear localization and upregulate nuclear acFoxO1 in MEE cells. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 and p300 co-operatively enhance FoxO1 acetylation to promote FasL-mediated MEE apoptosis during palate fusion.","Xu, Jing; Liu, Fei; Xiong, Zhuyou; Huo, Jiwu; Li, Wei; Jiang, Banghong; Mao, Wu; He, Bo; Wang, Xiaojing; Li, Guangzao",Experimental cell research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991875/,504

The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is more specific for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) than the tuberculin skin test, especially among populations with a high degree of coverage by the BCG vaccine. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the first screening of healthcare workers (HCW) for LTBI using the IGRA at a general hospital in Beijing. METHODS A pilot screening program for LTBI was triggered by accidental contact between HCW and two patients with active TB in the emergency department (ED). Given the necessity of estimating the overall LTBI prevalence in the institution, a sample of 518 HCW was enrolled in our cross-sectional study. The second IGRA was repeated with 43 of the 121 HCW in the ED after exposure to index TB cases. Data on putative risk factors were collected with a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS The prevalence of LTBI in the targeted population was 21.8%. Differences in the prevalence of LTBI were significantly related to age, employment duration, and history of occupational exposure. A lack of childhood BCG vaccination was independently associated with the prevalence of LTBI (adjusted OR: 1.686, 95% CI: 1.045-2.723, P = .0325). No new LTBI was diagnosed 12 weeks postexposure. No HCW adopted the preventive treatment for LTBI. CONCLUSIONS Considering the high morbidity of LTBI among HCW even in general hospitals, it is essential to formulate government policies and institutional operation protocols for the systematic screening, registration, and administration of prophylaxes for the control of LTBI.","Guo, Li Ping; Jiang, Yan; Liu, Ying Mei; Cao, Bin",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30232836/,504

METHOD We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines examining point prevalence of depression and anxiety in psoriatic arthritis as well as effects of treatment for psoriatic arthritis on these psychiatric comorbidities. MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews and Cochrane, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to October 2017. Quality of studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Study and population characteristics were extracted and entered into an electronic database for subsequent descriptive and meta-analysis of point prevalence. RESULT Three studies matched inclusion criteria with significant statistical heterogeneity. The prevalence of depression ranged between 9%-22% and anxiety between 15%-30% in patients with psoriatic arthritis. One study matched inclusion criteria for treatment effect analysis, albeit with a high risk of bias and illustrated a benefit of etanercept on the prevalence of depression (9% vs 16%) and anxiety (14% vs 30%) after 24 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION This is the first systematic review of point prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with psoriatic arthritis.

METHODS We examined the impact of functional polymorphisms in cytokine genes with critical roles in the early immune response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and interferon-gamma) on the severity and duration of illness following acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus, Coxiella burnetii (the causative agent of Q fever), or Ross River virus. RESULTS We found that the interferon-gamma +874T/A and the interleukin-10 -592C/A polymorphisms significantly affected illness severity, cytokine protein levels, and the duration of illness.

This study aims to investigate the potential advantages of ASD compared to intrapericardial (IPC) injection and factors affecting drug absorption through epicardium. METHODS Liposoluble, water soluble and viscous solutions of cyanine 5 (Cy5) fluorescent dye were delivered individually through ASD and IPC in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and then tissues were isolated and observed by in vivo imaging system. Atria and ventricles of the heart were taken for the paraffin section and observed under a fluorescence microscope. RESULTS The fluorescence intensity of Cy5 injected by ASD distributed in the heart was significantly higher than IPC injection. Whereas, the fluorescence signal spread in other tissues such as lung, liver, spleen, and kidney of ASD groups was much weaker. Moreover, when choosing liposoluble and viscous Cy5, the intensity of the heart turned stronger and fluorescence dye distributed in other tissues was lesser. CONCLUSIONS The application of ASD device may provide a promising route of drug delivery for CHD. Furthermore, increasing viscosity of the solution and liposolublity of the drug was beneficial to facilitate drug absorption through the epicardium.","Mikrani, Reyaj; Li, Cunyu; Naveed, Muhammad; Li, Cuican; Baig, Mirza Muhammad Faran Ashraf; Zhang, Qin; Wang, Yue; Peng, Juanjuan; Zhao, Lingzhi; Zhou, Xiaohui",Pharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-020-02898-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839887/,504
65909,Commentary: Rebuilding With Impacted Communities at the Center: The Case for a Civic Engagement Approach to COVID-19 Response and Recovery.,2021-01-12,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine if AYA oncology patients experienced a quantifiable improvement in psychosocial outcomes after attending a weekend retreat with their peers. METHODS AYA oncology patients attended a weekend retreat. They completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) before, 1 month after, and 6 months after the weekend retreat. Controls were age-matched oncology patients who did not attend the retreat. FINDINGS Retreat participants' scores did not significantly change over time; however, retreat participants' scores at 1-month follow-up were significantly higher than control group scores. CONCLUSIONS AYA oncology patients may experience transient improvement in psychological well-being after attending a retreat, but benefits may not be durable. Work remains needed to examine the impact of retreat attendance on specific aspects of psychosocial well-being. Implications for psychosocial oncology: Work is needed to decrease perceived attendance barriers for AYA oncology patients who have a low quality of life. Future retreat planners may consider modifying retreat activities and consider alternative retreat locations that appeal to campers with limited mobility, chronic pain, and/or other quality of life limitations. Additional study is needed to determine whether brief overnight or weekend retreats can be as effective as week-long camps in enhancing oncology patients' quality of life. Future researchers should compare changes in weekend retreat attendees' quality of life to changes in quality of life for a control group (e.g., via a waitlist control study design).","Antonetti, Callah; Stromberg, Sarah E; Costello, Aimee; Faith, Melissa A; Shaw, Peter H",Journal of psychosocial oncology,https://doi.org/10.1080/07347332.2020.1786876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633705/,504

66167,Sexual Minority Disparities in Health and Well-being as a Consequence of the COVID-19 Pandemic Differ by Sexual Identity.,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND Increased demand for healthcare services in countries experiencing high HIV disease burden and often coupled with a shortage of health workers, has necessitated task shifting from professional health workers to Lay Health Workers (LHWs) in order to improve healthcare delivery. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services particularly benefit from task-shifting to LHWs or similar cadres. However, evidence on the roles and usefulness of LHWs in MCH service delivery in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is not fully known. OBJECTIVES To examine evidence of the roles and impact of lay health worker programmes focusing on Women Living with HIV (WLH) and their HIV-exposed infants (HEIs). METHODS A scoping review approach based on Arksey and O'Malley's guiding principles was used to retrieve, review and analyse existing literature. We searched for articles published between January 2008 and July 2018 in seven (7) databases, including: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs, The Cochrane Library, EBM reviews and Web of Science. The critical constructs used for the literature search were ""lay health worker"", ""community health worker"", ""peer mentor"", ""mentor mother,"" ""Maternal and Child health worker"", ""HIV positive mothers"", ""HIV exposed infants"" and PMTCT. RESULTS Thirty-three (33) full-text articles meeting the eligibility criteria were identified and included in the final analysis. Most (n = 13, 39.4%) of the included studies were conducted in South Africa and used a cluster RCT design (n = 13, 39.4%). The most commonly performed roles of LHWs in HIV specific MCH programmes included: community engagement and sensitisation, psychosocial support, linkage to care, encouraging women to bring their infants back for HIV testing and supporting default tracing. Community awareness on Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (MTCT), proper and consistent use of condoms, clinic attendance and timely HIV testing of HEIs, as well as retention in care for infected persons, have all improved because of LHW programmes. CONCLUSION LHWs play significant roles in the management of WLH and their HEIs, improving MCH outcomes in the process. LHW interventions are beneficial in increasing access to PMTCT services and reducing MTCT of HIV, though their impact on improving adherence to ART remains scanty. Further research is needed to evaluate ART adherence in LHW interventions targeted at WLH. LHW programmes can be enhanced by increasing supportive supervision and remuneration of LHWs.","Schmitz, Kathrin; Basera, Tariro Jayson; Egbujie, Bonaventure; Mistri, Preethi; Naidoo, Nireshni; Mapanga, Witness; Goudge, Jane; Mbule, Majorie; Burtt, Fiona; Scheepers, Esca; Igumbor, Jude",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703152/,504

The main active ingredients and therapeutic targets of the Xuebijing injection, and the pathogenic targets of COVID-19 were screened using the TCMSP, UniProt, and GeneCard databases. According to the 'Drug-Ingredients-Targets-Disease' network built by STRING and Cytoscape, AKT1 was identified as the core target, and baicalein, luteolin, and quercetin were identified as the active ingredients of the Xuebijing injection in connection with AKT1. R language was used for enrichment analysis that predict the mechanisms by which the Xuebijing injection may inhibit lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammatory response, modulate NOS activity, and regulate the TNF signal pathway by affecting the role of AKT1. Based on the results of network pharmacology, a molecular docking was performed with AKT1 and the three active ingredients, the results indicated that all three active ingredients could stably bind with AKT1.

However, melatonin safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and dosage in this sensitive population are still unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS This study assessed the PK and safety of melatonin enteral administration to neonates with HIE undergoing hypothermia. Melatonin was infused at 0.5 mg/kg in five neonates with HIE undergoing hypothermia. Infusion started 1 hour after the neonates reached the target temperature of 33.5°C. Blood samples were collected before and at selective times after melatonin infusion. Abdominal complications or clinically significant changes in patients' vital signs were not found during or after melatonin. The peak plasma concentration reached 0.25 µg/mL. The area under the curve in 24 hours was 4.35 µg/mL*h. DISCUSSION Melatonin half-life and clearance were prolonged, and the distribution volume decreased compared to adults. In silico simulation estimated that the steady state can be reached after four infusions. Hypothermia does not affect melatonin PK. In humans high blood concentrations with lower doses can be achieved compared to animal experimentation, although intravenous administration is advised in the neonate population.

In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) are bactericidal against otopathogens, indicating potential therapeutic value for recalcitrant OM. We measured concentrations of 6 AMPs and 14 cytokines in middle ear effusion (MEE) from 67 children undergoing ventilation tube insertion for recurrent acute OM. Sixty one percent of children had bacterial otopathogens detected in their MEE, 39% by PCR and 22% by PCR and culture. Groups were defined as: PCR-negative/culture-negative (absence of bacterial otopathogen), n = 26; PCR-positive/culture-negative (presence of nonculturable bacterial otopathogen), n = 26; PCR-positive/culture-positive (presence of culturable bacterial otopathogen), n = 15. Age, antibiotic usage, day-care attendance, presence of respiratory viruses in MEE and number of AOM episodes were similar between groups. AMP and cytokine concentrations were higher in children with bacterial otopathogens in their MEE compared to those with no bacterial otopathogens. Median concentrations of AMPs (except HBD2) were 3 to 56-fold higher in MEE from children with bacterial otopathogens detected in their MEE (P ≤ 0.01). Similarly, median cytokine concentrations (except TGFβ) were >16-fold higher in MEE with bacterial otopathogens detected (P ≤ 0.001). This is the first study to measure AMPs in MEE and together with the cytokine data, results suggest that elevated AMPs and cytokines in MEE are a marker of inflammation and bacterial persistence.

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the mid-1960s and have been known to cause enteric or respiratory infections. In the last two decades, three HCoVs have emerged, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which initiated the ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory illness that presents as a mild upper respiratory disease but may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and can be fatal, especially when underlying comorbidities are present. Children account for a low percentage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, with seemingly less severe disease. Most pediatric patients present mild or moderate symptoms or are asymptomatic. However, some cases may be severe. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in pediatric patients must be studied in detail.

Early indication and detection of diseases, however, can provide patients and carers with the chance of early intervention, better disease management, and efficient allocation of healthcare resources. The latest developments in machine learning (including deep learning) provides a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this study, we introduce BEHRT: A deep neural sequence transduction model for electronic health records (EHR), capable of simultaneously predicting the likelihood of 301 conditions in one's future visits. When trained and evaluated on the data from nearly 1.6 million individuals, BEHRT shows a striking improvement of 8.0-13.2% (in terms of average precision scores for different tasks), over the existing state-of-the-art deep EHR models. In addition to its scalability and superior accuracy, BEHRT enables personalised interpretation of its predictions; its flexible architecture enables it to incorporate multiple heterogeneous concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication, measurements, and more) to further improve the accuracy of its predictions; its (pre-)training results in disease and patient representations can be useful for future studies (i.e., transfer learning).","Li, Yikuan; Rao, Shishir; Solares, José Roberto Ayala; Hassaine, Abdelaali; Ramakrishnan, Rema; Canoy, Dexter; Zhu, Yajie; Rahimi, Kazem; Salimi-Khorshidi, Gholamreza",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62922-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346050/,504

Our objective was to report the experience of 2 neurovascular centers with the WEB device in the treatment of broad-based intracranial aneurysms, including the technical feasibility and safety as well as short- and midterm angiographic and clinical follow-up-results. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of all ruptured and unruptured aneurysms treated with a WEB device (WEB Single-Layer and Single-Layer Sphere) between August 2014 and February 2017. Primary outcome measures included the feasibility of implantation and the angiographic outcome. Secondary outcome measures included the clinical outcome at discharge and procedural complications. RESULTS One hundred two aneurysms in 101 patients, including 37 (36.3%) ruptured aneurysms, were treated with the WEB device. Implantation was successful in 98 (96.1%) aneurysms. Additional devices (stents/coils) were necessary in 15.3% (15/98) of aneurysms. Procedural complications occurred in 4.9% (5/102). Of these, 4 were thromboembolic events and 1 was an intraprocedural rupture. Angiographic follow-up at 3 and 12 months was available for 79.6% (78/98) and 50.0% (49/98) of all aneurysms to date, respectively, showing a sufficient aneurysm occlusion in 80.7% (63/78) at 3 months and 77.6% (38/49) at 12 months.

We compared the mobility of an in situ endotracheal tube secured with adhesive tape to the one secured with a new commercially available purpose-designed endotracheal tube-holder device (Haider Tube-Guard). We also observed for the incidence of oropharyngeal or facial trauma associated with the 2 tube fixation methods. METHODS Thirty adult patients undergoing general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade were prospectively enrolled. Immediately after intubation, a single study author positioned the endotracheal tube tip in the distal trachea using a bronchoscope. Anesthesiologists caring for patients secured the tube in their normal fashion (always with adhesive tape). A force transducer was used to apply linear force, increasing to 15 N or until the principal investigator deemed that the force be aborted for safety reasons. The displacement of the endotracheal tube was measured with the bronchoscope. Any tape was then removed and the endotracheal tube secured with the Haider Tube-Guard device. The linear force was reapplied and the displacement of the endotracheal tube measured. The Haider Tube-Guard device was left in place for the duration of the case. The patient's face and oropharynx were examined for any evidence of trauma during surgery and in the recovery room. On discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, the patient answered a brief survey assessing for any subjective evidence of minor facial or oropharyngeal trauma. RESULTS Under standardized tension, the endotracheal tube withdrew a mean distance of 3.4 cm when secured with adhesive tape versus 0.3 cm when secured with the Haider Tube-Guard (P <0.001). Ninety-seven percent of patients (29/30) experienced clinically significant endotracheal tube movement (>1 cm) when adhesive tape was used to secure the tube versus 3% (1/30) when the Haider Tube-Guard was used (P <0.001). Thirty percent of patients (9/30) were potentially deemed a high extubation risk (endotracheal tube movement >4 cm) when the endotracheal tube was secured with tape versus 0% (0/30) when secured with the Haider Tube-Guard (P = 0.004). Six patients with taped endotracheal tubes required the traction to be aborted before 15 N of force was achieved to prevent potential extubation as the tape either separated from the face or stretched to allow excessive endotracheal tube movement. None of the patients appeared to sustain any injury from the Haider Tube-Guard device. CONCLUSIONS The Haider Tube-Guard significantly reduced the mobility of the endotracheal tube when compared with adhesive tape and was well tolerated in our observations.","Buckley, Jack C; Brown, Adam P; Shin, John S; Rogers, Kirsten M; Hoftman, Nir N",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000001222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983051/,504

RESULTS The thematic analysis of the narrations made it possible to define 26 themes and 6 macro-themes: Pandemic, What changes, Communication, Emotions/experiences, Role and image, Interprofessional collaboration. The results of this research make it possible to understand how a heterogeneous group of nurses experienced the particular period of pandemic in Canton Ticino and which reflections were derived from it. Some of the aspects highlighted can be compared with what is present in the international literature on the subject in order to find common ways of action for the nursing leadership, in the different Countries, facing the need to organize, manage and support nursing professionals in this and future pandemic situations. CONCLUSIONS The results of this research can be used both at an organisational and educational level and can be the starting point for future research.","Bianchi, Monica; Prandi, Cesarina",Professioni infermieristiche,https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2020.733133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355773/,504

METHODS A survey about home office ergonomics and discomfort was sent to faculty, staff, and administrators by email and was completed by 843 individuals. RESULTS Over 40%of the participants reported moderate to severe discomfort (severe low/middle back pain, moderate discomfort in eyes/neck/head, and discomfort in the upper back/shoulders). Laptops (always and often) were widely used (85%) with most using the laptop monitor (55%) of all respondents. Further, less than 45%of the seating conditions were reported as having adjustable arm rests. CONCLUSION As teleworking in makeshift offices becomes more common, the risk of significant discomfort and potentially more serious musculoskeletal disorders may result from poor static postures. Companies may need to accommodate workers by allowing them to take home office chairs, external monitors, keyboards, and mice as laptops are insufficient, ergonomically.","Gerding, Thomas; Syck, Megan; Daniel, Denise; Naylor, Jennifer; Kotowski, Susan E; Gillespie, Gordon L; Freeman, Andrew M; Huston, Thomas R; Davis, Kermit G",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33867366/,504

The identified pathogen is a new coronavirus named ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"" or SARS-CoV-2, and the respiratory syndrome it elicits was named ""coronavirus disease 2019,"" or COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the epidemic as a pandemic in March 2020. We reviewed the currently available international literature on the COVID-19 epidemic. In this paper, we summarize the relevant information for the diagnosis and prognosis of the new coronavirus. Details of the anamnestic factors and initial test results required to raise a clinical suspicion, the method of microbiological sampling, the basic information on the molecular diagnostic test - the 'gold-standard' real-time 'reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) - in particular the diagnostic current public health regulations for testing. We also place emphasis on the parameters of high-risk patients and how to identify them. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have significant epidemiological and health consequences in Hungary. In addition to epidemiological measures to slow down the epidemic, the timely identification and adequate hospital care of already infected individuals is also a key issue in terms of mortality. The chances of critically ill patients can only be improved with high-quality, careful intensive care, and to be able to provide the best, it is useful to use the experience of medical colleagues already working in endemic countries.

In contrast, structural alterations, including copy number changes, chromothripsis, kataegis, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and other large-scale genomic alterations, are frequent and widespread across the osteosarcoma genome. These observed structural alterations lead to activation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressors which together contribute to oncogenesis. To date, few targeted therapies for osteosarcoma have been identified. It is likely that effectiveness of targeted therapies will vary greatly in subsets of tumors with distinct key driver events. Model systems which can recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity of this disease are needed to test this hypothesis. One possible approach is to use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models characterized with regards to their similarity to the human tumor samples from which they were derived. Here we review evidence pointing to the genomic complexity of osteosarcoma and how this is reflected in available model systems. We also review the current state of preclinical testing for targeted therapies using these models.","Schott, Courtney; Shah, Avanthi Tayi; Sweet-Cordero, E Alejandro",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43085-6_1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767231/,504

Largely ignored are the menstruation-management needs of people experiencing homelessness. We explored these realities in New York City through in-depth interviews with individuals living on the street and in shelters (n = 22), key informant interviews with staff at government agencies, shelters and service provider organizations (n = 15), and field audits of public toilets. This paper explores both pragmatic difficulties presented by inadequate access to toilets, bathing spaces, and laundering services, and pervasive menstrual stigma. Amplifying the difficulties was near-constant pressure ""to pass,"" as someone who was not homeless in order to enable increased access to toilets, and as someone who was not menstruating, in order to engage in the activities of daily living. Our findings highlight the need for improved quality and accessibility of bathrooms for sheltered and street-dwelling homeless, and expedited access to bathing and laundering. Such actions are essential given the steady increase in homelessness in NYC and - under the long shadow of COVID - especially timely.","Sommer, Marni; Gruer, Caitlin; Smith, Rachel Clark; Maroko, Andrew; Kim Hopper,",Health & place,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987242/,504

Flaviviruses induce neuroinflammation with typical features of viral encephalitides, including inflammatory cell infiltration, activation of microglia, and neuronal degeneration. Development of safe and effective live-virus vaccines against neurotropic flavivirus infections demands a detailed knowledge of their neuropathogenesis in a primate host that is evolutionarily close to humans. Here, we used computerized morphometric analysis to quantitatively assess the cellular inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) of rhesus monkeys infected with three antigenically divergent attenuated flaviviruses. The kinetics, spatial pattern, and magnitude of microglial activation, trafficking of T and B cells, and changes in T cell subsets within the CNS define unique phenotypic signatures for each of the three viruses. Our results provide a benchmark for investigation of cellular inflammatory responses induced by attenuated flaviviruses in the CNS of primate hosts and provide insight into the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus encephalitis that might guide the development of safe and effective live-virus vaccines.","Maximova, Olga A; Faucette, Lawrence J; Ward, Jerrold M; Murphy, Brian R; Pletnev, Alexander G",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,https://doi.org/10.1369/jhc.2009.954180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19581627/,504

This alleviates time pressure on the clinician, and could reduce the risk of parent artery thrombosis. Three patients were treated with the Comaneci device. Two patients had acute ruptured posterior communicating aneurysms and one patient was treated electively for a carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm. Excellent occlusion of all three aneurysms was obtained. One patient developed a distal middle cerebral artery clot, that was treated with intravenous aspirin, with minor neurological consequences. These early results show that the Comaneci device can be used to achieve good cerebral aneurysm occlusion.

The present work is an effort for a computational target to block the spike proteins (S) and ACE2 receptor proteins with Macrolide antibiotics like Azithromycin, (AZM), Clarithromycin (CLAM) and Erythromycin (ERY) along with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These compounds were able to block the residues (Arg553, Arg555, and Ala558) surrounding the deep grove catalytic site (Val557) of RdRp and thus plays an important role in tight blocking of enzyme active site. Reference drug Remdesivir was used to compare the docking score of antibiotics with RdRp. Docking value exhibited good binding energy (-7.7 up to -8.2 kcal/mol) with RdRp, indicating their potential as a potent RdRp inhibitor. Interaction of CLAM and ERY presented low binding energy (-6.8 and -6.6) with the ACE2 receptor. At the same time, CLAM exhibited a good binding affinity of -6.4 kcal/mol, making it an excellent tool to block the attachment of spike protein to ACE2 receptors. Macrolides not only affected the attachment to ACE2 but also blocked the spike proteins further, consequently inhibiting the internalization in the host cell. Three Alkyl bonds between Arg555, Ala558, and Met542 by CLAM and two Alkyl bonds of Arg624 and Lys621 by ERY plays an important role for RdRp inactivation that can prevent the rise of newly budded progeny virus. These macrolides interacted with the main protease protein in the pocket responsible for the dimerization and catalytic function of this protein. The interaction occurred with residue Glu166, along with the catalytic residues (Tyr343, and His235) of Endoribonuclease (NSP15) protein. The present study gives three-way options either by blocking S proteins or ACE2 receptor proteins or inhibiting RdRp to counter any effect of COVID-19 by macrolide and could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 till some better option available.","Anwar, Firoz; Altayb, Hisham N; Al-Abbasi, Fahad A; Kumar, Vikas; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612827666210125121954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550966/,504

MAPK kinase 1 (MAP2K1) activates the ERK/MAPK pathway. The down-regulation of miR-195 is correlated with the onset and drug resistance of prostate cancer. Bioinformatics analysis identified complementary binding sites between miR-195 and MAP2K1. This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-195 on the proliferation, apoptosis and adriamycin (ADM) resistance of prostate cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed targeted regulation between miR-195 and MAP2K1. ADM resistant cell line DU145/ADM and PC-3/ADM were generated for comparing the miR-195 and MAP2K1 expression. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity was quantified. Cultured cells were treated with miR-195 mimic, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used for MAP2K1 expression. Western blot measured MAP2K1, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression, and flow cytometry quantified cell apoptosis, followed by EdU staining for cell proliferation. RESULTS Targeted regulation existed between miR-195 and MAP2K1 mRNA. Drug-resistant cells had lower miR-195 than parental cells, whilst MAP2K1 expression was higher. Under ADM treatment with IC50 concentration, drug resistant cells showed lower apoptosis. The transfection of miR-195 decreased MAP2K1 expression and p-ERK1/2, elevated cell apoptosis and suppressed EdU positive rate or cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS The down-regulation of miR-195 is correlated with ADM resistance of prostate cancer cells. The over-expression of miR-195 weakens cancer cell proliferation, facilitates cell apoptosis and decreases ADM resistance via targeted inhibition on MAP2K1 expression and ERK/MAPK signal pathway.","Zhang, J-Y; Li, Y-N; Mu, X; Pan, Z-L; Liu, W-B",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201812_16623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575899/,504

Whether acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is safe and effective in aneurysm clipping remains largely unknown. METHODS aSAH patients who underwent clipping surgery within 72 hours from bleeding were included. The patient in the ANH group received 400 mL autologous blood collection, and the blood was returned as needed during surgery. The relationships between ANH and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative outcome, complications were analyzed. RESULTS 62 aSAH patients were included between December 2019 and June 2020, 20 in ANH group and 42 in non-ANH group. ANH did not reduce the need of perioperative blood transfusion (3 [15%] vs 5 [11.9%], P = 0.734). However, ANH significantly increased serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (11.5 ± 2.5 g/dL vs 10.3 ± 2.0 g/dL, P = 0.045) and day 3 (12.1 ± 2.0 g/dL vs 10.7 ± 1.3 g/dL, P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (OR =0.895, 95% CI = 0.822-0.973, P = 0.010) was an independent risk factors for unfavorable outcome, and ROC curve analysis showed that it had a comparable predictive power as WFNS grade (Z =0.275, P > 0.05).

However, it is not clear how thrombus develops following flow-diversion treatment. Our objective was to develop a computation model for the prediction of stasis-induced thrombosis following flow-diversion treatment in cerebral aneurysms. We proposed a hypothesis to initiate coagulation following flow-diversion treatment. An experimental model was used by ligating rat's right common carotid artery (RCCA) to create flow-stasis environment. Thrombus formed in RCCA as a result of flow stasis. The fibrin distributions in different sections along the axial length of RCCA were measured. The fibrin distribution predicted by our computational model displayed a trend of increase from the proximal neck to the distal tip, consistent with the experimental results on rats. The model was applied on a saccular aneurysm treated with flow diverter to investigate thrombus development following flow diversion. Thrombus was predicted to form inside the sac, and the aneurysm was occluded with only a small remnant neck remained. Our model can serve as a tool to evaluate flow-diversion treatment outcome and optimize the design of flow diverters.","Ou, Chubin; Huang, Wei; Yuen, Matthew Ming-Fai",Medical & biological engineering & computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11517-016-1501-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106753/,504

93675,Lessons from the field: The role of agility in a coproduction project encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-10-05,"Objectives Cervical cancer in the setting of uterovaginal prolapse is exceedingly rare. Altered anatomy can complicate treatment of underlying cancer. We first present a rare case of cervical cancer with invasion of uterovaginal prolapse as well as a systematic review of similar reported cases in the literature. The objective of this study was to compare the practice patterns and outcomes regarding cervical cancer with invasion of procidentia. Methods We conducted a systematic search of online databases (PubMed, Embase, Medline and the Cochrane Library) from 1990 to 2018 of all the cases of cervical cancer associated with stage III-IV uterovaginal prolapse. Patient demographics, pathology, surgical management, chemotherapy, radiation and disease-free survival were compared. Results Fifteen reported cases of cervical cancer in the setting of procidentia were identified (squamous cell carcinoma-14, clear cell carcinoma-1). The mean age at diagnosis was 74 years (range 54-89). Thirteen percent (n = 2) of cases presented with FIGO stage I disease, 67% (n = 10) with stage II, and 20% (n = 3) with stage III. All cases had stage III-IV uterovaginal prolapse. 73% (11) were treated surgically including nine patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. Among patients who underwent primary surgery, 7% (1) received adjuvant chemotherapy, 33% (5) adjuvant radiotherapy and 21% (3) both adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. 33% (5) of surgical cases included procedures to address the pelvic organ prolapse (colpoclesis (n = 3), uterosacral suspension (n = 1) and anterior posterior repair (n = 1)). Two patients died from the disease within 12 months, one patient died from other causes within 1 month, and the remainder of patients were free of disease at last reported follow-up (Table 1). Conclusions Cervical cancer in the setting of stage III-IV uterovaginal prolapse can be managed successfully with standard treatment strategies (primary surgery with adjuvant therapy as necessary versus chemoradiation). When patients are surgical candidates, techniques to address the underlying prolapse can be used for symptomatic improvement.","Kahn, Ryan M; Gordhandas, Sushmita; Craig, Kiersten; Dune, Tanaka J; Holcomb, Kevin; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Frey, Melissa K",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32565896/,504

Besides this, studies on patients' clinical characteristics have described electrolyte imbalances as one of the recurrent features of COVID-19. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study on all patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) from 1st March to 31st May 2020 who had undergone a blood gas analysis and a nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 by rtPCR. We defined positive patients as cases (n. 710) and negatives as controls (n. 619), for a total number of patients of 1.329. The study was approved by the local ethics committee Area 3 Milan. Data were automatically extracted from the hospital laboratory SQL-based repository in anonymized form. We considered as outcomes potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chlorine (Cl-) and calcium (Ca++) as continuous and as categorical variables, in their relation with age, sex and SARS-CoV-2 infection status. RESULTS We observed a higher prevalence of hypokalemia among patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 (13.7% vs 6% of negative subjects). Positive patients had a higher probability to be admitted to the ED with hypokalemia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.8-4.1 p<0.0001) and women were twice as likely to be affected than men (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.67-3.54 p<0.001). Odds ratios for positive patients to manifest with an alteration in serum Na+ was (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.17-2.35 p<0.001) and serum chlorine (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.03-2.69 p<0.001). Notably, OR for positive patients to be hypocalcemic was 7.2 (95% CI 4.8-10.6 p<0.0001) with a low probability for women to be hypocalcemic (OR 0.63, 95% IC 0.4-0.8 p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a higher prevalence of hypokalemia, hypocal- cemia, hypochloremia and sodium alterations. Hypokalemia is more frequent among women and hypocal- cemia among men.","Pani, Arianna; Inglese, Elvira; Puoti, Massimo; Cento, Valeria; Alteri, Claudia; Romandini, Alessandra; Di Ruscio, Federica; Senatore, Michele; Moreno, Mauro; Tarsia, Paolo; Colombo, Fabrizio; Massimiliano Epis, Oscar; Panetta, Valentina; Vismara, Chiara; Bellone, Andrea; Scaglione, Francesco",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529866/,504

The majority of patients report sick in the late stage of carcinoma clinical advancement, which considerably limits the possibility of surgical treatment. Pancreatic cancer patients with no other alternative but palliative treatment constitute a large group. AIM To assess pain intensity levels and quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients after videothoracoscopic splanchnicectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2001 January and 2010 November in the Department of Thorax, General Surgery and Oncology of the Medical University of Lodz 262 patients with pancreatic tumours were hospitalized. In 121 cases grade 3 and grade 4 tumours were observed. Hundred and twenty-one videothoracoscopic procedures of sympathetic trunk and ganglion excision were performed in 89 patients. RESULTS Before the procedure the pain intensity level according to VAS was 5.66 (3.9-7.2; SD 1.24) in the trial group and 5.46 (4.1-7.1; SD 1.15) in the control group. The quality of life average assessment in both groups did not differ statistically (p = 1.07) and was 46.3 (32-66; SD 0.92) in patients before the operation and in the control group 50.3 (41-63; SD 0.75). On the 7(th) postoperative day the pain intensity on average was 2.33 (1.2-3.9; SD 0.78) and 4.57 (3.6-5.5; SD 0.69) respectively. One week after the procedure the quality of patients' life was estimated at 64.1 (39-83; SD 1.38) and in the control group at 52.2 (42-65; SD 0.71); the differences are significant (p < 0.05). Thirty days after the procedure 12 patients did not take any painkillers (13.5%), and in the others a considerable decrease of the taken drugs was observed. On average, the pain intensity was estimated at 1.78 (0.6-3.6; SD 0.68). The quality of life, on the other hand, improved considerably in relation to the state prior to the procedure, but increased insignificantly in relation to the state on the 7(th) postoperative day to 70.9 (52-88; SD 1.14). CONCLUSIONS Splanchnicectomy is a safe method of cancer pain treatment in patients with advanced pancreatic tumours. Videothoracoscopic excision of visceral nerve thoracic section contributes to the statistically significant decrease of cancer pain intensity and considerably improves the quality of patients' lives.","Smigielski, Jacek; Piskorz, Lukasz; Wawrzycki, Marcin; Kutwin, Leszek; Misiak, Piotr; Brocki, Marian",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.24690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23255971/,504

97148,Physicians and Social Determinants of Health.,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND Delayed umbilical cord clamping is associated with greater haemoglobin concentration and iron storage between 3 and 6 months of life and with less need of blood transfusion and lower incidence of neonatal hypotension compared to early umbilical cord clamping. METHODS The aim was to test the hypothesis that delayed cord clamping is better than early cord clamping in term infants born by elective caesarean section. Group A was subjected to immediate cord clamping while in the Group B, the umbilical cord was clamped 1 min after birth. Primary aim was revealed the difference in pre-ductal saturation between two groups while secondary aim was investigating the difference in HR, Ht, bilirubin and glycaemia. Pre-ductal SpO2 and HR were recorded at 5 and 10 min after birth, T was analysed 10 min after birth, glycaemia was revealed at 120 min while Ht and bilirubin were collected at 72 h. RESULTS 132 newborns were enrolled in the study and allocated in ratio 1:1 to group A or B. Delayed cord clamping did not improve SpO2, HR and T values compared to immediate cord clamping (p > 0,05). However, Group B showed greater haematocrit and bilirubin values at 72 h compared to Group A (56,71 ± 6663 vs 51,56 ± 6929; p < 0,05 and 8,54 ± 2,90 vs 7,06 ± 2,76; p < 0,05). Glycaemia value did not differ between two groups (p > 0,05). CONCLUSIONS Group B did not reveal any differences in SpO2, HR, T and glycaemia compared to Group A. Group B showed greater values of haematocrit and bilirubin but without need of phototherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION Umbilical Cord Clamping: What Are the Benefits; NCT03878602.

97227,Mental health crisis of Japanese health care workers under COVID-19.,2020-06-25,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small reservoirs of different molecules and important mediators of cell-to-cell communication. As putative vehicles of misfolded protein propagation between cells, they have drawn substantial attention in the field of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, exosome-mediated non-coding RNA delivery may play a crucial role in ALS, given the relevance of RNA homeostasis in disease pathogenesis. Since EVs can enter the systemic circulation and are easily detectable in patients' biological fluids, they have generated broad interest both as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and as valuable tools in understanding disease pathogenesis. Here, after a brief introduction on biogenesis and functions of EVs, we aim to investigate their role in neurodegenerative disorders, especially ALS. Specifically, we focus on the main findings supporting EV-mediated protein and RNA transmission in ALS in vitro and in vivo models. Then, we provide an overview of clinical applications of EVs, summarizing the most relevant studies able to detect EVs in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients, underlying their potential use in aiding diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, we explore the therapeutic applications of EVs in ALS, either as targets or as vehicles of proteins, nucleic acids and molecular drugs.","Gagliardi, Delia; Bresolin, Nereo; Comi, Giacomo Pietro; Corti, Stefania",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03619-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803397/,504

It is therefore important to identify both hazardous and protective individual factors during the pandemic. The current research explored the relationships between self-reported affective responding, perceived personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subjective well-being. An online survey (N = 471) conducted in Sweden between June and September, 2020, showed that higher levels of irritability, impulsivity, and the tendency to experience and express anger were generally associated with more severe personal consequences of the pandemic, particularly in areas related to family life, work/study, and finances. While more severe impacts of the pandemic in these areas of life were directly associated with lower subjective well-being, emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal appeared to moderate the extent to which consequences of the pandemic in other areas of life (i.e., social, free-time and physical activities) translated into decreased well-being. This suggests that cognitive reappraisal may serve to protect against some of the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Overall, the results indicate that the perceived consequences of the pandemic are multifaceted and that future research should examine these consequences using a multidimensional approach.","Gröndal, Maria; Ask, Karl; Luke, Timothy J; Winblad, Stefan",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34653222/,504

Simple H-type pseudoknots have been studied extensively in terms of biological functions, computational prediction, and energy models. Intramolecular kissing hairpins are a more complex and biologically important type of pseudoknot in which two hairpin loops form base pairs. They are hard to predict using free energy minimization due to high computational requirements. Heuristic methods that allow arbitrary pseudoknots strongly depend on the quality of energy parameters, which are not yet available for complex pseudoknots. We present an extension of the heuristic pseudoknot prediction algorithm DotKnot, which covers H-type pseudoknots and intramolecular kissing hairpins. Our framework allows for easy integration of advanced H-type pseudoknot energy models. For a test set of RNA sequences containing kissing hairpins and other types of pseudoknot structures, DotKnot outperforms competing methods from the literature.

METHODS Forty patients who attended for intravitreal injections were divided in those with less (<4h) and more (>4h) than 4 hours of mask use. Each group was divided depending on the application or not of povidone-iodine in the periocular area (PA) of the mask. Bacterial load was studied on PA and mouth area (MA) samples. RESULTS The bacterial load in the PA was higher in the >4h group compared with the <4h group (13.2 vs 48.75 Colony Forming Units/μL; p=0.03). The contamination in the PA significantly decreased after applying povidone-iodine in the >4h group (p=0.01). The use or not of povidone-iodine was strongly correlated to a positive culture (OR=9.0, p=0.00. CI 1.63-49.44). CONCLUSIONS Surgical face masks worn for more than 4 hours presents higher contamination in the PA than those with less use. Bacterial load in the PA is reduced with povidone-iodine on masks used for more than 4 hours. This contamination should be considered in the asepsis protocol of intravitreal injections.","Marin-Nieto, Juan; Reino-Perez, Carmen; Santillana-Cernuda, Genoveva; Díaz-Bernal, José Manuel; Luque-Aranda, Rafael; García-Basterra, Ignacio",Retina,https://doi.org/10.1097/iae.0000000000003202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965993/,504

Aims We compared the effects of alteplase in cohorts defined by the current Europe Union or United States marketing approval labels, and by hypothetical revisions of the labels that would remove the Europe Union upper age limit or extend the United States treatment time window to 4.5 h. Methods We assessed outcomes in an individual-patient-data meta-analysis of eight randomized trials of intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) versus control for acute ischemic stroke. Outcomes included: excellent outcome (modified Rankin score 0-1) at 3-6 months, the distribution of modified Rankin score, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality. Results Alteplase increased the odds of modified Rankin score 0-1 among 2449/6136 (40%) patients who met the current European Union label and 3491 (57%) patients who met the age-revised label (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.21-1.68 and 1.43, 1.23-1.65, respectively), but not in those outside the age-revised label (1.06, 0.90-1.26). By 90 days, there was no increased mortality in the current and age-revised cohorts (hazard ratios 0.98, 95% CI 0.76-1.25 and 1.01, 0.86-1.19, respectively) but mortality remained higher outside the age-revised label (1.19, 0.99-1.42). Similarly, alteplase increased the odds of modified Rankin score 0-1 among 1174/6136 (19%) patients who met the current US approval and 3326 (54%) who met a 4.5-h revised approval (odds ratio 1.55, 1.19-2.01 and 1.37, 1.17-1.59, respectively), but not for those outside the 4.5-h revised approval (1.14, 0.97-1.34). By 90 days, no increased mortality remained for the current and 4.5-h revised label cohorts (hazard ratios 0.99, 0.77-1.26 and 1.02, 0.87-1.20, respectively) but mortality remained higher outside the 4.5-h revised approval (1.17, 0.98-1.41). Conclusions An age-revised European Union label or 4.5-h-revised United States label would each increase the number of patients deriving net benefit from alteplase by 90 days after acute ischemic stroke, without excess mortality.","Hacke, Werner; Lyden, Patrick; Emberson, Jonathan; Baigent, Colin; Blackwell, Lisa; Albers, Gregory; Bluhmki, Erich; Brott, Thomas; Cohen, Geoffrey; Davis, Stephen M; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Grotta, James C; Howard, George; Kaste, Markku; Koga, Masatoshi; von Kummer, Rüdiger; Lansberg, Maarten G; Lindley, Richard I; Olivot, Jean-Marc; Parsons, Mark; Sandercock, Peter Ag; Toni, Danilo; Toyoda, Kazunori; Wahlgren, Nils; Wardlaw, Joanna M; Whiteley, William N; Del Zoppo, Gregory; Lees, Kennedy R",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493017744464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29171359/,504

Despite some differences in inclusion criteria between these studies, all required non-invasive vessel imaging to proof occlusion of a major brain supplying vessel. Furthermore, in most studies additional imaging techniques were used to exclude patients with already established large cerebral infarction or unfavorable collateral or penumbral status. Patients with small infarct volume, severe neurological deficits and in whom thrombectomy can be initiated within the first 6 hours after symptom onset seem to benefit the most. Therefore, mechanical thrombectomy using stent-retrievers in addition to intra-venous thrombolysis is recommended for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with proven major vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation.","Mordasini, Pasquale; Gralla, Jan",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1586/17434440.2015.1124019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26592745/,504
108971,When minor insecurities project large shadows: A profile analysis of cognitive and affective job insecurity.,2021-07-29,"OBJECTIVE Head trauma is one of the most important emergency health problems both in the world and in our country. The objective in our study is to (i) state the correlation between the findings of bispectral index score (BIS) and computed tomography (CT), which are used to evaluate the level of consciousness of patients with isolated head trauma, and (ii) investigate objective results about the patient's level of consiousness/alertness according to the CT modality, which is used frequently. METHODS This prospective study was carried out between 03.01.2014 and 09.01.2014 in the emergency department of Fatih Sultan Mehmet Education and Research Hospital. The average BIS scores were correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) point, the Canadian CT Head Rule major and minor criteria, and the pathologic findings in CT imaging. The patients' demographic features, vital signs at admission, and arrival times at the hospital were investigated. RESULTS In our study, 64 (31.7%) patients were female, and 138 (68.3%) patients were male. The mean BIS scores were 84.99±11.20 (86.05) and 93.78±3.80 (95.05) in patients with and without CT pathologies, respectively. The correlation between CT pathology and BIS scores was statistically significant: BIS scores were lower in patients with CT pathologies (p=0.001; p<0.01). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the BIS and GCS scores (45.6%) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION We showed that most head traumas occur after dangerous accidents, and according to the results, we can predict that males are more frequently affected than females. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between BIS scores and GCS points. In our study, the BIS scores were statistically significantly lower in patients with CT pathology than in patients without. We can predict that if the BIS score of the patient is low, then there will be the presence of pathology on CT imaging.","Kusken, Ozlem; Ozturk, Tuba Cimilli; Hunuk, Aysel; Akoglu, Ebru Unal; Ak, Rohat; Turan, Cansu Arslan; Onur, Ozge Ecmel",Northern clinics of Istanbul,https://doi.org/10.14744/nci.2018.89266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650107/,504

Data are derived from a randomized experiment, with a focus on whether improvement in social problemsolving skills varies across modified delivery formats, and whether improvements are attributable to program completion or program dosage. We find that there are significant improvements in social problem solving between the pre- and post-test, and that delivery of the curriculum using video conferencing technology or inmate co-facilitated formats produces equivalent outcomes relative to traditional classroom administration. On average, significant improvements accrue to participants who receive greater program dosage. However, program completion, commonly viewed as a primary marker of satisfactory program performance, is not associated with improvement in social problem solving. Implications of the findings for rehabilitation programming are discussed, including considerations in a pandemic context.","LaPlant, Eric G; Bellair, Paul E; Kowalski, Brian R; Addison, Dionne; Starr, Stephanie",International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624x20975159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33246371/,504

The main aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of both drugs used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients over 52 weeks. The secondary objective was to identify which clinical variables could have an impact on its effectiveness. A retrospective observational study was carried out, comparing the first 28 patients treated with ustekinumab after its commercialization was compared to the first 35 patients treated with ixekizumab. Although a higher level of skin clearance was achieved with ixekizumab with a PASI 90 and 100 response of 54.3% and 40% compared to 42.9% and 25% for ustekinumab, these differences were not statistically significant. Ixekizumab achieved a higher PASI 90 response in those patients with BMI > 27 (slightly overweight), which was statistically significant (P = 0.024). Ustekinumab had a greater survival at 52 weeks than ixekizumab, with a trend towards statistical significance (P = 0.052). Ixekizumab achieved higher skin clearance rates (PASI 90 and 100 response) than ustekinumab, with no statistically significant differences. However, ixekizumab should be specially considered in overweight patients. This article is protected by copyright.

110558,"Neighborhood Disadvantage Measures and COVID-19 Cases in Boston, 2020.",2021-03-17,"INTRODUCTION The health emergency caused by the spread of SARS-COV-2 virus has required the adoption of passive measures against contagion, such as social distancing. The use of filtering masks, of the different types available on the market, such as surgical and facial filtering masks (FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3), is also recommended. OBJECTIVES The aim of this paper, within the Italian and European regulatory reference framework, is to suggest a rational application of existing methodologies that enable to know and assess the features and/or make a face mask intended to be used by the community. In addition to this, the study aims to provide a correct regulatory framework and useful information for a correct use and disposal of face masks. Another purpose is the assessment of the hygienic, sanitary and regulatory aspects related to the use and disposal of face masks. METHODS The analysis of filtering masks is based on the review of scientific literature, the state of art of technology and the filtering means/materials available. Reference is made to filtering mechanisms and devices, the testing methods, the technical, manufacturing and performance features, and to the Italian and European regulatory reference framework. Reference is also made to the hygienic, sanitary and regulatory aspects related to the use and disposal of face masks. RESULTS Surgical masks or, alternatively, filtering masks with a filtration efficiency between 90% and 95% for 3-µm particles, are the most practicable choice with minor contraindications. The reusable type of mask is conceptually superior compared to single-use masks, but cleaning procedures to be followed are quite complex and not always described in a clear way. CONCLUSIONS The definition of rigorous and repeatable tests on mask filtration capacity, breathability, wearability, duration of use, regeneration, as well as safe disposal methods, are the main way to provide users with correct selection and use criteria. The results must be disclosed and disseminated quickly.","Santarsiero, A; Ciambelli, P; Donsì, G; Quadrini, F; Briancesco, R; D'Alessandro, D; Fara, G M",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2020.2371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32744582/,504
111438,Emotional labor: The role of organizational dehumanization.,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) agents improve hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Detail interactions among recruited/activated leucocytes, hepatic angiogenesis and fibrogenesis, splanchnic blood pooling, decreased hepatic veins to fluctuated splanchnic blood volume (hepatic venous dysregulation), portal hypertensive syndrome and ascites have never explored in cirrhosis. Our study used two anti-VEGFR agents - brivanib and sorafenib - to elucidate the relationship between above abnormalities of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-cirrhotic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS NASH-cirrhotic rats received 2-week brivanib, sorafenib or vehicle (NASH-cirrhotic+briv, NASH-cirrhotic+soraf and NASH-cirrhotic rats) were included for various measurements. RESULTS In comparison with NASH-cirrhotic rats, significant decreased plasma VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, hepatic tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 were accompanied by decreased leucocyte mass/activity ((99 m) Tc-phytate and (18) F-FDG SPECT/PET/CT scans), hepatic leucocytes recruitment/microvascular density (fluorescence-enhanced intravital microscopy) and hydroxyproline content, and increased hepatic blood flow in NASH-cirrhotic+briv and NASH-cirrhotic+soraf rats. In addition, increased hepatic microvasculatures compliance-related improved buffering effect of portal vein to acute mannitol infusion was associated with decreased circulating nitric oxide and aldosterone, plasma volume expansion (dye dilution method), splanchnic blood pooling ((99 m) Tc-RBC SPECT/PET/CT scans), peripheral hypotension, portal hypertension and ascites in brivanib and sorafenib-treated NASH-cirrhotic rats. CONCLUSION Besides antifibrotic, antiangiogenic and portal hypertensive effects, chronic antagonism of anti-VEGFR with brivanib and sorafenib improves hepatic blood flow, hepatic venous dysregulation, inhibits leucocytes recruitment/activation, splanchnic blood pooling and ascites formation in NASH-cirrhotic rats. Thus, brivanib and sorafenib might be ideal therapeutic agents in cirrhotic patients suffering from severe haemodynamic disarrangement and ascites.","Yang, Ying-Ying; Liu, Ren-Shyan; Lee, Pei-Chang; Yeh, Yi-Chen; Huang, Yi-Tsau; Lee, Wei-Ping; Lee, Kuei-Chuan; Hsieh, Yun-Cheng; Lee, Fa-Yauh; Tan, Tat-Wei; Lin, Han-Chieh",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.12299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23998651/,504
111519,Domestic migrant workers in India returning to their homes: emerging socioeconomic and health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-01,"PURPOSE Dexmedetomidine is thought to activate an endogenous pathway that naturally promotes non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Dexmedetomidine may induce restorative sleep, that is, NREM stage 3 and 4 (slow wave sleep; SWS) or sleep continuity in mechanically ventilated patients. Few data have been published, however, on the sleep characteristics of mechanically ventilated patients during dexmedetomidine infusion. METHODS We recorded polysomnography (PSG) for 24 h in mechanically ventilated patients sedated with dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine (0.2-0.7 μg/kg/h) was administered intravenously to maintain the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale between -1 and -4 only during the nighttime (9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.). During the daytime, we interrupted the sedatives and analgesics unless the patient complained of discomfort. When this occurred midazolam or opioids were administered intermittently. Sleep stages and the frequency of arousal/awakening during the nighttime were analyzed using Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria. RESULTS For the ten mechanically ventilated adult patients recruited into the study, the median total sleep time (TST) during the night was 4.7 h (IQR, 4.2-8.1 h), and 78 % of sleep occurred during the night (median 78 %, IQR: 69-88 %). Sleep architecture was exclusively NREM sleep stage 1 (median 28.9 % of TST) and stage 2 (median 71.2 % of TST). Neither SWS (median 0 % of TST) nor rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (median 0 % of TST) was observed. Median frequency of arousals/awakenings was 9.3/h (IQR, 3-19.5/h). CONCLUSIONS In mechanically ventilated patients, nighttime infusion of dexmedetomidine preserved the day-night cycle of sleep but induced severely disturbed sleep architecture without evidence of SWS or REM sleep.","Oto, Jun; Yamamoto, Katsunori; Koike, Shigefumi; Onodera, Mutsuo; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-012-2685-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22961436/,504

We sought to summarize current data on the prevalence and prognostic influence of dyspnea in the ICU setting and to provide concise and useful information for dyspnea detection and management. RECENT FINDINGS As opposed to pain, dyspnea has been a neglected symptom with regard to detection and management. Many factors contribute to the pathogenesis of dyspnea. Among them, ventilator settings seem to play a major role. Dyspnea affects half of mechanically ventilated patient and causes immediate intense suffering [median dyspnea visual analog scale of 5 (4-7)]. In addition, it is associated with delayed extubation and with an increased risk of intubation and mortality in those receiving noninvasive ventilation. However, one-third of critically ill patients are noncommunicative, and therefore, at high risk of misdiagnosis. Heteroevaluation scales based on physical and behavioral signs of respiratory discomfort are reliable and promising alternatives to self-report. SUMMARY Dyspnea is frequent and severe in critically ill patients. Implementation of observational scale will help physicians to access to noncommunicative patient's respiratory suffering and tailor its treatment. Further studies on the prognostic impact and management strategies are needed.","Decavèle, Maxens; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531366/,504

However, confusion persists regarding terminology and description of many clinical care process specifications which this research seeks to resolve by developing a taxonomic characterisation of clinical care process specifications. Literature on clinical care process specifications was analysed, creating the starting point for identifying common characteristics and how each is constructed and used in the clinical setting. A taxonomy for clinical care process specifications is presented. The De Bleser approach to limited clinical care process specifications characterisation was extended and each clinical care process specification is successfully characterised in terms of purpose, core elements and relationship to the other clinical care process specification types. A case study on the diagnosis and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in the United Kingdom was used to evaluate the taxonomy and demonstrate how the characterisation framework applies. Standardising clinical care process specifications ensures that the format and content are consistent with expectations, can be read more quickly and high-quality information can be recorded about the patient. Standardisation also enables computer interpretability, which is important in integrating Learning Health Systems into the modern clinical environment. The approach presented allows terminologies for clinical care process specifications that were widely used interchangeably to be easily distinguished, thus, eliminating the existing confusion.","McLachlan, Scott; Kyrimi, Evangelia; Dube, Kudakwashe; Hitman, Graham; Simmonds, Jennifer; Fenton, Norman",Health informatics journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1460458220906069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186428/,504

Several studies in recent years showed that tRNA halves and distinct Y RNA fragments are abundant in the extracellular space, including in biofluids. While their regulatory and diagnostic potential has gained a substantial amount of attention, the biogenesis of these extracellular RNA fragments remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that these fragments are produced by RNase 1, a highly active secreted nuclease. We use RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of a null mutation of RNase 1 on the levels of tRNA halves and Y RNA fragments in the extracellular environment of cultured human cells. We complement and extend our RNA sequencing results with northern blots, showing that tRNAs and Y RNAs in the non-vesicular extracellular compartment are released from cells as full-length precursors and are subsequently cleaved to distinct fragments. In support of these results, formation of tRNA halves is recapitulated by recombinant human RNase 1 in our in vitro assay. These findings assign a novel function for RNase 1, and position it as a strong candidate for generation of tRNA halves and Y RNA fragments in biofluids.","Nechooshtan, Gal; Yunusov, Dinar; Chang, Kenneth; Gingeras, Thomas R",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609822/,504

However, little information is available about the AKI in COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of AKI in adult patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS This was a retrospective cohort study of 1392 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were extracted from electronic hospitalization and laboratory databases. AKI was defined and staged according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Risk factors for AKI and the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality were assessed. RESULTS A total of 7% (99 of 1392) of patients developed AKI during hospitalization, 40% (40 of 99) of which occurred within 1 week of admission. Factors associated with a higher risk of AKI include severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.67), higher baseline serum creatinine (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.11), lymphopenia (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.53), and elevated D-dimer level (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.70). The in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 was 62%, 77%, and 80%, respectively. AKI was associated with in-hospital mortality even after adjustment for confounders (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.70 to 9.72).

118721,Community Health Workers: The Authors Reply.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. MAIN RESULTS We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control.

Participants read a mock news story created for the current study about a woman labeled as a ""welfare queen"" who was receiving assistance, but persuaded the reader to be sympathetic to her case. The mock news story varied based on the race/ethnicity, veteran status, and birthplace of the welfare recipient. Participants assessed the welfare recipient on various evaluative measures. A 4 (race/ethnicity: White/Black/Hispanic/Asian) × 2 (veteran status: veteran/not veteran) × 2 (country of origin: born in the US/not born in the US) between-subjects ANOVA was performed on the attitude and personality evaluations of the welfare recipient. The general pattern of results showed that welfare recipients were evaluated more positively when they were veterans, born in the United States, or were White or Asian. Conversely, the public evaluated the welfare recipient more negatively or held more aversive emotions towards them when they were Hispanic, Black, not born in the United States, or not a veteran.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The patient underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation, which included assessment of visual acuity with and without correction, extensive ophthalmological examination, cicloplegic refraction by retinoscopy and funduscopic examination, OCT, and angio-OCT examination. RESULTS Fundoscopic examination in a young patient with previous Sars-CoV-2 infection showed marked vascular tortuosity, evident both at the posterior pole and retinal periphery, especially on the arterial vasculature, and cotton wool spots along the retinal vessels, highlightable also at OCT and angio-OCT examination. These alterations persist at a 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In COVID-19 infection, even in asymptomatic pediatric patients, vasculitis develops also affecting the retinal vessels, appreciable on fundus examination. A thorough eye examination in all COVID-19 patients with close follow-up is therefore important. This is the first case report on retinal changes in a pediatric patient.","Abbinante, Giulia; Plaitano, Carmen; Gallo, Flavio Gioele; Magli, Adriano",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/11206721211027069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176314/,504

An analysis of their ocular side effects was performed. Only chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were found to have an ocular impact in the medium and long-term. Detailed search strategies were performed in EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS and WOS Core Collection. Additionally, the worldwide ongoing clinical trials including chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were evaluated, and their proposals of drug administration and exclusion criteria analyzed. In general, high maximum cumulative doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are being used for a short period in 135 currently underway clinical trials (to 21st April 2020). Typically, the doses were 2 to 5 times greater than the AAO recommendation (adjusted to weight) to avoid toxic retinopathy, the most undesirable ocular side effect. Maximum cumulative doses up to 12,000 mg for chloroquine and 18,000 mg for hydroxychloroquine were found. In prophylaxis clinical trials, 72,000 mg and 22,500 mg were the maximum cumulative doses for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine respectively. Only 48% of the clinical trials considered retinal impairment as an exclusion criterion, and just one referred to an ophthalmic examination previous to study inclusion. How chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment affect patients with a previous retinal condition is still poorly understood.

124063,Maternal Health: What Funders Have Been Supporting.,2021-04-01,"The increasing consumption of high-fat foods combined with a lack of exercise is a major contributor to the burden of obesity in humans. Aerobic exercise such as running is known to provide metabolic benefits, but how the over-consumption of a high fat diet (HFD) and exercise interact is not well characterized at the molecular level. Here, we examined the plasma proteome in mice for the effects of aerobic exercise as both a treatment and as a preventative regime for animals on either HFD or a healthy control diet. This analysis detected large changes in the plasma proteome induced by the HFD, such as increased abundance of SERPINA7, ALDOB, and down-regulation of SERPINA1E, CFD (adipsin). Some of these changes were significantly reverted using exercise as a preventative measure, but not as a treatment regime. To determine if either the intensity, or duration, of exercise influenced the outcome, we compared high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and endurance running. Endurance running slightly out-performed HIIT exercise, but overall, both provided similar reversion in abundance of plasma proteins modulated by the high-fat diet including SERPINA7, APOE, SERPINA1E, and CFD. Finally, we compared the changes induced by over-consumption of HFD to previous data from mice fed an isocaloric high saturated fat (SFA) or polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diet. This identified several common changes including increased APOC2 and APOE, but also highlighted changes specific for either over-consumption of HFD (ALDOB, SERPINA7, CFD), SFA-based diets (SERPINA1E), or PUFA-based diets (Haptoglobin - Hp). Together, these data highlight the importance of early intervention with exercise to revert HFD-induced phenotypes and suggest some of the molecular mechanisms leading to the changes in the plasma proteome generated by high fat diet consumption.

Anorectal manometry (ARM) and colonic transit testing have allowed classification of subtypes of constipation, raising promise of targeted treatments. There has been limited study of the correlation between physiological parameters and healthcare utilization. METHODS All patients undergoing ARM and colonic transit testing for chronic constipation at two tertiary care centers from 2000 to 2014 were included in this retrospective study. Our primary outcomes included number of constipation-related and gastroenterology visits per year. Multivariate linear regression adjusting for confounders defined independent effect of measures of colonic and anorectal function on healthcare utilization. KEY RESULTS Our study included 612 patients with chronic constipation. More than 50% (n = 333) of patients had outlet obstruction by means of balloon expulsion testing and 43.5% (n = 266) had slow colonic transit. On unadjusted analysis, outlet obstruction (1.98 vs 1.68), slow transit (2.40 vs 2.07) and high resting anal pressure (2.16 vs 1.76) were all associated with greater constipation-related visits/year compared to patients without each of those parameters (p < 0.05 for all). Outlet obstruction and high resting anal pressure were also associated with greater number of gastroenterology visits/year. After multivariate adjustment, high resting anal pressure was the only independent predictor of increased constipation-related visits/year (p = 0.02) and gastroenterology visits/year (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Among patients with chronic constipation, high resting anal pressure, rather than outlet obstruction or slow transit, predicts healthcare resource utilization.","Staller, K; Barshop, K; Kuo, B; Ananthakrishnan, A N",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26172284/,504

The emergence of drug-resistant strains further necessitates the development of novel antivirals that target the host factors crucial for viral replication. Area covered: This review summarizes the current understanding of the structural and functional properties of type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) as a proteolytic activator of influenza virus infection and discusses their potential as antiviral targets. It also explores the experimental evidence accumulated for inhibitors of TTSPs as novel, broad-spectrum antivirals against various influenza virus subtypes. The review also provides an overview of the properties of small molecules, proteins, and peptides that efficiently inhibit the proteolytic activation of the influenza virus. Expert opinion: TTSPs activate a wide range of influenza virus subtypes including avian influenza viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, via proteolytic cleavage of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) into infection-competent fusogenic conformation. Other viruses such as SARS-, MERS-coronaviruses and human metapneumoviruses may use the same host cell proteases for activation, implying that TTSP inhibition might be a novel strategy for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents for respiratory viral infections.","Shin, Woo-Jin; Seong, Baik Lin",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2017.1372417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870104/,504

The classical RAS is driven by its key enzyme ACE and is pivotal in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. More recently, it has been recognised that the protective RAS regulated by ACE2 counterbalances many of the deleterious effects of the classical RAS. Studies in murine models demonstrated that manipulating the protective RAS can dramatically alter many diseases including liver disease. Liver-specific overexpression of ACE2 in mice with liver fibrosis has proved to be highly effective in antagonising liver injury and fibrosis progression. Importantly, despite its highly protective role in disease pathogenesis, ACE2 is hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 as a cellular receptor to gain entry to alveolar epithelial cells, causing COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease in humans. COVID-19 is frequently life-threatening especially in elderly or people with other medical conditions. As an unprecedented number of COVID-19 patients have been affected globally, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutics targeting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2. Understanding the role of ACE2 in physiology, pathobiology and as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insight into potential new therapeutic strategies aiming to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection related tissue injury. This review outlines the role of the RAS with a strong focus on ACE2-driven protective RAS in liver disease and provides therapeutic approaches to develop strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.","Warner, Fiona J; Rajapaksha, Harinda; Shackel, Nicholas; Herath, Chandana B",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20201268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284956/,504

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a cross-sectional study that was conducted in Shenzhen to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies including, IgG, IgM, and IgA. In the COVID-19 group, 9 patients were enrolled after diagnosis. In the control group, 1589 individuals without clinical symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue) and returning from outside Shenzhen were enrolled. The first study enrollment occurred at the end of February 2020; the final study visit was March 18, 2020. RESULTS In the COVID-19 group, the 7 of 9 patients were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgA. Meanwhile, 6 of the 1589 healthy individuals were found to be weakly positive for IgG. According to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, the 6 individuals were all negative. CONCLUSION Strong supplemental support for clinical information can be provided by antibody detection, especially for IgA. According to comparison with overseas reports, the infection rate of the Chinese population outside Shenzhen, China, is significantly low, so most of the population in China is still susceptible.

We aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on robotic TME after the use of robotic stapler (RS) or LS after robotic TME. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Database. Participants who underwent robotic anterior resection were considered following these criteria: (1) studies comparing RS and LS; (2) studies reporting the rate of anastomotic leakage (AL). The primary outcome was the risk of AL. Secondary outcomes included the number of firings of stapler needed. A meta-analysis based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement was performed. A total of 4 studies including 391 patients (LS = 251, RS = 140) were included for analysis. Regarding the number of firings, overall results suggest that the rectal stapling was achieved with less firings in the RS group, but the difference is not significant [risk difference, (95% CI) 0.42 (- 0.13, 0.97)]. There was a 56% increased odds of AL for LS compared with RS; however, this was not statistically significant (OR: 1.56; 95% CI 0.59, 4.14). With the current literature evidence, the present study could not demonstrate a clear benefit of the RS over the LS.

130242,Priorities for Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment and Prevention During COVID-19's Second Wave.,2021-03-01,"Practical relevance: Feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection is very common in cats, usually causing only mild intestinal signs such as diarrhoea. Up to 10% of FCoV infections, however, result in the fatal disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Clinical challenges: Obtaining a definitive diagnosis of FIP based on non-invasive approaches is difficult. Confirmation of the disease relies on finding appropriate cytological or histopathological changes in association with positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen. In FIP cases with effusions, cytology and immunostaining on effusion samples can be relatively easy to perform; otherwise obtaining diagnostic samples is more challenging and collection of biopsies from tissues with gross lesions is necessary. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, a high index of suspicion of FIP may be obtained from the cat's signalment and history, combined with findings on clinical examination and laboratory test results. If largely consistent with FIP, these can be used as a basis for discussion with the owner about whether additional, more invasive, diagnostic tests are warranted. In some cases it may be that euthanasia is discussed as an alternative to pursuing a definitive diagnosis ante-mortem, especially if financial limitations exist or where there are concerns over a cat's ability to tolerate invasive diagnostic procedures. Ideally, the diagnosis should be confirmed in such patients from samples taken at post-mortem examination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The players from 36 professional football teams (n=977) among Turkish Super League and First League teams were invited to complete a questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Impact of Event Scale-Revised Scores (IES-R) and short form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). RESULTS The online survey was completed by 237 players (24.3%). The mean number of self-quarantine day of participants was 26.9±6.2 days. The median CES-D Scale and IES-R scores were 6.0 (min:0, max:42) and 23.0 (min:0, max:59), respectively. IPAQ scores of the players showed that four-fifths of the players still maintain high physical activity levels. There were negative, very weak and significant correlations between CES-D score and being married (r=-0.146, p=0.024), as well as between CES-D score and IPAQ-Walking (r=-0.189, p=0.004). A significant positive very weak correlation was observed between CES-D score and self-quarantine days (r=0.148, p=0.024). IPAQ-Walking was an independent predictor of CES-D.

Cryptogenic stroke according to TOAST criteria is a stroke which is not due to cardiogenic embolism, small vessel disease with lacunes or large vessel disease of brain supplying arteries. In the context of secondary stroke prevention studies, cryptogenic stroke is not operationally defined. RECENT FINDINGS The new concept of ""embolic stroke of undetermined source"" (ESUS) provides an operational definition. ESUS is diagnosed as a non-lacunar stroke on cerebral imaging and exclusion of large vessel atherosclerosis by CTA, MRA or ultrasound. Cardiogenic embolism is made less likely by ECG monitoring and echocardiography. At present, aspirin is used for secondary stroke prevention in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Based on the construct that ESUS might be caused by undetected atrial fibrillation or other embolic mechanisms, ongoing randomised secondary stroke prevention trials are comparing non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with aspirin.","Diener, Hans-Christoph; Bernstein, Richard; Hart, Robert",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-017-0775-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28707135/,504
133157,Principles And Policies To Strengthen Child And Adolescent Health And Well-Being.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVE Persistent somatic symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, have been referred to as somatisation. Somatisation is commonly associated with histories of trauma and PTSD. Although previous research has demonstrated that PTSD can predict somatic problems, there has been no examination of this at the level of PTSD symptom clusters and multi-dimensional assessment of somatic symptoms. We examined the association between the three ICD-11 PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing in the here and now, avoidance, and sense of threat), measured in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic as the stressor, and somatic symptoms while statistically adjusting for confounding variables. METHODS Participants were a nationally representative sample of 1,041 adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland. Physical health problems across the domains of pain, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, and fatigue were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire, and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the International Trauma Questionnaire. RESULTS Sense of threat was associated with the presence of pain (β=.254), fatigue (β=.332), gastro-intestinal (β=0.234), and cardiovascular symptoms (β=.239).

133831,Probing Mental Health Invisibilities during a Global Pandemic.,2020-10-21,"Persons with dementia (PWD) make up a large portion of the long-term care (LTC) population the world over. Before a global pandemic swept the world, governments and healthcare providers struggled with how to best care for this unique population. One of the greatest challenges is a PWD's tendency to ""walk with purpose"" and exhibit unsafe wayfinding and elopement, which places them at risk of falls and injury. Past solutions included increased use of restraints and pharmacological interventions, but these have fallen out of favor over the years and are not optimal. These challenges put enormous strain on staff and caregivers, who are often poorly trained in dementia care, underpaid, overworked, and overstressed. PWD are impacted by these stresses, and unmet needs in LTC places an even greater stress on them and increases their risks of morbidity and mortality. The physical design of their environments contributes to the problem. Old, institutionalized buildings have poor lighting, poor ventilation, long dead-end hallways, poor visual cues, lack of home-like décor, shared bedrooms and bathrooms, and are often dense and overcrowded. These design elements contribute to the four 'A's' of dementia: apathy, anxiety, agitation, and aggression, and they also contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 in these facilities the world over. In this review, we present current ""dementia friendly"" design models in the home, community, and LTC, and argue how they could have saved lives during the pandemic and reduced the stresses on both the dementia resident and the caregiver/staff.","Olson, Nancy L; Albensi, Benedict C",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-210017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814449/,504

We hypothesized that: 1) MIS-C and pre-pandemic KD cytokine profiles may be unique and justify the clinical differences observed; 2) SARS-CoV-2-specific immune complexes (IC) may explain the immunopathology of MIS-C. Seventy-four children were included: 14 MIS-C; 9 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR without MIS-C (COVID); 14 pre-pandemic KD and 37 healthy controls (HC). Thirty-four circulating cytokines were quantified in pre-treatment serum or plasma samples and the presence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 IC was evaluated in MIS-C patients. Compared to HC, MIS-C and KD groups showed most cytokines to be significantly elevated, with IFN-γ-induced response markers (including IFN-γ, IL-18, IP-10) and inflammatory monocytes activation markers (including MCP-1, IL-1α, IL-1RA) being the main triggers of inflammation. With linear discriminant analysis, MIS-C and KD profiles overlapped; however, a subgroup of MIS-C patients (MIS-Cplus) differentiated from the remaining MIS-C patients in IFN-γ, IL-18, GM-CSF, RANTES, IP-10, IL-1α and SDF-1 and incipient signs of macrophagic activation syndrome. Circulating SARS-CoV-2-IC were not detected in MIS-C patients.

In the stages prior to the development of arthritis, nonspecific musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestations may occur. The aim of the study is to describe the frequency of rheumatic regional pain syndromes (RRPS) in FDR of RA patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out from July 2016 to September 2018. Parents, offspring, and siblings of RA patients completed the Community Oriented Program in the Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire. Rheumatoid factor (RF) IgG, IgM, and IgA; anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs); C-reactive protein (CRP); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined. All subjects with a positive COPCORD (defined by the presence of musculoskeletal pain) were evaluated and classified. Three hundred thirty-five FDRs participated, 75.8% were female, mean age of 44.15 years; 138 (41.2%) were diagnosed with at least one RRPS; 72 (21.5%) had rotator cuff tendinitis, 51 (15.2%) pes anserine bursitis, and 39 (11.6) lateral epicondylitis; RA was diagnosed in 24 (7.16%) subjects, undifferentiated arthritis (UA) in 30 (8.9%) and inflammatory arthralgia (AI) in 104 (31%).

The disease has now become a global pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between COVID-19 and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. METHODS We collected and analyzed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We reviewed electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Third Hospital of Wuhan. RESULTS Among the 405 confirmed patients, 210 had no GI symptoms, 195 had GI symptoms, and the first symptom of 155 patients was GI. The prevalence of vascular and digestive diseases in the group with GI symptoms was significantly higher than in the group without GI symptoms. In patients with GI symptoms, the proportion with fever, cough, dysphoria, chest tightness, poor appetite, chest pain, and pharyngeal pain was significantly higher than in those without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in imaging between the 2 groups. In patients with GI symptoms, the proportion with increased procalcitonin (PCT) level and decreased lymphocyte count was significantly higher than in those without GI symptoms. CONCLUSION COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms had significantly more vascular and digestive system diseases and were more likely to have clinical manifestations of fever, cough, poor appetite, chest tightness, chest pain, insomnia, and pharyngeal pain. There were more patients with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Patients with GI symptoms were more likely to have increased PCT and decreased lymphocyte count.","Zhan, Ting; Tang, Yalin; Han, Zheng; Zhu, Qingxi; Tan, Jie; Liu, Meng; Cai, Yisan; Huang, Min; Chen, Xiaoli; Cheng, Xueting; Deng, Junsheng; Huang, Xiaodong; Tian, Xia",The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.5152/tjg.2021.20379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960938/,504

However, whether and how pelvic pain alters the neural activity and connectivity of the ACC and HIPP under baseline and during social pain, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electrophysiology and biochemistry, we show that pelvic pain, particularly, primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), causes an increase in the functional connectivity between ACC and HIPP in resting-state fMRI, and a smaller reduction in connectivity during social exclusion in PDM females with periovulatory phase. Similarly, model rats demonstrate significantly increased ACC-HIPP synchronization in the gamma band, associating with reduced modulation by ACC-theta on HIPP-gamma and increased levels of receptor proteins and excitation.

141940,"Vital Directions, Quality, And More.",2021-02-01,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer, carries a life expectancy of 12-15 months. The short life expectancy is due in part to the inability of the current treatment, consisting of surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, to eliminate invasive tumor foci. Treatment of these foci may be improved with tumoricidal human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs exhibit potent tumor tropism and can be engineered to express therapeutic proteins that kill tumor cells. Advancements in preclinical models indicate that surgical resection induces premature MSC loss and reduces therapeutic efficacy. Efficacy of MSC treatment can be improved by seeding MSCs on a biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffold. MSC delivery into the surgical resection cavity on a PLA scaffold restores cell retention, persistence, and tumor killing. To study the effects of MSC-seeded PLA implantation on GBM, an accurate preclinical model is needed. Here we provide a preclinical surgical protocol for image-guided tumor resection of GBM in immune-deficient mice followed by MSC-seeded scaffold implantation. MSCs are engineered with lentiviral constructs to constitutively express and secrete therapeutic TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow fluorescent tracking. Similarly, the U87 tumor cells are engineered to express mCherry and firefly luciferase, providing dual fluorescent/luminescent tracking. While currently used for investigating stem cell mediated delivery of therapeutics, this protocol could be modified to investigate the impact of surgical resection on other GBM interventions.","Sheets, Kevin T; Bagó, Juli R; Paulk, Ivory L; Hingtgen, Shawn D",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/57452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30059037/,504

145554,Analysis of chlamydia contacts and the look-back interval at a UK sexual health clinic.,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND Transmission of many viruses occurs by direct transmission during a close contact between two hosts, or by an indirect transmission through the environment. Several and often interconnected factors, both abiotic and biotic, determine the persistence of these viruses released in the environment, which can last from a few seconds to several years. Moreover, viruses in the environment are able to travel short to very long distances, especially in the air or in water. SUMMARY Although well described now, the role of these environments as intermediaries or as reservoirs in virus transmission has been extensively studied and debated in the last century. The majority of these discoveries, such as the pioneer work on bacteria transmission, the progressive discoveries of viruses, as well as the persistence of the influenza virus in the air varying along with droplet sizes, or the role of water in the transmission of poliovirus, have contributed to the improvement of public health. Recent outbreaks of human coronavirus, influenza virus, and Ebola virus have also demonstrated the contemporaneity of these research studies and the need to study virus persistence in the environment.

Even for a skilled surgeon, laparoscopic myomectomy in such a situation is difficult. We have established a new technique for laparoscopic myomectomy to solve these issues called the ""bottom-up suture"" method. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Before complete removal of the myoma, countertraction is applied by an assistant with a claw forceps, elevating the bed of the myoma to make suturing easy. The deep myometrium can be sutured while the myoma is still attached to the uterus. DISCUSSION This technique, the ""bottom-up suture,"" may improve the suturing of laparoscopic myomectomies. The advantages of this technique are that it is easy to control unexpected bleeding, and dead space formation can be prevented even when the myomas have grown deep into the uterine myometrium. This technique will become a reliable standard for laparoscopic myomectomy.","Tanase, Y; Ikuma, K; Matsumoto, T",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2011.00093.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776281/,504

METHODS Three hundred seventy eight (378) patients with hip (174) and knee (204) osteoarthritis undergoing total joint arthroplasty (174 THA-204 TKA) were assessed pre- and post-operatively (6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months) using the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D10). The patients' satisfaction with the results of total joint arthroplasty was also assessed. Differences were analyzed using general linear model for repeated measures. RESULTS The one-year response rate was 97 % for THA and 90 % for TKA. WOMAC and CES-D10 scores improved significantly after one year for both THA and TKA (P < 0.0001). The improvement in WOMAC total score was significantly greater for TKA patients (P < 0.0001 at 12 months). WOMAC pain and stiffness improved earlier for THA (6 weeks), while TKA had equivalent improvements at 3 and 6 months respectively. Both THA/TKA displayed significant improvement of WOMAC function at 3 months but TKA had greater improvement. Age, body mass index, residence, education and social support were not significant predictors of quality of life after total joint arthroplasty.

A quantitative synthesis of existing studies is lacking. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the prevalence rates for mental disorders among adults with a foster or residential child welfare or juvenile justice care history, comparing them where possible to rates among the general population. PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched for epidemiological studies published up to 28 October 2020. Nineteen studies, totaling 604,257 participants, met our inclusion criteria. Random-effects models were used for prevalence rates and odds ratios (OR) of mental disorders, and study quality was rated. A prevalence rate of 30% [95% CI (23.36, 37.36)] for any mental disorder in adults with a child welfare care history was found (3-17% for specific disorders). A prevalence rate of 45% [95% CI (42.38, 47.38)] for any mental disorder was found in adults with a juvenile justice care history (6-66% for specific disorders). For out-of-home placement history, adult mental disorders were significantly higher than in the general population (OR = 1.33-2.76). Studies differed in terms of methodology and the disorder groups considered, so heterogeneity between effect sizes ranged from low to high. Our findings suggest that the high risk that mental health issues will persist in adults with an out-of-home placement history needs to be taken seriously in the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The care systems involved need to collaborate and to be aware of these risks.","Seker, Süheyla; Boonmann, Cyril; Gerger, Heike; Jäggi, Lena; d'Huart, Delfine; Schmeck, Klaus; Schmid, Marc",European child & adolescent psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01828-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169369/,504

Docetaxel (DTX) is acknowledged as one of the most important chemotherapy agents. The aim of this study was to improve the efficacy of docetaxel by incorporation into the mPEG-PLA nanoparticle (DTX NP) for the treatment of sarcoma. The DTX NP was prepared by emulsion solvent diffusion method and the prescription and preparation process were optimized through a single factor experiment. The optimized DTX NP was characterized by drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, drug release, etc. Then, the pharmacokinetics was conducted on rats and tumor-bearing ICR mice. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy of DTX NP with different dosages was evaluated on tumor-bearing ICR mice. The optimized DTX NP was characterized by around 100 nm sphere nanoparticles, sustained in vitro drug release with no obvious burst drug release. Compared with DTX injection, the AUC of DTX NP increased by 94.7- and 35.1-fold on the rats and tumor-bearing ICR mice models, respectively. Moreover, the intra-tumoral drug concentration increased by 5.40-fold. The tumor inhibition rate of DTX NP reached 94.66%, which was 1.24 times that of DTX injection (76.11%) at the same dosage, and the bodyweight increase rate was also higher than the DTX injection. The study provided a DTX NP, which could significantly improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of DTX as well as reduced its toxicity. It possessed a certain prospect of application for sarcoma treatment.","Chen, Jianhua; Ning, Eerdunbagena; Wang, Zhijun; Jing, Ziqi; Wei, Guijie; Wang, Xue; Ma, Pengkai",Drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1945167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180752/,504

Harnessing the power of these enzymes in the laboratory has fueled an increase in biomedical applications that involve the synthesis, amplification, and sequencing of DNA. However, the high substrate specificity exhibited by most naturally occurring DNA polymerases often precludes their use in practical applications that require modified substrates. Moving beyond natural genetic polymers requires sophisticated enzyme-engineering technologies that can be used to direct the evolution of engineered polymerases that function with tailor-made activities. Such efforts are expected to uniquely drive emerging applications in synthetic biology by enabling the synthesis, replication, and evolution of synthetic genetic polymers with new physicochemical properties.","Nikoomanzar, Ali; Chim, Nicholas; Yik, Eric J; Chaput, John C",Quarterly reviews of biophysics,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033583520000050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32715992/,504

METHODS Medline, Google Scholar, Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute database, Factiva and news and government websites were systematically searched up to October 2019. Information was extracted on the date and SSB tax level change, tax type, included beverages, and earmarking; and checked for consistency with local experts. RESULTS Three-quarters of PICTs had an SSB tax (n=16/21) and 11 of these were excise taxes that included both imported and locally produced beverages. The level of tax was over 20% in 14 jurisdictions. SSB tax was increased by more than 20 percentage points in eight PICTs. Most taxes were ad valorem or volumetric, three were earmarked and only two taxes targeted sugar-sweetened fruit juices. The majority of countries (14/21) had different tax rates for imported and locally produced beverages. CONCLUSIONS More than three-quarters of PICTs have SSB taxes. More than one-third increased these taxes since 2000 at an amount that is expected to reduce soft drink consumption. Implications for public health: Despite high-quality tax design elements in some PICTs, SSB control policies could generally be strengthened to improve health benefits, e.g. by targeting all SSBs and earmarking revenue for health.","Teng, Andrea; Snowdon, Wendy; Win Tin, Si Thu; Genç, Murat; Na'ati, Elisiva; Puloka, Viliami; Signal, Louise; Wilson, Nick",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097355/,504

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). METHODS Bevacizumab was conjugated with paraisothiocyanatobenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DTPA) and subsequently radiolabeled with (99m)Tc via the (99m)Tc carbonyl synthon. The radioconjugate after purification was characterized by SE-HPLC and its in vitro stability was determined by histidine challenge experiments. Biodistribution studies to determine the uptake by tumors were carried out in melanoma model. RESULTS The radiochemical purity of (99m)Tc carbonyl labeled antibody was >98 %. The radiolabeled antibody exhibited good stability in the histidine challenge experiments up to 24 h when stored at 37 °C. Biodistribution studies in mice bearing melanoma showed significant tumor uptake (6.9 ± 2.2 % ID/g at 24 h p.i.) which was reduced to 1.6 ± 0.4 % ID/g on co-injection with cold Bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS The (99m)Tc carbonyl-DTPA-bevacizumab conjugate with good radiochemical purity, excellent stability and good specificity for VEGF indicates its potential as a radioimmunoscintigraphy agent for various cancers.","Kameswaran, Mythili; Pandey, Usha; Sarma, Haladhar Dev; Samuel, Grace",Annals of nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12149-014-0887-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038907/,504
158649,Health behaviour changes during COVID-19 and the potential consequences: A mini-review.,2020-06-18,"Phosphorylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification in proteins and the phosphate group is present constitutively or transiently in most biological building blocks. These phosphorylated biomolecules are involved in many high-affinity binding/unbinding events that rely predominantly on electrostatic interactions. To build accurate models of these molecules, we need an improved description of the atomic partial charges for all relevant protonation states. In this work, we showed that the commonly used protocols to derive atomic partial charges using well-solvated molecules are inadequate to model the protonation equilibria in binding events. We introduced a protocol based on PB/MC calculations with a single representative conformation (of both protonation states) and used the resulting pKa estimations to help manually curate the atomic partial charges. The final charge set, which is fully compatible with the GROMOS 54A7 force field, proved to be very effective in modeling the protonation equilibrium in different phosphorylated peptides in the free (tetrapeptides, pentapeptides, and pY1021) and protein-complexed forms (pY1021/PLC-γ1 complex). This was particularly important in the case of the pY1021 bound to the SH2 domain of PLC-γ1, where only our curated charge set captured the correct protonation equilibrium at the neutral to slightly acidic pH range. The binding/unbinding phenomena in that pH range are biologically relevant and, to improve our models, we need to go beyond the commonly used protocols and obtain revised force field parameters for these molecules.","Oliveira, Nuno F B; Pires, Inês D S; Machuqueiro, Miguel",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809819/,504

To overcome this problem, we put forward an effective method, namely complementary labels for multi-class classification. As opposed to the regular classification in which the original labels are given to training data, learning with complementary labels specifies one of the classes that the pattern does not belong to. Collecting ordinary labels will be more exhausting than collecting complementary labels because users must find out the ordinary class from some of the candidate classes. Although, ordinary labels are more informative than complementary labels and thus an assisted approach is needed to learn from. This paper uses chest X-ray because it is an image dataset that need time and cost for the labeling. This paper tries to classify normal, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 images.

Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science databases and grey literature for studies reporting epidemiological and clinical data of patients with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Eligible studies were all observational or interventional studies and commentaries in English language that reported patient data on HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. We used random effect meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence and mortality. Results: Of the 17 eligible studies, there were 3 retrospective cohorts, 1 survey, 5 case series, 7 case reports and 1 commentary that reported on a total of 146 HIV infected individuals. The pooled prevalence of HIV among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.0 - 3.0, I2 = 79.3%, p=0.01), whereas the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HIV patients was 0.68% (95% CI: 0.34 - 1.34).

170603,Covid-19 and Sexual and Reproductive Health of Women and Girls in Nigeria,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants are emerging around the globe. Unfortunately, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially, variants of concern (VOC) are less susceptible to neutralization by the convalescent and post-vaccination sera, raising concerns of increased disease transmissibility and severity. Recent data suggests the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing anti-body levels as a good correlate of vaccine mediated protection. However, currently used BSL3 based virus micro-neutralization (MN) assays are more laborious, time consuming and expensive, underscoring the need for BSL2 based, cost effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In light of this unmet need, we have developed a BSL2 pseudovirus based neutralization assay (PBNA) in cells expressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The assay is reproducible (R2=0.96), demonstrates a good dynamic range and high sensitivity. Our data suggests that the biological Anti-SARS-CoV-2 research reagents such as NIBSC 20/130 show lower neutralization against B.1.351 RSA and B1.1.7 UK VOC, whereas a commercially available monoclonal antibody MM43 retains activity against both these variants. SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudovirus based neutralization assays for VOC would be useful tools to measure the neutralization ability of candidate vaccines in both preclinical models and clinical trials and further help develop effective prophylactic countermeasures against emerging neutralization escape phenotypes.","Kalkeri, Raj; Cai, Zhaohui; Lin, Shuling; Farmer, John; Kuzmichev, Yury V.; Koide, Fusataka",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.16.452709,504

Hindu nationalism represents a fusion of conservative right-wing nationalism and religion, which has proved highly successful at the ballot box. It aims at the establishment of a Hindu Rashtra or state. Central to Hindu nationalism is the idea of Hindutva, which interpellates all Indians as belonging to a Hindu civilisation based on a common pan-Indian Hindu national identity. Muslims occupy the position of a ‘constitutive outside’ enabling the construction of a Hindu Rashtra;they remain ‘enemies’ to be either excluded or assimilated to a Hindu national culture. Consequently, they remain targets of government legislation. This will be illustrated with reference to the recent abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, the building of a temple to the Hindu God Ram in Ayodhya, the Citizen Amendment Act, and the government of India’s responses to COVID-19.

This has also led towards storage of vast amount of data in user interactive websites. Several news channels apart from live streaming, are using internet in such ways to convey their information. And these methods have not only benefited people to acquire regular updates but have also impacted their lives in many ways during the world awakening pandemic like COVID-19. Currently, in this pandemic situation, many leaders including federal and state government officials have shown great concern towards society by providing statements such as preventive measures, which were regularly recorded and elaborated in the form of stories by the news channels in their own websites. But, in general, the type of statement given by a leader will always affect people's opinion and behavior, which also happened during this pandemic. There were variations in number of cases of COVID-19 based upon a region leader's statements as per timeline and the people's modulating lifestyle there. This kind of relationship has motivated us towards analyzing the COVID-19 data based on sentiment and emotion involved in leader's statements, giving rise to an idea of web scraping to obtain their statements and stories from news channels. The main aim of this paper is to enlighten about different techniques and libraries used for web scraping, some challenges while designing a web scraper and finally arrive at an efficient methodology using them to extract news headlines and stories and create a new dataset that can be used in sentiment and emotion analysis.

Previously, we showed a reciprocal effect of 15q11.2 copy-number variation on fractional anisotropy, with widespread increases in deletion carriers. We aim to replicate and expand these findings, using a larger sample of participants (n=30,930), higher resolution imaging, and examining the implications for cognitive performance. Methods Diffusion tensor imaging measures from participants with no neurological/psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from the UK Biobank database. We compared 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion (n=103) and duplication (n=119) carriers to a large cohort of control individuals with no neuropsychiatric copy-number variants (n=29,870). Additionally, we assessed how changes in white matter mediated the association between carrier status and cognitive performance. Results Deletion carriers showed increases in fractional anisotropy in the internal capsule and cingulum, and decreases in the posterior thalamic radiation, compared to both duplication carriers and controls (who had intermediate values). Deletion carriers had lower scores across cognitive tasks compared to controls, which were mildly influenced by white matter alterations. Reduced fractional anisotropy in the posterior thalamic radiation partially contributed to worse cognitive performance in deletion carriers. Conclusions This study, together with our previous findings, provides convergent evidence for a dosage-dependent effect of 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 on white matter microstructure. Additionally, changes in white matter were found to partially mediate cognitive ability in deletion carriers, providing a link between white matter changes in 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 carriers and cognitive function.","Silva, Ana I.; Kirov, George; Kendall, Kimberley M.; Bracher-Smith, Mathew; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Hall, Jeremy; Ulfarsson, Magnus O.; Walters, G.

Results: 12,391 LFTs were conducted on 8025/36,054 (22.3%) students. Only one in 10 students had the recommended two tests. There were striking demographic disparities in uptake with those from ethnic minority groups having lower uptake (e.g. 3% of Chinese students were tested vs. 30.7% of White students), and variations by level and year of study (ranging from 5.3% to 33.7%), place of residence (29.0% to 35.6%) and faculty (15.2% to 32.8%). Barriers to engagement with testing included a lack of awareness, knowledge and understanding, and concerns about the accuracy and safety. Students understood limitations of LFTs but requested further information about test accuracy. Tests were used to inform behavioural decisions, often in combination with other information, such as the potential for exposure to the virus and perceptions of vulnerability.

However, most work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in the western world leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the Global South. This paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by focusing on this problem in the context of Bangladesh, a country in the Global South. The spread of misinformation on Facebook in Bangladesh, a country with a population over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings. By interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the general public, we analyzed the current state of verifying misinformation in Bangladesh. Our findings show that most people in the `news audience' want the news media to verify the authenticity of online information that they see online. However, the newspaper journalists say that fact-checking online information is not a part of their job, and it is also beyond their capacity given the amount of information being published online everyday.

We know that active learning strategies, in particular research experiences, can engage and empower STEM undergraduates, effectively closing the achievement gap for historically excluded persons. The apprenticeship model for STEM training – supervised research under a dedicated mentor – is highly effective, but out of reach for most students. Recent efforts have demonstrated that Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) can be an effective approach for making STEM research accessible for all. Our meta-analysis of CUREs finds that published examples now cover the breadth of the typical undergraduate biology curriculum. A thoughtfully designed CURE can go beyond foundational knowledge and analytical thinking to include career-related skills, e.g., teamwork and communication. Similarly, it can be designed with equity as a foundational principle, taking into account the unique contributions of all students and their varying needs. We provide here an example framework (The “Do Science Framework”) for making STEM training more effective and inclusive using CUREs. While CUREs do not inherently address equity, there can be no equity in STEM education without equal access to research participation, and progress toward this goal can be achieved using CUREs. However, implementing new CUREs is not a trivial undertaking, particularly at schools with high teaching loads and little or no research infrastructure, including many community colleges. We therefore propose a National Center for Science Engagement to support this transition, building on experiences of current nationally established CUREs as well as the work of many individual faculty. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, academia has a renewed responsibility to dismantle structural inequities in education; engaging all STEM students in research can be a key step.","Elgin, Sarah C R; Hays, Shan; Mingo, Vida; Shaffer, Christopher D; Williams, Jason",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.446616,504

Methods: We conducted a test-negative design study using linked population-wide vaccination, laboratory testing, and health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. Results: Against symptomatic infection caused by Alpha, vaccine effectiveness with partial vaccination ([≥]14 days after dose 1) was higher for mRNA-1273 than BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1. Full vaccination ([≥]7 days after dose 2) increased vaccine effectiveness for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 against Alpha. Protection against symptomatic infection caused by Beta/Gamma was lower with partial vaccination for ChAdOx1 than mRNA-1273. Against Delta, vaccine effectiveness after partial vaccination tended to be lower than against Alpha for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, but was similar to Alpha for ChAdOx1. Full vaccination with BNT162b2 increased protection against Delta to levels comparable to Alpha and Beta/Gamma. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization or death caused by all studied VOCs was generally higher than for symptomatic infection after partial vaccination with all three vaccines. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that even a single dose of these 3 vaccine products provide good to excellent protection against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes caused by the 4 currently circulating variants of concern, and that 2 doses are likely to provide even higher protection.","Nasreen, S.; He, S.; Chung, H.; Brown, K.

183637,Travel health nursing: expanding horizons for occupational health nurses.,2004,"Background: Early diagnosis is key to the best treatment options and possible outcomes for cancer patients. However, the COVID19 pandemic has put a heavy burden on the US healthcare system, causing hospitals and medical centers to stop or delay routine cancer screenings such as mammograms, pap tests, colonoscopies, CT scans and PSA assays. Subsequently, cancer diagnostic testing and cancer patient care have also been disrupted. Methods: To determine the extent of cancer diagnostic testing that was impacted during the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020, we analyzed the changes in cancer test volume at NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc. between 2019 and 2020, and especially between March and June 2020. Unique patient test counts were categorized by cancer types as determined by the diagnostic ICD 10 code C00-D49 (with a minimum of 100 tests in 2019). Results: Comparing test volumes in 2020 to 2019, an overall decrease in tests ordered in 2020 was seen for multiple cancers. These cancers include malignant neoplasms of breast (16%) and malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung (19%), followed by malignant neoplasm of colon, polycythemia vera, and Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition, a decrease in benign cancers, and decreases in benign neoplasm of colon, rectum, anus and anal canal was observed. To determine if the US stay-at-home order implemented between March and early June 2020 had affected test volume, month-to-month comparison shows the greatest impact in test volume in malignant neoplasm of breast: a 28% decrease comparing April 2020 to April 2019, and a 32% decrease comparing May 2020 to May 2019. Similarly, a 24% and 33% decrease were seen in malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung for the same months. Individual tests specific for breast and lung cancer also showed similar decreases: 49- 56% decrease for Breast Triple Stain (CK5 + p63 + CK 8/18), 11-41% decrease for ER test, and up to 39% decrease for HER2 diagnostic tests. Tests for ALK fusions for lung cancer showed decreases in test volume ranging from 15% to 30% during April, May and June 2020 as compared to 2019. Interestingly, we found that the total test volumes for each age group (increments of 10 up to age 80) decreased April and May 2020 as well, compared to April and May 2019. We did not see a difference in test volume decreases based on patient gender. Conclusions: There was a decrease in cancer tests ordered during the pandemic in 2020 for most cancer types, with a large decrease found in breast, lung and colon cancer. The sharp decrease in breast cancer tests is important to note as breast cancer has recently been identified as the most diagnosed form of cancer, surpassing lung cancer. This impact in cancer testing may translate to delayed diagnosis and treatment options. It remains to be seen whether this will lead to more aggressive cancer treatments, or to a greater patient mortality. It is imperative that we continue to monitor and screen patients for cancer as the pandemic continues or during any healthcare crisis in the future.","Juncker-Jensen, A.; Lau, C.

How to improve the resilience of the regional economy will be of great strategic significance to achieve high-quality economic development. Taking Kunming as an example, this paper identifies the influencing factors of regional economic development through literature research and expert interviews and constructs a hypothesis model of influencing factors of economic resilience. From the three dimensions of “defense, absorption and learning” of resilience theory, data are collected through questionnaires, and the mechanism between resilience theory and economic development is explored by using the structural equation model(SEM).

The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome in older persons is also addressed. RECENT FINDINGS Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the very elderly (80 years and over). Pneumococcus is also an important etiologic agent of pneumonia in residents of long-term care facilities. Clinical signs and symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia are less distinct in this group compared with younger patients. New data about influenza immunization reveal better mucosal immunity with the intranasal vaccine compared with the intramuscular vaccine. A review of clinical trial evidence differs from observational studies that demonstrate a clear benefit of the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine in the elderly. The prospect of severe acute respiratory syndrome in older adults is the most important new issue to emerge, as older adults are at increased risk from complications and death. SUMMARY There are many challenges in preventing and managing community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly. S. pneumoniae remains the most important cause. The clinical presentation of pneumonia in the very elderly can be nonspecific. Given the safety profile of the vaccine and supportive observational evidence, public health policymakers should continue to support use of the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine. However, research into new vaccine strategies, including use of conjugate or common antigen vaccines, is a priority.","Loeb, Mark",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15021052/,504

Unfortunately, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary suspension of non-urgent elective surgery was implemented. Thousands of patients currently awaiting hip and knee replacements have been affected. Many of these patients will present to their general practitioners for symptom management during this interim period. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to summarise current recommendations for the non-operative management of patients with symptomatic OA. DISCUSSION Non-operative treatment modalities for OA include education, lifestyle modification and exercise, mass reduction, physiotherapy, orthoses, psychology, pharmaceuticals and injections. Multimodal therapy is required for patients with severe symptoms. A number of useful online resources are presented, as access to public allied health services may be limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wall, Chris; Johnson, Theresa; de Steiger, Richard",Australian journal of general practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600002/,504

Although gross lesions are rare in oxyuriasis, it is possible that more subtle changes may develop, which may affect research results. In this study, we analysed the responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation by isoproterenol (ISO) of left atria isolated from Syphacia-infested (SYPH) and control, non-infested adult male Wistar rats (CONT). In the non-infested animals, ISO pD(2) was not significantly changed by ivermectin treatment. Whereas the maximal inotropic response to ISO was not significantly affected, the pD(2) value was decreased in SYPH (7.61 +/- 0.09, n = 7, vs 8.21 +/- 0.25 in CONT, n = 5, P < 0.05), indicating lower sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. This change was similar to that caused by a classic stressor, namely repeated immobilization, in non-infested rats (IMMO). In this group, ISO pD(2) was 7.62 +/- 0.14, n = 6 (P < 0.05 with relation to CONT). The results indicate that infestation with Syphacia sp. is as effective as immobilization at diminishing cardiac reactivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. It is thus possible that oxyuriasis may affect the response of other tissues to physiological modulators.","Silveira, Ana Carolina; Gilioli, Rovilson; Oliveira, Elizângela S; Bassani, Rosana A",Laboratory animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12626073/,504

Social distancing and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks. Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow (indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect of human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical grade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging from 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with medical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus, in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial masks.","Khosronejad, Ali; Santoni, Christian; Flora, Kevin; Zhang, Zexia; Kang, Seokkoo; Payabvash, Seyedmehdi; Sotiropoulos, Fotis",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173803/,504

PROCEDURE Cells of the G clone of HRT-18 were grown to confluent monolayers on permeable supports, and were directionally infected at the apical and basolateral domains with 3 wild-type BCV strains, RBCV-LSU-94LSS-051-2, RBCV-OK-0514-3, and EBCV-LY138-2, and 1 cell culture-adapted strain, EBCV-L9-80. Sequential cytopathic changes were microscopically monitored. Medium samples for titration of hemagglutinins and viral infectivity were collected directionally from both domains of the infected cell cultures at various intervals. RESULTS Polarized epithelioid HRT-18G cells from apical domains had maximal susceptibility to infection with the EBCV and RBCV strains, and those from basolateral surfaces had minimal susceptibility. Titers of hemagglutinins and infective progeny BCV reached 1,280 hemagglutinin units and 4.2 x 10(8) plaque-forming units/ml for apical samples, but were minimal for basolateral samples. Asymmetric virus release occurred through the apical surfaces of the HRT-18G cells by 12 hours after infection when cell fusion as a sign of cytopathic changes began. When cells were infected basolaterally, progeny virions released from apical surfaces reinfected the target cells from the apical domains and induced cytopathic changes were delayed about 12 hours, compared with changes detectable in apically exposed cultures. CONCLUSIONS EBCV and RBCV, isolated from cattle, had marked tropism for polarized epithelioid HRT-18G cells.

195495,The future of health care in the United States.,2006,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of the Solitaire FR device in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to large artery occlusion. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke treated with Solitaire FR as the first-line device to restore blood flow in 6 experienced European centers. This study was entirely funded and supported by Coviden Neurovascular. An independent Corelab determined modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores on the preprocedure and postprocedure angiograms. Complete revascularization was defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3 post-Solitaire FR device use. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage Type 2 associated with a decline of ≥ 4 points in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score within 24 hours or causing death. Favorable functional outcome was considered as modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2 at Day 90. RESULTS We studied 141 patients (mean age, 66 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 18); 74 patients received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator before endovascular treatment. Complete revascularization was achieved in 120 of 142 occlusion sites (85%) and good outcome in 77 of 141 (55%) patients. Good outcome was more frequent in patients treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator than in those without (66% versus 42%; P<0.01). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was reported in 5 patients (4%) and 29 of 141 (20%) patients died or were lost during follow-up (3 cases). CONCLUSIONS This retrospective study with centralized evaluation shows that the use of Solitaire FR is safe and achieves good revascularization rates and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke and large artery occlusion.","Dávalos, Antoni; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Chapot, René; Bonafé, Alain; Andersson, Tommy; Gralla, Jan",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851547/,504
195946,Occupational safety & health administration. Building partnerships.,1996,"Since their initial transmission to humans, viruses have diversified extensively through recombination and mutation. The presence of intra- and inter-individual viral diversity influences disease progression, drug resistance, and therapy and presumably explains the conflicting results in many studies, including the failure of peptide-based vaccination strategies. Although HIV is a small RNA virus, coinfection with large DNA viruses, notably the oncogenic gamma-herpesviridae human herpesvirus-8 and Epstein Barr virus, is common. This coinfection occurs secondary to immunosuppression and shared transmission routes with high-risk predisposing behavior. In addition, all 3 of these viruses can lead to chronic infections, long periods of latency, and reactivation characterized by pain and suffering. The efficient targeting of their genetic diversity represents one of the major challenges in their control, both in prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. An understanding of diversity will help delineate whether population-specific vaccine strategies are necessary.","Stebbing, Justin; Powles, Tom; Nelson, Mark; Bower, Mark",Journal of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16928877/,504

In this commentary, we explore novel approaches to global infectious disease surveillance through a focus on an important Canadian contribution to the area--the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). GPHIN is a cutting-edge initiative that draws on the capacity of the Internet and newly available 24/7 global news coverage of health events to create a unique form of early warning outbreak detection. This commentary outlines the operation and development of GPHIN and compares it to ProMED-mail, another Internet-based approach to global health surveillance. We argue that GPHIN has created an important shift in the relationship of public health and news information. By exiting the pyramid of official reporting, GPHIN has created a new monitoring technique that has disrupted national boundaries of outbreak notification, while creating new possibilities for global outbreak response. By incorporating news within the emerging apparatus of global infectious disease surveillance, GPHIN has effectively responded to the global media's challenge to official country reporting of outbreak and enhanced the effectiveness and credibility of international public health.","Mykhalovskiy, Eric; Weir, Lorna",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512327/,504
199173,"COVID-19 serological testing for Healthcare Workers in Lombardy, Italy",2020,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) entry into cells and cell-cell fusion mediated by HSV-1 glycoproteins require four glycoproteins, gD, gB, gH, gL. Of these, gH is the only one that so far exhibits structural-functional features typical of viral fusion glycoproteins, i.e., a candidate fusion peptide and, downstream of it, a heptad repeat (HR) segment able to form a coiled coil, named HR-1. Here, we show that gH carries a functional HR-2 capable of physical interaction with HR-1. Specifically, mutational analysis of gH aimed at increasing or decreasing the ability of HR-2 to form a coiled coil resulted in an increase or decrease of fusion activity, respectively. HSV infection was modified accordingly. A mimetic peptide with the HR-2 sequence inhibited HSV-1 infection in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that both HR-2 and HR-1 mimetic peptides adopt mainly random conformation in aqueous solution, while a decrease in peptide environmental polarity determines a conformational change, with a significant increase of the alpha-helical conformation content, in particular, for the HR-1 peptide. Furthermore, HR-1 and HR-2 mimetic peptides formed a stable complex, as revealed in nondenaturing electrophoresis and by circular dichroism. The mixture of HR-1 and HR-2 peptides reversed the inhibition of HSV infection exerted by the single peptides. Complex formation between HR-1 and HR-2 was independent of the presence of adjacent gH sequences and of additional glycoproteins involved in entry and fusion. Altogether, HR-2 adds to the features typical of class 1 fusion glycoproteins exhibited by HSV-1 gH.","Gianni, Tatiana; Piccoli, Angela; Bertucci, Carlo; Campadelli-Fiume, Gabriella",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16474129/,504

201843,Based on a Decision Tree Model for Exploring the Risk Factors of Smartphone Addiction Among Children and Adolescents in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"AIM To estimate the prevalence of burnout among dental students in two major universities in the United Arab Emirates during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this cross-sectional observational study, the burnout clinical subtype questionnaire (BCSQ-12-SS) (English version) was used. It consists of 12 questions covering domains of overload (4 questions), lack of development (4 questions), and neglect (4 questions). The questionnaire was sent to 500 dental students from the University of Sharjah (UOS) and Ajman University of Science and Technology (AUST). The association between burnout and sociodemographic variables was also investigated. RESULTS The majority of responders were females (74%). Socio-demographic and study characteristics of dental students from both universities were not remarkably different. However, the responses to the BCSQ-12-SS questions were not very different. In this study, there was no significant association between burnout and demographic variables, such as age, gender, relationships, distance from family, residency, year of study, studying hours, and number of failed subjects. However, there was a significant association between burnout and receiving a scholarship and family support. CONCLUSION Identifying individuals at risk for burnout may provide a potential intervention strategy and counseling to assist in dental student development, as it has good psychometric properties. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Burnout among dental students could develop into anxiety and depressive disorders. Early identification and prevention will protect the psychological well-being of dentists.

203067,Avoiding indirect effects of COVID-19 on maternal and child health,2020,"CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading across the world. Many patients will not be suitable for mechanical ventilation owing to the underlying health conditions, and they will require a conservative approach including palliative care management for their important symptom burden. OBJECTIVES: To develop a management plan for patients who are not suitable for mechanical ventilation that is tailored to the stage their COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Patients were identified as being stable, unstable, or at the end of life using the early warning parameters for COVID-19. Furthermore, a COVID-19-specific assessment tool was developed locally, focusing on key symptoms observed in this population which assess dyspnoea, distress, and discomfort. This tool helped to guide the palliative care management as per patients' disease stage. RESULTS: A management plan for all patients' (stable, unstable, end of life) was created and implemented in acute hospitals. Medication guidelines were based on the limitations in resources and availability of drugs. Staff members who were unfamiliar with palliative care required simple, clear instructions to follow including medications for key symptoms such as dyspnoea, distress, fever, and discomfort. Nursing interventions and family involvement were adapted as per patients' disease stage and infection control requirements. CONCLUSION: Palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to adapt to an emergency style of palliative care as patients can deteriorate rapidly and require quick decisions and clear treatment plans. These need to be easily followed up by generalist staff members caring for these patients. Furthermore, palliative care should be at the forefront to help make the best decisions, give care to families, and offer spiritual support.","Fusi-Schmidhauser, Tanja; Preston, Nancy J; Keller, Nikola; Gamondi, Claudia",J Pain Symptom Manage,,504

208867,[Decisions on the state of health of employees and applicants for work with the use of ICT media],2020,"Introduction: In a CICO (cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate) situation, anesthesiologists and acute care physicians must be able to perform an emergency surgical cricothyrotomy (front-of-neck airway procedure). CICOs are high-acuity situations with rare opportunities for safe practice. In COVID-19 airway management guidelines, bougie-assisted surgical cricothyrotomy is the recommended emergency strategy for CICO situations. Methods: We designed a 4-hour procedural simulation workshop on surgical cricothyrotomy to train 16 medical residents. We provided prerequisite readings, a lecture, and a videotaped demonstration. Two clinical scenarios introduced deliberate practice on partial-task neck simulators and fresh human cadavers. We segmented an evidence-based procedure and asked participants to verbalize the five steps of the procedure on multiple occasions. Results: Thirty-two residents who participated in the workshops were surveyed, with a 97% response rate (16 of 16 from anesthesiology, 15 of 16 from emergency medicine). Participants commented positively on the workshop's authenticity, its structure, the quality of the feedback provided, and its perceived impact on improving skills in surgical cricothyrotomy. We analyzed narrative comments related to three domains: preparation for the procedure, performing the procedure, and maintaining the skills. Participants highlighted the importance of performing the procedure many times and mentioned the representativeness of fresh cadavers. Discussion: We developed a surgical cricothyrotomy simulation workshop for anesthesiology and emergency medicine residents. Residents in the two specialities uniformly appreciated its format and content. We identified common pitfalls when executing the procedure and provided practical tips and material to facilitate implementation, in particular to face the COVID-19 pandemic.","Asselin, Mathieu; Lafleur, Alexandre; Labrecque, Pascal; Pellerin, Hélène; Tremblay, Marie-Hélène; Chiniara, Gilles",MedEdPORTAL,,504

214834,Impacts of environmental issues on health and well-being: a global pollution challenge,2020,"The magnitude of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has an enormous impact on the social life and the economic activities in almost every country in the world. Besides the biological and epidemiological factors, a multitude of social and economic criteria also govern the extent of the coronavirus disease spread in the population. Consequently, there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic determinants that contribute to the resulting pandemic. In this paper, we contribute towards the resolution of the debate by leveraging Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate the potential of 29 determinants, describing a diverse set of socio-economic characteristics, in explaining the coronavirus pandemic outcome. We show that the true empirical model behind the coronavirus outcome is constituted only of few determinants, but the extent to which each determinant is able to provide a credible explanation varies between countries due to their heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics. To understand the relationship between the potential determinants in the specification of the true model, we develop the coronavirus determinants Jointness space. In this space, two determinants are connected with each other if they are able to jointly explain the coronavirus outcome. As constructed, the obtained map acts as a bridge between theoretical investigations and empirical observations, and offers an alternate view for the joint importance of the socio-economic determinants when used for developing policies aimed at preventing future epidemic crises.","Stojkoski, Viktor; Utkovski, Zoran; Jolakoski, Petar; Tevdovski, Dragan; Kocarev, Ljupco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07947v5.pdf,504

These RNA RMs include ten internationally recommended SARS-CoV-2 target gene fragments (Pasteur-RdRp-IP2, Pasteur-RdRp-IP4, Charite-E, Charite-RdRp, CDC-N1, CDC-N2, China CDC-ORF1ab, China CDC-N, Hong Kong-ORF1b, and Hong Kong-N) for virus detection and one human gene fragment (RNase P) as an internal control. Two different platforms, RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR, were used to characterize UME RM 2019 (UME RM 2020 was only characterized with RT-qPCR). The homogeneity studies were evaluated by RT-qPCR. According to these results, it has been shown that both reference materials are homogeneous for intended use. Short-term studies were also conducted similarly for mimicking transport conditions and UME RM 2020, which is produced in lyophilized form, unlike other reference materials available in the market, provides convenience for users by ensuring that the reference material remains stable for 17 days even at 45 °C temperature. The lyophilized formulation of the reference material had greater stability which would allow it to be shipped without cooling items. The development of such RNA reference materials provides quality control for existing and newly designed RNA-based virus detection tests and it helps the prevention and control of epidemics.","Akyurek, Sema; Demirci, Sumeyra Nur Sanal; Bayrak, Zeynep; Isleyen, Alper; Akgoz, Muslum",Anal Bioanal Chem,,504

METHODS: Patients with AIS-LVO of the anterior circulation who underwent EVT were enrolled. According to the times of Wuhan closure and reopening, patients were divided into a pre-pandemic group (from November 8, 2019, to January 22, 2020), pandemic group (from January 23, 2020, to April 8, 2020) and post-epidemic group (from April 9, 2020, to June 24, 2020). The primary endpoints were the time delay among symptom onset to arriving hospital door, to groining puncture and to vascular reperfusion. Secondary endpoints were the functional outcomes evaluated by 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) score. RESULTS: In total, the times from onset to reperfusion (OTR, median 356 min vs. 310 min, p = 0.041) and onset to door (OTD, median 238 min vs. 167 min, p = 0.017) were prolonged in the pandemic group compared to the pre-pandemic group, and the delay continue in the post-epidemic period. In the subgroup analysis, the time from door to imaging (DTI) was significantly prolonged during the pandemic period. Interestingly, the prolonged DTI was corrected in the directly admitted subgroup during post-epidemic period. In addition, the functional outcomes showed no significant differences across the three periods. CONCLUSIONS: Total time and prehospital time were prolonged during the pandemic and post-epidemic periods. Urgent public education and improved in-hospital screening processes are necessary to decrease time delays.","Zhang, Tangqin; Chen, Chu; Xu, Xiangjun; Xu, Junfeng; Yang, Ke; Xu, Youqing; Yuan, Lili; Yang, Qian; Huang, Xianjun; Zhou, Zhiming",BMC Neurol,,504

We aimed at investigating the serotype distribution for IPD-causing S. pneumoniae and vaccine coverage among Chinese children and adults. This was a multicenter, observational study to collect S. pneumoniae isolates from normal sterile sites and IPD-related clinical information among children and adults. Serotyping was performed by a Capsule-Quellung reaction test using type-specific antisera. The study collected a total of 300 eligible isolates (pediatric = 148, adult = 152) were serotyped in a central laboratory. The most prevalent serotypes were 19A (20.9%) and 23 F (20.3%) in the pediatric group; 3 (21.7%) and 19 F (11.8%) in the adult group. PCV10 had low-to-moderate serotype coverage rates for children (60.8%) and adults (34.2%). PCV13 and PPV23 had high coverage rates for children (89.9%, 93.2%) and adults (70.4%, 82.9%), respectively, Investigational PCVs including PCV15 and PCV20 had high estimated coverage rates in children (89.9%, 93.9%). The study identified 269 subjects with IPD reported as the primary diagnosis in the medical records. Sepsis (48/136, 35.3%) and pneumonia (48/133, 36.1%) had the highest occurrence in the pediatric and adult groups, respectively. Study findings showed that non-PCV7 S. pneumoniae 19A and 3 were the most prevalent serotypes in Chinese children and adults, respectively. High-valent vaccines had similar coverage rates and may have a greater potential in preventing IPD.","Li, Ma-Chao; Wang, Yao; Zhang, Hong; Liu, Yong; Chen, Xue-Jun; Yang, Hong-Wei; Ma, Ping; Wang, Ding-Cheng; Zhang, Bing-Chang; Dong, Ai-Ying; Wang, Chun-Xin; Li, Yan; Bai, Peng; Tang, Wen-Min; Wang, Jue; Shao, Zhu-Jun; Xu, Ying-Chun",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,504

Methods: We conducted online survey on adult resident of Bali Province, Indonesia in September 14th to October 31st 2020 collecting data on demographics, impacts of the pandemic, conspiracy beliefs, trusts in conventional media and authoritative sources, as well as vaccine acceptance. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis for determinants of vaccine acceptance with SPSS 23.0. Results: We recruited 779 respondents with 38.9% male and median age of 24 years old (IQR 20 - 26). The result showed vaccine acceptance of 60.8%. Vaccine acceptance was correlated with conspiracy beliefs, trusts in conventional media and authoritative sources with Spearman's rho of -0.350, 0.269, and 0.287 respectively. Controlling for demographics and impacts of pandemic, showed strong conspiracy beliefs and trust in conventional media as the only independent determinants with OR of 0.33 (CI95% 0.20 - 0.54) and 1.91 (CI95% 1.37 - 2.65) respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated considerable impacts of infodemic, represented by conspiracy beliefs, trust in media, and in authoritative sources, toward COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Effective public health messaging should be conducted concurrent with vaccine rollout to improve acceptance and achieve herd immunity.","Wirawan, Gede Benny Setia; Mahardani, Putu Nandika Tungga Yudanti; Cahyani, Made Ratna Komala; Laksmi, Ni Luh Prema Shantika Putri; Januraga, Pande Putu",Pers Individ Dif,,504
225044,Foundation Funding In Telehealth,2021,"The landscape of miniaturized wireless biomedical devices (MWBDs) is rapidly expanding as proactive mobile healthcare proliferates. MWBDs are diverse and include various injectable, ingestible, implantable, and wearable devices. While the growth of MWBDs increases the flexibility of medical services, the adoption of these technologies brings privacy and security risks for their users. MWBDs can operate with sensitive, private information and affect patients through the use of stimulation and drug delivery. Therefore, these devices require trust and need to be secure. Embedding protective mechanisms into MWBDs is challenging because they are restricted in size, power budget, as well as processing and storage capabilities. Nevertheless, MWBDs need to be at least minimally securable in the face of evolving threats. The main intent of this work is to make the primary stakeholders of MWBDs aware of associated risks and to help the architects and the manufacturers of MWBDs protect their emerging designs in a repeatable and structured manner. Making MWBDs securable begins with performing threat modeling. This paper introduces a domain-specific qualitative-quantitative threat model dedicated to MWBDs. The proposed model is then applied to representative case studies from each category of MWBDs.","Vakhter, Vladimir; Soysal, Betul; Schaumont, Patrick; Guler, Ulkuhan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05937v1.pdf,504

229347,"How should community health workers in fragile contexts be supported: qualitative evidence from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Democratic Republic of Congo",2020,"Background: Consumers' willingness to use health chatbots can eventually determine if the adoption of health chatbots will succeed in delivering healthcare services for combating COVID-19. However, little research to date has empirically explored influential factors of consumer willingness toward using these novel technologies, and the effect of individual differences in predicting this willingness. Objectives: This study aims to explore (a) the influential factors of consumers' willingness to use health chatbots related to COVID-19, (b) the effect of individual differences in predicting willingness, and (c) the likelihood of using health chatbots in the near future as well as the challenges/barriers that could hinder peoples' motivations. Methods: An online survey was conducted which comprised of two sections. Section one measured participants' willingness by evaluating the following six factors: performance efficacy, intrinsic motivation, anthropomorphism, social influence, facilitating conditions, and emotions. Section two included questions on demographics, the likelihood of using health chatbots in the future, and concerns that could impede such motivation. Results: A total of 166 individuals provided complete responses. Although 40% were aware of health chatbots and only 24% had used them before, about 84% wanted to use health chatbots in the future. The strongest predictors of willingness to use health chatbots came from the intrinsic motivation factor whereas the next strongest predictors came from the performance efficacy factor. Nearly 39.5% of participants perceived health chatbots to have human-like features such as consciousness and free will, but no emotions. About 38.4% were uncertain about the ease of using health chatbots. Conclusion: This study contributes toward theoretically understanding factors influencing peoples' willingness to use COVID-19-related health chatbots. The findings also show that the perception of chatbots' benefits outweigh the challenges.","Almalki, Manal",Med Arch,,504

A few cases of GBS associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection have been reported. The aim was to identify specific clinical features of GBS associated with COVID-19. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane were searched from 1 November 2019 to 17 May 2020 and included all papers with full text in English, Spanish, French or Italian, reporting original data of patients with GBS and COVID-19. Data were extracted according to a predefined protocol. A total of 18 patients reported in 14 papers were included in this review. All the patients were symptomatic for COVID-19, with cough and fever as the most frequently reported symptoms. The interval between the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 and the first symptoms of GBS ranged from -8 to 24 days (mean 9 days; median 10 days). Most of the patients had a typical GBS clinical form predominantly with a demyelinating electrophysiological subtype. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in eight (44%) patients. Two (11%) patients died. Published cases of GBS associated with COVID-19 report a sensorimotor, predominantly demyelinating GBS with a typical clinical presentation. Clinical features and disease course seem similar to those observed in GBS related to other etiologies. These results should be interpreted with caution since only 18 cases have been heterogeneously reported so far.","De Sanctis, P; Doneddu, P E; Viganò, L; Selmi, C; Nobile-Orazio, E",Eur. j. neurol,,504

This study numerically investigated the transmission of COVID-19 by cough-induced particles in a cabin section of Boeing 737 model. One passenger was coughing in each case, while cough particles with measured size distributions were released during coughs and were tracked using the Lagrangian framework. Outcomes revealed that cough flow released by passengers could develop rapidly into a strong turbulent cough jet, breaking up the local airflow field. The released cough particles were largely dominated by the cough jet within 5 s, especially the first 1.5 s. Deposition of particles under 100 µm were relatively delayed when released from a window-seat location. Small particles (under 50 µm) released by a window-seat passenger were more likely to spread widely in the studied cabin section, which could lead to the highest exposure risks to nearby passengers. Also, due to ventilation design and seating arrangement, cough particles released by the middle-seat passenger were found easily trapped in his/her own local environment. Cough particles released from aisle-seat passengers had the least exposure risk to adjacent passengers. © 2021 The Author(s).

Studies have elucidated the central hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the E protein being responsible for much of the viroporin activity in favor of the virus. However, newer insights into the organizational principles at the membranous compartments within the host cells suggest further complexity of the system. The lesser hydrophobic Carboxylic-terminal of the protein harbors interesting amino acid sequences- suggesting at the prevalence of membrane-directed amyloidogenic properties that remains mostly elusive. These highly conserved segments indicate at several potential membrane-associated functional roles that can redefine our comprehensive understanding of the protein.

247607,COVID-19 and preterm birth,2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, children's hospitals across the country postponed elective surgery beginning in March 2020. As projective curves flattened, administrators and surgeons sought to develop strategies to safely resume non-emergent surgery. This article reviews challenges and solutions specific to a children's hospital related to the resumption of elective pediatric surgeries. We present our tiered reentry approach for pediatric surgery as well as report early data for surgical volume and tracking COVID-19 cases during reentry. METHODS: The experience of shutdown, protocol development, and early reentry of elective pediatric surgery are reported from Levine's Children's Hospital (LCH), a free-leaning children's hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. Data reported were obtained from de-identified hospital databases. RESULTS: Pediatric surgery experienced a dramatic decrease in case volumes at LCH during the shutdown, variable by specialty. A tiered and balanced reentry strategy was implemented with steady resumption of elective surgery following strict pre-procedural screening and testing. Early outcomes showed a steady thorough fluctuating increase in elective case volumes without evidence of a surgery-associated positive spread through periprocedural tracking. CONCLUSION: Reentry of non-emergent pediatric surgical care requires unique considerations including the impact of COVID-19 on children, each children hospital structure and resources, and preventing undue delay in intervention for age- and disease-specific pediatric conditions. A carefully balanced strategy has been critical for safe reentry following the anticipated surge. Ongoing tracking of resource utilization, operative volumes, and testing results will remain vital as community spread continues to fluctuate across the country.","Pickens, Ryan C; Kao, Angela M; Williams, Mark A; Herman, Andrew C; Kneisl, Jeffrey S",Am Surg,,504

247609,COVID-19 and preterm birth,2020,"A promising approach to help offset production costs for the cellulosic ethanol industry is to improve ethanol productivity while simultaneously generating value-added by-products. This study reports integration of an advanced fermentation approach (self-cycling fermentation) with the production of cellulose nanocrystals. Specifically, wood pulp was enzymatically hydrolyzed to yield dissolved sugars, which were fed to a self-cycling fermentation system for ethanol production, and residual solids were used for cellulose nanocrystals production via acid hydrolysis. Self-cycling fermentation achieved stable ethanol production for 10 cycles with significantly greater productivity than batch operation: ethanol volumetric productivity increased by 63-95% and annual ethanol productivity by 96 ± 5%. Additionally, the enzyme hydrolysis approach employed did not impede ethanol fermentation, and the cellulose nanocrystals generated displayed properties consistent with previous studies. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of this co-production strategy to produce both cellulosic ethanol and cellulose nanocrystals from a single feedstock.","Wang, Jie; Chae, Michael; Beyene, Dawit; Sauvageau, Dominic; Bressler, David C",Bioresour Technol,,504

As demand for chemical services grew, Warington constructed an ultimately lucrative career in chemistry in which consulting played a major part. His formative years laid ideal foundations for establishing himself as a consultant, whilst his appointment as chemical operator to the Society of Apothecaries' pharmaceutical trade provided the status and infrastructure to sustain this activity. Here I explore the nature of the chemical services he performed for a range of customers through a survey of his experimental notes. At a time when professional boundaries in the subject were being delineated, this case study provides an example of how chemistry could be commercialised outside the academic environment and how consulting merged into a broader scientific career.","Simmons, Anna",Ambix,,504
249048,Exploring how to deliver videoconference-mediated psychological therapy to adults with an intellectual disability during the coronavirus pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a pandemic that forced a transformation in the services provided by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Fragility hip fractures account for over 65,000 cases per year in the elderly population. The study aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on fragility hip fractures. METHODS: A retrospective data gather was performed to identify fragility hip fractures from the 23rd of March 2020 to the 13th of May 2020, and from the 23rd of March 2019 to the 13th of May 19. Two groups were formed and compared over their 30 day follow up. RESULTS: The control group comprised of 97 patients, with a mean age of 82.1 years old (62-102 years) and M:F ratio of 38:59. The case group comprised of 102 patients, with a mean age of 82.3 years old (60-100 years) and a M:F ratio of 16:86. Significant differences between groups were identified for gender (p < 0.001), time to theatre (p = 0.002), length of stay (p < 0.001) and COVID-19 status (p = 0.001). In the Case group, association with mortality was found for male gender (p = 0.041), right side (p = 0.031) and COVID-19 positive test results (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Early surgical intervention is advocated wherever possible, and sufficient optimisation, prior to surgery whenever a COVID-19 positive patient is identified. A safe rehabilitation environment is paramount for recovery in this group of patients. Further studies are required to understand the effect of this pandemic on the fragility hip fractures.

This mini review aimed to summarize the online education mode and plans for schools to resume full-time campus study in China during COVID-19. Chinese schools have made significant contributions to the prevention and control of the transmission of COVID-19 by adopting online learning from home. However, normal opening and classroom teaching have been affected. For education systems at all levels, online education may be an effective way to make up for the lack of classroom teaching during the epidemic. To protect staff and students from COVID-19, the timing of students returning to full-time campus study needs to be considered carefully.

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients. This work presents the in silico design of a potential lead vanadium compound. It was tested along with 20 other vanadium-containing complexes from the literature in a virtual screening test by docking against the inhibition of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.","Scior, Thomas; Abdallah, Hassan H; Fatimah Zaharah Mustafa, Siti; Antonio Guevara-García, José; Rehder, Dieter",Inorganica Chim Acta,,504

There is a high demand for rapid diagnostic tests to expedite the identification of cases and to facilitate early isolation and control spread. Hence this study evaluates six different rapid nucleic acid detection assays that are commercially available for SARS-CoV-2 virus detection. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 4981 participants and were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the gold standard real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method and with one of these six rapid methods of detection. Evaluation of the rapid nucleic acid detection assays was done by comparing the results of these rapid methods with the gold standard RT-qPCR results for SARS-COV-2 detection.

251174,Addressing covid-19 health disparities through community engagement,2020,"Many developing countries have highly unequal health systems across their regions. The pandemic of COVID-19 brought an additional challenge, as hospital structures equipped with doctors, intensive care units and respirators are not available to a sufficient extent in all regions. Using Data Envelopment Analysis, we create a COVID Index to verify whether the hospital structures in 543 Brazilian microregions are adequate to deal with COVID-19 and to verify whether public policies were implemented in the right direction. The results indicate that hospital structures in the poorest microregions were the most vulnerable, although the peak of COVID-19 occurred in the richest microregions (Sao Paulo). The Southeast states could relocate hospital resources or even patients between their regions. The relocation was not possible in many states in the Northeast, as the health system poorly assisted the interior of these states. These findings reveal that the heterogeneity of microregions' hospital structures follows the patterns of socioeconomic inequalities. We conclude that it is easier for the wealthier regions to reallocate hospital resources internally than for the poorest regions. By using the COVID Index, policymakers and hospital managers have straightforward information to decide which regions must receive new investments and reallocate underutilized resources.","Ferraz, Diogo; Mariano, Enzo Barberio; Manzine, Patricia Regina; Moralles, Herick Fernando; Morceiro, Paulo César; Torres, Bruno Guimarães; de Almeida, Mariana Rodrigues; Soares de Mello, João Carlos; Rebelatto, Daisy Aparecida do Nascimento",Soc Indic Res,,504

251772,Family planning in COVID-19 times: access for all,2021,"In February 2021, in response to emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, the Canton Grisons launched a unique RNA mass testing program targeting the labour force in local businesses. Employees were offered weekly tests free of charge and on a voluntary basis. If tested positive, they were required to self-isolate for ten days and their contacts were subjected to daily testing at work. Thereby, the quarantine of contact persons could be waved. Here, we evaluate the effects of the testing program on the tested cohorts. We examined 121364 test results from 27514 participants during February-March 2021. By distinguishing different cohorts of employees, we observe a noticeable decrease in the test positivity rate and a statistically significant reduction in the associated incidence rate over the considered period. The reduction in the latter ranges between 18%-50%. The variability is partly explained by different exposures to exogenous infection sources (e.g., contacts with visiting tourists or cross-border commuters). Our analysis provides the first empirical evidence that applying repetitive mass testing to a real population over an extended period of time can prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic. However, to overcome logistic, uptake, and adherence challenges it is important that the program is carefully designed and that disease incursion from the population outside of the program is considered and controlled.","Gorji, Hossein; Lunati, Ivan; Rudolf, Fabian; Vidondo, Beatriz; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich; Jenny, Patrick; Engel, Doortje; Schneider, Jörg; Jamnicki, Marina; Leuthold, Rudolf; Risch, Lorenz; Risch, Martin; Bühler, Martin; Sommer, Adrian; Caduff, Alexa",,,504

Responding to the challenge has revealed a discord between the United States and the European Union on how to tackle the crisis and their opposite perceptions of the WHO's role. President-elect J. Biden is about to cancel D. Trump's dubious decisions on U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, the Paris accord on climate, the World Health Organization. This reversal may lead to a more alignment between the United States and the European Union, but it can't prevent ongoing erosion of the U.S.A global hegemony.

253676,Understanding the effects of COVID-19 on health care and systems,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to the global health care system. Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China. METHODS: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices. RESULTS: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies. The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated.","Gong, Mengchun; Liu, Li; Sun, Xin; Yang, Yue; Wang, Shuang; Zhu, Hong",J Med Internet Res,,504

Expert opinion and scientific societies recommend a higher dose of low-molecular-weight heparin, but definitive data is lacking. We report our adapted thromboprophylaxis practice of low-molecular-weight heparin administration in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU patients. One-hundred six measurements in 19 ICU patients were collected. Despite enoxaparin 60 mg once daily, only two measurements of the trough anti-Xa were in the upper end of prophylactic range. Anti-Xa activity peaks increased significantly after administration, but all measurements were under the optimal prophylactic ranges. Despite an adapted protocol, three of the 19 patients (16%) developed venous thromboembolism. We show in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU patients, despite higher prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin administration due to body mass index, anti-Xa activity was well below peak serum levels in our cohort of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

We find that quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) fluctuations have a negative impact on the annual IDM, indicating that the mortality of infectious diseases varies counter-cyclically with the business cycle in China. Specifically, IDM usually increases with deterioration in economic conditions, and vice versa. The empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis I derived from the theoretical analysis, which highlights that economic fluctuations can negatively affect the mortality of infectious diseases. The findings can offer revelations for the government to consider the role of economic conditions in controlling the epidemic of infectious diseases. Policymakers should adopt appropriate and effective strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of macroeconomic downturns on the mortality of infectious diseases. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these analyses further emphasize the importance of promoting economic growth, increasing public health expenditure, and preventing and controlling foreign infectious diseases.","Sun, Ting-Ting; Tao, Ran; Su, Chi-Wei; Umar, Muhammad",Front Public Health,,504

Worldwide, this pandemic had a huge impact on the mental health of people in many countries causing similar reaction in terms of emotions and concerns at the population level. Our study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of Italian university students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the period immediately after the first lockdown through the administration of a questionnaire on the personal websites of students attending their undergraduate courses at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. We used the Patient-Health-Engagement-Scale, Self-Rating-Anxiety-Scale, and Self-Rating-Depression-Scale to assess engagement, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms of our sample. RESULTS: The sample size was 501 subjects, of which 35.33% were classified as anxious and 72.93% as depressed. Over 90% of respondents had good understanding of the preventive measures despite over 70% suffered from the impossibility of physically seeing friends and partners. Around 55% of students would have been willing to contribute much more to face the pandemic. An increase in the occurrences of anxiety was associated with being female, being student of the Rome campus, suffering from the impossibility of attending university, being distant from colleagues, and being unable of physically seeing one's partner. Performing physical activity reduced this likelihood. CONCLUSION: University students are at risk of psychological distress in the case of traumatic events. The evolution of the pandemic is uncertain and may have long-term effects on mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to study the most effective interventions to identify vulnerable subgroups and to plan for acute and long-term psychological services to control and reduce the burden of psychological problems.","Villani, Leonardo; Pastorino, Roberta; Molinari, Enrico; Anelli, Franco; Ricciardi, Walter; Graffigna, Guendalina; Boccia, Stefania",Global Health,,504

METHODS: We described cystocisternostomy technique for arachnoid cysts through fenestration medial to the edge of tentorium through lateral pontomesencephalic membrane and illustrated it's outcomes. We performed endoscopic lateral pontomesencephalic membranotomy in nine children with zero angled rigid endoscope (STORZ). The age ranged from eight months up to nine years. The cysts were Galassi type III in eight cases (five of them giant hemispheric) and Galassi type II in one case. Clinical presentations were delay in milestones, seizures, loss of consciousness, unsteady gait, and persistent headache. RESULTS: The cysts were decreased in size in five cases after three months and nearly disappeared after three and 15 months in two cases, and in 18 months in the other two. Preoperative symptoms improved in all cases. Insignificant subdural hygroma was found in five cases, one case developed hydrocephalus four months later treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt; contralateral massive subdural hematoma occurred in one case four months after surgery evacuated with two burr holes with good clinical outcome. There was neither CSF leakage, cranial nerve palsy nor mortality. CONCLUSION: The fenestration through the lateral pontomesencephalic membrane created a shortcut of CSF flow to the basal cisterns especially cerebellopontine cistern and represents a reliable option with an acceptable success rate. It creates a good drainage to the large cysts.","El Refaee, Ehab; Elbaroody, Mohammad",World neurosurgery (Online),,504

263659,"Impact of COVID-19 on health-related behaviours, well-being and weight management",2021,"The role of the RNAi/Dicer/Ago system in degrading RNA viruses has been elusive in mammals in the past, which has prompted authors to think that interferon (IFN) synthesis is essential in this clade, relegating the RNAi defense strategy against viral infection as an accessory function. However, recent publications highlight the existence of abundant viral small interference and micro RNAs (VsiRNAs and VmiRNAs) in both cell-line and whole organism based experiments, indicating a contribution of these molecules in host responses and/or viral replication. We explore the theoretical possibility that RNAi triggered by SARS-CoV-2 might degrade some host transcripts in the opposite direction, although this hypothesis seems counterintuitive. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was therefore computationally searched for exact intrapairing within the viral RNA and exact hybrid pairing with the human transcriptome over a minimum of 20 bases in length. Minimal segments of 20-base lengths of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found based on the theoretical matching with existing complementary strands in the human host transcriptome. Few human genes potentially annealing with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30, the subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 and two long noncoding RNAs, were retrieved. The hypothesis that viral-originated RNAi might mediate degradation of host transcriptome messages was corroborated by published high throughput sequencing of RNA from infected tissues and cultured cells, clinical observation and phylogenetic comparative analysis, indicating a strong specificity of these SARS-CoV-2 hybrid pairing sequences for human genomes.","Pasquier, Claude Robichon Alain",Heliyon,,504

The median viral shedding among studied population was obtained 34.16 (±17.65) days which was not significantly associated with age, sex and underlying diseases. Shiver and body pain were found in prolonged form of the infection and also patients who had gastrointestinal problems experienced longer viral shedding. Moreover, IgG was present in 84% of patients after 150 days. According to this data, the median viral shedding prolongation was 34.16 days which indicates that 14 days isolation might not be enough for population.

Their experiences, responses, dreams and understanding of CAL education in multicultural Australia were thus captured. Our data shows that critical CAL education might point to some avenues for the educational equity agenda. By arguing that emancipatory and critical practices could enhance students to achieve consciousness and collective self-transformation, we aim to make a contribution to the literature on CAL and languages education, which all too often isolates from broader issues in educational theory. The article also adds to the limited research that engages with CAL classroom data. Our critical approach to CAL education illuminates the intersections between language and social inclusion.

Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite (designated site i) recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, albeit selecting escape mutants in some animals. Indeed, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, harbor frequent mutations within the NTD supersite, suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective immunity and vaccine design.","McCallum, Matthew; De Marco, Anna; Lempp, Florian A; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Pinto, Dora; Walls, Alexandra C; Beltramello, Martina; Chen, Alex; Liu, Zhuoming; Zatta, Fabrizia; Zepeda, Samantha; di Iulio, Julia; Bowen, John E; Montiel-Ruiz, Martin; Zhou, Jiayi; Rosen, Laura E; Bianchi, Siro; Guarino, Barbara; Fregni, Chiara Silacci; Abdelnabi, Rana; Foo, Shi-Yan Caroline; Rothlauf, Paul W; Bloyet, Louis-Marie; Benigni, Fabio; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Neyts, Johan; Riva, Agostino; Snell, Gyorgy; Telenti, Amalio; Whelan, Sean P J; Virgin, Herbert W; Corti, Davide; Pizzuto, Matteo Samuele; Veesler, David",Cell,,504

BACKGROUND: Disruption of care pathways during a public health crisis may prevent children from obtaining prompt assessment for surgical conditions. Progression of appendicitis to perforation is influenced by timeliness of presentation. In the context of state-mandated controls and public wariness of hospitals, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on perforated appendicitis in children. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an analysis of all children presenting to 3 hospital sites with acute appendicitis between March 1 and May 7, 2020, corresponding with the peak COVID-19 outbreak in the New York City region. Control variables were collected from the same institutions for the preceding 5 years. The primary outcome measure was appendiceal perforation. RESULTS: Fifty-five children presented with acute appendicitis over 10 weeks. Compared to a 5-year control cohort of 1291 patients, we observed a higher perforation rate (45% vs 27%, odds ratio 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.29-3.85, P = 0.005) and longer mean duration of symptoms in children with perforations (71â±â39 vs 47â±â27âh, P = 0.001) during the COVID-19 period. There were no differences in perforation rates (55% vs 59%, P = 0.99) or median length of stay (1.0 vs 3.0 days, P = 0.58) among children screening positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Children in the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated higher rates of perforated appendicitis compared to historical controls. Preoperative detection of SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with inferior outcomes. Although children likely avoid much of the morbidity directly linked to COVID-19, disruption to local healthcare delivery systems may negatively impact other aspects of pediatric surgical disease.","Fisher, Jason C; Tomita, Sandra S; Ginsburg, Howard B; Gordon, Alex; Walker, David; Kuenzler, Keith A",Ann. surg,,504

We conducted a study to address the following question: how has the pandemic impacted US clinicians' professional roles and relationships? DESIGN: Inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. SETTING: Clinical settings across the USA in April and May of 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians with leadership and/or clinical roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. MEASURES: Emergent themes related to professional roles and relationships. RESULTS: Sixty-one clinicians participated in semi-structured interviews. Study participants were practising in 15 states across the USA, and the majority were White physicians from large academic centres. Three overlapping and inter-related themes emerged from qualitative analysis of interview transcripts: (1) disruption: boundaries between work and home life became blurred and professional identity and usual clinical roles were upended; (2) constructive adaptation: some clinicians were able to find new meaning in their work and described a spirit of collaboration, shared goals, open communication and mutual respect among colleagues; and (3) discord and estrangement: other clinicians felt alienated from their clinical roles and experienced demoralising work environments marked by division, value conflicts and mistrust. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians encountered marked disruption of their professional roles, identities and relationships during the pandemic to which they and their colleagues responded in a range of different ways. Some described a spirit of collaboration and camaraderie, while others felt alienated by their new roles and experienced work environments marked by division, value conflicts and mistrust. Our findings highlight the importance of effective teamwork and efforts to support clinician well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Butler, Catherine R; Wong, Susan P Y; Vig, Elizabeth K; Neely, Claire S; O039,; Hare, Ann M",BMJ Open,,504
280771,Access to Health Care by Migrants with Precarious Status During a Health Crisis: Some Insights from Portugal,2021,"Diabetes and its related metabolic disorders have been reported as the leading comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This clinical study aims to investigate the clinical features, radiographic and laboratory tests, complications, treatments, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes. This retrospective study included 208 hospitalized patients (&#8805;45 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the period between 12 January and 25 March 2020. Information from the medical record, including clinical features, radiographic and laboratory tests, complications, treatments, and clinical outcomes, were extracted for the analysis. 96 (46.2%) patients had comorbidity with type 2 diabetes. In COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes, the coexistence of hypertension (58.3% vs. 31.2%), coronary heart disease (17.1% vs. 8.0%), and chronic kidney diseases (6.2% vs. 0%) was significantly higher than in COVID-19 patients without type 2 diabetes. The frequency and degree of abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) chest scans in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes were markedly increased, including ground-glass opacity (85.6% vs. 64.9%, P < 0.001) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.7% vs. 37.8%, P < 0.001). In addition, the levels of blood glucose (7.23 mmol·L-1 (interquartile range (IQR): 5.80-9.29) vs. 5.46 mmol·L-1 (IQR: 5.00-6.46)), blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (2.21 mmol·L-1 (IQR: 1.67-2.76) vs. 1.75 mmol·L-1 (IQR: 1.27-2.01)), and systolic pressure (130 mmHg (IQR: 120-142) vs. 122 mmHg (IQR: 110-137), P = 0.001) in COVID-19 patients with diabetes were significantly higher than in patients without diabetes (P < 0.001). The coexistence of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders is common in patients with COVID-19, which may potentiate the morbidity and aggravate COVID-19 progression. Optimal management of the metabolic hemostasis of glucose and lipids is the key to ensuring better clinical outcomes. Increased clinical vigilance is warranted for COVID-19 patients with diabetes and other metabolic diseases that are fundamental and chronic conditions.","Chen, Yingyu; Chen, Jiankun; Gong, Xiao; Rong, Xianglu; Ye, Dewei; Jin, Yinghua; Zhang, Zhongde; Li, Jiqiang; Guo, Jiao",,,504

In addition to causing significant respiratory pathology, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (like infection with other respiratory viruses) directly or indirectly results in abnormal vasculature, which may contribute to hypoxemia. These vascular effects cause significant morbidity and may contribute to mortality from the disease. Given that abnormal vasculature and poor oxygenation are also hallmarks of solid tumors, lessons from the treatment of cancer may help identify drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Although the mechanisms that result in vascular abnormalities in COVID-19 are not fully understood, it is possible that there is dysregulation of many of the same angiogenic and thrombotic pathways as seen in patients with cancer. Many anticancer therapeutics, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and immune checkpoint blockers (ICB), result in vascular normalization in addition to their direct effects on tumor cells. Therefore, these therapies, which have been extensively explored in clinical trials of patients with cancer, may have beneficial effects on the vasculature of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, these drugs may have additional effects on the disease course, as some ADTs may impact viral entry, and ICBs may accelerate T-cell-mediated viral clearance. These insights from the treatment of cancer may be leveraged to abrogate the vascular pathologies found in COVID-19 and other forms of hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Munn, Lance L; Stylianopoulos, Triantafyllos; Jain, Natalie K; Hardin, C Corey; Khandekar, Melin J; Jain, Rakesh K",Clin. cancer res,,504

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is another widely spread virus that chronically affects about 257 million people. The management of patients with HBV infection has gained attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 have varying levels of liver involvements, resulting from direct viral effects on the liver as well as hepatotoxic drugs. This was demonstrated by elevated levels of liver enzymes, particularly evident in those patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, scarce information is available on the management of COVID-19 patients having an underlying chronic liver disease, including HBV infection. Studies have shown reactivation of HBV infection following treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids, emphasizing the need for caution when using these agents to treat COVID-19 patients with HBV infection. HBV screening and prophylaxis should be considered in patients with elevated transaminases levels and also in high prevalence populations. In patients with advanced liver disease, attention must be given to minimize the risk of liver decompensation.

However, there is uncertainty about the duration of immunity, evolution of IgG antibody levels and IgG avidity (an index of antibody-antigen binding strength), and differences in the immune responses between vaccines. Here we performed a prospective pilot study of 71 previously COVID-19 free subjects upon receiving both doses of either the Pfizer (n = 54) or Moderna (n = 17) mRNA vaccine. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies were measured longitudinally using a qualitative finger stick MidaSpot rapid test at the point-of-care for initial screening and a quantitative dry blood spot-based pGOLD laboratory test over [~] four months post-vaccination. The average anti-RBD IgG antibody levels peaked at [~] two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine and declined thereafter, while antibody avidity increased, suggesting antibody maturation. Moderna vaccine recipients compared to Pfizer vaccine recipients exhibited higher side effect severity, higher peak anti-RBD IgG antibody levels, and higher avidity up to the 90 days period. Differences in antibody levels diminished at [~] 120 days post-vaccination, in line with the similar efficacy observed in the two vaccines. The MidaSpot rapid test detected 100% anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD positivity for fully vaccinated subjects in both Pfizer and Moderna cohorts post full vaccination but turned negative greater than 90 days post-vaccination for 5.4% of subjects in the Pfizer cohort, whose quantitative anti-IgG were near the minimum levels of the group. Immune responses were found to vary greatly among vaccinees.

Ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent material was used to track the simulated contact contamination, with analysis undertaken using established image registration techniques of UV photographs. This was repeated for three separate sets of PPE. RESULTS: All three PPE sets showed similar performance in protecting against contamination transfer. For teams not utilising coveralls, this was dependent upon effective cleansing as part of doffing. There were similar patterns of contamination for restraint team members assigned to specific roles, with hands and upper torso appearing to be higher-risk areas. The restraint-related contamination was 23 times higher than that observed for physical observations. DISCUSSION: A second layer of clothing that can be removed showed efficacy in reducing contact contamination. PPE fit to individual is important. Post-restraint cleansing procedures are currently inadequate, with new procedures for face and neck cleansing required. These findings leave scope for staff to potentially improve their appearance when donning PPE and engaging with distressed patients.","Dix, Roland; Straiton, David; Metherall, Peter; Laidlaw, James; McLean, Lisa; Hayward, Andy; Ginger, Gary; Forrester, Louise; O039,; Rourke, Paul; Jefferies, Rob",Med Sci Law,,504
296649,International public health responses to COVID-19 outbreak: A rapid review,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Millions of biospecimens will be collected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), proper biospecimen handling is necessary to prevent laboratory-related infections. METHODS: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interim biosafety guidelines continue to be updated. Presented here are additional considerations intended to complement the interim guidance. These considerations draw on prior SARS recommendations and recent COVID-19 reports. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in various biospecimen types; however, studies are needed to determine whether viral load indicates viable virus. Throughout the pandemic, biospecimens will be collected for various purposes from COVID-19 known and suspected cases, as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Current data suggest the pandemic start may be as early as October 2019; thus, all biospecimens collected since could be considered potentially infectious. CONCLUSIONS: All entities handling these biospecimens should do risk assessments in accordance with institutional policies and adhere to any guidance provided. The scientific community has a responsibility to safely handle and maintain all biospecimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon, it will be imperative to convene expert working groups to address the current and long-term storage and use of these biospecimens. Ideally, worldwide guidelines will be established to protect the personnel handling these biospecimens and communities at large.","Lankes, Heather A; Makhlouf, Hala",Am. j. clin. pathol,,504

PURPOSE: To describe the study design and methodology of the Manhattan Vision Screening and Follow-up Study in Vulnerable Populations, which aims to investigate whether community-based vision screenings can improve detection and management of glaucoma, vision impairment, cataract, and other eye diseases among vulnerable populations living in affordable housing developments in upper Manhattan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 5-year prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled trial consists of vision screening and referral for follow-up eye care among eligible residents aged 40 and older. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus photography are measured. Participants with visual worse than 20/40, or IOP 23 to 29 mm Hg, or unreadable fundus images fail the screening and are scheduled with the on-site optometrist. Those with an abnormal image and/or IOP &#8805;30 mm Hg, are assigned as ""fast-track"" and referred to ophthalmology. Participants living in 7 developments randomized to the Enhanced Intervention Group who fail the screening and need vision correction receive complimentary eyeglasses. Those referred to ophthalmology receive enhanced support with patient navigators to assist with follow-up eye care. Participants living in 3 developments randomized to the Usual Care Group who fail the screening and need vision correction are given an eyeglasses prescription only and a list of optical shops. No enhanced support is given to the Usual Care Group. All participants referred to ophthalmology are assisted in making their initial eye exam appointment. CONCLUSION: This study targets vulnerable populations where they live to ensure improved access to and utilization of eye care services in those who are least likely to seek eye care.","Hark, Lisa A; Kresch, Yocheved S; De Moraes, Carlos Gustavo; Horowitz, Jason D; Park, Lisa; Auran, James D; Gorroochurn, Prakash; Stempel, Stella; Maruri, Stefania C; Stidham, Elizabeth M; Banks, Aisha Z; Saaddine, Jinan B; Lambert, Bianca C; Pizzi, Laura T; Sapru, Saloni; Price, Simani; Williams, Olajide A; Cioffi, George A; Liebmann, Jeffrey M",J Glaucoma,,504

METHODS: From 17 January 2020 to 8 March 2020, a total of 27 patients with TAAD were operated on in 8 cardiovascular surgery centres in Hubei Province (COVID-19 group). The data from 91 patients with TAAD from the same centres during the same period last year were extracted from the Hubei Cardiac Surgery Registration System (control group). A propensity score matched subgroup of 26 pairs (1:2) was identified. Perioperative data and short-term outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Nine patients in the COVID-19 group were categorized as suspicious for the disease (9/27, 33.3%), and others were excluded (18/27, 66.7%). No one was laboratory confirmed preoperatively. The average waiting, cross-clamp and circulatory arrest times were longer in the COVID-19 group (22.9 ± 8.3 vs 9.7 ± 4.0 h, P < 0.001; 135 ± 36 vs 103 ± 45 min, P = 0.003; 24 ± 9 vs 17 ± 8 min, P < 0.001, respectively). The 30-day or in-hospital deaths were 3.8% in both groups (P = 1.0). The COVID-19 group was associated with longer ventilation and intensive care unit times (81 ± 71 vs 45 ± 19 h, P < 0.001; 7.4 ± 3.8 vs 4.5 ± 2.7 days; P < 0.001, respectively). There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in the incidence of complications such as stroke, neurological deficit, acute kidney injury, pulmonary infection and reoperation. Serum antibody tests for those patients showed 7 out of 9 suspected cases were Immunoglobulin G positive. No cross-infection occurred in other patients or associated medical staff. CONCLUSIONS: With adequate preparation and appropriate protection, satisfactory early outcomes can be achieved after emergency operations for patients with TAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hu, Xingjian; Wang, Yin; Liu, Junwei; Qiu, Xuefeng; Liu, Xiaobin; Jiang, Xionggang; Huang, Xiaofan; Feng, Xianqing; Zhang, Yulin; Zhang, Songlin; Qian, Haiyun; Liu, Wei; Zhang, Jun; Dong, Jiashou; Chen, Jiajun; Xia, Jiahong; Dong, Nianguo; Wu, Long",Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,,504

Often, they are accompanied by right-sided endocarditis. We present an uncommon case of sepsis with pulmonary emboli without endocarditis and complicated by Lemierre's syndrome. Case-A 30-year-old man presented with five days of high fevers, dyspnea, sore throat, nonproductive cough, polyarthralgia, and myalgias. He worked as a butcher, had no sick contacts or recent travel, was a nonsmoker, did not vape or use illicit drugs, and had no rash. He was febrile at 102°F, tachycardic, hypotensive, tachypneic, and hypoxic to 84% on room air. The examination was notable for bilaterally decreased breath sounds and no murmurs were heard. Investigations revealed leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lactic acidosis, elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein), and transaminases. Initial chest-Xray (CXR) revealed prominent interstitial markings (Fig-1A). Oxygen supplementation by high flow nasal cannula and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. COVID-19 testing was negative twice. Blood cultures grew group-C beta-hemolytic streptococci (GCS), and follow-up CXR (Fig-1B) and computed tomogram (CT) thorax (Fig-1C) were concerning for pulmonary septic emboli along with bilateral consolidations. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were negative for vegetations. The antibiotic regimen was modified according to sensitivity. Further patient interview revealed that he was handling meat with an open, deep finger wound a month ago. Due to persistent left-sided neck pain, a CT neck was performed revealing left sided internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis (Fig-1D). Hence, anaerobic antibiotic coverage was added considering Lemierre's syndrome. Further, bilateral upper extremity deep and superficial venous thrombi were detected and the patient was started on therapeutic anticoagulation. Hypercoagulability workup was concerning for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome with a positive anti-cardiolipin antibody screen. A follow-up CT thorax revealed numerous bilateral septic emboli, with some cavitating (Fig-1E). The patient improved over the next week and was slowly weaned off supplemental oxygen. He was discharged home on Coumadin and completed four weeks of antibiotics. He was doing well at his follow-up. Discussion-Invasive disease due to GCS is uncommon, with an incidence of 4%-6%. Occasionally, they have been implicated for septicemia in meat handlers and with exposure to animals. GCS bacteremia can result in multiple system involvement, presenting with symptomatology like our patient. Beta-lactam antibiotics remain an effective treatment. Lemierre's syndrome is rare, and commonly associated with pharyngitis and anaerobes, though rarely, septic emboli and streptococci have been implicated.","Mukherjee, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,504

The methodological endeavor was based on two advanced econometric techniques, namely, structural equation modelling and network analysis through Gaussian graphical models, applied for each group of EU countries, analyzed during the period of 1995-2017. The main results revealed significant differentiation among the new and old EU countries as follows: public health support was found to have a positive impact on healthy aging and well-being of older people, on other social determinants, and on people's perceived good and very good health; overall, significant influences were revealed in terms of the aging dimensions. The main implications of our findings relate to other researchers as a baseline comparison with the existing situation before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, but also to policymakers that have to rethink the public health allocations, both in old and new EU member states, in order to endorse the aging credentials, underpinning a successful and healthy integration of the elderly within all life dimensions.","Cristea, Mirela; Noja, Gratiela Georgiana; Jurcut, Cecilia-Nicoleta; Ponea, Constantin Stefan; Caragiani, Elena Sorina; Istodor, Alin Viorel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,504

303065,Intimate Partner Violence and its Mental Health Implications Amid COVID-19 Lockdown: Findings Among Nigerian Couples,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies reported a high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but detailed data about clinical characteristics, risk factors of these patients and prognostic role of PE are still lacking. We aim to evaluate the occurrence of pulmonary embolism among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to describe their risk factors, clinical characteristics, and in-hospital clinical outcomes. METHODS: This is a multicenter Italian study including 333 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to seven hospitals from February 22 to May 15, 2020. All the patients underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for PE detection. In particular, CTPA was performed in case of inadequate response to high-flow oxygen therapy (Fi02&#8805;0.4 to maintain Sp02&#8805;92%), elevated D-dimer (>0.5µg/mL), or echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Among 333 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and undergoing CTPA, PE was detected in 109 (33%) cases. At CTPA, subsegmental, segmental, lobar and central thrombi were detected in 31 (29%), 50 (46%), 20 (18%) and 8 (7%) cases, respectively. In-hospital death occurred in 29 (27%) patients in the PE-group and in 47 (21%) patients in the non-PE group (p = 0.25). Patients in PE-group had a low rate of traditional risk factors and deep vein thrombosis was detected in 29% of patients undergoing compression ultrasonography. In 71% of cases with documented PE, the thrombotic lesions were located in the correspondence of parenchymal consolidation areas. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a low rate of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, PE is present in about 1 out 3 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia undergoing CTPA for inadequate response to oxygen therapy, elevated D-dimer level, or echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction. In most of the cases, the thromboses were located distally in the pulmonary tree and were mainly confined within pneumonia areas.","Loffi, Marco; Regazzoni, Valentina; Toselli, Marco; Cereda, Alberto; Palmisano, Anna; Vignale, Davide; Moroni, Francesco; Pontone, Gianluca; Andreini, Daniele; Mancini, Elisabetta Maria; Monello, Alberto; Iannopollo, Gianmarco; Casella, Gianni; Monetti, Francesco; Monti, Lorenzo; Ferrillo, Giuseppe; Liccardo, Gaetano; Tonet, Elisabetta; Zucchetti, Ottavio; Cossu, Alberto; Dugo, Marco; Patelli, Gianluigi; Sergio, Pietro; Esposito, Antonio; Colombo, Antonio; Giannini, Francesco; Piccolo, Raffaele; Danzi, Gian Battista",PLoS One,,504
303206,Incidence of psychological illness after coronavirus outbreak: a meta-analysis study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a group of infectious diseases caused by related viruses called coronaviruses. In humans, the seriousness of infection caused by a coronavirus in the respiratory tract can vary from mild to lethal. A serious illness can be developed in old people and those with underlying medical problems like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease. For the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease, due to the growing number of cases, a limited number of test kits for COVID-19 are available in the hospitals. Hence, it is important to implement an automated system as an immediate alternative diagnostic option to pause the spread of COVID-19 in the population. OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a deep learning model for classification of coronavirus infected patient detection using chest X-ray radiographs. METHODS: A fully connected convolutional neural network model is developed to classify healthy and diseased X-ray radiographs. The proposed neural network model consists of seven convolutional layers with rectified linear unit, softmax (last layer) activation functions and max pooling layers which were trained using the publicly available COVID-19 dataset. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For validation of the proposed model, the publicly available chest X-ray radiograph dataset consisting COVID-19 and normal patient's images were used. Considering the performance of the results that are evaluated based on various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, MSE, RMSE & accuracy, it is seen that the accuracy of the proposed CNN model is 98.07%.","Rao, P Srinivasa; Bheemavarapu, Pradeep; Kalyampudi, P S Latha; Rao, T V Madhusudhana",,,504

The receptor binding domain of the spike protein of this coronavirus has multiple neutralizing epitopes and is associated with viral entry. Here we have designed and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein fragment 330-526 as receptor binding domain 330-526 (RBD330-526) with two native glycosylation sites (N331 and N343); as a potential subunit vaccine candidate. We initially characterized RBD330-526 biochemically and investigated its thermal stability, humoral and T cell immune response of various RBD protein formulations (with or without adjuvant) to evaluate the inherent immunogenicity and immunomodulatory effect. Our result showed that the purified RBD immunogen is stable up to 72 h, without any apparent loss in affinity or specificity of interaction with the ACE2 receptor. Upon immunization in mice, RBD generates a high titer humoral response, elevated IFN-Î³ producing CD4+ cells, cytotoxic T cells, and robust neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our results collectively support the potential of RBD330-526 as a promising vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.","Shrivastava, Tripti; Singh, Balwant; Rizvi, Zaigham Abbas; Verma, Rohit; Goswami, Sandeep; Vishwakarma, Preeti; Jakhar, Kamini; Sonar, Sudipta; Mani, Shailendra; Bhattacharyya, Sankar; Awasthi, Amit; Surjit, Milan",Front Immunol,,504
303436,COVID-19 and internship opportunities at health organizations in Saudi Arabia,2020,"This review is aimed at evaluating whether radiation therapy (RT) can be omitted in older adult early-stage low-risk breast cancer (BC) patients. The published data are particularly relevant at present, during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, to define a treatment strategy and to prioritize essential therapy. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMED were systematically researched from outset through April 2020 using Mesh terms. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT), with one arm without adjuvant whole-breast irradiation (WBI), were included in the analysis. Recent literature regarding the COVID pandemic and BC RT was assessed. The reported RCTs identified a group of BC patients (pT1-2N0M0 R0, grade 1-2, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative tumours) in which the absolute risk of local recurrence (LR) was considered low enough to omit RT. The most common risk factors were tumor diameter, nodal and receptor status. Adjuvant RT had a significant impact on LR but not on distant metastasis (DM) or death. During the COVID 19 pandemic, results from RTCs were re-considered to define treatment recommendations for BC patients. International scientific societies and radiation oncology experts suggested RT omission, whenever possible, in older adult early-stage BC patients. Adjuvant RT might be omitted in a highly selected group of older adult early-stage BC patients with favourable prognostic factors. Hypofractionated regimens should be the standard. RT omission, partial breast irradiation (PBI), and ultra- hypofractionated regimens could be considered in selected cases due to the pandemic.","Palumbo, Isabella; Borghesi, Simona; Gregucci, Fabiana; Falivene, Sara; Fontana, Antonella; Aristei, Cynthia; Ciabattoni, Antonella",Journal of geriatric oncology,,504
303757,Online Mindfulness May Target Psychological Distress and Mental Health during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the world. In theory, tocilizumab and favipiravir are considered to be reliable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicenter trial in adults with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to a 14-day combination of favipiravir combined with tocilizumab (combination group), favipiravir, and tocilizumab. The primary outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination indicated absorption of lung inflammation). RESULTS: Between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020, 26 patients were recruited; 14 were randomly assigned to the combination group, 7 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 5 were assigned to the tocilizumab group. The cumulative lung lesion remission rate at day 14 was significantly higher in combination group as compared with favipiravir group (P = 0.019, HR 2.66 95 % CI [1.08-6.53]). And there was also a significant difference between tocilizumab and favipivavir (P = 0.034, HR 3.16, 95 % CI 0.62-16.10). In addition, there was no significant difference between the combination group and the tocilizumab group (P = 0.575, HR 1.28 95 %CI 0.39-4.23). Furthermore, combined therapy can also significantly relieve clinical symptoms and help blood routine to return to normal. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab combined with or without favipiravir can effectively improve the pulmonary inflammation of COVID-19 patients and inhibit the deterioration of the disease.","Zhao, Hong; Zhu, Qi; Zhang, Chi; Li, Jiawen; Wei, Ming; Qin, Yuhong; Chen, Guilin; Wang, Ke; Yu, Junhua; Wu, Zhao; Chen, Xianxiang; Wang, Guiqiang",Biomed Pharmacother,,504
304522,Proactive and Comprehensive Community Health Actions to Fight the COVID-19 Epidemic: Initial Lessons from Vietnam,2020,"Purpose of Review: COVID-19 is a major concern for the health and wellbeing of individuals worldwide. As COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to increase in the USA, aging Black and Hispanic populations have emerged as especially at-risk for increased exposure to COVID-19 and susceptibility to severe health outcomes. The current review discusses the weathering hypothesis and the influence of social inequality on the identified health disparities. Recent Findings: Aging minoritized populations have endured structural and social inequality over the lifecourse. Consequently, these populations experience weathering, a process that results in physiological dysregulation due to stress associated with persistent disadvantage. Through weathering and continued inequity, aging minoritized populations have an increased risk of exposure and poor health outcomes from COVID-19. Summary: Current literature and available data suggests that aging minoritized persons experience high rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The current review hypothesizes and supports that observed disparities are the result of inequalities that especially affect Black and Hispanic populations over the lifecourse. Future efforts to address these disparities should emphasize research that supports governments in identifying at-risk groups, providing accessible COVID-19-related information to those groups, and implementing policy that addresses the structural and social inequities that perpetuate current COVID-19 disparities.","Walubita, Tubanji; Beccia, Ariel; Boama-Nyarko, Esther; Goulding, Melissa; Herbert, Carly; Kloppenburg, Jessica; Mabry, Guadalupe; Masters, Grace; McCullers, Asli; Forrester, Sarah",Curr Epidemiol Rep,,504

In an attempt to decipher how kidneys are affected by COVID-19 infection, this review focuses on pathogenic and clinical links between COVID-19 infection and the kidneys. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are target for kidney affection, renal tropism, among other multiorgan complications. COVID-19 related kidney affection is reported not only in infected chronic kidney disease patients but also in those with no prior history of kidney disease. As nephrologists try to keep up with the rapidly evolving, sometimes hasty, reports on renal affection in COVID-19, kidneys continue to be deleteriously affected particularly in critical care settings. This review aims to briefly portray renal involvement in COVID-19 amid this unprecedented deluge of scientific data. Based on gained knowledge and expertise, it is prudent to develop and regularly update preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcome and reduce mortality.","Soliman, Neveen A",J Infect Public Health,,504
305347,Evaluation of a Short-Term Digital Group Intervention to Relieve Mental Distress and Promote Well-Being Among Community-Dwelling Older Individuals During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Study Protocol,2021,"Contact tracing is a very effective way to control the COVID-19-like pandemics. It aims to identify individuals who closely contacted an infected person during the incubation period of the virus and notify them to quarantine. However, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and efficiency issues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of depending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health authorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using Blockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of failure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all transactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is important, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike most of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system consists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public places access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control subsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent spreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based on the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones. Our analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy of the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking attacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system (which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation, and storage overheads.","Alansar, Seham A.; Badr, Mahmoud M.; Mahmoud, Mohamed; Alasmary, Waleed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02263v1.pdf,504

To exercise sovereignty is to exercise control over mortality and to define life as the deployment and manifestation of power' (Mbembe, 2003. Necropolitics. Public Culture, 15(1), 11-40. https://doi.org/10.1215/08992363-15-1-11). For Mbembe a key question is 'under what practical conditions is the right to kill, to allow to live, or to expose to death exercised?' (Mbembe, 2003. Necropolitics. Public Culture, 15(1), 11-40. https://doi.org/10.1215/08992363-15-1-11).

In this context, autopsies are important to confirm the disease, determine associated conditions, and study the pathophysiology of this novel disease. The aim of this study was to assess the systemic involvement of COVID-19. In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy (MIA-US), and we present the results of 10 initial autopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used MIA-US for tissue sampling of the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA. All patients showed exudative/proliferative diffuse alveolar damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients, and all patients showed a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in the glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection, such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis, and orchitis. CONCLUSIONS: MIA-US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease causing major events in the lungs and with involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes result from severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena. These findings indicate that both epithelial and vascular injury should be addressed in therapeutic approaches.","Duarte-Neto, Amaro N; Monteiro, Renata A A; da Silva, Luiz F F; Malheiros, Denise M A C; de Oliveira, Ellen P; Theodoro-Filho, Jair; Pinho, João R R; Gomes-Gouvêa, Michele S; Salles, Ana P M; de Oliveira, Ilka R S; Mauad, Thais; Saldiva, Paulo H N; Dolhnikoff, Marisa",Histopathology,,504

The present study investigated the modulation of T-helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation by the miR-21/Smad7/TGF-ß pathway, and their roles in COPD. Lung tissues were obtained from lung cancer patients with or without COPD who underwent lobotomy and the levels of miR-21, TGF-ß/Smad signaling molecules, RORÎ³T, and other Th17-related cytokines were detected. Mouse COPD models were built by exposing both wild-type (WT) and miR-21-/- mice to cigarette smoke (CS) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) intraperitoneal injection. Isolated primary CD4+ T cells were treated with either CS extract, miR-21 mimics or inhibitors, followed by measuring Th17 cells markers and the expression of TGF-ß/Smad signaling molecules and RORÎ³T. Increased levels of miR-21, Smad7, phosphorylated (p)-Smad2, p-Smad3, TGF-ß, and Th17-related cytokines was detected in the lungs of COPD patients. Lung function in modeled WT mice, but not miR-21-/- ones, deteriorated and the number of inflammatory cells in the lung tissues increased compared to the control WT-mice. Moreover, primary CD4+ lymphocytes tend to differentiate into Th17 cells after the treatment with CSE or miR-21 mimics, and the expression of RORÎ³T and the TGF-ß/Smad signaling were all increased, however miR-21 inhibitors worked reversely. Our findings demonstrated that Th17 cells increased under COPD pathogenesis and was partially modulated by the miR-21/Smad7/TGF-ß pathway.","He, Shengyang; Sun, Shenghua; Lu, Junjuan; Chen, Lili; Mei, Xiang; Li, Liqiu; Zeng, Zhengpeng; Zhong, Mubin; Xie, Lihua",Sci Rep,,504

METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to a group of patients with MS who consulted at the MS unit of Vithas hospital (DINAC Foundation) in Seville, and patients with MS attended in several provinces of China in April 2020, with the aim of analysing the differences and similarities between populations in the social and professional effects of confinement. To this end, a database was created and subsequently analysed. RESULTS: The Chinese population includes a higher proportion of younger patients and no differences were identified regarding sex. Most of the variables studied behaved in the same way in both patient populations. Spanish patients presented a lesser impact (30.7%) on their socio-economic situation than Chinese patients (44%) (P < .05). There were no significant differences between populations in the remaining variables. Social networks were widely used in the majority of patients from both populations. CONCLUSIONS: The social and professional consequences of the pandemic were very similar in both groups; the use of social networks and family support was also similar. Spanish patients seem to present greater economic stability, perhaps due to the social support they receive.","Zhang, G X; Sanabria, C; Martínez, D; Zhang, W T; Gao, S S; Alemán, A; Granja, A; Páramo, C; Borges, M; Izquierdo, G","Neurologia (Barc., Ed. impr.)",,504

The high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 and the lack of an approved drug or vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 underscores the urgent need for developing effective antiviral therapies. Therapeutics that target essential viral proteins are effective at controlling virus replication and spread. Coronavirus Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and fusion with the host cell, and thus are essential for viral replication. To enter host cells, the Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus, SARS-CoV, bind the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through their receptor binding domains (RBDs). Here, we rationally designed a panel of ACE2-derived peptides based on the RBD-ACE2 binding interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Using SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-pseudotyped viruses, we found that a subset of peptides inhibits Spike-mediated infection with IC50 values in the low millimolar range. We identified two peptides that bound Spike RBD in affinity precipitation assays and inhibited infection with genuine SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these peptides inhibited the replication of a common cold causing coronavirus, which also uses ACE2 as its entry receptor. Results from the infection experiments and modeling of the peptides with Spike RBD identified a 6-amino-acid (Glu37-Gln42) ACE2 motif that is important for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 with peptide-based inhibitors. These findings will allow for the successful development of engineered peptides and peptidomimetic-based compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.","Larue, Ross C; Xing, Enming; Kenney, Adam D; Zhang, Yuexiu; Tuazon, Jasmine A; Li, Jianrong; Yount, Jacob S; Li, Pui-Kai; Sharma, Amit",Bioconjug Chem,,504

Here we highlight a case of TT following COVID-19 infection. A 38-year Myanmar immigrant female presented with nocturnal fever, fatigue, nausea, sore throat, appetite and weight loss for 1 week with dysphagia, neck swelling, dyspnea, and watery diarrhea. Medical history included renal transplant due to ESRD from IgA nephropathy, DM and treated latent TB with no prior or family history of thyroid disease. She had COVID 7 months ago, complicated by allograft rejection. She was tachycardic, febrile but not in acute distress. Neck exam revealed diffuse thyromegaly with tenderness on right lobe without bruit, palpable cervical lymphadenopathy nor tremors. Labs showed WBC 12.8x109/L (4.8-10), and ESR 50 ml/hr (20-40). On admission, she developed AKI and immunosuppressant meds were discontinued. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotic. CT chest reported moderate loculated right pleural effusion with mid and lower lobe consolidation. Blood and urine culture, pleural fluid, sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and QuantiFERON-TB were negative. Upon persistent fever, RIPE therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) was started and stopped after 10 days due to transaminitis and negative TB PCR. Further labs showed TSH 0.04 mIU/ml (0.27-4.2), FT4 2.81 ng/dl (0.93-1.7), TT3 127 ng/dl (80-200), negative TPO and TSI. Endocrinology was consulted for thyroiditis. Ibuprofen and Propranolol were initiated with continuation of prednisone. Repeat thyroid labs normalized in 4 days. US thyroid noted diffuse, heterogenous thyromegaly without hypervascularity or abscess. CT neck showed diffuse thyromegaly 4.2x7.2x7.5 cm in size;right thyroid lobe extended to posterior clavicle with enhanced capsule, without discrete lymph node or vascularity changes, suggestive of thyroiditis. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of left thyroid lobe drained 3 ml purulent fluid and AFB were seen on direct smear. She was diagnosed as TT, but unable to restart RIPE therapy due to worsening liver function. She expired after cardiac arrest due to intracranial bleeding and brain abscess. Thyroid tuberculosis is a rarely reported clinical entity. This is the first reported case of secondary TB (TT) in post-COVID infected patient from reactivation of latent TB. In our case, follicular destruction caused initial hyperthyroidism with later recovery. It can be difficult to distinguish subacute from suppurative thyroiditis due to TB. Imaging may not always show clear abscess formation. FNA is crucial for diagnosis, and drainage of any abscess. Anti-TB meds can be given, surgery is rarely required. TT should be considered in any immunocompromised patient with fever and neck pain. Imaging should also include evaluation for any CNS spread of TB. Early detection and treatment will help reduce significant morbidity and mortality.","Win, Kyaw Zin Hamidi Afshin Sattar Alamgir Karunakaran Abhijana",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,504

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models based on clinical features to assess the risk of severe disease and triage for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with COVID-19 who were released from quarantine until April 30, 2020, in Korea. A total of 5628 patients were included in the training and testing cohorts to train and validate the models that predict clinical severity and the duration of hospitalization, and the clinical severity score was defined at four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. RESULTS: Out of a total of 5601 patients, 4455 (79.5%), 330 (5.9%), 512 (9.1%), and 301 (5.4%) were included in the mild, moderate, severe, and critical levels, respectively. As risk factors for predicting critical patients, we selected older age, shortness of breath, a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, a low lymphocyte count, and a low platelet count. We developed 3 prediction models to classify clinical severity levels. For example, the prediction model with 6 variables yielded a predictive power of >0.93 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We developed a web-based nomogram, using these models. CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction models, along with the web-based nomogram, are expected to be useful for the assessment of the onset of severe and critical illness among patients with COVID-19 and triage patients upon hospital admission.","Oh, Bumjo; Hwangbo, Suhyun; Jung, Taeyeong; Min, Kyungha; Lee, Chanhee; Apio, Catherine; Lee, Hyejin; Lee, Seungyeoun; Moon, Min Kyong; Kim, Shin-Woo; Park, Taesung",J Med Internet Res,,504

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a human receptor that facilitates entry of SARS-CoV-2, serves as a prominent target for drug discovery. In the present study, we have applied the bioinformatics approach for screening of a series of bioactive chemical compounds from Himalayan stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) as potent inhibitors of ACE-2 receptor (PDB ID: 1R4L). The molecular docking was applied to dock a set of representative compounds within the active site region of target receptor protein using 0.8 version of the PyRx virtual screen tool and analyzed by using discovery studio visualizer. Based on the highest binding affinity, 23 compounds were shortlisted as a lead molecule using molecular docking analysis. Among them, ß-sitosterol was found with the highest binding affinity - 12.2 kcal/mol and stable interactions with the amino acid residues present on the active site of the ACE-2 receptor. Similarly, luteoxanthin and violaxanthin followed by rutin also displayed stronger binding efficiency. We propose these compounds as potential lead candidates for the development of target-specific therapeutic drugs against COVID-19.","Upreti, Shobha; Prusty, Jyoti Sankar; Pandey, Satish Chandra; Kumar, Awanish; Samant, Mukesh",Mol. divers,,504

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between acute and chronic TV (hours/week) and reported injury (yes/no) and evaluate the relationship between acuteâ:âchronic TV and injury while controlling for sex, age, and prior injury in young athletes. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Online surveys. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Middle school-aged adolescents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We conducted a baseline survey at the start of the 2017-2018 academic year. The baseline survey solicited information regarding demographics, injury history, and primary sport. Subsequent surveys were delivered electronically at the start of each week. Information obtained with the weekly survey included weekly TV and injuries sustained the previous week. Injuries were reported and classified (eg, acute or gradual onset) by the participants. Weekly TV was aggregated as rolling averages over the prior 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Acute:chronic TV was calculated for each participant for every week as the prior week TV divided by the TV during the prior 2 (1â:â2), 3 (1â:â3), and 4 (1â:â4) weeks of the study period. RESULTS: A total of 244 recruits participated. Higher average TV over the prior 4 weeks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93, 1.00; P = .05) was associated with fewer reported injuries. Additionally, higher average TV over the prior 2 (OR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.93, 0.99; P = .04), 3 (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.91, 0.99; P = .02), and 4 (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.91, 0.99; P = .05) weeks was associated with fewer reported acute injuries the following week. Acute:chronic TV and any injury type were not related.

Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n =12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to pseudovirus neutralizing antibody measurements. FINDINGS: A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r = 0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks' follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling revealed faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti-NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%). INTERPRETATION: Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with heterogeneous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. In mild infection, anti-S1 serology alone may underestimate incident infections.

319363,Clinical Adjustments During COVID-19 for Outpatient Substance Use Treatment in a Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 serology is used to identify prior infection at individual and at population level. Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n =12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to pseudovirus neutralizing antibody measurements. FINDINGS: A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r = 0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks' follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative.

322437,Health-system pharmacists discuss racial disparities in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to decreases in neuroimaging volume. Our aim was to quantify the change in acute or subacute ischemic strokes detected on CT or MR imaging during the pandemic using natural language processing of radiology reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 32,555 radiology reports from brain CTs and MRIs from a comprehensive stroke center, performed from March 1 to April 30 each year from 2017 to 2020, involving 20,414 unique patients. To detect acute or subacute ischemic stroke in free-text reports, we trained a random forest natural language processing classifier using 1987 randomly sampled radiology reports with manual annotation. Natural language processing classifier generalizability was evaluated using 1974 imaging reports from an external dataset. RESULTS: The natural language processing classifier achieved a 5-fold cross-validation classification accuracy of 0.97 and an F1 score of 0.74, with a slight underestimation (-5%) of actual numbers of acute or subacute ischemic strokes in cross-validation. Importantly, cross-validation performance stratified by year was similar. Applying the classifier to the complete study cohort, we found an estimated 24% decrease in patients with acute or subacute ischemic strokes reported on CT or MR imaging from March to April 2020 compared with the average from those months in 2017-2019. Among patients with stroke-related order indications, the estimated proportion who underwent neuroimaging with acute or subacute ischemic stroke detection significantly increased from 16% during 2017-2019 to 21% in 2020 (P = .01). The natural language processing classifier performed worse on external data. CONCLUSIONS: Acute or subacute ischemic stroke cases detected by neuroimaging decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a higher proportion of studies ordered for stroke were positive for acute or subacute ischemic strokes. Natural language processing approaches can help automatically track acute or subacute ischemic stroke numbers for epidemiologic studies, though local classifier training is important due to radiologist reporting style differences.","Li, M D; Lang, M; Deng, F; Chang, K; Buch, K; Rincon, S; Mehan, W A; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Kalpathy-Cramer, J",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,504
323224,Mental Health and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Hardiness and Meaningfulness Reduce Negative Effects on Psychological Well-Being,2020,"The current COVID-19 pandemia affects health care systems worldwide, however, to a variable extent depending on the caseload in each country. We aimed to provide a cross-sectional overview of current limitations or adaptions in lung transplant programs in Germany in from January to May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A cross-sectional survey assessing various aspects of lung transplant activity was sent to all active lung transplant programs (n = 12) in Germany. Eight centers (66%) responded to the survey within the requested time frame. Four centers (50%) reported their activity is not restricted at all and four centers (50%) reported on moderate general limitations. The overall lung transplant activity in Germany from January to May 2020 contains 128 bilateral and 11 single lung transplantations, which is similar to the same period in the year 2019 (126 bilateral transplantations and 12 single lung transplantations). The results suggest that the influence of the COVID-19 pandemia on lung transplantation activity in Germany has been moderate so far. Nevertheless, adaptions such as extensive testing of donors and recipients were introduced to reduce the likelihood of infections and increase patient safety. Alertness to changes in COVID-19 reproduction rates might be required until effective antiviral therapy or vaccination is available.","Michel, Sebastian; Witt, Christian; Gottlieb, Jens; Aigner, Clemens",Thorac. cardiovasc. surg,,504
323280,Supporting people leaving prisons during COVID-19: perspectives from peer health mentors,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented global public health crisis, and governments have implemented various responses with varying degrees of effectiveness. South Korea’s approach, which has involved minimal lockdown in order to “flatten the curve”, and which offers an alternative for many democracies, has attracted much attention. Based on in-depth interviews with public health professionals and policy advisors in government agencies, this article analyses how well South Korea’s response to COVID-19 complies with the expectations of good governance, and assesses the strengths and challenges of the Korean model. Our analysis shows that South Korea has been reactive rather than preventive/passive amid waves of clusters such as outbreaks in nightclubs, e-commerce warehouses, schools, hospitals and religious gatherings. The government has used a range of countermeasures, including contact tracing, diagnostic testing, media briefings and text alerts. At the same time, the challenges for the Korean approach have been concerns about privacy, fatigue over emergency alerts and politicisation.","Kim, Min-Hyu; Cho, Wonhyuk; Choi, Hemin; Hur, Joon-Young",Asian Stud.

These strains, isolated from faeces of animals living in captivity at the zoological garden of Lille (France), are Escherichia coli ICVB443, Enterococcus faecalis ICVB501 and Pediococcus pentosaceus ICVB491. Their genomes have been analysed and compared to those of their pathogenic or probiotic counterparts. The genome analyses of E. coli ICVB443 and Ent. faecalis ICVB501 displayed similarities to those of probiotics E. coli 1917 Nissle, and Ent. faecalis Symbioflor 1, respectively. Furthermore, E. coli ICVB443 shares at least 89 genes with the enteroaggregative E. coli 55989 (EAEC), and Ent. faecalis ICVB501 shares at least 315 genes with the pathogenic Ent. faecalis V583 strain. Unlike Ped. pentosaceus ICVB491, which is devoid of virulence genes, E. coli ICVB443 and Ent. faecalis ICVB501 both carry genes encoding virulence factors on their genomes. Of note, the bioinformatics analysis of these two genomes located the bsh gene, which codes for bile salt hydrolase (BSH). The presence of BSH is of major importance, as it can help to increase the viability of these two strains in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The genome analysis of Ped. pentosaceus ICVB491 confirmed its GRAS status (Generally Recognised As Safe), as no genomic virulence factor determinant was found.","Eveno, Mégane; Belguesmia, Yanath; Bazinet, Laurent; Gancel, Frédérique; Fliss, Ismail; Drider, Djamel",Arch. microbiol,,504
324275,COVID-19 as Eco-Pandemic Injustice: Opportunities for Collective and Antiracist Approaches to Environmental Health,2021,"BACKGROUND: Conflicting reports have emerged for rates of preterm births and stillbirths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of these reports did not account for natural variation in these rates. We aimed to evaluate variations in preterm birth and stillbirth rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked population health administrative databases of pregnant people giving birth in any hospital in Ontario between July 2002 and December 2020. We calculated preterm birth and stillbirth rates. We assessed preterm birth at 22-28, 29-32 and 33-36 weeks' gestation, and stillbirths at term and preterm gestation. We used Laney control P' charts for the 18-year study period (6-mo observation periods) and interrupted time-series analyses for monthly rates for the most recent 4 years. RESULTS: We evaluated 2 465 387 pregnancies, including 13 781 that resulted in stillbirth. The mean preterm birth rate for our cohort was 7.96% (range 7.32%-8.59%). From January to December 2020, we determined that the preterm birth rate in Ontario was 7.87%, with no special cause variation. The mean stillbirth rate for the cohort was 0.56% (range 0.48%-0.70%). From January to December 2020, the stillbirth rate was 0.53%, with no special cause variation. We did not find any special cause variation for preterm birth or stillbirth subgroups. We found no changes in slope or gap between prepandemic and pandemic periods using interrupted time-series analyses. INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, Canada, we found no special cause variation (unusual change) in preterm birth or stillbirth rates, overall or by subgroups, during the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous 17.5 years.","Shah, Prakesh S; Ye, Xiang Y; Yang, Jie; Campitelli, Michael A",CMAJ,,504
324760,Lessons from the mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic: A blueprint to reform CDC,2021,"Protection against renal fibrosis is important for the management of obstructive nephropathy. We researched the roles and possible mechanism of miR-155-5p in renal interstitial fibrosis, which may provide a potential endogenous target for renal interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy. Herein, NRK-49F cells were transfected with miR-155-5p mimic, miR-155-5p inhibitor, SIRT1 plasmid and/or SIRT1 siRNA. The unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was built with male C57 black mice and administrated with SRT1720 by tail vein injection. Levels of miR-155-5p, SIRT1 and relative proteins (TGF-ß1, &#945;-SMA, Collage I and fibronectin) in NRK-49F cells or mice kidney tissues were measured with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. The target gene of miR-155-5p was analyzed through TargetScan and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Mice kidney tissue was stained with Masson trichrome. It was found that miR-155-5p overexpression promoted the expressions of fibroblast related proteins expression and inhibited the SIRT1 expression in NRK-49F cells, while miR-155-5p silencing had an opposite effect. SIRT1 can bind with miR-155-5p. MiR-155-5p inhibited the level of SIRT1. Fibroblast related proteins were up-regulated by miR-155-5p and down-regulated by SIRT1 in NRK-49F cells, while the up-regulatory effect of miR-155-5p was reversed by SIRT1. MiR-155-5p expression was up-regulated and SIRT1 expression was down-regulated in the kidney tissue of UUO mice. SRT1720 attenuated the fiber deposition, up-regulated SIRT1 level and down-regulated the levels of fibroblast related proteins in UUO model mice. To conclude, miR-155-5p promotes renal interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy via inhibiting SIRT1 signaling pathway.","Wang, Zhan; Chen, Rui; Xu, Zheming; Ru, Wei; Tian, Hongjuan; Yang, Fan; Tao, Chang",J Recept Signal Transduct Res,,504

We retrospectively analysed a short prospective series of 23 ileo- or colostomized patients referring to a single coloproctology out-patient clinic. Patients were followed up using TM from March 3rd to April 5th 2020, when local and national policy postponed any non-emergent and non-oncologic in-patient visit to a future date. Seventeen patients were eligible for observation. Tele-consulted patients were overall satisfied, with 14 of them choosing TM as their first option for a future consultation. All medical staff gave a positive feedback about TM project. The use of TM in stoma care was easily feasible in an emergent global context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported experience of remote stoma care services during COVID-19 pandemic. The next challenge is to turn emergent actions into daily outpatient practice.","D’Antonio, Dario; Pizza, Francesco; Tropeano, Francesca Paola; De Palma, Giovanni Domenico; Marvaso, Alberto; Luglio, Gaetano",SN Compr.

The concept that stem cell injection may reduce tissue injury or assist its recovery after radiation has been recently argued. Herein, we examined the effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) on radiation-induced skin damage in rats. Methods: This study is an experimental case control study. ASCs were isolated from peri uterine fat tissue of the rats. Then the rats received a 30 Gy single dose radiation to their buttocks skin using gamma radiation. Next day stem cells were transplanted subcutaneously in 16 rats as the case group. A group of 16 rats was considered as control group with radiation but no transplantation of stem cells. Then rats were examined and observed by macroscopic analysis and phenotypic scores during 4 weeks of follow up. Results: The wound size in control group was significantly higher than case group in the second, third and fourth weeks of evaluation (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in skin lesion severity, pathological factors, and the onset of recovery signs between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: It seems that using ASCs alone has not profound effects on reducing radiation-induced cutaneous complications, while combination of these cells with growth factors may produce more promising results.","Khademi, Bijan; Safari, Sima; Mosleh-Shirazi, Mohammad Amin; Mokhtari, Maral; Chenari, Nooshafarin; Razmkhah, Mahboobeh",Stem Cell Investig,,504

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with increased risk of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), however, there is a paucity of data regarding outcomes after administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) for stroke in patients with COVID-19. Design/Methods: We present a multi-center case series from 9 centers in the United States of patients with acute neurological deficits consistent with AIS and COVID-19 who were treated with IV tPA. Results: We identified 13 patients (mean age 62 (±9.8) years, 9 (69.2%) male). All received IV tPA and 3 cases also underwent mechanical thrombectomy. All patients had systemic symptoms consistent with COVID-19 at the time of admission: fever (5 patients), cough (7 patients), and dyspnea (8 patients). The median admission NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score was 14.5 (range 3- 26) and most patients (61.5%) improved at follow up (median NIHSS score 7.5, range 0-25). No systemic or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages were seen. Stroke mechanisms included cardioembolic (3 patients), large artery atherosclerosis (2 patients), small vessel disease (1 patient), embolic stroke of undetermined source (3 patients), and cryptogenic with incomplete investigation (1 patient). Three patients were determined to have transient ischemic attacks or aborted strokes. Two out of 12 (16.6%) patients had elevated fibrinogen levels on admission (mean 262.2 ± 87.5 mg/dl), and 7 out of 11 (63.6%) patients had an elevated D-dimer level (mean 4284.6 ±3368.9 ng/ml).

331368,Coping With COVID-19: Mindfulness-Based Approaches for Mitigating Mental Health Crisis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Several aspects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remain ambiguous, including its transmission, severity, geographic, and racial differences in mortality. These variations merit elaboration of local patterns to inform wider national policies. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, data of patients treated at a dedicated COVID hospital with moderate and severe illness during 8 wk of the pandemic were reviewed with attention to mortality in a competing risks framework. RESULTS: A total of 1147 patients were hospitalized, and 312 (27.2%) died in hospital. Those who died were older (56.5 vs 47.6 y; P < 0.0001). Of these, 885 (77.2%) had tested positive on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with 219 (24.2%) deaths (incidence rate, 1.9 per 100 person-days). Median time from onset of symptoms to death was 11 days. A competing risks analysis for in-hospital death revealed an adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio of 1.4 for each decade increase in age. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis provides broad patterns of disease presentation and mortality. Even COVID test-negative patients will receive treatment at dedicated facilities, and 33% presenting cases may die within the first 72 h, most with comorbid illness. This should be considered while planning distribution of services for effective health-care delivery.","Goel, Ashish; Raizada, Alpana; Agrawal, Ananya; Bansal, Kamakshi; Uniyal, Saurabh; Prasad, Pratima; Yadav, Anil; Tyagi, Asha; Rautela, R S",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,504
334131,Tackling COVID-19 in informal tented settlements (Lebanon): an assessment of preparedness and response plans and their impact on the health vulnerabilities of Syrian refugees,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of transnasal oesophagoscopy (TNO) in cases of suspected upper aerodigestive tract malignancy and define its role as a safe alternative to panendoscopy. We have also analysed if the implementation of TNO during the COVID-19 pandemic was beneficial in order to provide uninterrupted care to the patients with the limited resources available in these challenging times. METHODS: All patients who underwent TNO guided biopsies or dilatation attempted over a 7 month period during COVID- 19 pandemic were included by searching the hospital and department database at The Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. A comparative group of patients who underwent panendoscopy over 9 months were included for comparison. Demographic data, histological diagnosis, second procedure and cost involved were recorded. RESULTS: During this period, 20 TNO procedures (16 biopsies and 4 dilatations) were attempted which were compared with 20 panendoscopy procedures. The diagnostic accuracy of TNO biopsy for identifying benign and malignant pathology was 81.1%. The sensitivity and specificity for identifying malignancy was 76.9% and 100% respectively. The most common lesion location was laryngeal (43.8%) followed by oropharyngeal (37.5%), more specifically located at the tongue base. The median waiting period between the procedure being listed and TNO being performed was 5.5 days compared to 12 days for panendoscopy. There were 12/16 patients who did not require further interventions for histological diagnosis of the tumor. The TNO procedure was well tolerated with no complications and all were done under local anaesthesia as outpatient procedure without need for admission. TNO resulted in cost saving of 356 per case on a standard NHS tariff. CONCLUSION: TNO is a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with suspected UADT malignancy and dysphagia and has proven to be an asset during the COVID-19 pandemic when we have to make the best use of the limited theatre time and resources. Also, the cost analysis showed that outpatient based TNO can provide significant cost savings for the current standard of care. Furthermore, it has shown better patient tolerability, lesser complications and shortened the time for diagnosis and hence starting timely treatment for these patients.","Goyal, M.; McNally, G.; Batra, A.; Izzat, S.; Pothula, V.",Medical Journal of Malaysia,,504

To date there is no data about the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectability period in human bodies after death. The present case documents the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract 35-days after death. Post-mortem swabs could be used as a valuable tool in preventive evaluation of the risks-benefits ratio associated with autopsy execution. SARS-CoV-2 RNA post-mortem detection could have a key diagnostic role in deaths lacking medical assistance, unattended deaths, and patients with multiple comorbidities. Based on the present report, staged post-mortem swabs should be performed even after a long post-mortem interval.","Beltempo, Pasquale; Curti, Serena Maria; Maserati, Renato; Gherardi, Mirella; Castelli, Maurizio",Forensic Sci Int,,504

This may be particularly true of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) and their caregivers - populations already overburdened by intersecting stressors (e.g. psychosocial, biomedical, familial, economic, social, or environmental). Addressing the adverse mental health sequelae of COVID-19 among ALHIV requires a multi-dimensional approach that at once (a) economically empowers ALHIV and their households and (b) trains, mentors, and supervises community members as lay mental health services providers. Mental health literacy programming can also be implemented to increase mental health knowledge, reduce stigma, and improve service use among ALHIV. Schools and HIV care clinics offer ideal environments for increasing mental health literacy and improving access to mental health services.","Okumu, Moses; Nyoni, Thabani; Byansi, William",Glob Public Health,,504

Understanding the multidimensional impacts of this pandemic is crucial to identify the most critical needs and to inform targeted interventions. This population survey study aimed to investigate the acute phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of perceived threats and concerns, occupational and financial impacts, social impacts and stress between 3 April and 15 May 2020. METHODS: 6040 participants are included in this report. A multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with stress changes (as measured by the Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)) relative to pre-outbreak retrospective estimates. RESULTS: On average, PSS scores increased from low stress levels before the outbreak to moderate stress levels during the outbreak (p<0.001). The independent factors associated with stress worsening were: having a mental disorder, female sex, having underage children, heavier alcohol consumption, working with the general public, shorter sleep duration, younger age, less time elapsed since the start of the outbreak, lower stress before the outbreak, worse symptoms that could be linked to COVID-19, lower coping skills, worse obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to germs and contamination, personalities loading on extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism, left wing political views, worse family relationships and spending less time exercising and doing artistic activities. CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional analyses showed a significant increase from low to moderate stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Identified modifiable factors associated with increased stress may be informative for intervention development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 patients with severe COVID-19 disease treated with convalescent plasma transfusion were included in the study. The efficacy of CP and in which situations it was effective were investigated. CONCLUSION: 80 % of the patients recovered, and 20 % died in our study. The mean age of the patients who died was found to be higher than the patients who recovered. CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil, MPV, and NLR counts were found to be higher, and lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower in the deceased group after CP. It was determined that patients who received CP within the first five days were hospitalized for a shorter period. DISCUSSION: Administration of CP transfusion within the first five days in severe COVID-19 patients has been shown to reduce hospital stay length.","Akay Cizmecioglu, Hilal; Goktepe, Mevlut Hakan; Demircioglu, Sinan; Tekinalp, Atakan; Cizmecioglu, Ahmet; Tuna, Ali Kursat; Ozer, Huseyin",Transfus Apher Sci,,504

The objective of this study was to examine the mental health needs of LGBT college students in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We fielded a rapid-response online survey in the spring of 2020. We recruited 477 LGBT-identifying college students aged 18-25 years by contacting LGBT-serving organizations on 254 college campuses and through targeted social media advertising. RESULTS: Nearly half (45.7%) of LGBT college students have immediate families that do not support or know their LGBT identity. Approximately 60% of sampled LGBT college students were experiencing psychological distress, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Health-care providers, college and university administrators, and campus counseling centers should take swift action to ensure that LGBT students receive mental health support during the pandemic.","Gonzales, Gilbert; Loret de Mola, Emilio; Gavulic, Kyle A; McKay, Tara; Purcell, Christopher",J Adolesc Health,,504

350411,The impact of COVID-19 on the hospice and palliative care workforce,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the People's Republic of China in December 2019. Thereafter, a global logarithmic expansion of cases occurred. Some countries have a higher rate of infections despite the early implementation of quarantine. Air pollution might be related to high susceptibility to the virus and associated case fatality rates (deaths/cases*100). Lima, Peru, has the second highest incidence of COVID-19 in Latin America and also has one the highest levels of air pollution in the region. METHODS: This study investigated the association of levels of PM2.5 exposure in previous years (2010-2016) in 24 districts of Lima with cases, deaths and case fatality rates for COVID-19. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate this association controlled by age, sex, population density and number of food markets per district. The study period was from March 6 to June 12, 2020. RESULTS: There were 128,700 cases in Lima and 2382 deaths due to COVID-19. The case fatality rate was 1.93%. Previous exposure to PM2.5 (2010-2016) was associated with the number of COVID-19- cases (ß = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.034-0.107) and deaths (ß = 0.0014; 95% CI: 0.0006-0.0.0023) but not with the case fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for age, sex and number of food markets, the higher rates of COVID-19 in Metropolitan Lima are attributable to the increased PM2.5 exposure in the previous years, among other reasons. Reduction in air pollution from a long-term perspective and social distancing are needed to prevent the spread of virus outbreaks.","Vasquez-Apestegui, Bertha V; Parras-Garrido, Enrique; Tapia, Vilma; Paz-Aparicio, Valeria M; Rojas, Jhojan P; Sanchez-Ccoyllo, Odón R; Gonzales, Gustavo F",BMC Public Health,,504

We applied different standard and nonstandard computational numerical methods for the solution of the stochastic system. The design of a nonstandard computation method for the stochastic system is innovative. Unfortunately, standard computation numerical methods are time-dependent and violate the structure properties of models, such as positivity, boundedness, and dynamical consistency of the stochastic system. To that end, convergence analysis of nonstandard computational methods and simulation with a comparison of standard computational methods are presented.","Shatanawi, Wasfi; Raza, Ali; Arif, Muhammad Shoaib; Abodayeh, Kamaledin; Rafiq, Muhammad; Bibi, Mairaj",Adv.

At this point in time, no vaccine is available to prevent the infection, no effective drugs are available to prevent and treat the disease, and none of the communities have acquired herd immunity. Various models have shown positive impact of social distancing, provided its implementation on vast majority of the population over a long period of time. Its effect is manifold. Besides flattening the curve, it impacts the political, fiscal, social, economic aspects of the society, along with socially vulnerable and economically underprivileged population. It becomes obsolete after the population develops herd immunity subsequent to widespread infection in the community, or after effective mass immunisation or specific drugs for its control, cure and prevention are available widely.","Mal, Piryani Rano; Suneel, Piryani; Shomeeta, Piryani",J Pak Med Assoc,,504

355121,On the question of vulnerability,2020,"INTRODUCTION: There is controversy concerning the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARB) for treating hypertensive patients with Covid-19. It has been hypothesized that these drugs might increase the risk of severe Covid-19, but some authors suggested that blocking the renin-angiotensin system might actually decrease this risk. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all the consecutive hypertensive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a health area. The outcome variable was hospitalization because of severe Covid-19. RESULTS: 539 subjects were diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 157 (29.1%) had hypertension and were included in the study. Sixty-nine cases (43.9%) were hospitalized because of severe Covid-19. In multivariable analysis older age, diabetes and hypertensive myocadiopathy were related to a higher risk of hospital admission. ARB treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization (HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10 - 0.88). A similar albeit not significant trend was observed for ACEI. CONCLUSION: ARB or ACEI treatment was not associated with a worse clinical outcome in consecutive hypertensive patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Golpe, Rafael; Pérez-de-Llano, Luis A; Dacal, David; Guerrero-Sande, Hector; Pombo-Vide, Beatriz; Ventura-Valcárcel, Pablo",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,504

The physical, social, and organizational infrastructure of healthcare systems across the world is being stressed. This pandemic has highlighted that the healthcare of the country is as strong as its weakest link and that no aspect of life, be it social or economic, is spared from this pandemic. The authors would like to highlight some of the lessons learned from Singapores management of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the Singaporean Covid-19 pandemic, public health policy planning was all encompassing in its coverage, involving various stakeholders in government and society. The important role of individuals, governments, industry, and primary healthcare practitioners when tackling COVID-19 are highlighted. Singapores management of the Covid-19 pandemic involved an approach that involved the whole of society, with a particular focus on supporting the vulnerable foreign worker population, which formed the majority of Covid-19 cases in the country. Hopefully amidst the trying times, valuable lessons are learnt that will be etched into medical history and collective memory. We hope to highlight these lessons for future generations, both for members of the public and fellow healthcare practitioners.","Wang, Samuel S Y; Teo, Winnie Z Y",Ann Glob Health,,504
355523,Food Insecurity and Diabetes: The Role of Federally Qualified Health Centers as Pillars of Community Health,2021,"Predictive modeling often uses black box machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks, to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In scientific domains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually important for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly follow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on discoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs enable important features to be discovered with control of the FDR. However, knockoffs require rich generative models capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they obey the so-called""swap""property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs (DDLK), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap property. DDLK consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit likelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint distribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure that the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, DDLK uses the Gumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case swap. We find DDLK has higher power than baselines while controlling the false discovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task involving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.","Sudarshan, Mukund; Tansey, Wesley; Ranganath, Rajesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15835v1.pdf,504

355934,Applying the health justice framework to address health and health care inequities experienced by people with disabilities during and after covid-19,2021,"In this study, an excellent phosphate adsorbent was prepared for removing phosphate to an extremely low concentration. The La(OH)3 nano-rods stabilizing in polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (PLNFs) were prepared by electrospinning and a subsequent in situ precipitation. PAN nanofibers were employed as the matrix of the composite nanofibers, where the well-dispersed La(OH)3 nano-rods were encapsulated as the active species for highly efficient phosphate capture owing to the strong binding between phosphate and lanthanum. On account of the nano-structure, the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity was 151.98 mg P/g (La), much higher than the result of La(OH)3 nano-crystal, produced by precipitation without PAN or any organic surfactants. Moreover, the PLNFs could remove phosphate (2 mg P/L) to an extremely low concentration within 20 min, which could lead to a nutrient deficient condition to protect water quality and ecosystem. The optimization of PLNFs design was implemented through parameter adjustment of electrospinning. Lanthanum salt content, humidity, concentration of solution and applied voltage were chosen to analyze the influences on the composition, diameter and morphology of the nanofibers, giving the result that the most effective adsorbent was the PLNFs with spider-web-like nano-structures.","He, Jiaojie; Yang, Yue; Xu, Yuhong; Wang, Zichuan; Xu, Bing; Huang, Yuheng; Yang, Liwei",Water Sci Technol,,504

We studied the effects of ibuprofen on action potential characteristics and several transmembrane ionic currents using the conventional microelectrode technique and the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique on cardiac preparations and enzymatically isolated ventricular myocytes. In dog (200 µM; n=6) and rabbit (100 µM; n=7) papillary muscles, ibuprofen moderately but significantly prolonged repolarization at 1 Hz stimulation frequency. In dog Purkinje fibers, repolarization was abbreviated, and maximal rate of depolarization was depressed in a frequency-dependent manner. Levofloxacin (40 µM) alone did not alter repolarization, but augmented the ibuprofen-evoked repolarization lengthening in rabbit preparations (n=7). In dog myocytes, ibuprofen (250 µM) did not significantly influence IK1, but decreased the amplitude of Ito and IKr potassium currents by 28.2% (60 mV) and 15.2% (20 mV) respectively. Ibuprofen also depressed INaL and ICa currents by 19.9% and 16.4%. We conclude that ibuprofen seems to be free from effects on AP parameters at lower concentrations. However, at higher concentrations it may alter repolarization reserve, contributing to the observed proarrhythmic risk in patients.","Pászti, Bence József; Prorok, Janos; Magyar, Tibor; Árpádffy-Lovas, Tamás; Györe, Balázs; Topál, Leila; Gazdag, Péter; Szlovák, Jozefina; Naveed, Muhammad; Jost, Norbert; Nagy, Norbert; Varró, András; Virág, László; Koncz, Istvan",Can. j. physiol. pharmacol,,504

Of note, T cell aging and low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) are implicated with several age-related conditions. The expansion of late-differentiated T cells (CD28-), regulatory T cells, increased serum levels of autoantibodies, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were implicated with morbidities during aging. Features of accelerated immunosenescence can be identified in adults with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and are predictive of poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is an interplay between immunosenescence and age-related diseases. In this review, we discuss how the aging immune system may contribute to the development and clinical course of age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.","Barbé-Tuana, Florencia; Funchal, Giselle; Schmitz, Carine Raquel Richter; Maurmann, Rafael Moura; Bauer, Moisés E",Semin. immunopathol,,504

The highly contagious COVID-19 infection has affected millions of people to date and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Aside from the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a treatment or vaccine has been the main reason for its spread. Thus, it has become necessary to find alternative methods for controlling SARS-CoV-2. For the present review, we conducted an online search for different available nutrition-based therapies for previously known coronavirus infections and RNA-based virus infections as well as general antiviral therapies. These treatments have promise for combating COVID-19, as various nutrients and minerals play direct and indirect roles in the control and prevention of this newly emerged viral infection. The patients' nutritional status with COVID-19 must be analyzed before administering any treatment, and nutritional supplements should be given to the affected individuals along with routine treatment.

Objective: To assess the performance of a severity scoring system on admission CXR in predicting hospital outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study included 240 patients (142 men, 98 women; median age 65 [50-80]) admitted to the hospital from 3/16/2020 to 4/30/2020 with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and who underwent CXR within 24 hours of admission. Three chest radiologists and three radiology residents independently scored patients' admission CXR using a 0 to 24-point composite scale (sum of 0-3 scores for extent and severity of disease in upper and lower lung zones). The score's interrater reliability score was assessed using Kendall's W statistic. The six readers' scores were averaged for further analyses. Demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and admission laboratory values were collected from the electronic medical record. ROC analysis was performed to assess the association of CXR severity and mortality. Additional univariable associations, as well as multivariable logistic regression models incorporating patient characteristics and laboratory values, were tested between CXR severity and clinical outcomes. Results: Interrater reliability of the CXR scores ranged from 0.687 to 0.737 for attendings, 0.653 to 0.762 for residents, and 0.575 to 0.666 for all readers combined. Admission CXR score &#8805; 10 achieved 53.0% (35/66) sensitivity and 75.3% (131/174) specificity for predicting hospital mortality. Hospital mortality was 44.9% (35/78) in patients with a high-risk admission CXR (score &#8805; 10), versus 19.1% (31/162) in patients with a low-risk CXR (score <10) (p<0.001). Admission CXR severity was an independent predictor of death (OR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.10-1.24, p<0.001). CXR severity was a univariable predictor of intubation (OR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.21, p<0.001) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR: 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27, p=0.007), though was not associated with these in multivariable models (p>0.05). Conclusion: For patients admitted with COVID-19, a simple admission CXR severity score may help predict hospital mortality, intubation, and CRRT. Clinical Impact: CXR may assist risk assessment and clinical decision making early in the disease course of COVID-19.","Reeves, Russell A; Pomeranz, Corbin; Gomella, Andrew A; Gulati, Aishwarya; Metra, Brandon; Hage, Anthony; Lange, Steven; Parekh, Maansi; Donuru, Achala; Lakhani, Paras; Sundaram, Baskaran",,,504

The aim of this literature review is to summarize key findings related to ABO blood types and COVID-19 infection rate, symptom presentation, and outcome. Summarized findings include associations between ABO blood type and higher infection susceptibility, intubation duration, and severe outcomes, including death. The literature suggests that blood type O may serve as a protective factor, as individuals with blood type O are found COVID-19 positive at far lower rates. This could suggest that blood type O individuals are less susceptible to infection, or that they are asymptomatic at higher rates and therefore do not seek out testing. We also discuss genetic associations and potential molecular mechanisms that drive the relationship between blood type and COVID-19. Studies have found a strong association between a locus on a specific gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) and outcome severity, such as respiratory failure. Cellular models have suggested an explanation for blood type modulation of infection, evidencing that spike protein/Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-dependent adhesion to ACE2-expressing cell lines was specifically inhibited by monoclonal or natural human anti-A antibodies, so individuals with non-A blood types, specifically O, or B blood types, which produce anti-A antibodies, may be less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to the inhibitory effects of anti-A antibodies.","Zhang, Yujia; Garner, Rachael; Salehi, Sana; La Rocca, Marianna; Duncan, Dominique",Ann Hematol,,504

The goal is to add as few agents as possible to the initial seed-sets such that, once the process started with these seed-sets stabilizes, each agent has either both opinions or none. We show that the problem is NP-hard. Further, we investigate the complexity from the parameterized point-of-view. The problem is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size. The problem remains W[1]-hard even for the combination of parameters the solution size and treewidth of the network even if all thresholds are at most 3, or the activation process stabilizes within 4 rounds. On the other hand, the problem is FPT when parameterized by the number of rounds, maximum threshold, and treewidth. This algorithm applies also for combined parameter treedepth and maximum threshold. Finally, we show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by vertex cover number of the input network alone. Our results also imply that the original Target Set Selection problem is FPT when parameterized by 3-PVC.","Knop, Duvsan; Schierreich, vSimon; Such'y, Ondvrej",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10184v1.pdf,504
373574,Factors associated with postponed health checkups during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany,2021,"Clopidogrel is increasingly being used for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke according to the updated guidelines on acute stroke management. Failure to achieve a drug response is referred to as clopidogrel resistance. Similarly, a higher activation of platelets during clopidogrel therapy-high on-treatment platelet reactivity-is equivalent to a reduced effectiveness of a therapy. Clopidogrel resistance is considered to be a common and multifactorial phenomenon that significantly limits the efficacy of antiplatelet agents. The aim of the current study is to review the latest literature data to identify the prevalance and predictors of clopidogrel high on-treatment platelet reactivity among stroke subjects and to establish the potential impact on clinical outcomes and prognosis. Clinical databases were searched by two independent researchers to select relevant papers on the topic, including all types of articles. Several important predictors contributing to clopidogrel resistance were identified, including genetic polymorphisms, the concomitant use of other drugs, or vascular risk factors, in particular nonsmoking and diabetes. Clopidogrel high on-treatment platelet reactivity has a negative impact on the clinical course of stroke, worsens the early- and long-term prognoses, and increases the risk of recurrent vascular events. Platelet function testing should be considered in selected stroke individuals, especially those predisposed to clopidogrel resistance, for whom an improvement in the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is essential. This particular group may become the greatest beneficiaries of the modification of existing therapy based on platelet function monitoring.","Wisniewski, Adam; Filipska, Karolina",,,504

In this multicentered retrospective study, we enrolled 3219 patients with diagnosed COVID-19 admitted to 9 hospitals from December 31, 2019 to March 4, 2020, to estimate the associations and prognostic power of circulating cardiac injury markers with the poor outcomes of COVID-19. In the mixed-effects Cox model, after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the adjusted hazard ratio of 28-day mortality for hs-cTnI (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) was 7.12 ([95% CI, 4.60-11.03] P<0.001), (NT-pro)BNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide or brain natriuretic peptide) was 5.11 ([95% CI, 3.50-7.47] P<0.001), CK (creatine phosphokinase)-MB was 4.86 ([95% CI, 3.33-7.09] P<0.001), MYO (myoglobin) was 4.50 ([95% CI, 3.18-6.36] P<0.001), and CK was 3.56 ([95% CI, 2.53-5.02] P<0.001). The cutoffs of those cardiac biomarkers for effective prognosis of 28-day mortality of COVID-19 were found to be much lower than for regular heart disease at about 19%-50% of the currently recommended thresholds. Patients with elevated cardiac injury markers above the newly established cutoffs were associated with significantly increased risk of COVID-19 death. In conclusion, cardiac biomarker elevations are significantly associated with 28-day death in patients with COVID-19. The prognostic cutoff values of these biomarkers might be much lower than the current reference standards. These findings can assist in better management of COVID-19 patients to improve outcomes. Importantly, the newly established cutoff levels of COVID-19-associated cardiac biomarkers may serve as useful criteria for the future prospective studies and clinical trials.","Qin, Juan-Juan; Cheng, Xu; Zhou, Feng; Lei, Fang; Akolkar, Gauri; Cai, Jingjing; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Blet, Alice; Xie, Jing; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Ye-Mao; Huang, Zizhen; Zhao, Ling-Ping; Lin, Lijin; Xia, Meng; Chen, Ming-Ming; Song, Xiaohui; Bai, Liangjie; Chen, Ze; Zhang, Xingyuan; Xiang, Da; Chen, Jing; Xu, Qingbo; Ma, Xinliang; Touyz, Rhian M; Gao, Chen; Wang, Haitao; Liu, Liming; Mao, Weiming; Luo, Pengcheng; Yan, Youqin; Ye, Ping; Chen, Manhua; Chen, Guohua; Zhu, Lihua; She, Zhi-Gang; Huang, Xiaodong; Yuan, Yufeng; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Wang, Yibin; Liu, Peter P; Li, Hongliang",Hypertension,,504

Today, we know a lot more about Covid-19 infection than we did a year ago. We know that the fight against the spread of the virus, when not correctly done, favours the development of variants of the original covid-19 strain and, we also know that these variants especially the one defined as the ""English"" variant, has the ability to spread much more and more quickly than the original strain. We know that people, even at lethal risk of complications, are especially old aged, but we also know that those who are oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic patients can spread the infection.

384915,Weather Conditions and COVID-19 Incidence in a Cold Climate: A Time-Series Study in Finland,2020,"BACKGROUND: On March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai. By April 12, 2020, 54 cases and 1257 contacts were identified. We describe the epidemiological, clinical, and transmission characteristics of these cases. METHODS: A confirmed case was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during March 21-April 12, 2020 in a resident of or traveler to Uganda. We reviewed case-person files and interviewed case-persons at isolation centers. We identified infected contacts from contact tracing records. RESULTS: Mean case-person age was 35 (±16) years; 34 (63%) were male. Forty-five (83%) had recently traveled internationally ('imported cases'), five (9.3%) were known contacts of travelers, and four (7.4%) were community cases. Of the 45 imported cases, only one (2.2%) was symptomatic at entry. Among all case-persons, 29 (54%) were symptomatic at testing and five (9.3%) were pre-symptomatic. Among the 34 (63%) case-persons who were ever symptomatic, all had mild disease: 16 (47%) had fever, 13 (38%) reported headache, and 10 (29%) reported cough. Fifteen (28%) case-persons had underlying conditions, including three persons with HIV. An average of 31 contacts (range, 4-130) were identified per case-person. Five (10%) case-persons, all symptomatic, infected one contact each. CONCLUSION: The first 54 case-persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda primarily comprised incoming air travelers with asymptomatic or mild disease. Disease would likely not have been detected in these persons without the targeted testing interventions implemented in Uganda. Transmission was low among symptomatic persons and nonexistent from asymptomatic persons. Routine, systematic screening of travelers and at-risk persons, and thorough contact tracing will be needed for Uganda to maintain epidemic control.","Migisha, Richard; Kwesiga, Benon; Mirembe, Bernadette Basuta; Amanya, Geofrey; Kabwama, Steven N; Kadobera, Daniel; Bulage, Lilian; Nsereko, Godfrey; Wadunde, Ignatius; Tindyebwa, Tonny; Lubwama, Bernard; Kagirita, Atek A; Kayiwa, John T; Lutwama, Julius J; Boore, Amy L; Harris, Julie R; Bosa, Henry Kyobe; Ario, Alex Riolexus",Global Health,,504

385427,The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Among Pakistani Adults in Lahore,2021,"Expanded polystyrene (EPS) has excellent thermal insulation properties and is widely applied in building energy conservation. However, these thermal insulation materials have caused numerous fires because of flammability. Pyrolysis is necessary to support combustion, and more attention should be paid to the pyrolysis characteristics of EPS. Moreover, pyrolysis is considered to be an effective method for recycling solid waste. Pyrolysis kinetics of EPS were analyzed by thermogravimetric experiments, both in nitrogen and air atmospheres. A new method was proposed to couple the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa model-free method and the model-fitting method called the Coats-Redfern as well as the particle swarm optimization (PSO) global algorithm to establish reaction mechanisms and their corresponding kinetic parameters. It was found that the pyrolysis temperature of EPS was concentrated at 525-800 K. The activation energy of EPS in nitrogen was about 163 kJ/mol, which was higher than that in air (109.63 kJ/mol). Furthermore, coupled with Coats-Redfern method, reaction functions g(&#945;) = 1 - (1 - &#945;)3 and g(&#945;) = 1 - (1 - &#945;)1/4 should be responsible for nitrogen and air reactions, respectively. The PSO algorithm was applied to compute detailed pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Kinetic parameters could be used in further large-scale fire simulation and provide guidance for reactor design.","Ni, Xiaoyang; Wu, Zheng; Zhang, Wenlong; Lu, Kaihua; Ding, Yanming; Mao, Shaohua",,,504

We aimed to determine the incidence, causes and outcome of severe maternal morbidity and near miss, and the sociodemographic and obstetric factors associated with these at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Delhi. Methods.: Women admitted with severe maternal morbidity and near miss, as defined by the WHO study group, were included in the study. The incidence ratio of near miss and severe morbidity in the hospital was determined, and a case-control study was conducted to study the factors associated with the occurrence of near miss. Information was obtained from hospital records and interviews, using a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. Results.: The incidence ratio of near miss was 6.85/ 1000, and severe morbidity was 11.38/1000 live births. Hypertensive disorders and haemorrhage were the common causes of cases of near miss and severe morbidity. Coagulation dysfunction (62%) was the most common organ dysfunction, followed by uterine dysfunction (22%). Older age (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, confidence interval [CI] 1.02-3.93), the absence of formal education (OR 2.05, CI 1.11-3.75), <18 years of age at marriage (OR 2.01, CI 1.21-3.32), lower income (OR 3.8, CI 1.88-7.64), gravida of four or more (OR 2.25, CI 1.21-4.17) and residence outside Delhi (OR 9.31, CI 4.36-19.90) were significant predictors of near miss. Sepsis, hypertensive disorders and haemorrhage were the most common underlying conditions in women who died. The foetal outcome was a live birth in 64% of near-miss cases and 62% among severe morbidity. Conclusions.: The burden of severe maternal morbidity and near miss is high.

394040,The necessity for intra-action reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"After the advent of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in the late 2019, the resulting severe and pernicious syndrome (COVID-19) immediately was deployed all around the world. To date, despite relentless efforts to control the disease by drug repurposing, there is no approved specific therapy for COVID-19. Given the role of innate and acquired immune components in the control and elimination of viral infections and inflammatory mutilations during SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis, immunotherapeutic strategies appear to be beneficent. Passive immunotherapies such as convalescent plasma, which has received much attention especially in severe cases, as well as suppressing inflammatory cytokines, interferon administration, inhibition of kinases and complement cascade, virus neutralization with key engineered products, cell-based therapies, immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs are among the key immunotherapeutic approaches to deal with COVID-19, which is discussed in this review. Also, details of leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates as the most potent immunotherapy have been provided. However, despite salient improvements, there is still a lack of completely assured vaccines for universal application. Therefore, adopting proper immunotherapies according to the cytokine pattern and involved immune responses, alongside engineered biologics specially ACE2-Fc to curb SARS-CoV2 infection until achieving a tailored vaccine is probably the best strategy to better manage this pandemic. Therefore, gaining knowledge about the mechanism of action, potential targets, as well as the effectiveness of immune-based approaches to confront COVID-19 in the form of a well-ordered review study is highly momentous.","Bayat, M.; Asemani, Y.; Mohammadi, M.

DESIGN: We compared, in a cohort of confirmed COVID-19 older patients, three specifically developed scores with a previously established early warning score. Main endpoint was all causes in-hospital death. SETTING: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study, conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) of an urban teaching hospital, referral center for COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed the clinical records of the confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or more consecutively admitted to our ED over a 6-week period (March 1st to April 15th, 2020). A total of 210 patients, aged between 60 and 98 years were included in the study cohort. MEASUREMENTS: International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterization Protocol-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium (ISARIC-4C) score, COVID-GRAM Critical Illness Risk Score (COVID-GRAM), quick COVID-19 Severity Index (qCSI), National Early Warning Score (NEWS). RESULTS: Median age was 74 (67-82) and 133 (63.3%) were males. Globally, 42 patients (20.0%) deceased. All the score evaluated showed a fairly good predictive value with respect to in-hospital death. The ISARIC-4C score had the highest area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.799 (0.738-0.851), followed by the COVID-GRAM 0.785 (0.723-0.838), NEWS 0.764 (0.700-0.819), and qCSI 0.749 (0.685-0.806). However, these differences were not statistical significant. CONCLUSION: Among the evaluated scores, the ISARIC-4C and the COVID-GRAM, calculated at ED admission, had the best performance, although the qCSI had similar efficacy by evaluating only three items. However, the NEWS, already widely validated in clinical practice, had a similar performance and could be appropriate for older patients with COVID-19.","Covino, Marcello; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Burzo, Maria Livia; Russo, Andrea; Forte, Evelina; Carnicelli, Annamaria; Piccioni, Andrea; Simeoni, Benedetta; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco; Sandroni, Claudio",J. am. geriatr. soc,,504

Facebook posts from two prominent cancer-SSAs 365 Cancer Prevention Society (365CPS) and Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) between comparable periods in 2019 and 2020 were extracted. These posts were categorized using a classification scheme which was specifically developed by two coders with adequate intercoder reliability. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if there was a significant difference in the frequency of posts between 2019 and 2020, and across three specific periods in 2020. Results indicate that 365CPS appears to have adapted to the pandemic by increasing their posting frequency on Facebook in 2020, but the same was not evident for SCS. However, both SSAs tweaked their social media outreach strategy in line with social distancing measures, publishing posts detailing activities that beneficiaries can participate from home such as healthy recipes and virtual events. SSAs can scale up their efforts to achieve a higher level of health promotion and support for their beneficiaries. Further qualitative studies are required to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 from the perspective of beneficiaries and validate the classification scheme which was developed in this study. The classification scheme could be used in ascertaining the quality of social media communication between public/private support groups and patients.","Ethan Tan, Kieran; Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind; Wee, Hwee Lin",J Biomed Inform,,504
397995,Coronavirus and interpersonal violence: A need for digital mental health resources,2020,"AIM: The city of L'Aquila (central Italy) was hit by a strong earthquake in 2009 that caused the collapse of several buildings, deaths and injured people. In the following years, a great number of building sites were activated, building workers resulted intensely exposed and represent a relevant target for research on environmental mutagenesis and epidemiological surveillance. Cells of buccal mucosa are considered an appropriate site for early detecting of cytogenetic damage, since it represents the first barrier in inhalation or ingestion and can metabolize carcinogenic agents into reactive chemicals. Our study is aimed 1) at comparing the early genotoxic damage as measured by the buccal mucosa micronucleus test in two subgroups of workers defined by different occupational exposure and 2) at evaluating possible confounding variables such as lifestyle factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in L'Aquila, on 24 outdoor workers (OWs) highly exposed on the construction sites and 26 indoor workers (IWs), all subjected to the compulsory occupational surveillance system, in the period 2017-2018. Buccal cells samples were collected and, based on the Micronucleus test, the exfoliated cells were classified in respect of nuclear changes observed. Moreover, a self-report questionnaire composed of 84 items, was administered to the workers. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between Exp+ (OWs) and Exp- (IWs) in the number of the analyzed cells (expressed as mean value out of 1000 cells): respectively 954.46 vs 990.06 normal cells, (p < 0.001); 19.79 vs 4.95 micronucleated cells, as marker of chromosomal damage (p < 0.001); 13.93 vs 8.96 binucleated cells, as marker of failed cytokinesis (p < 0.001); 2.09 vs 1.18 karyolytic cells, as marker of cell death and damaged DNA (p < 0.05). According with a multivariate regression analysis, in addition to the job exposure (OW vs IW, beta = 12.221, p < 0.001), the only variable independently associated with an increase in Micronuclei (MNs) is the smoking habit (OWs vs IWs, beta = 6.683, p < 0.001) which, even if not associated with dust exposure, worsens cell integrity. Moreover, this worsening effect is weaker in workers not exposed to the site dust (moderation effect). Within social demographic factors, the high educational level only apparently seems to affect MNs number: even if unbalanced in favor of IWs vs OWs, this variable resulted a confounder, since its effect disappears when the interaction between these two factors is considered, because it is a covariate of smoking habit as well as of the job condition. CONCLUSION: Despite some limitation, our findings clearly confirm the role of occupational exposure as a marker of cytogenetic damage associated with MNs number in construction workers. Moreover, smoking status appears as the only other investigated factor independently associated to the outcome. The statistical model, in addition, highlights possible moderation and confounding effects, such as interaction between smoking and occupational exposure and the unbalanced school education level in workers. Micronucleus test in exfoliated buccal cells would be considered a suitable method for studying the early genotoxic damage in the construction occupational setting as well as in evaluating the efficacy of preventive practices.","Leonardi, Sara; Poma, Anna Mg; Colafarina, Sabrina; D039,; Aloisio, Francesco; Scatigna, Maria; Zarivi, Osvaldo; Mastrantonio, Riccardo; Tobia, Loreta; Fabiani, Leila",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,504

399522,Community Health Workers: The Authors Reply,2020,"Public health emergencies are a test of resilience for health systems, which depend on health workforces that are well managed and cared for. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the weakness of many health systems in preparing their health workforces. The crisis also exacerbated the unequal conditions between different professions, an issue that is still understudied in the workforce literature. This paper analyzes the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for different health professionals, considering the ways in which Brazil's the health system does or does not protect them. We also analyse the role of pre-existing inequalities between different professions and social groups within the workforce in shaping their different experiences of the pandemic. We present data comparing the perceptions of different health professionals facing the pandemic in Brazil: physicians, nurses, and community health workers. Data were collected in an online survey in Brazil with 1630 health care workers between June 15th and July 1st. Findings suggest that none of the professions felt well prepared to work under emergencies. However, differences relating to professional background were exacerbated during the pandemic, creating unequal conditions for different health workers. These inequalities may pose new challenges for the post-pandemic scenario.","Lotta, Gabriela; Fernandez, Michelle; Corrêa, Marcela",Int. j. health plann. manage,,504

Cancer patients have been considered a group with special susceptibility, particularly patients with lung tumour involvement and haematological neoplasms. The Spanish Lymphoma Oncology Group (GOTEL) carried out a multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in patients with lymphoma. Results: A total of 150 patients were included between 22 May and 11 June 2020. The mean age was 65 years (range 17-89), 70 women (46.5%) and 80 men (53, 5%). At the time of diagnosis of lymphoma, 13 cases were stage I (9%), 27 (18%) stage II, 37 (24.5%) stage III, and 73 (48.5%) stage IV, while 6.6% had a primary extranodal origin. A total of 10 cases with positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, which is a prevalence of 6% in this population. None of the patients required intensive care unit management and all fully recovered from the infection. Conclusion: IgG antibody seroprevalence in lymphoma patients appears similar to that of the general population and does not show greater aggressiveness.","Franco, Fernando; Guirado, María; Martínez-Banaclocha, Natividad; Gumà, Josep; Lavernia, Javier; Gómez-Codina, José; Rodriguez-Abreu, Delvys; Martínez, Fani; Barrajón, Enrique; Méndez, Miriam; Calvo, Virginia; Provencio, Mariano",Curr Oncol,,504

METHODS: We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74]vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality. Inflammatory factor cascade and coagulation abnormality may be the potential mechanisms of COVID-19 combined with cardiac injury.","Fan, Hua; Zhang, Lin; Huang, Bin; Zhu, Muxin; Zhou, Yong; Zhang, Huan; Tao, Xiaogen; Cheng, Shaohui; Yu, Wenhu; Zhu, Liping; Chen, Jian",Int J Infect Dis,,504

The model is estimated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on a data augmentation scheme, in which the latent states are drawn together with the model parameters for each area and time. As an illustration we analyze incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 collected in Italy at regional level for the period from February 24, 2020, to January 17, 2021, corresponding to 48 weeks, where we use number of swabs as an offset.

408038,Inherently high uncertainty in predicting the time evolution of epidemics,2021,"Early and accurate diagnosis of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is essential for patient isolation and contact tracing so that the spread of infection can be limited. Computed tomography (CT) can provide important information in COVID-19, especially for patients with moderate to severe disease as well as those with worsening cardiopulmonary status. As an automatic tool, deep learning methods can be utilized to perform semantic segmentation of affected lung regions, which is important to establish disease severity and prognosis prediction. Both the extent and type of pulmonary opacities help assess disease severity. However, manually pixel-level multi-class labelling is time-consuming, subjective, and non-quantitative. In this article, we proposed a hybrid weak label-based deep learning method that utilize both the manually annotated pulmonary opacities from COVID-19 pneumonia and the patient-level disease-type information available from the clinical report. A UNet was firstly trained with semantic labels to segment the total infected region. It was used to initialize another UNet, which was trained to segment the consolidations with patient-level information using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, multi-institutional CT datasets from Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the United States were utilized. Results show that our proposed method can predict the infected regions as well as the consolidation regions with good correlation to human annotation.","Wu, Dufan; Gong, Kuang; Arru, Chiara Daniela; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Bizzo, Bernardo; Buch, Varun; Ren, Hui; Kim, Kyungsang; Neumark, Nir; Xu, Pengcheng; Liu, Zhiyuan; Fang, Wei; Xie, Nuobei; Tak, Won Young; Park, Soo Young; Lee, Yu Rim; Kang, Min Kyu; Park, Jung Gil; Carriero, Alessandro; Saba, Luca; Masjedi, Mahsa; Talari, Hamidreza; Babaei, Rosa; Mobin, Hadi Karimi; Ebrahimian, Shadi; Dayan, Ittai; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Li, Quanzheng",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,504

410013,The operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system in responses to epidemics: Implications for COVID-19 control in Vietnam,2020,"Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer. Treatments that directly address tumor survival are required. Indomethacin (IND) is a well-known drug used worldwide. Although widely used as a therapeutic agent, IND has undesirable gastrointestinal effects. PURPOSE: To investigate the antitumor efficacy of IND incorporated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs+IND), as well as its toxic potential in a syngeneic murine B16 melanoma model. METHODS: Antitumor activity was evaluated by measuring tumor size and weight and by histopathological analysis. Possible molecular signaling pathways involved in the antitumor activity were analyzed by Western blot in liver tissue and by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue. The potential toxicity was evaluated by determining body and organ weights and by biochemical and genotoxic analysis. RESULTS: MSNPs+IND treatments inhibited tumor growth by up to 70.09% and decreased the frequency of mitosis in tumor tissues, which was up to 37.95% lower compared to the IND groups. In hepatic tissue, COX-2 levels decreased significantly after treatment with MSNPs+IND and IND. Additionally, MSNPs+IND and IND increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3 (156.25% and 137.50%, respectively), inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Genotoxicity was limited to the group treated with the higher concentration of IND, while MSNPs prevented IND-induced genotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: MSNPs may be promising for future applications in cancer therapy.","Ferreira, Natália Helen; Ribeiro, Arthur Barcelos; Rinaldi-Neto, Francisco; Fernandes, Fernanda Santos; do Nascimento, Samuel; Braz, Wilson Rodrigues; Nassar, Eduardo José; Tavares, Denise Crispim",Pharm Res,,504

413664,In Brief,2020,"INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the influence of High (H, 4.13%), Medium (M, 2.0%) and Low (L, 0.1%) doses of menthol on temperature perception and regulation, compared to a Placebo Condition (P). METHOD: Sixteen participants underwent the aforementioned conditions on four separate days. During each test participants rested supine (Environmental conditions: 30 °C, 50% rh) for 30-min before 40 mL of L, M, H or P gel was applied to the anterior upper body, then rested 30-min thereafter. Primary measures included thermal sensation (TS), thermal comfort (TC), irritation (IRR), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperature (chest, forearm, thigh, calf), and EMG (trapezius, pectoralis major, sternocleidomastoid). The area under the curve (AUC) from minute 30 to 60 was compared between conditions using relevant non/parametric tests (alpha level = 0.05). RESULTS: A cooling trend in Tre was observed following Placebo gel application, but this significantly (p < 0.05) reversed into a heat storage response in M and H. Both TS and TC significantly differed by condition (p < 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner, with L, M, and H doses eliciting significantly cooler sensations and more discomfort than P (p < 0.05). Irritation significantly differed by condition (p < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner, with L and M eliciting significantly greater irritation than P (p < 0.01). No other differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Menthol exerts perceptual and thermoregulatory effects independent of skin temperature. A menthol dose-dependent perceptual cooling effect was evident with possible saturation at the moderate dose. A dose-dependent alteration in deep body temperature was also evident.","Gillis, D Jason; Capone, Selena; Nestor, Kacey; Snell, Mitchel",J Therm Biol,,504

416636,"Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic-Unique Opportunities for Unifying, Revamping and Reshaping Epidemic Preparedness of Europe's Public Health Systems",2020,"Background: Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have demonstrated improvements in time-in-range (TIR, blood glucose 70-180 mg/dL) without increasing hypoglycemia. Testing a closed-loop system in an inpatient environment with supervised challenges allows for initial evaluation of performance and safety of the system. Methods: Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) were enrolled into two similar studies (n = 10 per study), with 3-day inpatient analysis periods. Participants tested a Lilly hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system comprising an investigational insulin pump, insulin lispro, a pump-embedded model predictive control algorithm, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and an external dedicated controller. Each protocol included meal-related and exercise challenges to simulate real-world diabetes self-management errors. Only study staff interacted with the HCL system. Performance was assessed using standard CGM metrics overall and within prespecified periods. Results: Participants (25% male) had mean ± standard deviation (SD) age 44.7 ± 14.2 years, T1D duration 30.2 ± 11.1 years, A1C 7.2% ± 0.8%, and insulin usage 0.53 ± 0.21 U/(kg·day). Percentage TIR 70-180 mg/dL (mean ± SD) was 81.2 ± 8.4 overall, 85.2 ± 8.1 outside of challenge periods, 97.3 ± 5.3 during the nocturnal periods, and 74.5 ± 16.2 for the postprandial periods. During challenge periods, percentage TIR for the overbolus challenge was 65.4 ± 29.2 and that for the delayed bolus challenge was 57.1 ± 25.1. No adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, or unanticipated adverse device events occurred while participants were using the HCL system. Conclusions: In participants with T1D, Lilly AID system demonstrated expected algorithm performance and safety with satisfactory glycemic outcomes overall and in response to simulated diabetes management challenges. Additional studies in less supervised conditions and with broader patient populations are warranted.

417025,A nationwide survey of psychological distress among Indonesian residents during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In Korea, there have been 10,480 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as of April 11, 2020. We investigated the transmission of COVID-19 in a cluster of cases. METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 10 confirmed COVID-19 patients in an outbreak that started at Spa facility A in a local community in Korea on March 28, 2020 and traced them through April 8, 2020. Epidemiological surveys and diagnostic tests were conducted for each contact, and the secondary attack rate was estimated. RESULTS: There were 3 male confirmed patients (30.0%) and 7 female confirmed patients (70.0%), and their mean age was 53.5 years (range, 2.0 to 73.0). Two patients (20.0%) were asymptomatic. The incubation period was between 3 days and 12 days. Three confirmed patients were infected at female's Spa facility A and 7 confirmed patients were second, third, and fourth generations of transmission. Seven confirmed patients contracted COVID-19 through presymptomatic contact. In total, 192 contacts were identified, with a secondary attack rate of 3.6%. Eighty-three contacts (43.2%) were aged 40-59 years, and the secondary attack rate was the highest (12.1%) in those aged &#8805;60 years. Most exposures (n=156, 81.3%) involved casual contact. The number of visitors using the female's spa facility was 58, including 3 confirmed patients, resulting in a secondary outbreak rate of 5.9%. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a cluster of cases occurring in a setting with high temperature and humidity. The second, third, and fourth generations were transmitted through presymptomatic contact.","Han, Taewon",Epidemiol Health,,504
417531,Maternal Health: What Funders Have Been Supporting,2021,"Background: The lack of evidence-based recommendations for therapeutic decisions during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a unique scenario of clinical decision making which is worth to analyze. We aim to identify the drivers of therapeutic aggressiveness during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional worldwide survey (conducted April 12 to 19, 2020) was aimed at physicians who managed patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Treatment preferences were collected in five different clinical scenarios. We used multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression to identify variables that were associated with the use of more aggressive therapies. Findings: The survey was completed by 852 physicians from 44 different specialties and 29 countries. The heterogeneity of therapeutic decisions increased as the clinical scenario worsened. Factors associated with aggressive therapeutic decisions were higher self-perceived expertise (high vs. null, OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.31-2.89), perceived quality of COVID-19 publications (high vs. null, OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.17-3.16), and female sex (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.02-1.33). Conversely, Infectious Diseases specialty, Latin American and North American origin, lower confidence in the treatments chosen, and having published articles indexed in PubMed as the first-author were associated with the use of less aggressive therapies. Interpretation: Our study provides insight into the drivers of the decision-making process during a new and extreme health emergency. Different factors including the perceived expertise and quality of publications, gender, geographic origin, medical specialty and implication in medical research influenced this process. The clinical severity attenuated the physician's tolerance for uncertainty.

418130,COVID-19: the current situation in Afghanistan,2020,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic brought new attention to medication abortion because it does not require direct physical contact between patient and clinical staff No-test approaches for medication abortion preserve the usual standard of care, except that they replace the in-person ultrasound or physical exam before the abortion with other evidence-based methods to assess the patient's duration of pregnancy and screen for ectopic pregnancy Early in the pandemic, a no-test sample protocol was published to offer guidance for clinical practice However, little has been published on the safety and efficacy outcomes of no-test approaches Method Through webinars and personal contacts, we invited US-based clinics that had adopted the no-test medication abortion protocol to join the study A no-test medication abortion was defined as not having a preabortion ultrasound or physical exam Participating clinics abstracted data from medical records of all patients who received a no-test medication abortion and entered them into a REDCap database We conducted descriptive analyses of the clinic protocols and the patient sample We also developed a multilevel, multivariable model that accounted for clustering at the clinic-level to estimate the adjusted odds of medication abortion failure and adverse events Results We included 11 clinics, 4 of which contributed some data from the TelAbortion Study Clinics shared data on 791 patients served from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2020 Among all patients, 58 1% received mifepristone in person and 41 9% received it by mail At mifepristone provision, patients’ pregnancy durations ranged from 27 to 74 days;36 4% were 71 days We received at least some follow-up data for 626 patients (79 1%) and excluded 14 patients who did not take mifepristone Of the remaining 612 patients, 5 (0 8%) experienced serious adverse events defined as hospital admission, abdominal surgery and blood transfusion One patient had a confirmed ectopic pregnancy and was admitted to a hospital for salpingectomy 9 days after provision of mifepristone (included as a serious adverse event) Abortion outcome data were available for 394 patients (64 4%) Overall, 94 7% (95% CI: 92 0% to 96 7%) of patients had a complete abortion with &lt;1600 mcg of misoprostol, without an aspiration, procedure, or more mifepristone and misoprostol 2 patients had suspected or confirmed ongoing pregnancies Outcomes were similar for those who received medications in-person and those who received them by mail Conclusions No-test medication abortion with either in-person pick up or mailing of medications is effective and safe, with outcomes similar to rates found in the published literature Moreover, omitting tests reduce COVID-19 risk and conform with FDA REMS requirements when combined with in-person pick up Follow up rates (64 4%) with the NTMA approach were similar to other medication abortion protocols Combining no-test medication abortion protocols with mailing of medications to patients would support public health efforts for those who want to avoid a clinic visit","Upadhyay, U.; Raymond, E.; Koenig, L.; Coplon, L.; Ricci, S.; Kaneshiro, B.; Boraas, C.; Winikoff, B.",Contraception,,504
419341,The Privatization of the Italian National Health System and its Impact on Health Emergency Preparedness and Response: The COVID-19 Case,2021,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) continues to spread globally. It has become a major cause of concern for health care professionals all over the world. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, awareness and hygiene practices regarding COVID-19 among private dental practitioners practicing in Tricity (Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali) in India during these critical times. Materials and Methods: A total of 245 private dentists participated in this cross-sectional survey and finally 215 constituted the final sample size. A self-administered, multiple choice type questionnaire (verified by a specialist) was administered to obtain information from the subjects. The questionnaire was divided into two parts and included 15 questions on knowledge and awareness regarding COVID-19. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and Student's t-test. Results: Percentage of subjects who answered correctly regarding main symptoms of COVID-19 and primary mode of transmission was 87% and 82.5% respectively. One-third of the subjects were not aware regarding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be used while rendering dental treatment. 75% of subjects were of the opinion that supportive care is the current treatment regime for COVID-19. Less than one-third of subjects (30.2%) reported high scores. Education level (p=0.018) and health sector profile (p=0.024) of the subjects were significantly associated with mean knowledge scores. Conclusion: The findings of the present study showed that some notable deficiencies in knowledge existed among dental professionals regarding some vital aspects of COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improving dentists'knowledge via health education and training programs. Further studies on the subject are also warranted once the situation normalizes.","Singh Gambhir, Ramandeep; Singh Dhaliwal, Jagjit; Aggarwal, Amit; Anand, Samir; Anand, Vaibhav; Kaur Bhangu, Amanpreet",Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig,,504

The purpose of the study was to investigate the occurrence of 16S rRNA methyltransferase (RMTase) genes in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) clinical isolates associated with bloodstream infections (BSIs) in China. Methods: From July 2015 to December 2018, a total of 137 unique CRKP clinical isolates associated with BSIs were collected from 11 Chinese teaching hospitals. PCR and DNA sequencing were used to identify 16S RMTase genes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on all CRKP clinical isolates. Relevant information was extracted from WGS data (antibiotic resistance determinants, K-type and wzi allelic types). All 16S RMTase-producing CRKP clinical isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: In this study, 137 CRKPs were found to harbor at least one carbapenemase gene. Among 137 CRKPs, 78 (56.9%, 78/137) were positive for 16S RMTase genes (5 for armA, 70 for rmtB, 3 for both armA and rmtB) and highly resistant to gentamicin and amikacin (MICs &#8805;256 mg/L). Seventy-five isolates harboring 16S RMTase genes also produced ESBLs. In this study, 5 sequence types (STs) and 6 capsule serotypes were found among 78 isolates positive for 16S RMTases genes, while 14 STs and 6 capsule serotypes were found among 59 isolates negative for 16S RMTases genes. Compared with the isolates negative for 16S RMTases genes, the STs and capsular serotypes of 16S RMTases-positive strains are more concentrated. Among 78 16S RMTases-positive strains, the most prevalent clone type is ST11-PFGE-B-KL64-wzi64 (62.8%, 49/78), which mainly carries the rmtB and blaKPC genes and is distributed in 7 provinces in China. Conclusion: A high prevalence of 16S RMTase genes was found among CRKP clinical isolates associated with BSIs from Chinese teaching hospitals, which was attributed to the dissemination of the ST11-PFGE-B-KL64-wzi64 clone.","Shen, Xiaofei; Liu, Li; Yu, Jingyi; Ai, Wenxiu; Cao, Xingwei; Zhan, Qing; Guo, Yinjuan; Wang, Liangxing; Yu, Fangyou",Infect Drug Resist,,504

426792,Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Behavior of Families in Italy: A Focus on Children and Adolescents,2021,"In patients with hematologic malignancies due to immune system disorders, especially persistent febrile neutropenia, invasive fungal infections (IFI) occur with high mortality. Aspergillosis, candidiasis, fusariosis, mucormycosis, cryptococcosis and trichosporonosis are the most important infections reported in patients with hematologic malignancies that undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These infections are caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens that do not cause severe issues in healthy individuals, but in patients with hematologic malignancies lead to disseminated infection with different clinical manifestations. Prophylaxis and creating a safe environment with proper filters and air pressure for patients to avoid contact with the pathogens in the surrounding environment can prevent IFI. Furthermore, due to the absence of specific symptoms in IFI, rapid and accurate diagnosis reduces the mortality rate of these infections and using molecular techniques along with standard mycological methods will improve the diagnosis of disseminated fungal infection in patients with hematologic disorders. Amphotericin B products, extended-spectrum azoles, and echinocandins are the essential drugs to control invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, and according to various conditions of patients, different results of treatment with these drugs have been reported in different studies. On the other hand, drug resistance in recent years has led to therapeutic failures and deaths in patients with blood malignancies, which indicates the need for antifungal susceptibility tests to use appropriate therapies. Life-threatening fungal infections have become more prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies in recent years due to the emergence of new risk factors, new species, and increased drug resistance. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the different dimensions of the most critical invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies and present a list of these infections with different clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcomes.","Shariati, Aref; Moradabadi, Alireza; Chegini, Zahra; Khoshbayan, Amin; Didehdar, Mojtaba",Infect Drug Resist,,504

430145,PIN33 Public Health Behaviour Changes during the Covid-19 Outbreak in China: A Comparison in Different Risk Groups,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To identify geographic hotspots and coldspots of work disability burden and their associated sociodemographic factors in Australia. METHODS: Using Australian workers' compensation and census data, we calculated weeks of compensated time off work per 1000 labor force, an indicator of work disability burden, at Statistical Area Level 4, the smallest level of labor force data produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Records included all claims with at least 1 day of compensated time off work lodged between 2010 and 2015. Work disability burden was z-transformed by state and territory and mapped across Australia. Statistical Areas that were more than 1 standard deviation from the state or territory mean were considered hotspots and coldspots. We tested several sociodemographic factors as predictors of work disability burden. RESULTS: Work disability burden hotspots were concentrated in lower socioeconomic suburbs and exurbs of state capitals, in addition to several regional areas. Coldspots were primarily in wealthy central urban and suburban areas. Factors associated with greater work disability burden include higher area socioeconomic disadvantage, rurality, lower labor force participation, higher unemployment, higher proportion of work in production industries and in blue-collar occupations, and higher numbers of those with core activity limitations, those aged 65+ years, and foreign-born residents. CONCLUSIONS: Work disability burden is unequally distributed across Australia and strongly influenced by sociodemographic and occupational factors. The findings can guide more efficient allocation of resources for work disability prevention and rehabilitation.","Lane, Tyler J; Collie, Alex",Am. j. ind. med,,504

Statistically, it is noted that worldwide deaths has occurred due to outbreak of infectious diseases. There is list of epidemics caused by infectious diseases like Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), swine flu, bird flu, etc. But, spread of COVID-19 is much more remarkable in very short period of time. Modern system of medicine, do not have any defini-tive management. Now, we need to think about other systems of medicine to break this chain.

Present study aims to understand the principles of Ayurveda, in view of concept, epidemiol-ogy, etiopathology, prognosis, prevention and management of infectious dis-eases. It comprises of probable approaches of infectious diseases through Ayurveda.

The speedily spread of COVID-19 is due to indulgence in the etiological factors, by people of this era. The onset period of this pandemic was VasantaRutu(spring), hence KaphaPrakopa(vitiation of Kapha) is there. And the further pathogenesis is like ShwasanakaSannipatikaJwara(fever due to vitiation of all humors). So, Panchakarma (Internal purification), Rasayana Chikitsa (Rejuvenating treat-ment) and Sadvritta (Good regime) can be included in the management of such diseases. From this study it can be concluded that disease is produced due to an imbalance between physical and mental elements, as it reduces resis-tance of body against disease. If we cure or prevent this imbalance and the strengthen host’s defense system by Ayurvedic drugs, lifestyle modifications, and diet modifications, the body will be immune to diseases.","Shelotkar, Priyanka; Borage, Swapnil",Int.

Less attention was paid to the experiences of individuals and less still to the impact of COVID-19 on an individual's wellbeing. This research addresses this gap by utilising a holistic wellbeing framework to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the overall wellbeing of individuals in the Australian state of South Australia through an online survey. The research framework for the survey comprises six dimensions: psychological and emotional health, physical health, living standards, family and community vitality, governance, and ecological diversity and resilience. The results show that most respondents (71%) were able to maintain overall wellbeing during the pandemic. However, more than a half of the respondents could not maintain wellbeing in psychological and emotional health. Further examination of the drivers of inability to maintain overall wellbeing reveals that low-income individuals, younger respondents (aged 18-24) and women suffer disproportionate hardships. Defining poverty in terms of multi-dimensional deprivations in wellbeing enables a nuanced analysis of the unequal impacts of COVID-19 mitigation policies that can be used to improve policymaking.","Saikia, Udoy; Dodd, Melinda M; Chalmers, James; Dasvarma, Gouranga; Schech, Susanne",PLoS One,,504

434121,Attitudes towards vaccines and intention to vaccinate against COVID-19: Implications for public health communications in Australia,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, Black Americans are suffering from a significantly disproportionate incidence of COVID-19. Going beyond mere epidemiological tallying, the potential for racial-justice interventions, including reparations payments, to ameliorate these disparities has not been adequately explored. METHODS: We compared the COVID-19 time-varying Rt curves of relatively disparate polities in terms of social equity (South Korea vs. Louisiana). Next, we considered a range of reproductive ratios to back-calculate the transmission rates ßiâj for 4â¯cells of the simplified next-generation matrix (from which R0 is calculated for structured models) for the outbreak in Louisiana. Lastly, we considered the potential structural effects monetary payments as reparations for Black American descendants of persons enslaved in the U.S. would have had on pre-intervention ßiâj and consequently R0. RESULTS: Once their respective epidemics begin to propagate, Louisiana displays Rt values with an absolute difference of 1.3-2.5 compared to South Korea. It also takes Louisiana more than twice as long to bring Rt below 1. Reasoning through the consequences of increased equity via matrix transmission models, we demonstrate how the benefits of a successful reparations program (reflected in the ratio ßbâb/ßwâw) could reduce R0 by 31-68%. DISCUSSION: While there are compelling moral and historical arguments for racial-injustice interventions such as reparations, our study considers potential health benefits in the form of reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. A restitutive program targeted towards Black individuals would not only decrease COVID-19 risk for recipients of the wealth redistribution; the mitigating effects would also be distributed across racial groups, benefiting the population at large.","Richardson, Eugene T; Malik, Momin M; Darity, William A; Mullen, A Kirsten; Morse, Michelle E; Malik, Maya; Maybank, Aletha; Bassett, Mary T; Farmer, Paul E; Worden, Lee; Jones, James Holland",Soc Sci Med,,504

METHODS: Deliveries from 14 U.S. medical centers, March 19-May 31, 2020, were included. Peripartum infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test within 14 days of delivery. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with randomly selected control patients were sampled (1:2 ratio) with controls delivering during the same day without a positive test. Outcomes were obstetric (e.g., delivery mode, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, delivery < 37 weeks), an adverse neonatal outcome composite measure (primary), and anesthetic utilization (e.g., neuraxial labor analgesia and anesthesia). Outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within centers. Sensitivity analyses compared symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to controls. RESULTS: 1454 peripartum women were included: 490 with SARS-CoV-2 infection [176 (35.9%) symptomatic]; 964 controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients were slightly younger, more likely non-nulliparous, non-white, and Hispanic than controls. They were more likely to have diabetes, obesity, or cardiac disease and less likely to have autoimmune disease. After adjustment for confounders, individuals experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited an increased risk for delivery < 37 weeks gestation compared to controls, 73 (14.8%) vs. 98 (10.2%) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.47 95% CI (1.03-2.09)]. Effect estimates for other obstetric outcomes and the neonatal composite outcome measure were not meaningfully different between SARS-CoV-2-patients versus controls. In sensitivity analyses, compared to controls, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibited: increases in cesarean delivery [aOR: 1.57 95% CI (1.09-2.27)]; postpartum length of stay [aOR 1.89 95% CI (1.18-2.60)]; delivery < 37 weeks gestation [aOR 2.08 95% CI (1.29-3.36)]. These adverse outcomes were not found in asymptomatic women versus controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients (asymptomatic and symptomatic) were less likely to receive neuraxial labor analgesia [aOR: 0.52 95% CI (0.35-0.75)] and more likely to receive general anesthesia for cesarean delivery [aOR: 3.69 95% CI (1.40-9.74)] due to maternal respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multicenter U.S. cohort study of women with and without peripartum SARS-CoV-2 infection, differences in obstetric and neonatal outcomes seem to be mostly driven by symptomatic patients. Lower utilization of neuraxial analgesia in laboring patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic infection compared to patients without infection requires further investigation.","Katz, Daniel; Bateman, Brian T; Kjaer, Klaus; Turner, Dana P; Spence, Nicole Z; Habib, Ashraf S; George, Ronald B; Toledano, Roulhac D; Grant, Gilbert; Madden, Hannah E; Butwick, Alex J; Lynde, Grant; Minehart, Rebecca D; Beilin, Yaakov; Houle, Timothy T; Sharpe, Emily E; Kodali, Bhavani; Bharadwaj, Shobana; Farber, Michaela K; Palanisamy, Arvind; Prabhu, Malavika; Gonzales, Nikolai Y; Landau, Ruth; Leffert, Lisa",,,504

Our approach focuses on spatial weights which are binary prior to row-standardization. However, unlike recent literature our approach requires no strong a priori assumptions on (socio-)economic distances between the spatial units. The estimation approach relies on efficient Gibbs sampling techniques and can be easily combined with and extended to more flexible spatial specifications. In addition to geographic prior structures, we also discuss shrinkage priors on the neighbourhood size, which are particularly useful in spatial panels where T is small relative to N.","Krisztin, Tam'as; Piribauer, Philipp",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11938v1.pdf,504
435402,Evaluating the clinical dyad leadership model: a narrative review,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious health crisis of our time. Global public measures have been enacted to try to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. The trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) community has overcome challenges in order to continue to deliver acute trauma care to patients and plan for challenges ahead. This review explores the lessons learnt, the priorities and the controversies that the T&O community has faced during the crisis. Historically, the experience of major incidents in T&O has focused on mass casualty events. The current pandemic requires a different approach to resource management in order to create a long-term, system-sustaining model of care alongside a move towards resource balancing and facilitation. Significant limitations in theatre access, anaesthetists and bed capacity have necessitated adaptation. Strategic changes to trauma networks and risk mitigation allowed for ongoing surgical treatment of trauma. Outpatient care was reformed with the uptake of technology. The return to elective surgery requires careful planning, restructuring of elective pathways and risk management. Despite the hope that mass vaccination will lift the pressure on bed capacity and on bleak economic forecasts, the orthopaedic community must readjust its focus to meet the challenge of huge backlogs in elective caseloads before looking to the future with a robust strategy of integrated resilient pathways. The pandemic will provide the impetus for research that defines essential interventions and facilitates the implementation of strategies to overcome current barriers and to prepare for future crises.","Madanipour, S; Iranpour, F; Goetz, T; Khan, S",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,504

This meta-analysis quantifies the prevalence of mortality among (1) diabetic and (2) non-diabetic, and (3) the prevalence of DM, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published studies were retrieved from four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and medRxiv) and appraised critically utilizing the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's tool. Meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model. The measures of heterogeneity were ascertained by I- squared (I 2 ) and Chi-squared (Chi 2 ) tests statistics. Predictors of heterogeneity were quantified using meta-regression models. Results: Of the reviewed 475 publications, 22 studies (chiefly case series (59.09 %)), sourcing data of 45,775 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, were deemed eligible. The weighted prevalence of mortality in hospitlized COVID-19 patients with DM (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 15.0-26.0; I 2 , 96.8 %) was 82 % (1.82-time) higher than that in non-DM patients (11.0 %, 95 % CI: 5.0-16.0; I 2 , 99.3 %). The prevalence of mortality among DM patients was highest in Europe (28.0 %; 95 % CI: 14.0-44.0) followed by the United States (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 11.0-32.0) and Asia (17.0 %, 95 % CI: 8.0-28.0). Sample size and severity of the COVID-19 were associated (p < 0.05) with variability in the prevalence of mortality. The weighted prevalence of DM among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 20 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 15-25, I 2 , 99.3 %). Overall, the quality of the studies was fair. Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were appreciably burdened with a high prevalence of DM. DM contributed to the increased risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to non-DM patients, particularly among critically ill patients.

439905,The Mediating Role of Perceived Social Support Between Resilience and Anxiety 1 Year After the COVID-19 Pandemic: Disparity Between High-Risk and Low-Risk Nurses in China,2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is rapidly expanding across the world, with more than 100,000 new cases each day as of end-June 2020. Healthcare workers are struggling to provide the best care for COVID-19 patients. Approaches for invasive ventilation vary widely between and within countries and new insights are acquired rapidly. We aim to investigate invasive ventilation practices and outcome in COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. Methods: PRoVENT-COVID ('study of PRactice of VENTilation in COVID-19') is an investigator-initiated national, multicenter observational study to be undertaken in intensive care units (ICUs) in The Netherlands. Consecutive COVID-19 patients aged 18 years or older, who are receiving invasive ventilation in the participating ICUs, are to be enrolled during a 10-week period, with a daily follow-up of 7 days. The primary outcome is ventilatory management (including tidal volume expressed as mL/kg predicted body weight and positive end-expiratory pressure expressed as cmH2O) during the first 3 days of ventilation. Secondary outcomes include other ventilatory variables, use of rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia such as prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, use of sedatives, vasopressors and inotropes; daily cumulative fluid balances; acute kidney injury; ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 (VFD-28), duration of ICU and hospital stay, and ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality. Discussion: PRoVENT-COVID will be the largest observational study to date, with high density ventilatory data and major outcomes. There is urgent need for a better understanding of ventilation practices, and the effects of ventilator settings on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The results of PRoVENT-COVID will be rapidly disseminated through electronic presentations, such as webinars and electronic conferences, and publications in international peer-reviewed journals. Access to source data will be made available through local, regional and national anonymized datasets on request, and after agreement of the PRoVENT-COVID steering committee.

441269,Model for Mitigation of Workplace Transmission of COVID-19 Through Population-Based Testing and Surveillance,2021,"The development of specific antiviral compounds to SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent task. One of the obstacles for the antiviral development is the requirement of biocontainment because infectious SARS-CoV-2 must be handled in a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Replicon, a non-infectious self-replicative viral RNA, could be a safe and effective tool for antiviral evaluation. Herein, we generated a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Eight fragments covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome except S, E, and M genes were amplified with HiBiT-tag sequence by PCR. The amplicons were ligated and in vitro transcribed to RNA. The cells electroporated with the replicon RNA showed more than 3000 times higher luminescence than MOCK control cells at 24 h post-electroporation, indicating robust translation and RNA replication of the replicon. The replication was drastically inhibited by remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. The IC50 of remdesivir in this study was 0.29 µM, generally consistent to the IC50 obtained using infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a previous study (0.77 µM). Taken together, this system could be applied to the safe and effective antiviral evaluation without using infectious SARS-CoV-2. Because this is a PCR-based and transient replicon system, further improvement including the establishment of stable cell line must be achieved.","Kotaki, Tomohiro; Xie, Xuping; Shi, Pei-Yong; Kameoka, Masanori",Sci Rep,,504

Transmission by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers rendered intervention and containment of the disease extremely challenging. Based on reported infection case studies, we construct an epidemiological model that focuses on transmission around the symptom onset. The model is calibrated against incubation period and pairwise transmission statistics during the initial outbreaks of the pandemic outside Wuhan with minimal non-pharmaceutical interventions. Mathematical treatment of the model yields explicit expressions for the size of latent and pre-symptomatic subpopulations during the exponential growth phase, with the local epidemic growth rate as input. We then explore reduction of the basic reproduction number R0 through specific transmission control measures such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and sheltering in place. When these measures are implemented in combination, their effects on R0 multiply. We also compare our model behaviour to the first wave of the COVID-19 spreading in various affected regions and highlight generic and less generic features of the pandemic development.","Tian, Liang; Li, Xuefei; Qi, Fei; Tang, Qian-Yuan; Tang, Viola; Liu, Jiang; Li, Zhiyuan; Cheng, Xingye; Li, Xuanxuan; Shi, Yingchen; Liu, Haiguang; Tang, Lei-Han",Nat Commun,,504
441284,Time for the ethical management of COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"Although the prognosis of advanced extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is poor, there have been no preclinical research models for the development of novel therapeutics. This study aims to establish a preclinical research model for EMPD. We transplanted EMPD tissue into immunodeficient NOD/Scid mice. Histopathological and genetic analyses using a comprehensive cancer panel were performed. For in vivo preclinical treatments, trastuzumab, lapatinib, docetaxel, or eribulin were administered to patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Tissue transplanted from the EMPD patient was enlarged in NOD/Scid mice and was transplanted into further generations. Both the transplantation of PDX into nu/nu mice and the reanimation of the cryopreserved xenografted tumors in NOD/Scid mice were successful. We also established an EMPD-PDX-derived primary cell culture. Histopathologically, the xenografted tumors were positive for CK7, which was consistent with the patient's tumors. Genetically, the pathogenic mutation ERBB2 S310F was detected in the patient's tumors (primary intraepidermal lesion, metastatic lymph node) and was observed in the xenografted tumors even after continued passages. The xenografted tumors responded well to trastuzumab and lapatinib therapy. Also, cytotoxic agents (docetaxel and eribulin) were effective against the xenografted tumors. This PDX model (EMPD-PDX-H1) could be a powerful tool for the research and development of EMPD treatments.","Maeda, Takuya; Kitamura, Shinya; Nishihara, Hiroshi; Yanagi, Teruki",Oncogene,,504

443126,The evaluation of a new multidimensional job insecurity measure in a Chinese context,2020,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global public health threaten. A series of strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China, contributing to the improvement of air quality. In this study, we described the trend of air pollutant concentrations and the incidence of COVID-19 during the epidemic and applied generalized additive models (GAMs) to assess the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 235 Chinese cities. Disease progression based on both onset and report dates as well as control measures as potential confounding were considered in the analyses. We found that stringent prevention and control measures intending to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, contributed to a significant decline in the concentrations of air pollutants except ozone (O3). Significant positive associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter with diameters &#8804;2.5 µm (PM2.5), particulate matter with diameters &#8804;10 µm (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with daily new confirmed cases were observed during the epidemic. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 (lag0-15), PM10 (lag0-15), and NO2 (lag0-20) were associated with a 7% [95% confidence interval (CI): (4-9)], 6% [95% CI: (3-8)], and 19% [95% CI: (13-24)] increase in the counts of daily onset cases, respectively. Our results suggest that there is a statistically significant association between ambient air pollution and the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the quarantine measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the spread by improving ambient air quality, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Zhang, Xinhan; Tang, Mengling; Guo, Fanjia; Wei, Fang; Yu, Zhebin; Gao, Kai; Jin, Mingjuan; Wang, Jianbing; Chen, Kun",Environ Pollut,,504

After clearing the infection, the patient remained asymptomatic for 5 months. He was then readmitted with a spontaneous haemothorax, most likely related to the use of dabigatran, which progressed to a pleural empyema with a trapped lung. The patient underwent a video assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) with decortication. Because of focal abnormalities, biopsies for histopathology were taken from the lung parenchyma. These showed an organizing pneumonia with progression towards fibrosis and arteries with intimal fibrosis. So far, no histopathological reports exist on late pulmonary changes after a COVID-19 infection. The unusual combined presence of microvascular damage and interstitial fibrosis may reflect a pathophysiological concept in which early endothelial damage by SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a chronic state of microvascular damage, low grade inflammation, and early progression towards pulmonary fibrosis.","Dikken, Johan L.; Maat, Alexander P.

445201,A Simple Algorithm for Return to Workplace Employer Antibody Testing,2020,"BACKGROUND: The use of teledermatology has spread over the last years, especially during the recent SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Teledermoscopy, an extension of teledermatology, consists of consulting dermoscopic images, also transmitted through smartphones, to remotely diagnose skin tumors or other dermatological diseases. The purpose of this work was to verify the diagnostic validity of images acquired with an inexpensive smartphone microscope (NurugoTM), employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify malignant melanoma (MM), melanocytic nevus (MN), and seborrheic keratosis (SK). METHODS: The CNN, trained with 600 dermatoscopic images from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive, was tested on three test sets: ISIC images, images acquired with the NurugoTM, and images acquired with a conventional dermatoscope. RESULTS: The results obtained, although with some limitations due to the smartphone device and small data set, were encouraging, showing comparable results to the clinical dermatoscope and up to 80% accuracy (out of 10 images, two were misclassified) using the NurugoTM demonstrating how an amateur device can be used with reasonable levels of diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: Considering the low cost and the ease of use, the NurugoTM device could be a useful tool for general practitioners (GPs) to perform the first triage of skin lesions, aiding the selection of lesions that require a face-to-face consultation with dermatologists.","Veronese, Federica; Branciforti, Francesco; Zavattaro, Elisa; Tarantino, Vanessa; Romano, Valentina; Meiburger, Kristen M; Salvi, Massimo; Seoni, Silvia; Savoia, Paola",Diagnostics (Basel),,504
445539,China experience from COVID-19: Mental health in mandatory quarantine zones urgently requires intervention,2020,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused health systems across the country to plan for field hospitals to care for patients outside of traditional healthcare settings in the event of a second surge. Here we describe key considerations for the implementation of pharmacy operations and a field hospital formulary at an offsite location within a 2-week time frame. SUMMARY: Development of an offsite field hospital formulary is first dependent on the location and patient population defined for the field hospital. Creation of a limited formulary for a planned field hospital in Michigan involved reviewing physical space limitations and drug distribution workflows, assessing current prescribing trends, creating drug categories, and creating formulary guidelines to limit formulary options in each therapeutic category. Ultimately, our institution developed a 140-medication field hospital formulary, a process to enable appropriate use of nonformulary drugs, and a mixed operations model including automated dispensing cabinets and a manual cart-fill process. Although the institution did not have to open the field hospital, the process used for developing the formulary and determining distribution models will allow for an immediate implementation if a second surge occurs. CONCLUSION: A methodical approach to developing limited formularies and pharmacy operations in a field hospital setting will allow health systems to establish efficient and effective medication distribution services in the event of a second surge of COVID-19 cases.","Bazzell, Brian; Wagner, Deb; Durant, Karin M; Callahan, Brian",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,504

450393,Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Students With Developmental Disabilities During COVID-19 Lockdown in Poland,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern. Telehealth is an effective option to fight the outbreak of COVID-19. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the role of telehealth services in preventing, diagnosing, treating, and controlling diseases during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted through searching five databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019, written in English language and published in peer reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Quality assessment was based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize and report the findings. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion out of the 142 search results. Currently, healthcare providers and patients who are self-isolating, telehealth is certainly appropriate in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This solution has the potential to prevent any sort of direct physical contact, provide continuous care to the community, and finally reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The use of telehealth improves the provision of health services. Therefore, telehealth should be an important tool in caring services while keeping patients and health providers safe during COVID-19 outbreak.","Monaghesh, Elham; Hajizadeh, Alireza",BMC Public Health,,504
450394,Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Students With Developmental Disabilities During COVID-19 Lockdown in Poland,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) were recommended to protect healthcare workers when providing care to infected patients. Despite their single-use disposable nature, the need to disinfect and repurpose FFRs is paramount during this global emergency. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if UV treatment has an observable impact on respirator integrity; (2) test the impact of UV treatment on N95 FFR user fit; and (3) test the impact of UV treatment on FFR integrity. Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection was assessed in maintaining N95 FFR integrity. Two models of FFRs were exposed to UV fluences ranging from 0 to 10,000 mJ cm-2 per side and subsequently tested for fit, respirator integrity, and airflow. Inspection of N95 FFRs before and after UV treatment via microscopy methods showed no observable or tactile abnormalities in the integrity of respirator material or straps. Tensile loading tests on UV-treated and untreated respirator straps also demonstrated no impact on breaking strength. Standardized fit test methods showed no compromise in user fit following UV treatment. Evaluation of particle penetration and airflow through N95 FFRs showed no impact on integrity, and average filtration efficiency did not fall below 95% for any of the respirator types or fluence levels. This work provides evidence that UV disinfection does not compromise N95 FFR integrity at UV fluences up to 10,000 mJ cm-2. UV disinfection is a viable treatment option to support healthcare professionals in their strategy against the spread of COVID-19.","Ontiveros, C Carolina; Sweeney, Crystal L; Smith, Christopher; MacIsaac, Sean; Bennett, Jessica L; Munoz, Sebastian; Stoddart, Amina K; Gagnon, Graham A",Sci Rep,,504

Since many people cope with stress by eating, the current study investigated whether eating behaviors shifted among U.S. adults after the emergence of the pandemic. Data from national, crowdsourced surveys conducted on March 31st, 2020 and February 13th, 2019 were compared. Average levels of eating to cope and food addiction symptoms did not appear to shift during the early stages of the pandemic; however, U.S. adults ate about 14% more added sugars. Moreover, greater stress in response to the pandemic was associated with greater eating to cope, added sugars intake, food addiction symptoms, drinking to cope, and drinking frequency. These associations differed by the presence of state-level stay-at-home orders, perceived vulnerability to disease, age, U.S. political party affiliation, and gender. Although eating behaviors did not appear to majorly shift during the early stages of the pandemic, stress from the pandemic may intensify some maladaptive coping tendencies among U.S. adults.","Cummings, Jenna R; Ackerman, Joshua M; Wolfson, Julia A; Gearhardt, Ashley N",Appetite,,504

With the onset of social distancing due to COVID-19, the field of pediatric neuropsychology is encouraged to consider the utility of non-traditional, tele-neuropsychological assessments. In order to accommodate ongoing service needs for medically and neurodevelopmentally complex children, a novel three-tiered telehealth service model of care was developed and implemented in a large pediatric outpatient neuro/psychological clinic within an academic medical center. METHOD: In this article, we provide case examples that illustrate the clinical implementation of this three-tiered telehealth service model of care for serving children during this uncertain time. CONCLUSION: The primary aim of this article is to provide examples outlining how clinical service decisions were made in the application of this three-tiered model for children with complex medical and neurodevelopmental histories. This article is intended to serve as a guide for other pediatric neuropsychology providers considering tele-neuropsychological services for complex pediatric patients during social distancing.","Peterson, Rachel K; Ludwig, Natasha N; Jashar, Dasal Tenzin",Clin Neuropsychol,,504

As a result, enormous efforts have been made globally to develop numerous vaccine candidates in a matter of months. Currently, over 30 vaccine candidates are under assessment in clinical trials, with several undergoing preclinical studies. Here, we reviewed the major vaccine candidates based on the specific vaccine platform utilized to develop them. We also discussed the immune responses generated by these candidates in humans and preclinical models to determine vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Finally, immune responses induced in recovered COVID-19 patients and their possible vaccine development implications were also briefly reviewed.","Jain, Swati; Batra, Himanshu; Yadav, Poonam; Chand, Subhash",,,504

459840,ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings: Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pharmacy operations-2020,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Stop the Bleed (STB) campaign was developed in part to educate the lay public about hemorrhage control techniques aimed at reducing preventable trauma deaths. Studies have shown this training increases bystanders' confidence and willingness to provide aid. One high-risk group might be better solicited to take the course: individuals who have been a victim of previous trauma, as high rates of recidivism after trauma are well-established. Given this group's risk for recurrent injury, we evaluated their attitudes toward STB concepts. METHODS: We surveyed trauma patients admitted to 3 urban trauma centers in Baltimore from January 8, 2020 to March 14, 2020. The survey was terminated prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trauma patients hospitalized on any inpatient unit were invited to complete the survey via an electronic tablet. The survey asked about demographics, prior exposure to life-threatening hemorrhage and first aid training, and willingness to help a person with major bleeding. The Johns Hopkins IRB approved waiver of consent for this study. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients completed the survey. The majority of respondents had been hospitalized before (92.9%) and had witnessed severe bleeding (60.7%). The majority had never taken a first aid course (60.7%) nor heard of STB (83.9%). Most respondents would be willing to help someone with severe bleeding form a car crash (98.2%) or gunshot wound (94.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients admitted for trauma had not heard about Stop the Bleed, but stated willingness to respond to someone injured with major bleeding. Focusing STB education on individuals at high-risk for trauma recidivism may be particularly effective in spreading the message and skills of STB.","Van Winkle, Bonnylin; DiBrito, Sandra R; Amini, Neda; Levy, Matthew J; Haut, Elliott R",J Surg Res,,504

461663,National mental health policy and Australia's 'Deaths of despair',2021,"A decline of T regulatory cell (Treg) number and function is associated with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA). However, the mechanism of downregulation of Tregs in URSA patients is still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the changes of Tregs in URSA patients and the epigenetic regulation for these changes. Venous blood samples were collected from 20 patients with URSA and 20 healthy control subjects. Treg number and inhibitory capacity, and Foxp3 mRNA expression and Foxp3 TSDR methylation were compared between the 2 groups. Correlations between Treg frequency and inhibitory function and TSDR methylation status were examined by Spearman's correlation. The proportion of Tregs within the population of CD4+ T cells and the expression of Foxp3 mRNA was significantly lower in URSA patients than in healthy control subjects. Tregs from URSA patients and healthy controls both significantly inhibited the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells toward K562 targets; however, the inhibitory ability of Tregs from URSA patients was significantly lower than that from healthy controls. The methylation level of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) in the Foxp3 gene was significantly greater in URSA patients than in the controls, and the level of methylation was inversely correlated with the proportion of Tregs and Foxp3 mRNA expression in the peripheral blood. However, the methylation level was not correlated with the inhibitory function of Tregs. A decrease of Treg number and function may be related to the pathogenesis of URSA, and Foxp3 hypermethylation may be associated with the decreased Treg number.","Zhu, Liqiong; Liu, Meilan; Zhang, Suning; Ou, Yuhua; Chen, Ying; Wei, Jing; Su, Fang; Chen, Hui; Zhang, Jianping",Reprod. sci,,504

An online-based cross-sectional survey, using a web-based interviewing technique, was conducted to collect data on DHL. Simple bivariate and multivariate linear regression was performed to assess the association of key characteristics with DHL. The results show a high DHL related to COVID-19 in 54.3% of students. Most of the Pakistani students demonstrated ~50% DHL in all dimensions, except for reliability. Multivariate findings showed that gender, sense of coherence and importance of information were found to be significantly associated with DHL. However, a negative association was observed with students' satisfaction with information. This led to the conclusion that critical operational and navigations skills are essential to achieve COVID-19 DHL and cope with stress, particularly to promote both personal and community health.

464406,The French general population's attitudes toward lockdown against COVID-19: a fragile consensus,2020,"INTRODUCTION: It is clear that a proportion of patients continue to suffer long-lasting symptoms following acute infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Persistent olfactory dysfunction is one of the commonest complaints reported in the condition colloquially known as long COVID (now known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)). The prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of long COVID olfactory dysfunction are not yet well understood. At present, the main stay of treatment is olfactory training. Quantitative olfactory testing and impacts on patient quality of life have not been widely studied. This study describes our experiences at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals, UK (WWL) of establishing a COVID-19 smell clinic, along with preliminary data on patient demographics, baseline smell test scores and quality of life questionnaire scores before olfactory training. METHODS: We piloted a COVID-19 smell clinic. We recorded patient demographics and clinical characteristics then performed clinical assessment of each patient. Quantitative measurements of olfactory dysfunction were recorded using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We measured the impact of olfactory dysfunction on patient quality of life using the validated English Olfactory Disorders Questionnaire (eODQ). RESULTS: 20 patients participated in the clinic. 4 patients were excluded from analysis due to missing data. Median age was 35 years. 81% (n=13) of the participants were female. 50% (n=8) of patients suffered with a combination of anosmia/ageusia and parosmia, whilst 43% (n=7) of patients suffered with anosmia/ageusia without parosmia. Almost all the patients registered UPSIT scores in keeping with impaired olfaction. Patient scores ranged from 22 to 35, with the median score at 30. All patients reported that their olfactory dysfunction had an impact on their quality of life. The median eODQ score reported was 90, with scores ranging from 42 to 169 out of a maximum of 180. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that it is simple and feasible to set up a COVID-19 smell clinic. The materials are inexpensive, but supervised completion of the UPSIT and eODQ is time-consuming. Patients demonstrate reduced olfaction on quantitative testing and experience significant impacts on their quality of life as a result. More research is needed to demonstrate if olfactory training results in measurable improvements in smell test scores and quality of life.","Chu, M.; Gopikrishna, D.; Rocke, J.; Kumar, B.

464860,Green and white teas as health-promoting foods,2021,"When it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic [1], various issues and problems arise for institutions and critical infrastructures. Institutions such as first responders can be affected by COVID-19 by temporary or permanent loss of their essential staff and resources and therefore loss of their carrying capacity. The gradual and partial loss of carrying capacity in combination with increased demand on first responder systems can potentially push these system towards their tipping point, and thus cause even more loss of capacity to respond to emergency situations. In addition to the increased mental and emotional pressure burdened on first responders due to the presence and dangers of the virus, emergency personnel such as police officers can experience increased workload and stress during the pandemic as well as exposure to symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals affected by COVID-19. By assessing the dynamic carrying capacity of the first responder systems and their interaction with the general population they provide service to, the resiliency of first responder systems can be assessed in face of various scenarios. The resiliency of first responder systems can be increased by designing extra capacity and preventing the system from coming into the proximity of its tipping point, which could result in partial or major collapse in performance of the system. Therefore, protecting the emergency personnel and these indispensable institutions as well as maintaining the capacity to respond to the majority of the emergency calls is paramount. Since the police force, hospitals, fire departments, and other care institutions are structures consisting of a wide range of individuals and operate in an ever-changing environment, this paper attempts to assess the resilience and capacity of such institutions via simulations to find and localize their tipping points. To enable such simulations, the model developed by Vierlboeck, Nilchiani, and Edwards [2] was extended with further branches to allow for simulations of sub-systems and loads thereof. For this paper, the police force of New York City (NYC) was chosen as a case study. To assess the police force performance, the capabilities and capacities of the sub-system were evaluated by testing its function under different circumstances and with different influencing factors such as fatigue [3] and the influence of the Yerkes-Dodsen Law [4]. This way, it was possible to assess the performance of the emergency personnel and provide information that could potentially be used for regulatory measures and decisions. The conducted evaluations and simulations studied the existing system's resiliency and its proximity to the system tipping point as the reduction of a number of emergency personnel is inevitable due to sickness caused by COVID-19. The baseline simulations showed performance drops under high loads which leaves the system in a more delicate state and vulnerable, with a higher tendency to collapse. Testing different scenarios, it was found that overall the system can tolerate a certain degree of changes in temporary demand. However, extended stress and increased demand on the emergency infrastructure systems can push them towards their tipping point and therefore cause irreversible damage.","Vierlboeck, M.; Nilchiani, R.

466591,Mental Health Nursing: waiting room intervention in integral health care,2020,"T cells play vital roles in the development and progression of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ T cells and immunoregulatory activity mediated by CD4+ T cells. Interleukin (IL)-9-secreting CD4+ T cells (Th9 cells) were recently found to be involved in the onset of ACS. We investigated regulatory role of Th9 cells to CD8+ T cells in patients with stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Circulating Th9 cells percentage, plasma IL-9 level, and PU.1 mRNA relative level was up-regulated in AMI patients compared with controls. There was no significant difference of IL-9-secreting CD8+ T cells percentage among groups. CD8+ T cells from AMI patients revealed increased cytotoxicity than those from controls, which presented as enhanced cytotolytic activity to target cells, increased interferon-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; secretion, elevated perforin and granzyme B production, and reduced programmed death-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4. IL-9 stimulation did not affect proliferation, but promoted CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity from both controls and AMI patients. IL-9-secreting CD4+ T cells were enriched in CD4+ CCR4- CCR6- CXCR3- cells. The enhancement of CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity induced by CD4+ CCR4- CCR6- CXCR3- cells was dependent on IL-9 secretion. The present results indicated that up-regulation of IL-9-secreting CD4+ T cells may contribute to pathogenesis of AMI through enhancement of CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity.","Gang, Hongsheng; Peng, Dingfeng; Hu, Yongjun; Tang, Shaoyong; Li, Songhai; Huang, Qing",APMIS,,504
467184,An American Disgrace,2020,"Off-grid electrification of remote communities using sustainable energy systems (SESs) is a requisite for realizing sustainable development goals Nonetheless, the capacity planning of the SESs is challenging as it needs to fulfil the fluctuating demand from a long-term perspective, in addition to the intermittency and unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) Owing to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the capacity planning problem, an efficient technique must be employed to achieve a cost-effective system Existing techniques are, subject to some constraints on the derivability and continuity of the objective function, prone to premature convergence, computationally demanding, follows rigorous procedures to fine-tune the algorithm parameters in different applications, and often do not offer a fair balance during the exploitation and exploration phase of the optimization process Furthermore, the literature review indicates that researchers often do not implement and examine the energy management scheme (EMS) of a microgrid while computing for the capacity planning problem of microgrids This paper proposes a rule-based EMS (REMS) optimized by a nature-inspired grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) for long-term capacity planning of a grid-independent microgrid incorporating a wind turbine, a photovoltaic, a battery (BT) bank and a diesel generator (Dgen) In which, a rule-based algorithm is used to implement an EMS to prioritize the usage of RES and coordinate the power flow of the proposed microgrid components Subsequently, an attempt is made to explore and confirm the efficiency of the proposed REMS incorporated with GOA The ultimate goal of the objective function is to minimize the cost of energy (COE) and the deficiency of power supply probability (DPSP) The performance of the REMS is examined via a long-term simulation study to ascertain the REMS resiliency and to ensure the operating limit of the BT storage is not violated The result of the GOA is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) The simulation results indicate that the proposed technique’s superiority is confirmed in terms of convergence to the optimal solution The simulation results confirm that the proposed REMS has contributed to better adoption of a cleaner energy production system, as the scheme significantly reduces fuel consumption, CO2 emission and COE by 92 4%, 92 3% and 79 8%, respectively as compared to the conventional Dgen The comparative evaluation of the algorithms shows that REMS-GOA yields a better result as it offers the least COE (objective function), at $0 3656/kW h, as compared to the REMS-CSA at $0 3662/kW h and REMS-PSO at $0 3674/kW h, for the desired DPSP of 0% Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to highlight the effect of uncertainties on the system inputs that may arise in the future","Bukar, Abba Lawan; Tan, Chee Wei; Yiew, Lau Kwan; Ayop, Razman; Tan, Wen-Shan",Energy Conversion and Management,,504

467660,Facemasks and the Covid 19 pandemic: What advice should health professionals be giving the general public about the wearing of facemasks?,2020,"Video calls using software such as Skype, Zoom and FaceTime can improve socialisation among older people and family, however it is unknown if video calls are able to improve socialisation among older people and their peers. Twenty-two residents across three British care homes engaged with each other using 'Skype quiz' sessions with the support of staff once a month over an eight-month trial. Video calls were accessed via a 'Skype on Wheels' intervention that comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad, or through Skype TV. Residents met other residents from the three care homes to build new friendships and participate in a thirty-minute quiz session facilitated by eight staff. Staff were collaborators who recruited older people, implemented the intervention and provided feedback that was analysed using thematic analysis. Residents enjoyed being able to see other residents' faces and surroundings. Analysis of the field notes revealed five themes of: residents with dementia remember faces not technology, inter and intra connectedness, re-gaining sense of self and purpose, situational loneliness overcome and organisational issues create barriers to long-term implementation. Inter-care home connection through video calls to reduce feelings of loneliness in residents seems acceptable and a feasible, low cost model, especially during times of public crisis such as COVID-19.","Zamir, Sonam; Hennessy, Catherine; Taylor, Adrian; Jones, Ray",,,504
467774,Homeopathic medicine as health promotion during COVID-19 pandemic period in Niteroi city: Abstract,2021,"Importance: Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies are urgently needed to reduce transmission in these high-risk populations. Objective: To evaluate COVID-19 transmission in nursing homes associated with contact-targeted interventions and testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical modeling study developed an agent-based susceptible-exposed-infectious (asymptomatic/symptomatic)-recovered model between July and September 2020 to examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes. Residents and staff of a simulated nursing home with 100 residents and 100 staff split among 3 shifts were modeled individually; residents were split into 2 cohorts based on COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were analyzed from September to October 2020. Exposures: In the resident cohorting intervention, residents who had recovered from COVID-19 were moved back from the COVID-19 (ie, infected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort to the non-COVID-19 (ie, susceptible and uninfected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort. In the immunity-based staffing intervention, staff who had recovered from COVID-19 were assumed to have protective immunity and were assigned to work in the non-COVID-19 cohort, while susceptible staff worked in the COVID-19 cohort and were assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment. These interventions aimed to reduce the fraction of people's contacts that were presumed susceptible (and therefore potentially infected) and replaced them with recovered (immune) contacts. A secondary aim of was to evaluate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with 2 types of screening tests (ie, rapid antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing) conducted with varying frequency. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated cumulative incidence proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 3 months. Results: Among the simulated cohort of 100 residents and 100 staff members, frequency and type of testing were associated with smaller outbreaks than the cohorting and staffing interventions. The testing strategy associated with the greatest estimated reduction in infections was daily antigen testing, which reduced the mean cumulative incidence proportion by 49% in absence of contact-targeted interventions. Under all screening testing strategies, the resident cohorting intervention and the immunity-based staffing intervention were associated with reducing the final estimated size of the outbreak among residents, with the immunity-based staffing intervention reducing it more (eg, by 19% in the absence of testing) than the resident cohorting intervention (eg, by 8% in the absence of testing). The estimated reduction in transmission associated with these interventions among staff varied by testing strategy and community prevalence. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that increasing the frequency of screening testing of all residents and staff, or even staff alone, in nursing homes may reduce outbreaks in this high-risk setting. Immunity-based staffing may further reduce spread at little or no additional cost and becomes particularly important when daily testing is not feasible.","Holmdahl, Inga; Kahn, Rebecca; Hay, James A; Buckee, Caroline O; Mina, Michael J",JAMA Netw Open,,504

469746,COVID-19 vaccination: returning to WHO's Health For All,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, is spreading around the world. Different individuals infected with COVID-19 have different manifestations. It is urgent to determine the risk factors of disease progress of COVID-19. 364 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, who were admitted to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from February 3, 2020 to March 16, 2020, were divided into mild, ordinary, severe, and critical groups, according to Chinese novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan. Peripheral blood IL-6 and leukocyte characteristics were analyzed, to evaluate the correlation with the severity of COVID-19. The levels of peripheral blood IL-6 were 2.35 ± 0.46 pg/ml (mild), 6.48 ± 1.13 pg/ml (ordinary), 20.30 ± 5.15 pg/ml (severe), and 123.48 ± 44.31 pg/ml (critical). The leukocytes were 5.70 ± 0.41×109/L (mild), 6.21 ± 0.14×109/L (ordinary), 6.37 ± 0.26×109/L (severe), and 10.03 ± 1.43×109/L (critical). The lymphocytes were 1.46 ± 0.19×109/L (mild), 1.89 ± 0.14×109/L (ordinary), 1.26 ± 0.07×109/L (severe), and 1.17 ± 0.23×109/L (critical). The neutrophils were 3.63 ± 0.36×109/L (mild), 3.78 ± 0.11×109/L (ordinary), 4.47 ± 0.25×109/L (severe), and 7.92 ± 1.19×109/L (critical). The monocytes were 0.42 ± 0.05×109/L (mild), 0.44 ± 0.01×109/L (ordinary), 0.46 ± 0.02×109/L (severe), and 0.78 ± 0.25×109/L (critical). Conclusively, increase of peripheral blood IL-6 and decrease of lymphocytes can be used as the indicators of severe COVID-19. The increase of neutrophils and monocytes was noticed in critical cases of COVID-19, suggesting that the increase of neutrophils and monocytes should be considered as risk factors of critical cases of COVID-19. Peripheral blood IL-6 and leukocyte characteristics were also analyzed in different age groups. The increase of serum IL-6, decrease of lymphocytes, and increase of neutrophils were noticed in patients over 60 years old.","Li, Quan; Xie, Yuyu; Cui, Zhangbo; Tang, Shi; Yuan, Baodong; Huang, Hai; Hu, Yanjie; Wang, Yaling; Zhou, Ming; Shi, Chunwei",Front Immunol,,504

Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can block virus-receptor binding through interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Trastuzumab prevents the binding of IL-6 to both sIL-6R and mIL-6R and thereby inhibits the cytokine storm syndrome induced by COVID-19.

471044,"John Wyn Owen: former director of the NHS in Wales, who introduced the concept of “health gain”",2020,"BACKGROUND: The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has recently affected Italy since February 21, constitutes a threat to normal subjects, as the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even death. There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). METHODS: When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-CoV-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting. RESULTS: We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care. CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that XLA patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B-cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease. However, there is a need for larger observational studies to extend these conclusions to other patients with similar genetic immune defects.","Soresina, Annarosa; Moratto, Daniele; Chiarini, Marco; Paolillo, Ciro; Baresi, Giulia; Focà, Emanuele; Bezzi, Michela; Baronio, Barbara; Giacomelli, Mauro; Badolato, Raffaele",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,,504

METHODS: After a two-day hands-on training, six panels of 150 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were cultured onto CT plates prepared in-house in two laboratories. Finally, triplicate readings of 900 CT plates resulted 18 DST patterns for each of the initial isolates. Time intervals to the results and for media preparations were estimated, as were intra- and interobserver agreements, test sensitivities and specificities calculated. BACTEC MGIT 960 DST was used as a reference. RESULTS: The median time to produce DST results for isoniazid, rifampicin and levofloxacin was 13 days. The CT sensitivity ranged from 94.7% for levofloxacin to 95.8% and 97.3% for isoniazid and rifampicin, respectively. The test specificities were even higher exceeding 97% for all three drugs tested. Interobserver agreement reached 100% in one of the laboratories and exceeded 97% for levofloxacin and 99% for isoniazid and rifampicin in the second laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the CT into a new laboratory was straightforward with only minimal guidance. This study proves that the CT is highly reproducible and easily interpreted by previously inexperienced personnel.","Klaos, Kadri; Agejeva, Anna; Kummik, Tiina; Laks, Sirje; Remets, Olesja; Sasi, Sirje; Tann, Anneli; Viiklepp, Piret; Altraja, Alan",Int. j. infect. dis,,504

472914,COVID-19 and Precarious Employment: Consequences of the Evolving Crisis,2021,"OBJECTIVES: One-fifth of Covid-19 patients suffer a severe course of Covid-19 infection; however, the specific causes remain unclear. Mast cells (MCs) are activated by SARS-CoV-2. Although only recently recognized, MC activation syndrome (MCAS), usually due to acquired MC clonality, is a chronic multisystem disorder with inflammatory and allergic themes, and an estimated prevalence of 17%. This paper describes a novel conjecture explaining how MCAS might cause a propensity for severe acute Covid-19 infection and chronic post-Covid-19 illnesses. METHODS: Observations of Covid-19 illness in patients with/without MCAS were compared with extensive clinical experience with MCAS. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19's hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have preliminarily been observed to be helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of the authors' treated MCAS patients with Covid-19 suffered severe infection, let alone mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperinflammatory cytokine storms in many severely symptomatic Covid-19 patients may be rooted in an atypical response to SARS-CoV-2 by the dysfunctional MCs of MCAS rather than a normal response by normal MCs. If proven, this theory has significant therapeutic and prognostic implications.","Afrin, Lawrence B; Weinstock, Leonard B; Molderings, Gerhard J",Int J Infect Dis,,504

However, whether vapers are more susceptible to COVID-19 is unknown. Using integrated data in each US state from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), United States Census Bureau and the 1Point3Acres.com website, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with negative binomial distribution assumption and log link functions were used to examine the association of statewide e-cigarette use prevalence with number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US on a state level from January 21, 2020 to April 25, 2020. The weighted proportion of vapers who used e-cigarettes every day or some days ranged from 2.86% to 6.42% for US states. Statistically significant associations were observed between the weighted proportion of vapers and number of COVID-19 cases as well as COVID-19 deaths in the US after adjusting for the weighted proportion of smokers and other significant covariates in the GEE models. With every one percent increase in weighted proportion of vapers in each state, the number of COVID-19 cases increase by 0.3139 (95% CI: 0.0554-0.5723) and the number of COVID-19 deaths increase by 0.3730 (95% CI: 0.0815-0.6646) in log scale in each US state. The positive associations between the proportion of vapers and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each US state in this ecological study suggest an increased susceptibility of vapers to COVID-19 on a state level and warrants further investigation.","Li, Dongmei; Croft, Daniel P; Ossip, Deborah J; Xie, Zidian",Prev Med Rep,,504

476805,Estimating vulnerability to COVID-19 in India - Authors' reply,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how telemedicine can be beneficial in many areas of orthopedic clinical practice through a literature narrative review. In addition, we discuss advantages, barriers, and enablers of such technology. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine in orthopedics was initially described to discuss simple cases among non-specialist doctors through videoconferencing. Recently, it evolved to postoperative follow-up on selected cases, physical examination, and even teleconsultations direct to patients. Studies have reported that consultation can be offered safely to selected patients. Although this topic is already being addressed for a long time, recent studies have reported that there is still resistance among many orthopedic surgeons. Telemedicine for orthopedics has safely expanded its operations. It can be used in postoperative follow-up of selected cases, fracture follow-up, and even in pediatric cases. Remote diagnosis of fractures is done successfully on an outpatient basis in many countries. Protocols and methods to standardize the virtual orthopedic examination for common musculoskeletal conditions have been developed. Satisfaction with teleconsultations as well as cost-effectiveness of remote care orthopedics were already well reported by some studies. We believe that remote care will be expanded in several hospitals around the world due to its huge potential. This fact is explained by natural technological development and by change and obliteration of habits accelerated exponentially after COVID-19 crisis.","Foni, Noel Oizerovici; Costa, Lauro Augusto Veloso; Velloso, Leandro Manuel Reis; Pedrotti, Carlos Henrique Sartorato",Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med,,504
477456,Investigating Preventive Behaviors Toward COVID-19 Among Iranian People,2021,"Improved understanding of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), within households could aid control measures. However, few studies have systematically characterized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in U.S. households (1). Previously reported transmission rates vary widely, and data on transmission rates from children are limited. To assess household transmission, a case-ascertained study was conducted in Nashville, Tennessee, and Marshfield, Wisconsin, commencing in April 2020. In this study, index patients were defined as the first household members with COVID-19-compatible symptoms who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, and who lived with at least one other household member. After enrollment, index patients and household members were trained remotely by study staff members to complete symptom diaries and obtain self-collected specimens, nasal swabs only or nasal swabs and saliva samples, daily for 14 days. For this analysis, specimens from the first 7 days were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using CDC RT-PCR protocols. A total of 191 enrolled household contacts of 101 index patients reported having no symptoms on the day of the associated index patient's illness onset, and among these 191 contacts, 102 had SARS-CoV-2 detected in either nasal or saliva specimens during follow-up, for a secondary infection rate of 53% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%-60%). Among fourteen households in which the index patient was aged <18 years, the secondary infection rate from index patients aged <12 years was 53% (95% CI = 31%-74%) and from index patients aged 12-17 years was 38% (95% CI = 23%-56%). Approximately 75% of secondary infections were identified within 5 days of the index patient's illness onset, and substantial transmission occurred whether the index patient was an adult or a child. Because household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is common and can occur rapidly after the index patient's illness onset, persons should self-isolate immediately at the onset of COVID-like symptoms, at the time of testing as a result of a high risk exposure, or at the time of a positive test result, whichever comes first. Concurrent to isolation, all members of the household should wear a mask when in shared spaces in the household.§.","Grijalva, Carlos G; Rolfes, Melissa A; Zhu, Yuwei; McLean, Huong Q; Hanson, Kayla E; Belongia, Edward A; Halasa, Natasha B; Kim, Ahra; Reed, Carrie; Fry, Alicia M; Talbot, H Keipp",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,504

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 497 pregnant women between May and July 2020 using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) to determine the effect of obstetrics history, fear of hospitalization, concerns about the pandemic, birth, and the health of both mother and infant, on antenatal depression during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. FINDINGS: The general EDS mean score of the total group was determined as mean 13.70 ± 6.22, which was higher than the critical cutoff point of 13. According to the multiple linear regression model applied in the study, the best predictive variables for the mean EDS score were determined to be concerned about completing a healthy pregnancy (r = -0.45), social media and news programs related to COVID-19 increasing levels of concern (r = -0.31), fear of hospitalization as the birth approaches (r = -0.45), having bad dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic (r = -0.41), the request for an elective cesarean delivery because of fear of catching COVID-19 (r = -0.40), fear of breastfeeding the infant (r = -0.45), and concerns that their own health would be negatively affected because of the pandemic (r = - 0.39), and these variables affected the mean EDS score negatively (total variance 40.5%, R = 0.642).

Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey carried out at a one-time point between April 3 and 18, 2020, enrolled 407 participants. Due to the imposed lockdown, respondents self-reported their weight and height. One dichotomized question (positive/negative) assessed the perception of weight change (yes = change perception, and no = no change perception). The variation in BMI was calculated by subtracting the estimated weight during confinement from the estimated weight before. Results: No significant variation in BMI was detected before and during the confinement (p = 0.40), while a perceived weight change was found in 212 (52.1%) participants. The regression analysis showed that higher fear of COVID-19 score (ORa = 0.96) and higher self-reported weight change (ORa = 0.47) were associated with lower weight change perception. However, longer confinement duration (ORa = 1.07), higher anxiety (ORa = 1.05), and high eating concerns (ORa = 1.81) were associated with higher weight change perception. Conclusion: Our results revealed that both the fear of COVID-19 and self-reported weight change were negatively associated with weight change perception, while higher anxiety and a longer duration of confinement correlated with a higher weight change perception. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings. © 2021","Haddad, C.; Zakhour, M.; Siddik, G.; Haddad, R.; Sacre, H.; Salameh, P.",Nutrition Clinique et Metabolisme,,504

482278,"What GDPR and the Health Research Regulations (HRRs) mean for Ireland: ""explicit consent""-a legal analysis",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of nursing supply flows, domestically and internationally. Its impact at the country-level has further highlighted preexisting nurse supply gaps and the effect of staffing shortages. Internationally, the pandemic has disrupted global supply chains. The world has witnessed the closing of borders, the interruption of travel, and, in some countries, the restriction of outflows. The State of the World's Nursing Report (SOWN) (WHO, 2020) noted a shortfall of almost six million nurses immediately pre-COVID-19, a shortage suffered particularly by low- and middle-income countries. This is of major concern given that increased international outflows of nurses in the new post-COVID era could undermine, even more than before, the readiness of those countries to meet healthcare demands (ICN, 2020). In this default scenario, some, but not all, highincome destination countries will continue to rely on international inflow of nurses to a significant extent, as they did pre-COVID- 19, further exacerbating the suffering of poor countries. Put simply, without country-level policy changes related to the nursing workforce and backed by international organisations, pre-COVID-19 trends of increased nurse flows from low- to high-income countries will likely continue. In this scenario, the iniquitous maldistribution of nurses may become more pronounced.

Our study was thus aimed to analyze the presence of secretory mucosal anti-SARS-CoV-2 type A immunoglobulins (IgA) in the conjunctival fluid of COVID-19 patients. The tears of 28 COVID-19 patients and 20 uninfected controls were collected by the Schirmer test and analyzed by a specific ELISA assay detecting anti-spike (S1) virus protein IgA. The results showed that 35.7% of COVID-19 subjects have specific antiviral IgA at the ocular level, persisting till 48 days post disease onset. Most of the IgA positive subjects presented mild symptoms. The collected data indicate a prolonged persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA at the eye level and suggest that IgA detection may be extremely helpful in clarifying virus pathology and epidemiology.","Caselli, Elisabetta; Soffritti, Irene; Lamberti, Giuseppe; D039,; Accolti, Maria; Franco, Filippo; Demaria, Davide; Contoli, Marco; Passaro, Angela; Contini, Carlo; Perri, Paolo",,,504

While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images. Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, video-level, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.","Roy, Subhankar; Menapace, Willi; Oei, Sebastiaan; Luijten, Ben; Fini, Enrico; Saltori, Cristiano; Huijben, Iris; Chennakeshava, Nishith; Mento, Federico; Sentelli, Alessandro; Peschiera, Emanuele; Trevisan, Riccardo; Maschietto, Giovanni; Torri, Elena; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Smargiassi, Andrea; Soldati, Gino; Rota, Paolo; Passerini, Andrea; van Sloun, Ruud J G; Ricci, Elisa; Demi, Libertario",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,,504

In the pursuit of new derivatives with improved operational temperatures, several""rational""strategies have been proposed and applied through a fluid transfer of knowledge between theoreticians and experimentalists. These have mainly focused on the choice of the magnetic ion and the design of an adequate coordination environment, both in terms of magnetic anisotropy and molecular vibrations. However, much of the progress has been achieved by serendipity, oversimplified theories and chemical intuition. In order to draw conclusions on the chemical design key parameters that govern the physical behavior of molecular nanomagnets in terms of magnetic memory, we apply here a state-of-the-art inferential statistical analysis to a body of over a thousand published experiments. Our analysis shows that the effective barrier derived from an Arrhenius equation displays an excellent correlation with the magnetic memory, and that there are only two promising strategies between all alternatives proposed so far, namely terbium bis-phthalocyaninato sandwiches and dysprosium metallocenes. In addition, we provide an interactive dashboard for visualizing the collected data, which contains all the reported cases between 2003 and 2019. This meta-study aims to dispel widespread theoretical misconceptions and will allow researchers in the field to avoid experimental blind alleys.","Duan, Yan; Coutinho, Joana T.; Rosaleny, Lorena E.; Cardona-Serra, Salvador; Baldov'i, Jos'e J.; Gaita-Arino, Alejandro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03199v1.pdf,504

METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2013, data from patients who underwent curative radical gastrectomy and consequently received AC for pathologic stage 2 or 3 gastric cancer at 27 institutions in South Korea were analyzed. RESULTS: The study enrolled 925 patients, 661 patients (71.5%) who completed 8 cycles of AC and 264 patients (28.5%) who did not. Compared with the mean disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients who completed 8 AC cycles (69.3 months), the mean DFS of patients who completed 6 AC cycles (72.4 months; p = 0.531) and those who completed 7 AC cycles (63.7 months; p = 0.184) did not differ significantly. However, the mean DFS of the patients who completed 5 AC cycles (48.2 months; p = 0.016) and those who completed 1-4 AC cycles (62.9 months; p = 0.036) was significantly lower than the DFS of those who completed 8 AC cycles. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the mean DFS was significantly affected by advanced stage, large tumor size, positive vascular invasion, and number of completed AC cycles (1-5 cycles: hazard ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.08; p = 0.041). CONCLUSION: The current multicenter observational cohort study showed that the mean DFS for 6 or 7 AC cycles was similar to that for 8 AC cycles as an adjuvant treatment for gastric cancer.","Jeong, Sang-Ho; Yoo, Moon-Won; Son, Young-Gil; Oh, Sung Jin; Kim, Jong-Han; Kim, Hyoung-Il; Park, Joong-Min; Hur, Hoon; Jee, Ye Seob; Hwang, Sun-Hwi; Jin, Sung-Ho; Lee, Sang Eok; Lee, Yong-Joon; Seo, Kyung Won; Park, Sungsoo; Lee, Chang Min; Kim, Chang Hyun; Jeong, In Ho; Lee, Han Hong; Choi, Sung Il; Lee, Sang-Il; Kim, Chan Young; Chae, Hyundong; Son, Myoung-Won; Pak, Kyung Ho; Kim, Sungsoo; Lee, Moon-Soo; Min, Jae-Seok",Ann. surg. oncol,,504

We show that during the earlier part of the epidemic, using travel data increases the predictions. Training the model to forecast also enables learning characteristics of the epidemic. In particular, we show that changes in model parameters over time can help us quantify how well a state or a country has responded to the epidemic. The variations in parameters also allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.","Srivastava, Ajitesh; Prasanna, Viktor K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11372v3.pdf,504

This extends to the self-other relationship as there is both being infected and infecting the other. What this pandemic crisis tells us about our self and relatedness, its cultural differences, and how these are rooted in the brain's relation to the world. METHODS: First, we discuss about the psychological and neuronal features of self and and self-other relation and how they are rooted in a deeper layer of the brain's neural activity complemeting its cognitive surface layer. Secondly, we demonstrate cultural differences of eastern and western concepts of self, i.e., independency and inter-dependency, and how these reflect the manifestation of the brain's neuro-social and -ecological alignment. Finally, we highlight how inter-subjective and cultural nature of self surface in the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Discussing various lines of empirical data showing the brain's intimate alignment to both social and ecological environmental contexts our results support the assumption of the brain's deep layer features by laying bare a continuum of different degrees of neuro-social and neuro-ecological alignment. This entails a a two-stage model of self with neuro-social-ecological and psychological levels that extends the previously suggested basis model of self-specificity (BMSS). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the current pandemic shows the importance of the deeper inter-subjective and cultural layers of both self and brain; their neglect can be life-threatening for self and others and, paradoxically, might reduce, rather than enlarge, the self's sense of freedom and independence.

Probabilistic models were applied to assess the probability of secondary infections while availing the public transport after the release of the lockdown. RESULTS: The model predicted that transition from sub-exponential to exponential transmission occurs around eighth week after the reporting a cluster of cases. The probability of the secondary infections with a single index case in an enclosure of the city bus and the sub-urban train general coach and ladies coach was found to be 0.192, 0.074 and 0.114 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nowcasting at the early stage of the epidemic predicts the probable time point of the exponential transmission and alerts the public health system. After the lockdown release, public transports will be the major sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in metro cities and appropriate strategies based on nowcasting are highly desirable.","Krishnamurthy, Kamalanand; Ambikapathy, Bakiya; Kumar, Ashwani; Britto, Lourduraj De",,,504

All countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19 by March 17. In response to the pandemic, different European countries took different approaches. This paper compares the impact of different containment measures taken by European countries in response to COVID-19 on their electricity consumption profiles. The comparisons are made for Spain, Italy, Belgium and the UK as countries with severe restrictions, and for the Netherlands and Sweden as countries with less restrictive measures. The results show that the consumption profiles reflect the difference in peoples’ activities in different countries using various measures.","Bahmanyar, Alireza; Estebsari, Abouzar; Ernst, Damien",Energy Res.

However, the diagnosis by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is costly and time-consuming. Several methods of group testing have been developed to overcome this problem. The proposed strategy offers optimization of group testing according to the available resources by decreasing not only the number of the assays but also the turnaround time. The initial classification of the samples would be done according to the intention of testing defined as diagnostic or screening/surveillance, achieving the best possible homogeneity. The proposed stratification of pooling is based on branching (divisions) and depth (levels of re-pooling) of the original group in association with the estimated probability of a positive sample. The dilutional effect of the grouped samples has also been considered. The margins of minimum and maximum conservation of assays of pooled specimens are calculated and the optimum strategy can be selected in association with the probability of positive samples in the original group. This algorithm intends to be a useful tool for group testing offering a choice of strategies according to the requirements.","Perivolaropoulos, Christos; Vlacha, Vasiliki",J Med Virol,,504
502995,Health workforce response to Covid-19: What pandemic preparedness planning and action at the federal and state levels in Germany?: Germany's health workforce responses to Covid-19,2021,"The present study employed an ex-Gaussian model of response times (RTs) to elucidate the cognitive processes related to experimentally induced state anxiety (SA) and vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV), an indicator of adaptive responses in both cognitive and affective domains. Participants (nâ¯=â¯110) completed a dual task composed of (i) a flanker attention and (2) working memory load task, while SA was induced by threat of noise. Electrocardiography was measured during the task and during four baseline periods in order to calculate vmHRV. RTs on the flanker task were fit to an ex-Gaussian distribution, which estimated three RT parameters: mu (Gaussian mean), sigma (Gaussian SD), and tau (combination of exponential mean and SD). First, findings indicate that threat of noise was associated with reductions in mu and tau, suggesting that SA might improve attention and motor responding. Second, higher resting vmHRV was associated with relatively lower tau (averaged across conditions), as well as to relatively stronger threat-related decreases in tau. Third, intra-individual decreases in vmHRV were accompanied by concomitant decreases in tau. These findings support roles for trait and state vagal control in guiding adaptive anxiety-related (and anxiety-unrelated) attentional responses. Findings are consistent with extant theories that emphasize functional interrelations among emotion, cognition, and vagal function.","Spangler, Derek P; Cox, Katherine R; Thayer, Julian F; Brooks, Justin R; Friedman, Bruce H",Int. j. psychophysiol,,504

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with laboratory-confirmed co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV in a designated hospital. Patients were divided into medicine group (n = 12) and non-medicine group (n = 8) according to previous ART history before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The median age was 46.5 years and 15 (75%) were female. Ten patients had initial negative RT-PCR on admission, 5 of which had normal CT appearance and 4 were asymptomatic. Lymphocytes were low in 9 patients (45%), CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 were low in all patients. The predominant CT features in 19 patients were multiple (42%) ground-glass opacities (58%) and consolidations (32%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in the medicine group was significantly lower than that in the non-medicine group [median (interquartile range, IQR):14.0 (10.0-34.0) vs. 51.0 (35.8-62.0), P = 0.005]. Nineteen patients (95%) were discharged with a median hospital stay of 30 days (IQR, 26-30). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection exhibited mild to moderate symptoms. The milder extent of inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection might be associated with a previous history of ART in HIV-infected patients.","Liu, Jia; Zeng, Wenjuan; Cao, Yukun; Cui, Yue; Li, Yumin; Yao, Sheng; Alwalid, Osamah; Yang, Fan; Fan, Yanqing; Shi, Heshui",Int J Infect Dis,,504

508447,Admissions to Norwegian Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide. Therefore, it is critically important to identify new useful markers that can be easily obtained in routine practice. Inflammation is a crucial issue in the pathogenesis and development of cancer. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of absolute monocyte count, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), the combination of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR-PLR), and combined platelet and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLT-NLR) in peripheral blood samples of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 160 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery, and 42 healthy controls. The status of absolute monocyte count, MLR, NLR-PLR and PLT-NLR was calculated on the basis of blood samples obtained before and after surgery. Haematologic factors were examined in correlation with the type of tumour growth, tumour size, histological type, percentage of mucinous component, grade of malignancy, Tumour-Node-Metastasis stage, venous, lymphatic and perineural invasion of cancer cells, status of lymph node invasion and the presence of cancer cell deposits. The Kaplan-Meier method and the long-rank test were used to compare survival curves. To determine independent prognostic factors, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied. RESULTS: The PLT-NLR status was correlated with tumour size and the presence of perineural invasion (P = 0.015; P = -0.174, P = 0.037). Moreover, high NLR-PLR and PLR-NLR ratios in the blood samples obtained after surgery were positively associated with histological type of cancer and percentage of the mucinous component (NLR-PLR: P = 0.002; P = 0.009; PLR-NLR status: P = 0.002; P = 0.007). The analysis of 5-year disease-free survival showed that the MLR of whole blood obtained after surgery [HR = 2.903, 95%CI: (1.368-6.158), P = 0.005] and the status of lymph node metastasis [HR = 0.813, 95%CI: (0.653-1.013), P = 0.050] were independent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The postoperative MLR in whole blood samples can be used as an independent prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer.","Jakubowska, Katarzyna; Koda, Mariusz; Grudzinska, Malgorzata; Kanczuga-Koda, Luiza; Famulski, Waldemar",World J Gastroenterol,,504
508611,COVID-19 in Gaza: a pandemic spreading in a place already under protracted lockdown,2020,"Chronic pain causes significant suffering, limitation of daily activities and reduced quality of life. Infection from COVID-19 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to systemic complications and death. Led by the World Health Organization, healthcare systems across the world are engaged in limiting the spread of infection. As a result, all elective surgical procedures, outpatient procedures and patient visits, including pain management services, have been postponed or cancelled. This has affected the care of chronic pain patients. Most are elderly with multiple comorbidities, which puts them at risk of COVID-19 infection. Important considerations that need to be recognised during this pandemic for chronic pain patients include: ensuring continuity of care and pain medications, especially opioids; use of telemedicine; maintaining biopsychosocial management; use of anti-inflammatory drugs; use of steroids; and prioritising necessary procedural visits. There are no guidelines to inform physicians and healthcare providers engaged in caring for patients with pain during this period of crisis. We assembled an expert panel of pain physicians, psychologists and researchers from North America and Europe to formulate recommendations to guide practice. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, these recommendations are based on the best available evidence and expert opinion at this present time and may need adapting to local workplace policies.","Shanthanna, H; Strand, N H; Provenzano, D A; Lobo, C A; Eldabe, S; Bhatia, A; Wegener, J; Curtis, K; Cohen, S P; Narouze, S",Anaesthesia,,504

METHODS: To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12%) and asthma (n=19, 15%). Twenty-eight patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and six patients died in our unit. CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P<0.05) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

In such a situation, the rise and fall of the number of affected cases or deaths has turned into a constant headline in most news channels. Consequently, there is a lack of positivity in the world-wide news published in different forms of media. Texts based on news articles, movie reviews, tweets, etc. are often analyzed by researchers, and mined for determining opinion or sentiment, using supervised and unsupervised methods. The proposed work takes up the challenge of mining a comprehensive set of online news texts, for determining the prevailing sentiment in the context of the ongoing pandemic, along with a statistical analysis of the relation between actual effect of COVID-19 and online news sentiment. The amount and observed delay of impact of the ground truth situation on online news is determined on a global scale, as well as at country level. The authors conclude that at a global level, the news sentiment has a good amount of dependence on the number of new cases or deaths, while the effect varies for different countries, and is also dependent on regional socio-political factors.","Chakraborty, Amartya; Bose, Sunanda",J Comput Soc Sci,,504

512351,Perspectives from the frontline: A pharmacy department’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Covid19 infection is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a novel member of the coronavirus (CoV) family. CoV genomes code for a ORF1a / ORF1ab polyprotein and four structural proteins widely studied as major drug targets. The genomes also contain a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs) coding for accessory proteins that are not essential for virus replication, but appear to have a role in pathogenesis. The accessory proteins have been less well characterized and are difficult to predict by classical bioinformatics methods. METHODS: We propose a computational tool GOFIX to characterize potential ORFs in virus genomes. In particular, ORF coding potential is estimated by searching for enrichment in motifs of the X circular code, that is known to be over-represented in the reading frames of viral genes. RESULTS: We applied GOFIX to study the SARS-CoV-2 and related genomes including SARS-CoV and SARS-like viruses from bat, civet and pangolin hosts, focusing on the accessory proteins. Our analysis provides evidence supporting the presence of overlapping ORFs 7b, 9b and 9c in all the genomes and thus helps to resolve some differences in current genome annotations. In contrast, we predict that ORF3b is not functional in all genomes. Novel putative ORFs were also predicted, including a truncated form of the ORF10 previously identified in SARS-CoV-2 and a little known ORF overlapping the Spike protein in Civet-CoV and SARS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to characterizing sequence properties of accessory genes of SARS coronaviruses, and especially the newly acquired genes making use of overlapping reading frames.","Michel, Christian Jean; Mayer, Claudine; Poch, Olivier; Thompson, Julie Dawn",Virol J,,504

513386,Prioritising mental health after the pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the past few months, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused extensive economic and social damage. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19-related measures on partner relationships and sexual and reproductive health in China. METHODS: From May 1 to 5, 2020, 3500 young Chinese individuals were recruited through WeChat or Weibo to participate in a survey to obtain information on sexual and reproductive health (eg, sexual desire, frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual satisfaction, etc). The questionnaire also collected demographic data (eg, age, race, education, current financial status, sexual orientation, relationship status, etc). RESULTS: In total, 967 participants were included in the sexual health analysis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, 22% of participants (n=212) reported a decrease in sexual desire; 41% (n=396) experienced a decrease in the sexual intercourse frequency; 30% (n=291) reported an increase in the frequency of masturbation; 20% (n=192) reported a decrease in alcohol consumption before or during sexual activities, and 31% (n=298) reported a deterioration in partner relationships during the pandemic. The logistic regression analysis indicated that the following influenced partner relationships: accommodations during the pandemic (P=.046; odds ratio [OR] 0.59; 95% CI 0.30-0.86); exclusive relationship status (yes or no) (P<.001; OR 0.44; 95 % CI 0.27-0.73); sexual desire (P=.02; OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.38-2.97); and sexual satisfaction (P<.001; OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.54-2.50). COVID-19 also caused disruptions in reproductive health services such as prenatal and postnatal care, childbirth and abortion services, contraception availability, and the management of sexually transmitted infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that many young people have wide-ranging issues affecting their sexual and reproductive health due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures. Strategies and guidelines are needed to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health of young people during this pandemic.","Li, Guanjian; Tang, Dongdong; Song, Bing; Wang, Chao; Qunshan, Shen; Xu, Chuan; Geng, Hao; Wu, Huan; He, Xiaojin; Cao, Yunxia",J Med Internet Res,,504
514688,The mental health and lifestyle impacts of COVID-19 on bipolar disorder,2021,"Due to the government's early intervention such as mass lockdown and curtailment strategies towards mass gatherings, amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the organization of the voluntary blood donation camps have been suspended. It's most significant impact on the blood community has been a dramatic decrease in the number of blood donors. Therefore, our blood stock has almost dried up and put our inventory in a state of jeopardy. Additionally, all the elective surgeries and non-urgent clinical interventions have also been deferred during this time. This has led to a drop in the blood collection, demand as well as the issue at our blood center. With this backdrop, we intended to assess the effect of this mass lockdown on our blood supply management, particularly in two phases [phase-I prior to the outbreak] and phase-II [during the outbreak]. Transitioning back to the normal conditions would most likely depend on the extent and the time duration of this pandemic and associated behavioural change, which is foreseen to remain in effect well beyond the original estimates.","Raturi, M; Kusum, A",Transfus Clin Biol,,504

We examined the coding sequences of 10 common variable immunodeficiency-associated genes obtained by the whole-exome sequencing of 121 hospitalized patients. These 10 genes showed significant enrichment in predicted pathogenic point mutations in severe patients compared with the non-severe ones. Moreover, in the TNFRSF13C gene, the minor allele of the p.His159Tyr variant, which is known to increase NF-kB activation and B-cell production, was significantly more frequent in the 38 severe cases compared to both the 83 non-severe patients and the 375 asymptomatic subjects further genotyped. This finding identified a potential genetic risk factor of severe COVID-19 that not only may serve to unravel the mechanisms underlying the disease severity but, also, may contribute to build the rationale for individualized management based on B-cell therapy.","Russo, Roberta; Andolfo, Immacolata; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Cantalupo, Sueva; Marra, Roberta; Frisso, Giulia; Abete, Pasquale; Cassese, Gian Marco; Servillo, Giuseppe; Esposito, Gabriella; Gentile, Ivan; Piscopo, Carmelo; Della Monica, Matteo; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Russo, Giuseppe; Cerino, Pellegrino; Buonerba, Carlo; Pierri, Biancamaria; Zollo, Massimo; Iolascon, Achille; Capasso, Mario",,,504

METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, medRxiv and SSRN were searched (May 02, 2020 to August 12, 2020) for non-randomised observational CoViD-19 studies. Event/patient numbers were extracted, comparing ACE inhibitor/ARB treatment (and each separately), to treatment with neither drug, for the outcomes: (a) Likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) CoViD-19 severity (including hospitalisation, Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU), ventilation); (c) Case-fatality. Risk of bias was assessed (ROBINS-I). Random-effects meta-analysis estimates were pooled. Eighty six studies including 459,755 patients (103,317 with hypertension), were analysed. In patients with hypertension, ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment was not associated with a greater likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 60,141 patients (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.14), hospitalisation in 5,925 patients (OR 0.90, 0.62-1.31), ITU in 7,218 patients (OR 1.06, 0.73-1.56), ventilation (or ITU/ventilation/death) in 13,163 patients (OR 0.91, 0.72-1.15) or case-fatality in 18,735 patients with 2,893 deaths (OR 0.75, 0.61-0.92).

521245,Mobile health approaches to disease surveillance in Africa;Wellvis COVID triage tool,2021,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. METHODS: In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and &#8805;75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). FINDINGS: During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205â639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21â447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1·39% (95% credible interval 1·04-1·77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and &#8805;75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0·116% (0·0729-0·148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0·939% (0·729-1·19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4·87% (3·37-6·89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14·2% (10·2-18·1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6·72% (5·52-8·01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19·1% (14·7-21·9) for those aged 75 years and older. INTERPRETATION: Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

Le scanner thoracique est un outil diagnostique et pronostique essentiel de la prise en charge des patients et les lésions typiques de la pneumonie à Sars-CoV-2 sont à présent bien établies. Cependant, certaines anomalies vasculaires rencontrées chez la plupart des patients, qui se traduisent par un aspect épaissi et irrégulier des vaisseaux pulmonaires au sein des zones pathologiques, sontsous-estimées et peu connues des radiologues. Données récentes : Les études histologiques soulignent la prépondérance des atteintes pariétales vasculaires au niveau pulmonaire qui peuvent être corrélées aux anomalies scanographiques. Ces dernières permettent d’orienter le diagnostic en cas de doute biologique ou de progression des lésions en verre dépoli. Elles suggèrent que l’atteinte alvéolo-interstitielle, sans anomalie bronchique ou bronchiolaire associée, pourrait être secondaire aux lésions vasculaires. Enfin, des études complémentaires sont nécessaires pour rechercher un éventuel intérêt pronostique de la quantification de ces lésions. Conclusion : Ce travail illustre les corrélations radio-histologiques des atteintes vasculaires et pulmonaires du Sars-Cov-2 et propose une iconographie didactique des principales lésions rencontrées. Summary Introduction : The Sars-CoV-2 pandemic has started a year ago, and to this day, the pathophysiology of lung parenchymal lesions is not fully understood. Chest-CT is an essential diagnostic and prognostic tool to evaluate the disease, and findings of Covid-19 pneumonia are well established. However, vascular abnormalities have been reported in a vast majority of patients, such as irregularities and enlargement of the distal pulmonary vessels, and they are not yet well-known or recognised by most radiologists. Recent findings : Histological studies have shown vascular mural infiltration and multiple abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature. These can be correlated to the chest-CT findings, and may raise the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia when there is a biological doubt or progression of ground-glass opacities of unknown origin. They suggest that the alveolo-interstitial lesions, which are not associated with bronchial abnormalities, could be secondary to the vascular damages. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the prognostic value of the extent of pulmonary vascular abnormalities on chest-CT. Conclusion : This work correlates the radiological and the histological findings of pulmonary vascular lesions in Sars-Cov-2 pneumonia and provides an extensive iconography of the main encountered abnormalities.","Baque-Juston, M.; Guesmi, M.; Foglino, P.; Mondot, L.; Burel-Vandenbos, F.; Chassang, M.; Dellamonica, J.",Journal d&#039;imagerie diagnostique et interventionnelle,,504

Results: A total of 239 patients were divided into the younger group (<60 years; n=181) and the older group (≥60 years; n=58). In both groups, fever and cough were common symptoms. However, dyspnea was more frequent in older patients than younger patients (20.7% versus 9.9%, p=0.032). Compared with younger patients, older patients harbored more severe cases (37.9% versus 17.1%, p=0.001) and comorbidities (58.6% versus 21.0%, p<0.001) such as hypertension and diabetes.

This study provides a basis for further investigation of the anti-HBV activity and possible mechanism of action of 1246TGG.","Xiang, Yang-fei; Ju, Huai-qiang; Li, Shen; Zhang, Ying-jun; Yang, Chong-ren; Wang, Yi-fei",Virol Sin,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-010-3144-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20960184/,504
590770,"Bradford Hill’s criteria, emerging zoonoses, and One Health",2015-11-14,"This study analyzes the effects of COVID-19 confinement on the autonomous learning performance of students in higher education. Using a field experiment with 458 students from three different subjects at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain), we study the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is the group of students that had their face-to-face activities interrupted because of the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect of the COVID-19 confinement on students’ performance. This effect is also significant in activities that did not change their format when performed after the confinement. We find that this effect is significant both in subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that did not change the student workload. Additionally, an analysis of students’ learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study on a continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement changed students’ learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students’ assessment are expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in their learning performance.","Gonzalez, T.; de la Rubia, M.

This article describes a survey on BToV in Brazil carried out on 80 fecal samples from diarrheic young and adult cattle, using a nested-RT-PCR targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. BToV was detected in 6.25% (5/80) of stool samples from three different geographic regions. Sequences analysis showed that Brazilian BToVs have a high degree of identity with European and Japanese BToVs and a lower degree of identity with North American Breda 1 strain.

We investigated distinctive clinical features of HBoV-positive children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS AND RESULTS: During April 2007–July 2009, for 402 hospitalized children younger than 2 years with LRTI, we prospectively examined virus genomes in nasopharyngeal swabs for HBoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenzavirus, and adenovirus. The HBoV genomes were identified in 34 patients (8.5%). Clinical and laboratory data of HBoV-positive and other virus/bacteria-negative patients (n = 18) were analyzed and compared with data of RSV-single positive patients (n = 99). The seasonal distribution of HBoV exhibits a concentration of cases during March–September, with most RSV cases occurring during winter in Japan. The minimum age of HBoV-positive patients was 5 months, although 44 patients (44%) with RSV were younger than 6 months. The main clinical features were respiratory distress and hypoxia. Hypoxia advances within 3 days after onset. The mean oxygen saturation on arrival was 92.8%, which was significantly lower than that in patients with RSV (p < 0.001). White blood cell counts were similar among groups. However, the percentage of neutrophils in white blood cells were significantly higher in HBoV-positive patients (62 vs. 45%, p < 0.001). Their prognoses were good. Their hospital stays were 6.6 days.

592795,Guest Editorial: Articles selected from the 2020 International Conference on Health Policy Statistics,2021-02-02,"Progressive fibrosis leads to loss of organ function and affects many organs as a result of excessive extracellular matrix production. The ubiquitous matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) is central to this through association with its primary receptor, CD44, which exists as standard CD44 (CD44s) or multiple splice variants. Mediators such as profibrotic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β are widely associated with fibrotic progression. TGF-β1 induces myofibroblast differentiation, while IL-1β induces a proinflammatory fibroblast phenotype that promotes fibroblast binding to monocyte/macrophages. CD44 expression is essential for both responses. Potential CD44 splice variants involved, however, are unidentified. The TGF-β1-activated CD44/epidermal growth factor receptor complex induces differentiation of metastatic cells through interactions with the matrix metalloproteinase inducer, CD147. This study aimed to determine the CD44 variants involved in TGF-β1- and IL-1β-mediated responses and to investigate the potential profibrotic role of CD147. Using immunocytochemistry and quantitative PCR, standard CD44s were shown to be essential for both TGF-β1-induced fibroblast/myofibroblast differentiation and IL-1β-induced monocyte binding. Co-immunoprecipitation identified that CD147 associated with CD44s. Using CD147-siRNA and confocal microscopy, we also determined that incorporation of the myofibroblast marker, αSMA, into F-actin stress fibers was prevented in the absence of CD147 and myofibroblast-dependent collagen gel contraction was inhibited. CD147 did not associate with HA, but removal of HA prevented the association of CD44s with CD147 at points of cell–cell contact. Taken together, our data suggest that CD44s/CD147 colocalization is essential in regulating the mechanical tension required for the αSMA incorporation into F-actin stress fibers that regulates myofibroblast phenotype.","Woods, Emma L.; Grigorieva, Irina V.; Midgley, Adam C.; Brown, Charlotte V.M.; Lu, Yueh-an; Phillips, Aled O.; Bowen, Timothy; Meran, Soma; Steadman, Robert",J Biol Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34364871/,504
592851,Brazil’s more doctors programme and infant health outcomes: a longitudinal analysis,2021-08-14,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global health emergency. Recent data indicate a 50% mortality rate across UK intensive care units. METHODS: A single institution, two-centre retrospective analysis following implementation of a Decision Support tool and real-time data dashboard for early detection of patients requiring personalised enhanced care, focussing particularly on respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure, oxygenation indices, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin. Protocols differing from conventional practice included high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for all COVID-19 positive patients and antioxidant prescription. RESULTS: By 22nd April 2020, 923 patients tested COVID-19 positive. 569 patients (61.7%) were male. The majority presented with advanced disease: interquartile ranges were C-reactive protein 44.9-179mg/L, D-dimer 1070-3802ng/L, and ferritin 261-1208g/L. Completed case fatality rates were 25.1% [95% CI 20.0, 30.0] in females, 40.5% [95% CI 35.9, 45.0] in males. 139 patients were admitted to intensive care where current death rates are 16.2% [95% CI 3.8, 28.7] in females, 38.2% [95% CI 28.6, 47.8] in males with no trends for differences based on ethnicity. A real-time traffic lights dashboard enabled rapid assessment of patients using critical parameters to accelerate adjustments to management protocols. In total 513 (55.6%) of patients were flagged as high risk for thromboembolic disease, exceeding the numbers flagged for respiratory deteriorations (N=391, 42.4%), or cytokine storm (N=68, 7.4%). There was minimal evidence that age was associated with disease severity, but males had higher levels of all dashboard indices, particularly C-reactive protein and ferritin (p<0.0001) which displayed no relationship with age. CONCLUSIONS: Survival rates are encouraging. Protocols employed (traffic light-driven personalised care, protocolised early therapeutic anticoagulation based on D-dimer >1,000ng/L and/or CRP>200 mg/L, personalised ventilatory strategies and antioxidants) are recommended to other units. Males are at greater risk of severe disease, most likely as the obligate SARS-CoV-2 receptor is on the X-chromosome, and require especially close, and early attention.","Vizcaychipi, M.

However, the neurological manifestations of MERS have rarely been reported since it first emerged in 2012. METHODS: We evaluated four patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS coronavirus (CoV) infections who showed neurological complications during MERS treatment. These 4 patients were from a cohort of 23 patients who were treated at a single designated hospital during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea. The clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and prognoses are described. RESULTS: Four of the 23 admitted MERS patients reported neurological symptoms during or after MERS-CoV treatment. The potential diagnoses in these four cases included Bickerstaff's encephalitis overlapping with Guillain-Barré syndrome, intensive-care-unit-acquired weakness, or other toxic or infectious neuropathies. Neurological complications did not appear concomitantly with respiratory symptoms, instead being delayed by 2–3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular complications are not rare during MERS treatment, and they may have previously been underdiagnosed. Understanding the neurological manifestations is important in an infectious disease such as MERS, because these symptoms are rarely evaluated thoroughly during treatment, and they may interfere with the prognosis or require treatment modification.","Kim, Jee-Eun; Heo, Jae-Hyeok; Kim, Hye-ok; Song, Sook-hee; Park, Sang-Soon; Park, Tai-Hwan; Ahn, Jin-Young; Kim, Min-Ky; Choi, Jae-Phil",J Clin Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3988/jcn.2017.13.3.227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28748673/,504

Using US national survey data collected September 30–October 27, 2020 (N = 6095), behaviors in the prior week examined were: 7 potentially risky activities, mask wearing anywhere, and mask wearing while undertaking each activity. Differences among political affiliations were estimated for adults with 0 and with ≥1 medical risk factors for severe complications, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Among adults with medical risk factors, the adjusted number of potentially risky activities was higher among Republicans (3.83) but not Independents (3.17) relative to Democrats (2.98). The adjusted percentage of adults with medical risk factors who wore a mask anywhere in the past week was lower for Republicans (87%) and Independents (91%) than for Democrats (97%). While undertaking each specific activity, the adjusted percentage of at-risk adults never wearing a mask was higher for Republicans than Democrats: 24% vs 8% at bar/club; 6% vs 0% at grocery/pharmacy; 63% vs 30% visiting at friend's home; 68% vs 41% hosting visitors; 30% vs 5% at gathering of ≥10 people; 25% vs 11% while within 6 ft of someone they do not live with.

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a single centre parallel group, superiority, randomized (1:1 allocation ratio) controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to the Hamad Medical Corporation -ICU in Qatar for COVID-19 associated respiratory distress and in need of mechanical ventilation are screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria: all adult patients admitted to the ICU who test positive for COVID-19 by PCR-test and in need for mechanical ventilation are eligible for inclusion. Upon crossing the limit of D-dimers (1.2 mg/L) these patients are routinely treated with an increased dose of anticoagulant according to our local protocol. This will be the start of randomization. Exclusion criteria: pregnancy, allergic to the drug, inherited coagulation abnormalities, no informed consent. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention group will receive the anticoagulant bivalirudin intravenously with a target aPTT of 45-70 sec for three days while the control group will stay on the standard treatment with low-molecular-weight heparins /unfractionated heparin subcutaneously (see scheme in Additional file 1). All other treatment will be unchanged and left to the attending physicians. MAIN OUTCOMES: As a surrogate parameter for clinical improvement and primary outcome we will use the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio. RANDOMISATION: After inclusion, the patients will be randomized using a closed envelope method into the conventional treatment group, which uses the standard strategy and the experimental group which receives anticoagulation treatment with bivalirudin using an allocation ratio of 1:1. BLINDING (MASKING): Due to logistical and safety reasons (assessment of aPTT to titrate the study drug) only the data-analyst will be blinded to the groups. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We performed a sample size calculation and assumed the data for P/F ratio (according to literature) is normally distributed and used the mean which would be: 160 and SD is 80. We expect the treatment will improve this by 30%. In order to reach a power of 80% we would need 44 patients per group (in total 88 patients). Taking approximately 10% of dropout into account we will include 100 patients (50 in each group). TRIAL STATUS: The local registration number is MRC-05-082 with the protocol version number 2.

Three of the compounds, which also had furan rings, inhibited the cleavage activity of HAV 3C(pro) with K(ic)s of 120–240 nM. HPLC-based assays revealed that the inhibitors were slowly hydrolyzed by both HAV 3C(pro) and SARS 3CL(pro), confirming the identity of the expected products. Mass spectrometric analyses indicated that this hydrolysis proceeded via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Modeling studies indicated that the halopyridinyl moiety of the inhibitor fits tightly into the S1-binding pocket, consistent with the lack of tolerance of the inhibitors to modification in this portion of the molecule.

ALI and in particular ARDS, are usually accompanied by refractory hypoxemia and the need for mechanical ventilation. In most cases, an exaggerated inflammatory and pro-thrombotic reaction to an initial stimulus, such as systemic infection, elicits disruption of the alveolo-capillary membrane and vascular fluid leak. The pulmonary endothelium is a major metabolic organ promoting adequate pulmonary and systemic vascular homeostasis, and a main target of circulating cells and humoral mediators under injury; pulmonary endothelium is therefore critically involved in the pathogenesis of ALI. In this review we will discuss mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and edema generation in the lung with special emphasis on the interplay between the endothelium, the immune and hemostatic systems, and highlight how these principles apply in the context of defined disorders and specific insults implicated in ALI pathogenesis.","Maniatis, Nikolaos A.; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Catravas, John D.; Orfanos, Stylianos E.",Vascul Pharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1537189108000852; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vph.2008.06.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537189108000852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722553/,504
595601,Lessons learned from pharmacy learner and educator experiences during early stages of COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-22,"Protein synthesis is a tightly controlled process responding to several stimuli, including viral infection. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses depend on the translation machinery of the host and can manipulate it by affecting the availability and function of specific eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Human norovirus is a member of the Caliciviridae family and is responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks. Previous studies on feline calicivirus and murine norovirus 1 (MNV1) demonstrated that the viral protein, genome-linked (VPg), acts to direct translation by hijacking the host protein synthesis machinery. Here we report that MNV1 infection modulates the MAPK pathway to activate eIF4E phosphorylation. Our results show that the activation of p38 and Mnk during MNV1 infection is important for MNV1 replication. Furthermore, phosphorylated eIF4E relocates to the polysomes, and this contributes to changes in the translational state of specific host mRNAs. We propose that global translational control of the host by eIF4E phosphorylation is a key component of the host-pathogen interaction.","Royall, Elizabeth; Doyle, Nicole; Abdul-Wahab, Azimah; Emmott, Ed; Morley, Simon J.; Goodfellow, Ian; Roberts, Lisa O.; Locker, Nicolas",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25561727/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m114.602649,504

While the disease is not rare, but the symptoms may be atypical in children. CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-month-old boy with fever and rash without respiratory complaints at the onset of the disease presented to the hospital. His illness was then accompanied by severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoxemia, and pleural effusion. The nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test was positive for the novel coronavirus. Despite primary normal lung imaging, the second imaging was typical for the disease on the third day of admission. DISCUSSION: Dermatologic manifestations of the novel coronavirus infection are not rare during the illness but rarely occur at the onset of the disease. Information about the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and its time interval from the onset of the disease in children are not clear yet. Severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and pleural effusion are not reported as classic findings of the novel SARS-CoV-2. They may be considered as a consequence of the hyperinflammatory response or direct effect of the virus. CONCLUSION: As a different manifestation of SARS-CoV-2, infected children may initially present fever and rash. More studies are needed to discover the cause of these complications. The correct answer may lead to better insight and more effective treatment.","Navaeifar, Mohammad Reza; Poudineh Ghazaghi, Mehrdad; Shahbaznejad, Leila; Rouhanizadeh, Hamed; Abutalebi, Mahnush; Ranjbar Varandi, Mobina; Rezai, Mohammad Sadegh",Int Med Case Rep J,https://doi.org/10.2147/imcrj.s262935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32821174/,504

One clear example of this is haemophilia A resulting from deleterious mutations in the FVIII gene. Replacement with serum derived or recombinant FVIII protein can cause anti-drug antibodies in 20-50% of individuals treated. The resulting inhibitor antibodies override the benefit of treatment and, at best, make life unpredictable for those treated. The only way to overcome the inhibitor issue is to reinstate immunological tolerance to the administered protein. Here we compare the various approaches that have been tested and focus on the use of antigen-processing independent T cell epitopes (apitopes) for tolerance induction.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish the laws of the spread of COVID-19 and to use them to develop a mathematical model to predict changes in the number of active cases over time, possible human losses, and the rate of recovery of patients, to make informed decisions about the number of necessary beds in hospitals, the introduction and type of quarantine measures, and the required threshold of vaccination of the population. METHODS: This study analyzed the onset of COVID-19 spread in countries such as China, Italy, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Germany based on publicly available statistical data. The change in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered persons over time was examined, considering the possible introduction of quarantine measures and isolation of infected people in these countries. Based on the data, the virus transmissibility and the average duration of the disease at different stages were evaluated, and a model based on the principle of recursion was developed. Its key features are the separation of active (nonisolated) infected persons into a distinct category and the prediction of their number based on the average duration of the disease in the inactive phase and the concentration of these persons in the population in the preceding days. RESULTS: Specific values for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and COVID-19 duration were estimated for different countries. In China, the viral transmissibility was 3.12 before quarantine measures were implemented and 0.36 after these measures were lifted. For the other countries, the viral transmissibility was 2.28-2.76 initially, and it then decreased to 0.87-1.29 as a result of quarantine measures. Therefore, it can be expected that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will be suppressed if 56%-64% of the total population becomes vaccinated or survives COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted in most countries are too weak compared to those previously used in China. Therefore, it is not expected that the spread of COVID-19 will stop and the disease will cease to exist naturally or owing to quarantine measures. Active vaccination of the population is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the required specific percentage of vaccinated individuals depends on the magnitude of viral transmissibility, which can be evaluated using the proposed model and statistical data for the country of interest.","Ilyin, Sergey O",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/21468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871381/,504

METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional design was used for this study. We targeted all nurses and doctors working in three governmental hospitals in the Gaza Strip and worked with victims of the last war, more specifically, those who were working in emergency departments, intensive care units, operating rooms, surgical departments, and burn units. A demographic sheet and Impact Event Scale–Revised were used in this study. The Impact Event Scale–Revised has three sub-scales; intrusion, avoidance, and hyper-arousal. RESULTS: The results showed that 291 (89.8%) of 324 participants had scores more than 35 (threshold cut-off point) on the Impact Event Scale–Revised. Scores ranged from zero to 80 with a mean of 52.13. Females had higher levels of stress (55.79) than males (51.63) and nurses (54.85) had more stress than physicians (47.38). The most frequent symptoms of trauma subscales was “avoidance” (mean = 20.04), followed by “intrusion” (mean = 17.83), and then “hyper-arousal” (mean = 14.27). Levels of trauma symptoms were not affected by place of living, hospital of work, while level of education had impacted level of trauma. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that health care providers suffered from severe posttraumatic symptoms after exposure to prolonged war stress. This level of trauma among health care providers warrants intervention programs to reduce stress and trauma among Gaza health care providers after the war.","Abu-El-Noor, Nasser Ibrahim; Aljeesh, Yousef Ibrahim; Radwan, AbdalKarim Said; Abu-El-Noor, Mysoon Khalil; Qddura, Ibrahim Abdel-Ilhady; Khadoura, Khalid Jamal; Alnawajha, Samer Khader",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883941715001661; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883941715001661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992869/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2015.08.010,504
597337,The first life skills intervention to enhance well-being amongst university students in the Arab world: ‘Khotwa’ pilot study,2021-06-16,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, active testing has risen as a key component of many response strategies around the globe. Such strategies have a common denominator: the limited availability of diagnostic tests. In this context, pool testing strategies have emerged as a means to increase testing capacity. The efficiency gains obtained by using pool testing, derived from testing combined samples simultaneously, vary according to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population being tested. Motivated by the need for testing closed populations, such as long-term care facilities (LTCFs), where significant correlation in infections is expected, we develop a probabilistic model for settings where the test results are correlated, which we use to compute optimal pool sizes in the context of two-stage pool testing schemes. The proposed model incorporates the specificity and sensitivity of the test, which makes it possible to study the impact of these measures on both the expected number of tests required for diagnosing a population and the expected number and variance of false negatives. We use our experience implementing pool testing in LTCFs managed by SENAMA (Chile’s National Service for the Elderly) to develop a simulation model of contagion dynamics inside LTCFs, which incorporates testing and quarantine policies implemented by SENAMA. We use this simulation to estimate the correlation of test results among collected samples when following SENAMA’s testing guidelines. Our results show that correlation estimates are high in settings representative of LTCFs, which validates the use of the proposed model for incorporating correlation in determining optimal pool sizes for pool testing strategies. Generally, our results show that settings in which pool testing achieves efficiency gains, relative to individual testing, are likely to be found in practice. Moreover, the results show that incorporating correlation in the analysis of pool testing strategies both improves the expected efficiency and broadens the settings in which the technique is preferred over individual testing.","Basso, Leonardo J.; Salinas, Vicente; Sauré, Denis; Thraves, Charles; Yankovic, Natalia",Health Care Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453651/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-021-09578-w,504
597498,Peruvian Guideline to Care the Mental Health of Health Providers During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-27,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) is posing a threat to the public health globally. Serological test for SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody can improve early diagnosis of COVID‐19 and serves as a valuable supplement to RNA detection. METHOD: A SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test strip based on colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was developed, with both spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen used for antibody detection. From 3 medical institutions across China, serum or plasma of 170 patients with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis and 300 normal controls were collected and tested with the strip. Sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed. Positive rates in different medical centers, age group, gender, and different disease course were compared. RESULTS: 158 out 170 samples from confirmed COVID‐19 patients had positive results from the test, and 296 out of 300 samples from normal controls had negative results. The kit was 92.9% sensitive and 98.7% specific. The positive rate was 77.3% during the first week after disease onset, but reached 100% since day 9. AUC and kappa coefficient were 0.958 and 0.926, respectively, which showed the consistency of the test results with the standard diagnosis. Age or gender caused little variations in the kit sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The rapid, easy‐to‐use SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test kit has a superior performance, which can help with accurate diagnosis and thus timely treatment and isolation of COVID‐19 patients, that contributes to the better control of the global pandemic.","Liao, Mengting; Yan, Jiawei; Wang, Xinfeng; Qian, Huimin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Dan; Wang, Bin; Yang, Bo; Liu, Shaohui; Zhou, Mao; Gao, Qian; Zhou, Qian; Luo, Jiquan; Li, Zongxiang; Liu, Wenen",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33067888/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23619,504

METHODS: Cancer‐related CTs performed at one academic hospital and three affiliated community hospitals in Massachusetts were retrospectively analyzed. Three periods of 2020 were considered as follows: pre‐COVID‐19 (1/5/20–3/14/20), COVID‐19 peak (3/15/20–5/2/20), and post‐COVID‐19 peak (5/3/20–11/14/20). 15 March 2020 was the day a state of emergency was declared in MA; 3 May 2020 was the day our hospitals resumed to non‐urgent imaging. The volumes were assessed by (1) Imaging indication: cancer screening, initial workup, active cancer, and surveillance; (2) Care setting: outpatient and inpatient, ED; (3) Hospital type: quaternary academic center (QAC), university‐affiliated community hospital (UACH), and sole community hospitals (SCHs). RESULTS: During the COVID‐19 peak, a significant drop in CT volumes was observed (−42.2%, p < 0.0001), with cancer screening, initial workup, active cancer, and cancer surveillance declining by 81.7%, 54.8%, 30.7%, and 44.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001). In the post‐COVID‐19 peak period, cancer screening and initial workup CTs did not recover (−11.7%, p = 0.037; −20.0%, p = 0.031), especially in the outpatient setting. CT volumes for active cancer recovered, but inconsistently across hospital types: the QAC experienced a 9.4% decline (p = 0.022) and the UACH a 41.5% increase (p < 0.001). Outpatient CTs recovered after the COVID‐19 peak, but with a shift in utilization away from the QAC (−8.7%, p = 0.020) toward the UACH (+13.3%, p = 0.013). Inpatient and ED‐based oncologic CTs increased post‐peak (+20.0%, p = 0.004 and +33.2%, p = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer imaging was severely impacted during the COVID‐19 pandemic. CTs for cancer screening and initial workup did not recover to pre‐COVID‐19 levels well into 2020, a finding that suggests more patients with advanced cancers may present in the future. A redistribution of imaging utilization away from the QAC and outpatient settings, toward the community hospitals and inpatient setting/ED was observed.","Zattra, Ottavia; Fraga, Anthony; Lu, Nancy; Gee, Michael S.; Liu, Raymond W.; Lev, Michael H.; Brink, James A.; Saini, Sanjay; Lang, Min; Succi, Marc D.",Cancer Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355873/,504

Limited data are available on SARS-CoV-2 in pets. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pets during a COVID-19 household transmission investigation. Pets from households with ≥1 person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion from April–May 2020. We enrolled 37 dogs and 19 cats from 34 households. All oropharyngeal, nasal, and rectal swabs tested negative by rRT-PCR; one dog’s fur swabs (2%) tested positive by rRT-PCR at the first sampling. Among 47 pets with serological results, eight (17%) pets (four dogs, four cats) from 6/30 (20%) households had detectable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. In households with a seropositive pet, the proportion of people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was greater (median 79%; range: 40–100%) compared to households with no seropositive pet (median 37%; range: 13–100%) (p = 0.01). Thirty-three pets with serologic results had frequent daily contact (≥1 h) with the index patient before the person’s COVID-19 diagnosis. Of these 33 pets, 14 (42%) had decreased contact with the index patient after diagnosis and none were seropositive; of the 19 (58%) pets with continued contact, four (21%) were seropositive. Seropositive pets likely acquired infection after contact with people with COVID-19.

However, concerns exist that PA levels may have decreased during the pandemic thus exacerbating health disparities. This study aims to determine changes in and locations for PA and reasons for decreased PA during the pandemic. METHODS: Reported percentage of changes in and locations for PA and reasons for decreased PA were examined in 3829 US adults who completed the 2020 SummerStyles survey. RESULTS: Overall, 30% reported less PA, and 50% reported no change or no activity during the pandemic; percentages varied across subgroups. Adults who were non-Hispanic Black (Black) or Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic White, (White)) reported less PA. Fewer Black adults (vs. White) reported doing most PA in their neighborhood. Concern about exposure to the virus (39%) was the most common reason adults were less active. CONCLUSIONS: In June 2020, nearly one-third of US adults reported decreased PA; 20% reported increased PA. Decreased activity was higher among Black and Hispanic compared to White adults; these two groups have experienced disproportionate COVID-19 impacts. Continued efforts are needed to ensure everyone has access to supports that allow them to participate in PA while still following guidance to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Watson, Kathleen B.; Whitfield, Geoffrey P.; Huntzicker, George; Omura, John D.; Ussery, Emily; Chen, Tiffany J.; Fanfair, Robyn Neblett",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233691/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-021-01161-4,504

Monthly numbers of cataract surgeries during the pandemic were compared with monthly numbers in the reference years 2016–2019. In the pandemic the number of cataract surgeries decreased by 53.4%. The monthly numbers during the first, second and third wave of the pandemic were 77.5%, 51.5% and 29.7% lower, respectively, compared with the reference level. No rebound effect was observed once the pandemic restrictions were eased. Simultaneous bilateral cataract surgeries (SBCS) constituted 6.5% of cataract procedures performed in April and May 2021 compared with 0.77% carried out between May 2019 and March 2021.

However, surveillance for HPIV is rarely performed continuously, and national-level epidemiologic and genetic data are scarce. Within the German sentinel system, to monitor acute respiratory infections (ARI), 4463 respiratory specimens collected from outpatients < 5 years of age between October 2015 and September 2019 were retrospectively screened for HPIV 1–4 using real-time PCR. HPIV was identified in 459 (10%) samples. HPIV-3 was the most common HPIV-type, with 234 detections, followed by HPIV-1 (113), HPIV-4 (61), and HPIV-2 (49). HPIV-3 was more frequently associated with age < 2 years, and HPIV-4 was more frequently associated with pneumonia compared to other HPIV types. HPIV circulation displayed distinct seasonal patterns, which appeared to vary by type. Phylogenetic characterization clustered HPIV-1 in Clades 2 and 3. Reclassification was performed for HPIV-2, provisionally assigning two distinct HPIV-2 groups and six clades, with German HPIV-2s clustering in Clade 2.4.

607060,Deriving household composition using population-scale electronic health record data—A reproducible methodology,2021-03-29,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe diarrhea and a high rate of mortality in suckling pigs. The epidemic of PEDV that occurred after 2013 was caused by non-insertion and deletion of S gene (S-INDEL) PEDV strains. During this epidemic, a variant of the non-S-INDEL PEDV strain with a large deletion of 205 amino acids on the spike gene (5-17-V) was also found to co-exist with a non-S-INDEL PEDV without deletion (5-17-O). Herein, we describe the differences in the complete genome, distribution, virulence, and antigenicity between strain 5-17-O and variant strain 5-17-V. The deletion of 205 amino acids was primarily located in the S1(O) domain and was associated with milder clinical signs and lower mortality in suckling pigs than those of the 5-17-O strain. The 5-17-V strain-induced antibody did not completely cross-neutralize the 5-17-O strain. In conclusion, the deletion in the S1 region reduces the virulence of PEDV and influences the virus-neutralizing activities of the antibody it induces.","Tsai, Kuo-Jung; Deng, Ming-Chung; Wang, Fun-In; Tsai, Shu-Hui; Chang, Chieh; Chang, Chia-Yi; Huang, Yu-Liang",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276502/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12121378,504
607113,Three further ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect health outcomes,2020-05-05,"Outbreaks of ARD associated with HAdV have been reported in military populations in many countries. Here, we report an ARD outbreak caused by HAdV‐7 in a military training camp in Shaanxi Province, China, from February to March of 2012. Epidemic data and samples from the patients were collected, and viral nucleotides from samples and viral isolations were detected and sequenced. IgG and IgA antibodies against HAdV, and the neutralization antibodies against the viral strain isolated in this outbreak, were detected. Epidemiological study showed that all personnel affected were males with an average age of 19.1 years. Two peaks appeared on the epicurve and there was an 8‐day interval between peaks. Laboratory results of viral nucleotide detection carried out with clinical specimens were positive for HAdV (83.33%, 15/18). Further study through serum antibody assay, virus isolation and phylogenetic analysis showed that HAdV‐7 was the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak. IgA antibody began to appear on the 4th day after the onset and showed 100% positivity on the 8th day. The virus strain in the present outbreak was highly similar to the virus isolated in Hanzhong Shaanxi in 2009. We conclude that HAdV‐7 was the pathogen corresponding to the outbreak, and this is the first report of an ARD outbreak caused by HAdV‐7 in military persons in China. Vaccine development, as well as enhanced epidemiological and virological surveillance of HAdV infections in China should be emphasized.","Yu, Pengbo; Ma, Chaofeng; Nawaz, Muhammad; Han, Lei; Zhang, Jianfang; Du, Quanli; Zhang, Lixia; Feng, Qunling; Wang, Jingjun; Xu, Jiru",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734976/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12074,504

Information on COVID-19 in nondialysis CKD patients is not available yet. CASE REPORTS: Here we present 7 patients with grade 4–5 CKD who developed symptomatic COVID-19; they comprise 2.6% of our 267 advanced CKD patients. The estimated GFR was between 12 and 20 mL/min during the month prior to COVID-19. The 3 major symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, and 5 patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and steroids were the most frequently prescribed drugs. Two patients needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation. All patients showed minimal to moderate kidney function deterioration during admission, with an eGFR decline below 5 mL/min in 6 cases. No patient required acute dialysis. Six patients were discharged alive and remained dialysis free athe t the time of reporting, and one 76-year-old patient died. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affects grade 4–5 CKD patients, but prognosis may be acceptable if prompt supportive measures are applied. These findings should be confirmed in larger cohorts, and further observations will be needed to understand the full spectrum of clinical features and the optimal approach to COVID-19 in patients with advanced CKD.","Collado, Silvia; Arenas, María Dolores; Barbosa, Francesc; Cao, Higini; Montero, María Milagro; Villar-García, Judit; Barrios, Clara; Rodríguez, Eva; Sans, Laia; Sierra, Adriana; Pérez-Sáez, María José; Redondo-Pachón, Dolores; Coca, Armando; Maiques, José María; Güerri-Fernández, Roberto; Horcajada, Juan Pablo; Crespo, Marta; Pascual, Julio",Kidney Blood Press Res,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32898845/,504

The transmission method is human-to-human. Since this second wave of SARS-CoV-2 is more aggressive than the first wave, rapid testing is warranted to use practical diagnostics to break the transfer chain. Currently, various techniques are used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. A full review of online databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was analyzed to identify relevant articles focusing on SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosis and therapeutics. The most recent article search was on May 10, 2021. We summarize promising methods for detecting the novel Coronavirus using sensor-based diagnostic technologies that are sensitive, cost-effective, and simple to use at the point of care. This includes loop-mediated isothermal amplification and several laboratory protocols for confirming suspected 2019-nCoV cases, as well as studies with non-commercial laboratory protocols based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a field-effect transistor-based bio-sensing device.

It has resulted in loss of thousands of lives globally and has brought countries to the brink of economic, social, and health collapse. A major issue of this infection is the ease with which it transmits through salivary droplets and its survival for long durations outside the body. Therefore, its early detection is critical in prevention, diagnostic, and management efforts of COVID-19 patients. Loss of taste and smell is one of the early symptoms reported in these patients and the virus is abundantly found in the salivary secretion of the infected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Infection and inflammation of salivary glands are common among viral infections, particularly in the early stages, which lead to salivary composition changes. Chemosensory sensation of taste is critically dependent on the salivary flow rate and its inorganic constituents, protein levels, specific 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, ghrelins, pH levels, and enzymes. Therefore, the question arises, “Does COVID-19 infection alter the salivary components and composition leading to early transient symptoms of Ageusia and hypogeusia?” This review shows association of the COVID-19 and Ageusia, in addition to the early viral infection of salivary glands and possible changes in salivary flow and content.

612075,The diversity of opinion among general practitioners regarding the threat and measures against COVID-19 – Cross-sectional survey,2021-07-28,"Viroporins are small virus-encoded ion channel proteins. Most viroporins are monovalent selective cation channels, with few showing the ability to conduct divalent cations, like calcium (Ca(2+)). Nevertheless, some viroporins are known to disrupt host cell Ca(2+) homeostasis, which is critical for virus replication and pathogenesis. Rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane glycoprotein that has a viroporin domain (VPD), and NSP4 viroporin activity elevates cytosolic Ca(2+) in mammalian cells. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that the NSP4 VPD forms an ion channel and determine whether the channel can conduct Ca(2+). Using planar lipid bilayer and liposome patch clamp electrophysiology, we show that a synthetic peptide of the NSP4 VPD has ion channel activity. The NSP4 VPD was selective for cations over anions and channel activity was observed to have both well-defined “square top” openings as well as fast current fluctuations, similar to other viroporins. Importantly, the NSP4 VPD showed similar conductance of divalent cations (Ca(2+) and Ba(2+)) as monovalent cations (K(+)), but a viroporin defective mutant lacked Ca(2+) conductivity. These data demonstrate that the NSP4 VPD is a Ca(2+)-conducting viroporin and establish the mechanism by which NSP4 disturbs host cell Ca(2+) homeostasis.","Pham, Thieng; Perry, Jacob L.; Dosey, Timothy L.; Delcour, Anne H.; Hyser, Joseph M.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28256607/,504

METHODS: The study includes 76 patients of 5.2 ± 2.8 years old. Seventy-eight JP specimens and 24 parapolyp tissues from polypectomy were used. PCR was used to detect HAdV DNA and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for viral and host gene expression. The PCR products were sequenced for virus typing. The correlation between VDR expression and HAdV infection was established using nonparametric Spearman’s analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four children (97.4%) had a single polyp and two had two polyps. The histopathological characteristics of the polyps were in line with JP. Thirty-three samples had HAdV DNA (43.4%), including 32 subgroup C and 1 subgroup B HAdV; no enteric HAdV was detected. HAdV messenger RNA was detected in 5 of the 33 samples (15.2%). The samples had increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and calprotectin expression, and reduced E-cadherin and VDR expression. JP samples with low VDR expression were more prevalent of HAdV DNA (r = 1.261, 95% confidence interval, 1.017–1.563), while VDR expression positively correlated with E-cadherin and negatively with inflammation gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV latent infection was prevalent among JP tissues. The presence of HAdV correlated positively to low VDR expression. IMPACT: The HAdVs infect the upper airways and gastrointestinal system and is found to persist in lymphoid tissues. The prevalence of HAdV and the status of the infection is unknown. The study investigated the prevalence of HAdV from polypectomy specimens of JP patients and found that HAdV was prevalent and was in a persistent state. HAdV infection was more prevalent in samples with low VDR expression. Whether HAdV infection and reactivation is a contributing factor to JPs is unknown.

Given that 94% of young adults own and use smartphones, social media can offer personalized, accessible social support among peers with cancer. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the specific benefits, downsides, and topics of social support via social media among young adults with cancer. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with young adults with cancer, aged between 18 and 39 years, who were receiving treatment or had completed treatment for cancer. RESULTS: Most participants (N=45) used general audience platforms (eg, Facebook groups), and some cancer-specific social media (eg, Caring Bridge), to discuss relevant lived experiences for medical information (managing side effects and treatment uncertainty) and navigating life with cancer (parenting and financial issues). Participants valued socializing with other young adults with cancer, making connections outside their personal networks, and being able to validate their emotional and mental health experiences without time and physical constraints. However, using social media for peer support can be an emotional burden, especially when others post disheartening or harassing content, and can heighten privacy concerns, especially when navigating cancer-related stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Social media allows young adults to connect with peers to share and feel validated about their treatment and life concerns. However, barriers exist for receiving support from social media; these could be reduced through content moderation and developing more customizable, potentially cancer-specific social media apps and platforms to enhance one’s ability to find peers and manage groups.","Lazard, Allison J; Collins, Meredith K Reffner; Hedrick, Ashley; Varma, Tushar; Love, Brad; Valle, Carmina G; Brooks, Erik; Benedict, Catherine",JMIR Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473063/; https://doi.org/10.2196/28234,504

We assess single-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) in adults ≥ 70 years old in British Columbia, Canada, where second doses were deferred by up to 16 weeks and where a spring 2021 wave uniquely included codominant circulation of Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Gamma (P.1) variants of concern (VOC). METHODS: Analyses included community-dwelling adults ≥ 70 years old with specimen collection between 4 April (epidemiological week 14) and 1 May (week 17) 2021. Adjusted VE was estimated by test-negative design. Cases were reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test-positive for SARS-CoV-2, and controls were test-negative. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of a single-dose ≥ 21 days before specimen collection, but a range of intervals was assessed. Variant-specific VE was estimated against viruses genetically characterized as Alpha, Gamma or non-VOC lineages. RESULTS: VE analyses included 16 993 specimens: 1226 (7%) test-positive cases and 15 767 test-negative controls. Of 1131 (92%) genetically characterized viruses, 509 (45%), 314 (28%), and 276 (24%) were Alpha, Gamma, and non-VOC lineages, respectively. At 0–13 days postvaccination, VE was negligible at 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0–26) but increased from 43% (95% CI, 30–53) at 14–20 days to 75% (95% CI, 63–83) at 35–41 days postvaccination. VE at ≥ 21 days postvaccination was 65% (95% CI, 58–71) overall: 72% (95% CI, 58–81), 67% (95% CI, 57–75), and 61% (95% CI, 45–72) for non-VOC, Alpha, and Gamma variants, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of mRNA vaccine reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by about two-thirds in adults ≥ 70 years old, with protection only minimally reduced against Alpha and Gamma variants.","Skowronski, Danuta M; Setayeshgar, Solmaz; Zou, Macy; Prystajecky, Natalie; Tyson, John R; Galanis, Eleni; Naus, Monika; Patrick, David M; Sbihi, Hind; El Adam, Shiraz; Henry, Bonnie; Hoang, Linda M N; Sadarangani, Manish; Jassem, Agatha N; Krajden, Mel",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244723/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab616,504
620754,The Impact of a Universal Mental Health Intervention on Youth with Elevated Negative Affectivity: Building Resilience for Healthy Kids,2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 reached Latin-American countries slightly later than European countries, around February/March, allowing some emergency preparedness response in countries characterized by low health system capacities and socioeconomic disparities. OBJECTIVE: This paper focuses on the first months of the pandemic in five Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It analyses how the pre-pandemic context, and the government's responses in terms of containment and mitigation and economic measures have affected the COVID-19 health outcomes. METHODS: Extensive qualitative document analysis was conducted focused on publicly-available epidemiological data and federal and state/regional policy documents since the beginning of the pandemic. RESULTS: The countries were quick to implement stringent COVID-19 measures and incrementally scaled up their health systems capacity, although tracing and tracking have been poor. All five countries have experienced a large number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The analysis on the excess deaths also shows that the impact in deaths is far higher than the official numbers reported to date for some countries. CONCLUSION: Despite the introduction of stringent measures of containment and mitigation, and the scale up of health system capacities, pre-pandemic conditions that characterize these countries (high informal employment, and social inequalities) have undermined the effectiveness of the countries’ responses to the pandemic. The economic support measures put in place were found to be too timid for some countries and introduced too late in most of them. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive strategy for testing and tracking has also contributed to the failure to contain the spread of the virus.","Benítez, María Alejandra; Velasco, Carolina; Sequeira, Ana Rita; Henríquez, Josefa; Menezes, Flavio M.; Paolucci, Francesco",Health Policy Technol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211883720300861?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211883720300861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32874863/,504

The experimentation that takes place within these corporate networks has a parallel on the government side, where subnational governments, and particularly cities as hubs of economic activity, have increased their profile and level of cooperative activity. We argue that engagement in these partnerships is an essential way in which firms and governments co-evolve and create the basis for sustainable economic growth in the Information Age. While the origins of this collaborative form of governance reside in the increasing knowledge intensity of value creation, its implications go far beyond MNE value creation and capture, extending to issues of global governance such as climate change and sustainable development goals. We examine the implications of this process of co-evolution both in terms of the costs of developing the requisite corporate capabilities as well as the legitimacy of these efforts as part of a deliberative democracy.","Lundan, Sarianna; Cantwell, John",J Int Bus Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100419/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41267-020-00373-3,504

MDCK-33016PF cells are used in propagation of a cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine (Optaflu(®)); but, like most continuous cell lines, can grow in immunocompromised mice to produce tumors. It is, therefore, essential that no residual cells remain within the vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses or oncogenic DNA. Multiple, redundant processes ensure the safety of influenza vaccines produced in MDCK-33016PF cells. The probability of a residual cell being present in a dose of vaccine is approximately 1 in 10(34). Residual MDCK-DNA is ≤10 ng per dose and the ß-propiolactone used to inactivate influenza virus results in reduction of detectable DNA to less than 200 base pairs (bp). Degenerate PCR and specific PCR confirm exclusion of oncogenic viruses. The manufacturing process has been validated for its capacity to remove and inactivate viruses. We conclude that the theoretical risks arising from manufacturing seasonal influenza vaccine using MDCK-33016PF cells are reduced to levels that are effectively zero by the multiple, orthogonal processes used during production.","Onions, David; Egan, William; Jarrett, Ruth; Novicki, Deborah; Gregersen, Jens-Peter",Biologicals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105610000989; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2010.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105610000989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537553/,504

Within the modified Langevin Poisson–Boltzmann model of an electric double layer, we derived an analytical expression for the osmotic pressure between the planar zwitterionic lipid bilayer and charged solid planar surface. We also show that the electrostatic interaction between the zwitterionic lipid head groups of the proximal leaflet and the negatively charged solid surface is accompanied with a more perpendicular average orientation of the lipid head-groups. We further highlight the important role of the surfaces’ nanostructured topography in their interactions with biological material. As an example of nanostructured surfaces, we describe the synthesis of TiO(2) nanotubular and octahedral surfaces by using the electrochemical anodization method and hydrothermal method, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of these nanostructured surfaces are described in order to elucidate the influence of the surface topography and other physical properties on the behavior of human cells adhered to TiO(2) nanostructured surfaces.

Identifying risk factors for isolation of MDROs is critical to COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: All eligible adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 10 hospitals in the Republic of Korea between February 2020 and May 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Using this cohort, epidemiology and risk factors for isolation of MDROs were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 152 patients, 47 with microbial culture results were included. Twenty isolates of MDROs from 13 (28%) patients were cultured. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (five isolates) was the most common MDRO, followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (four isolates). MDROs were mostly isolated from sputum samples (80%, 16/20). The median time from hospitalization to MDRO isolation was 28 days (interquartile range, 18–38 days). In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with MDRO isolation (62% versus 15%; p = 0.001). Use of systemic corticosteroids after diagnosis of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 15.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.34–97.01; p = 0.004) and long-term care facility (LTCF) stay before diagnosis of COVID-19 (aOR: 6.09; 95% CI: 1.02–36.49; p = 0.048) were associated with MDRO isolation. CONCLUSIONS: MDROs were isolated from 28% of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with culture data and 8.6% of the entire cohort.

630448,Epidemic Meets Pandemic:: Treating Opioid Use Disorder in the Age of COVID-19,2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION: In patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a short course of steroids is routinely given as first-line therapy. However, the response is often transient and additional therapy is usually needed. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are frequently used as second-line therapy, although there is little clinical guidance on the timing of their administration and on tapering/discontinuation of the drug. To provide clinical recommendations, we used the Delphi technique to obtain consensus for statements regarding administration and on tapering/discontinuation of second-line TPO-RAs among a group of Italian clinicians with expertise in management of ITP. METHODS: The Delphi process was used to obtain agreement on five statements regarding initiation and on tapering/discontinuation of second-line TPO-RAs. Agreement was considered when 75% of participants approved the statement. Eleven experts participated in the voting. RESULTS: Full consensus was reached for three of the five statements. The experts held that an early switch from corticosteroids to a TPO-RA has the dual advantage of sparing patients from corticosteroid abuse and improve long-term clinical outcomes. All felt that dose reduction of TPO-RAs can be considered in patients with a stable response and platelet count >100 × 10(9)/L that is maintained for at least 6 months in the absence of concomitant treatments, although there was less agreement in patients with a platelet count >50 × 10(9)/L. Near consensus was reached regarding the statement that early treatment with a TPO-RA is associated with an increase in clinically significant partial or complete response. The experts also agreed that optimization of tapering and discontinuation of TPO-RA therapy in selected patients can improve the quality of life. CONCLUSION: The present consensus can help to provide guidance on use of TPO-RAs in daily practice in patients with ITP. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Second-line administration of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in immune thrombocytopenia: There is little guidance on the timing of administration and tapering/discontinuation of thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

AIMS: This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 exposure among Paraguayan healthcare workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study has been carried out in five hospitals of Paraguay. Demographic and occupational exposure to COVID-19 were collected through a short questionnaire. Mental health status was assessed with the GAD-7, the PHQ-9, and the PCL-C. Logistic regression was used to determine psychological risk factors. RESULTS: 432 participants were surveyed. 218 (50.46%) were physicians. The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD was 48.15, 41.90, and 5.79%, respectively. There were no significant differences in anxiety (128 [29.63%] vs. 80 [18.52%]; p = 0.3303), depression (102 [23.61%] vs. 79 [18.29%]; p = 0.6703), or PTSD (14 [3.24%] vs. 11 [2.55%]; p = 0.8074) between frontline versus second-line workers. Main risk factors associated with psychological distress included work experience <5 years for depression and a COVID-19 positive diagnosis or having family/friends with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis for PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Paraguayan healthcare workers reported high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and a low prevalence of PTSD. A positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and work experience <5 years are important psychological risk factors.","Villalba-Arias, Jorge; Estigarribia, Gladys; Bogado, José Andrés; Méndez, Julieta; Toledo, Santiago; Barrios, Iván; Castaldelli-Maia, João Mauricio; Ventriglio, Antonio; Torales, Julio",J Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586935/; https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.1979494,504

631737,Understanding global mental health: a conceptual review,2021-03-23,"Differentiated models of service delivery (DSD models) for HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa were conceived as a way to manage rapidly expanding populations of experienced patients who are clinically “stable” on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Entry requirements for most models include at least six months on treatment and a suppressed viral load. These models thus systematically exclude newly-initiated patients, who instead experience the conventional model of care, which requires frequent, multiple clinic visits that impose costs on both providers and patients. In this open letter, we argue that the conventional model of care for the first six months on ART is no longer adequate. The highest rates of treatment discontinuation are in the first six-month period after treatment initiation. Newly initiating patients are generally healthier than in the past, with higher CD4 counts, and antiretroviral medications are better tolerated, with fewer side effects and substitutions, making extra clinic visits unnecessary. Improvements in the treatment initiation process, such as same-day initiation, have not been followed by innovations in the early treatment period. Finally, the advent of COVID-19 has made it riskier to require multiple clinic visits. Research to develop differentiated models of care for the first six-month period is needed. Priorities include estimating the minimum number and type of provider interactions and ART education needed, optimizing the timing of a patient’s first viral load test, determining when lay providers can replace clinicians, ensuring that patients have sufficient but not burdensome access to support, and identifying ways to establish a habit of lifelong adherence.","Rosen, Sydney; Grimsrud, Anna; Ehrenkranz, Peter; Katz, Ingrid",Gates Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13159.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875281/,504
632810,Policy brief on climate change and mental health/well-being,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive and anti-cytokine treatment may have a protective effect for patients with COVID-19. Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: To identify cellular phenotypes that may be shared across tissues affected by disparate inflammatory diseases, we developed a meta-analysis and integration pipeline that models and removes the effects of technology, tissue of origin, and donor that confound cell-type identification. Using this approach, we integrated > 300,000 single-cell transcriptomic profiles from COVID-19-affected lungs and tissues from healthy subjects and patients with five inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and interstitial lung disease. We tested the association of shared immune states with severe/inflamed status compared to healthy control using mixed-effects modeling. To define environmental factors within these tissues that shape shared macrophage phenotypes, we stimulated human blood-derived macrophages with defined combinations of inflammatory factors, emphasizing in particular antiviral interferons IFN-beta (IFN-β) and IFN-gamma (IFN-γ), and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. RESULTS: We built an immune cell reference consisting of > 300,000 single-cell profiles from 125 healthy or disease-affected donors from COVID-19 and five inflammatory diseases. We observed a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state that is shared and strikingly abundant in severe COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, inflamed RA synovium, inflamed CD ileum, and UC colon. These cells exhibited a distinct arrangement of pro-inflammatory and interferon response genes, including elevated levels of CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3, GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. Further, we found this macrophage phenotype is induced upon co-stimulation by IFN-γ and TNF-α. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis identified immune cell states shared across inflamed tissues affected by inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. Our study supports a key role for IFN-γ together with TNF-α in driving an abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19-affected lungs, as well as inflamed RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, Fan; Mears, Joseph R.; Shakib, Lorien; Beynor, Jessica I.; Shanaj, Sara; Korsunsky, Ilya; Nathan, Aparna; Donlin, Laura T.; Raychaudhuri, Soumya",Genome Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-021-00881-3; https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13073-021-00881-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879239/,504

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, in order to assess whether pneumococcal co-infection is associated with different mortality rate and hospital stay in these patients. Materials and Methods: Charts, protocols, mortality, and hospitalization data of a consecutive series of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in northern Italy during COVID-19 outbreak were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing to detect an underlying pneumococcal co-infection. Covid19+/u-Ag+ and Covid19+/u-Ag- patients were compared in terms of overall survival and length of hospital stay using chi-square test and survival analysis. Results: Out of 575 patients with documented pneumonia, 13% screened positive for the u-Ag test. All u-Ag+ patients underwent treatment with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin or Levofloxacin. Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Darunavir/Cobicistat were added in 44 patients, and hydroxychloroquine and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in 47 and 33 patients, respectively. All u-Ag+ patients were hospitalized. Mortality was 15.4% and 25.9% in u-Ag+ and u-Ag- patients, respectively (p = 0.09). Survival analysis showed a better prognosis, albeit not significant, in u-Ag+ patients. Median hospital stay did not differ among groups (10 vs. 9 days, p = 0.71). Conclusions: The routine use of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing helped to better target antibiotic therapy with a final trend of reduction in mortality of u-Ag+ COVID-19 patients having a concomitant pneumococcal infection.

At the first endomyocardial biopsy (EMB)‐proven episode, she had concomitant pneumonia, and a temporary biventricular assist device implant was followed by complete and long‐lasting cardiac recovery. Five years later, she was re‐admitted for relapsing cardiogenic shock with a recent history of pneumonia. She was treated with extracorporeal life support with apical venting for left ventricular unloading, and full recovery was achieved. Despite negative seriate nasopharyngeal swabs and EMB during hospitalization, an antibody positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was discovered after 4 weeks from discharge. This is the first report of an EMB‐proven, immune‐mediated (virus‐negative) recurrence of fulminant myocarditis.

636147,Testing Testimonial.,2021-04-16,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, uses its spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral membrane to enter host cells. The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to enrich the Golgi-resident fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer, and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on soluble and virion S trimers, is predominantly modified in the Golgi by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions.","Zhang, Shijian; Go, Eden P.; Ding, Haitao; Anang, Saumya; Kappes, John C.; Desaire, Heather; Sodroski, Joseph",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.438120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821278/,504

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. We aimed to clarify correlation of systemic inflammation with disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatments were compared among 317 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with moderate, severe, or critically ill form of the disease. Moreover, the longitudinal changes of serum cytokines, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and hsCRP to lymphocyte count ratio (hsCRP/L) as well as their associations with disease severity and outcomes were investigated in 68 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Within 24 h of admission, the critically ill patients showed higher concentrations of inflammatory markers including serum soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), ferritin, procalcitonin, LDH, hsCRP, and hsCRP/L than patients with severe or moderate disease. The severe cases displayed the similar response patterns when compared with moderate cases. The longitudinal assays showed the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, LDH, hsCRP, and hsCRP/L gradually declined within 10 days post admission in moderate, severe cases or those who survived. However, there was no significant reduction in cytokines, LDH, hsCRP, and hsCRP/L levels in critically ill or deceased patients throughout the course of illness. Compared with female patients, male cases showed higher serum concentrations of soluble IL-2R, IL-6, ferritin, procalcitonin, LDH, and hsCRP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IL-6 > 50 pg/mL and LDH > 400 U/L on admission were independently associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Exuberant inflammatory responses within 24 h of admission in patients with COVID-19 may correlate with disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to elicit a sex-based differential immune response. IL-6 and LDH were independent predictive parameters for assessing the severity of COVID-19. An early decline of these inflammation markers may be associated with better outcomes.","Zeng, Zhilin; Yu, Haijing; Chen, Huilong; Qi, Weipeng; Chen, Liang; Chen, Guang; Yan, Weiming; Chen, Tao; Ning, Qin; Han, Meifang; Wu, Di",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854750/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03255-0,504

Patients with autoimmune diseases are commonly treated with broad-acting immunomodulatory drugs, with the risk of severe side effects. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have the inherent capacity to induce peripheral tolerance as well as tissue regeneration and are therefore a prime candidate to use as cell therapy in patients with autoimmune disorders. (Pre)clinical studies using Treg therapy have already established safety and feasibility, and some show clinical benefits. However, Tregs are known to be functionally impaired in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, ex vivo manipulation to boost and stably maintain their suppressive function is necessary when considering autologous transplantation. Similar to autoimmunity, severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by an exaggerated immune reaction and altered Treg responses. In light of this, Treg-based therapies are currently under investigation to treat severe COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN: Pediatric clinical research networks from 20 countries and 50 of their affiliated research sites completed two surveys over one month from early May to early June 2020. Networks liaised with their affiliated sites and contributed to the interpretation of results through pan-European group discussions. Based on SARS-CoV-2 first detection dates, countries formed one early and one late detecting cluster. We tested the hypothesis that this clustering influenced clinical research. RESULTS: Research sites were first impacted by the pandemic in mid-March 2020 (03/16 ±10 days, the same date as lockdown initiation, P = .99). From first impact up until early June, site initiation and feasibility analysis processes were affected for ˃50% of the sites. Staff were redirected to COVID-19 research for 44% of the sites and 75.5% of sites were involved in pediatric COVID-19 research (only 6.3% reported COVID cases in their other pediatric trials). Mitigations were used, but differently between the early and late detecting country clusters and between countries with and without a pediatric COVID-19 research taskforce. Positive effects include the development of teleworking capacities. CONCLUSIONS: Through this collaborative effort from pediatric research networks, we found that pediatric trials were affected and conducted with a range of unequally applied mitigations across countries during the pandemic. The global impact might be greater than captured. In a context where clinical research is increasingly multinational, this report reveals the importance of collaboration between National Networks.","Mantha, Olivier L.; Flamein, Florence; Turner, Mark; Fernandes, Ricardo M.; Hankard, Regis",J Pediatr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347621007897?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437911/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347621007897; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.08.028,504
641569,84 The Opioid Epidemic Meets the Coronavirus Pandemic: Rates of Emergency Department Visits for Opiate Use Disorder during COVID-19,2020-10-31,"For public health promotion to succeed, popular support is necessary and the chosen policies and measures have to be perceived as legitimate by the public. In other words, health authorities need to build on and sustain established trust when they recommend a certain policy. When the policy is criticized, this trust is challenged, and the authorities enter into a negotiation of credibility (ethos). In this article, we research a particular instance of such negotiation, drawing lessons for health promotion and for COVID-19 communication. We study a Norwegian television debate in which an MD presented harsh criticism of the health authorities’ chosen crisis response in the early phase of the pandemic. Unpacking the rhetorical constitution of the expert ethos of the MD and of the health authorities, respectively, we find that representatives of the authorities are more open to participation and better at connecting to everyday experiences than the MD, who primarily builds her expert ethos on mastery of scientific language and methods, combined with alarmist rhetoric. Further, we identify main tenets of the public’s reception of the debate through an analysis of 1961 tweets that commented on the program. The analysis indicates that public health authorities might maintain high levels of trust by rhetorically cultivating their positions within institutional and (social) media networks of expertise.","Kjeldsen, Jens E; Ihlen, Øyvind; Just, Sine N; Larsson, and Anders Olof",Health Promot Int,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339493/,504

643007,Prevalence and correlates of weight bias internalization in weight management: A multinational study,2021-02-17,"The coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 has not been previously described in children and young adults. We reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children and young adults admitted for COVID-19 to an urban Children's Hospital in New York City, focusing on coagulation and venous thromboembolism. Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed from 54 patients aged 2 months to 30 years treated by the Pediatric Hematology service at a single Children's Hospital between January 1 and May 31, 2020. Information was obtained from hospital records with IRB approval. There was a moderate male predominance, with 32 (59%) males and 22 (41%) females. There were 28 (52%) patients younger than 18 years and 26 (48%) patients 18 - 30 years old. 26% of patients identified as Black, and 57% as Hispanic/Latino, similar to the community demographics in the Bronx in the 2019 census. Obesity was the most prevalent comorbid condition, with 19 (35%) patients having BMI of 30 or higher. There were also 12 (22%) patients with sickle cell anemia. There were 28 (52%) patients in this cohort with severe and critical illness, as based on established criteria, and 25 (46%) patients required increased ventilatory support. This was defined by the need for > 5L nasal cannula, high-flow nasal cannula, non-rebreather, or intubation. 11 patients (20%) had documented venous thromboembolism (VTE). Four patients died of COVID-19 complications at ages 2 months, 11, 14 and 18 years old. The VTE rate was similar in those patients under 18 years of age (5 of 28, 18%) and those 18 - 30 years of age (6 of 26, 23%). Most (94%) patients had a D-Dimer > 0.5 (upper limit of normal) at admission and 57% developed peak D-Dimer > 5 ug/mL during their admission. Elevated D-dimer > 5 was a risk factor for VTE with 3 of 23 (13%) and 7 of 17 (41%) patients developing VTE with D-dimer < 5 and > 5, respectively (OR 4.7, p=0.042). Patients requiring increased ventilatory support had a 36% rate of VTE as compared to 1 of 28 (4%) of those without (OR 15.2, p=0.003). Six of 24 patients on prophylactic anticoagulation developed VTE. One patient developed a pulmonary embolism 10 days post discharge from the hospital. No patients on anti-Xa-based low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis developed VTE. None of 12 patients with sickle cell anemia developed VTE, had peak D-Dimer > 5 ug/mL or required increased ventilatory support. Hospitalized children and young adults with COVID-19 in our cohort developed a coagulopathy similar to that of older adults, characterized by elevated D-Dimer and high rate of VTE. This is in contrast to the published pediatric series out of China and Singapore that described mild illness and did not comment on VTE rates. Presence of elevated D-dimer or need for increased ventilatory support were significant risk factors for thrombosis. Patients with sickle cell anemia had a lower risk of VTE and less severe illness. Anti-Xa monitored thromboprophylaxis may aid in preventing or ameliorating the COVID-19 coagulopathy in children and young adults. Institutional anticoagulation guidelines were developed based on these observations. Disclosures Davila: Spire Learning: Speakers Bureau; ATHN: Other: Grant Funding.

Description Il s’est agi d’une étude rétrospective à visée descriptive et analytique. Elle s’est déroulée au CHU de TIngandogo et a concerné la période du 09 mars au 30 août 2020. Ont été inclus, tous les patients positifs à la COVID-19 par un test PCR et dont la créatininémie était disponible. Méthodes L’analyse multivariée a été réalisée et une valeur de p <0,05 a été considérée comme statistiquement significative. Résultats Nous avons inclus 168 patients. La moyenne d’âge était de 57,7±15,2 ans avec un sex-ratio de 3,1. La prévalence de l’IRA était de 16,07 % et ses principales complications étaient l’encéphalopathie urémique (OR=8,18 ; p =0,005), le syndrome œdémateux (OR=0,06 ; p =0,012) et la baisse des réserves alcalines (OR=0,761 ; p =0,001). Les facteurs de risque d’IRA étaient l’âge élevé (OR=0,19 ; p =<0,001), la prise de médicaments traditionnels (OR=0,19 ; p =<0,001), les vomissements (OR=0,15 ; p =0,01), l’augmentation de la CRP (OR=1,008 ; p =0,012) et l’hyperleucocytose (OR=1,000 ; p =0,033). Sa survenue était associée à une mortalité élevée (OR=0,097 ; p =<0,001). Conclusion L’IRA au cours de la COVID-19 est fréquente et associée à une morbi-mortalité élevée. Un renforcement de la sensibilisation à l’éviction des décoctions pourrait contribuer à réduire sa fréquence. Un diagnostic et une prise en charge précoce des patients à partir de la 5e décade et ceux ayant des signes pulmonaires et un syndrome inflammatoire pourrait permettre de réduire la forte mortalité qui lui est associée.","Delma, S.; Akodmo, S.

This study explored the experiences and support needs of children and young adults (CYAs) with CF, and parents who have a child with CF, during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: CYAs with CF and parents of CYAs with CF completed a UK wide online survey with open and closed questions exploring experiences, information and support needs and decision‐making processes. Qualitative thematic content analysis and descriptive quantitative analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: CYAs aged 10–30 years (n = 99) and parents of CYAs aged 0–34 years (n = 145) responded. Parents (72.7%) and CYAs (50.0%) worried about the virus, and both were vigilant for virus symptoms (82.7% and 79.7%). Over three‐quarters of CYAs were worried about their own health if they caught the virus. CYAs worried about feeling more isolated during the virus (64.9%). Qualitative findings reported the following themes: (1) Disruption—caused by isolation, (2) impact on psychological wellbeing, (3) safety of shielding, and (4) healthcare and treatment provision—changes to care, access and support. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID‐19 and UK shielding advice to have no contact with anyone outside the household caused disruption to the lives and routines of individuals in relation to work, education, social lives, relationships, CF management routines and support. Parents and CYAs highlighted the need for clear, up‐to‐date and tailored advice on individualized risks and shielding.","Collaço, Nicole; Legg, Julian; Day, Maria; Culliford, David; Campion, Anna; West, Carolyn; Darlington, Anne‐Sophie",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138526/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25537,504

Induced inflammation afterwards infection engenders a high infiltration of immune cells and cytokines that triggers matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activation. These endopeptidases are mediators of the lung extracellular matrix (ECM), a basic element for alveoli structure and gas exchange. METHODS: When immune cells, MMPs, secreted cytokines and several other mediators are gathered a pathological matrix remodeling occurs. This phenomenon tends to tissue destruction in the first place and a pulmonary hypertrophy and fibrosis in the second place. FINDINGS: After pathological matrix remodeling establishment, pathological diseases take place even after infection state. Since post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is an emerging complication of the disease, there is an urge to better understand and characterize the implication of ECM remodeling during SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Targeting MMPs and their inhibitors could be a probable solution for occurred events since there are many cured patients that remain with severe sequels even after the end of infection.","Guizani, Imen; Fourti, Nesrine; Zidi, Wiem; Feki, Moncef; Allal-Elasmi, Monia",Inflamm Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00011-021-01487-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286362/,504

The pulse oximeter has been the only noninvasive monitor that can be used as a reference of oxygenation in current anesthetic management; however, in recent years, a new monitoring method that uses the oxygen reserve index (ORi™) has been developed by Masimo Corp. ORi is an index that reflects the state of moderate hyperoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO(2)] between 100 and 200 mmHg) using a non-unit scale between 0.00 and 1.00. ORi monitoring performed together with percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) measurements may become an important technique in the field of anesthetic management, for measuring oxygenation reserve capacity. By measuring ORi, it is possible to predict hypoxemia and to detect hyperoxia at an early stage. In this review, we summarize the method of ORi, cautions for its use, and suitable cases for its use. In the near future, the monitoring of oxygen concentrations using ORi may become increasingly common for the management of respiratory function before, after, and during surgery.","Ishida, Yusuke; Okada, Toshio; Kobayashi, Takayuki; Uchino, Hiroyuki",J Anesth,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-021-02938-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900455/,504
651610,“I’ll just deal with this on my own”: a qualitative exploration of experiences with self-managed abortion in the United States,2021-05-04,"The current coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has raised the possibility of potential neurotropic properties of this virus. Indeed, neurological sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have already been reported and highlight the relevance of considering the neurological impact of coronavirus (CoV) from a translational perspective. Animal models of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by structurally similar CoVs during the 2002 and 2012 epidemics, have provided valuable data on nervous system involvement by CoVs and the potential for central nervous system spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. One key finding that may unify these pathogens is that all require angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 as a cell entry receptor. The CoV spike glycoprotein, by which SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to cell membranes, binds angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 with a higher affinity compared with SARS‐CoV. The expression of this receptor in neurons and endothelial cells hints that SARS‐CoV‐2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared with previous CoVs. However, it remains to be determined how such invasiveness might contribute to respiratory failure or cause direct neurological damage. Both direct and indirect mechanisms may be of relevance. Clinical heterogeneity potentially driven by differential host immune‐mediated responses will require extensive investigation. Development of disease models to anticipate emerging neurological complications and to explore mechanisms of direct or immune‐mediated pathogenicity in the short and medium term is therefore of great importance. In this brief review, we describe the current knowledge from models of previous CoV infections and discuss their potential relevance to COVID‐19.","Natoli, S.; Oliveira, V.; Calabresi, P.; Maia, L.

654483,The enhancement of the employer branding strategies of Polish hospitals through the detection of features which determine employer attractiveness: a multidimensional perspective,2021-06-28,"INTRODUCTION: Engaging communities and intended beneficiaries at various stages of health research is a recommended practice. The contribution of community engagement to non-communicable disease research in low- and middle-income countries has not yet been extensively studied or synthesised. This protocol describes the steps towards generating an understanding of community engagement in the context of non-communicable disease research, prevention and health promotion using a realist review approach. A realist lens enables a rich explanatory approach to causation while capturing complexity, and an openness to multiple outcomes, including unintended consequences. The review will thus develop an understanding of community engagement without assuming that such practices result in more ethical research or effective interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We propose a realist approach aiming to examine how, why, under what circumstances and for whom community engagement works or does not work. The iterative review steps include clarifying the review scope; searching for evidence; appraising studies and extracting data; synthesising evidence and drawing conclusions; and disseminating, implementing and evaluating the findings. Principles of meta-narrative review (pragmatism, pluralism, historicity, contestation, reflexivity and peer review) are employed to ensure practicable and contextualised review outputs. The proposed review will draw on theoretical and empirical literature beyond specific diseases or settings, but with a focus on informing non-communicable disease research and interventions in low- and middle-income countries. The synthesis of existing literature will be complemented by qualitative realist interviews and stakeholder consultation. Through drawing on multiple types of evidence and input from both experts and intended beneficiaries, the review will provide critical and pragmatic insights for research and community engagement in low- and middle-income countries. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand. Dissemination will include traditional academic channels, institutional communications, social media and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders.","Klingberg, Sonja; Adhikari, Bipin; Draper, Catherine E; Bosire, Edna N; Tiigah, Priscilla; Nyirenda, Deborah; Mukumbang, Ferdinand C",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290072/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050632,504

A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out with the aim of studying the prevalence of various serovars of Salmonella in calves and their relationship with diarrhea signs. The study was conducted in Mar and Sierras Dairy Basin located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Seven hundred and twenty six calves both with diarrhea signs or not were sampled by rectal mucosa swab in 50 dairy farms during the rearing period. Isolates identified as Salmonella spp. were classified using polyvalent and monovalent antisera against somatic, flagellar and capsule antigens (Vi). Salmonella spp. was found in 36% of the farms and serotypes were: S. Mbandaka, S. Anatum, S. Typhimurium, S. Dublin, S. Montevideo, S. Meleagridis, S. Newport, S. Seftemberg, S. subesp. 16,7:z1, S. Infantis, S. Give. A percentage of 5.5% calves was positive and calves showing diarrheal signs were 5.9 times more likely to be infected with Salmonella spp. than those having no signs. The age of positive calves ranged from the first day of life to 53; the second day being the most frequent time. In conclusion, 11 Salmonella serovars were detected in one out of 3 dairy farms in Mar and Sierras Dairy Basin, and not only were these serovars associated with diarrhea signs including the presence of mucus in feces, but they were also more prevalent among calves aged up to 21 days.","Bilbao, Gladys N.; Malena, Rosana; Passucci, Juan A.; Pinto de Almeida Castro, Aldana M.; Paolicchi, Fernando; Soto, Pedro; Cantón, Juliana; Monteavaro, Cristina E.",Rev Argent Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0325754118301184; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0325754118301184,504
655970,Comparing Chinese children and adults with RT-PCR positive COVID-19: A systematic review,2020-07-13,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been affecting the world since the end of 2019. The severity of the disease can range from an asymptomatic or mild course to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with respiratory failure, which may lead to death. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, scientists around the world have been studying the genome and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection to develop effective therapies and prevention. In this review, we summarize the progressive development of various treatments and vaccines as they have emerged, a year after the outbreak of the pandemic. Initially for COVID-19, patients were recommended drugs with presumed antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects that were previously used to treat other diseases. Thereafter, therapeutic interventions were supplemented with promising approaches based on antibodies, peptides, and stem cells. However, licensed COVID-19 vaccines remain the most effective weapon in combating the pandemic. While there is an enormous effort to enhance the vaccination rate to increase the entire population immunity, the production and delivery of vaccines is becoming limited in several countries. In this regard, there are new challenges needing to be addressed by combining non-pharmacological intervention with effective therapies until vaccination is accessible to all.","Hudakova, Nikola; Hricikova, Simona; Kulkarni, Amod; Bhide, Mangesh; Kontsekova, Eva; Cizkova, Dasa",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10060636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064300/,504
656266,Estimating the Impact of the Pandemic on Children's Physical Health: A Scoping Review,2021,"AIM: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown on lacrimal surgery among oculoplastic surgeons in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: An institutional board review approved anonymous electronic survey was sent out via email to oculoplastic surgeons across the Asia-Pacific region. All responses were tabulated and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 259 valid responses were received. Nearly 87% of the surgeons agreed that lacrimal procedures were associated with a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. In all, at the time of taking the survey, 151/259 (58.3%) of the surgeons were not performing any lacrimal surgeries in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and 71/259 (27.4%) of the respondents were only performing emergency lacrimal surgeries. External dacryocystorhinostomy was the most commonly performed lacrimal procedure across the region and lacrimal procedures contributed to at least 25% of the income for nearly a third of the respondents. Majority of the respondents were female (52.9%), but a significantly higher proportion of male oculoplastic surgeons were still performing lacrimal surgeries during the lockdown. Over 75% of respondents indicated that resuming lacrimal procedures is important to their practice. CONCLUSION: The survey showed that there was a general agreement among the surveyed oculoplastic surgeons in the Asia-Pacific region that lacrimal procedures were associated with a high risk of COVID-19 transmission and over 85% of them of had either stopped performing elective lacrimal surgeries altogether or were providing only emergent care. It is likely that not performing elective lacrimal procedures, COVID-19 has financially impacted a high percentage of the surveyed oculoplastic surgeons.","Nair, Akshay Gopinathan; Narayanan, Natasha; Ali, Mohammad Javed",Clin Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177805/; https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s279728,504
656901,Sex differences in COVID-19 case fatality: do we know enough?,2020-11-05,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, with variable presentations of different organ systems. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are highly variable ranging from mild presentations to severe, life-threatening symptoms and the wide individual variability may be due to the broad heterogeneity in the underlying pathologies (Okediji et al., 2020 [1]). There is no doubt that early management may have a major influence on the outcome. This led the scientists to search for ways to monitor disease progression or to predict outcomes in COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to predict who will progress to the severe forms or in what time, numerous prospective and longitudinal studies represent the evidence for determining the potential immunological risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death. The kinetics and breadth of immune responses during COVID-19 appear to follow a trend which is consistent to the predominant pathological alterations (Akhtar, 2020 [2]). Recent publications have used these biomarkers to help identify patients who will develop the severe acute COVID-19. Of particular interest is the relationship between the kinetics of peripheral leukocytes and clinical progress of the disease in COVID-19. Although research is ongoing in this area, we present details about the current status of the evaluation. Understanding of the COVID-19 related alterations of the innate and adaptive immune responses may help to promote the vaccine development and immunological interventions.","Ghaebi, Mahnaz; Tahmasebi, Safa; Jozghorbani, Maryam; Sadeghi, Alireza; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza",Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865882/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320521004884?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119503; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320521004884,504

To date, there have been no U.S. studies comparing COVID-19 incidence in schools that varied in implementing recommended prevention strategies, including mask requirements and ventilation improvements* (2). Using data from Georgia kindergarten through grade 5 (K-5) schools that opened for in-person learning during fall 2020, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) assessed the impact of school-level prevention strategies on incidence of COVID-19 among students and staff members before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Among 169 K-5 schools that participated in a survey on prevention strategies and reported COVID-19 cases during November 16-December 11, 2020, COVID-19 incidence was 3.08 cases among students and staff members per 500 enrolled students.§ Adjusting for county-level incidence, COVID-19 incidence was 37% lower in schools that required teachers and staff members to use masks, and 39% lower in schools that improved ventilation, compared with schools that did not use these prevention strategies. Ventilation strategies associated with lower school incidence included methods to dilute airborne particles alone by opening windows, opening doors, or using fans (35% lower incidence), or in combination with methods to filter airborne particles with high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filtration with or without purification with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) (48% lower incidence). Multiple strategies should be implemented to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools (2); mask requirements for teachers and staff members and improved ventilation are important strategies that elementary schools could implement as part of a multicomponent approach to provide safer, in-person learning environments. Universal and correct mask use is still recommended by CDC for adults and children in schools regardless of vaccination status (2).","Gettings, Jenna; Czarnik, Michaila; Morris, Elana; Haller, Elizabeth; Thompson-Paul, Angela M.; Rasberry, Catherine; Lanzieri, Tatiana M.; Smith-Grant, Jennifer; Aholou, Tiffiany Michelle; Thomas, Ebony; Drenzek, Cherie; MacKellar, Duncan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043610/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7021e1,504

Threats to worker safety, health, and well-being including non-traditional work arrangements and practices, precarious work, uncertain hazardous exposures, and work organization issues, such as heavy workloads, design of work, uneven work hours, and difficult interpersonal relationships among workers and managers are apparent. Furthermore, the relationship between personal health risk factors and workplace risks and exposures has drawn increased attention and concern. As employer economic pressures continue to build, it is anticipated that ethical dilemmas for practitioners will become increasingly complex. A review of relevant Total Worker Health(®) (TWH) literature, related ethical constructs and competencies, an examination of codes of ethics for occupational safety and health and health promotion/education disciplines was conducted. A case study for TWH utilizing an ethical decision-making model for the analysis of key ethical issues and solutions was completed. TWH approaches to protecting safety, promoting health, and advancing well-being are increasingly being adopted. These approaches can reveal ethical dilemmas, and ethical constructs are needed to guide decision-making.

The majority of surveyed students indicated a desire to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, with more medical than non-medical students planning to get vaccinated (91.99% vs. 59.42%). The most common concern about SARS-CoV-2 infection was the risk of passing on the disease to elderly relatives. While conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 vaccine are less popular among MS, both groups indicated concerns that vaccines may cause autism is equally common (~5%). Further studies exploring social attitudes towards the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are a necessary first step to optimizing vaccination programs and achieving herd immunity.","Szmyd, Bartosz; Bartoszek, Adrian; Karuga, Filip Franciszek; Staniecka, Katarzyna; Błaszczyk, Maciej; Radek, Maciej",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33562872/,504

Data are limited on the impact of neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment on avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA shedding. METHODS. In this multicenter, retrospective study, data were collected from adults hospitalized with A(H7N9) infection during 2013–2017 in China. We compared clinical features and A(H7N9) shedding among patients with different NAI doses and combination therapies and evaluated factors associated with A(H7N9) shedding, using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS. Among 478 patients, the median age was 56 years, 71% were male, and 37% died. The median time from illness onset to NAI treatment initiation was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 6–10 days), and the median duration of A(H7N9) RNA detection from onset was 15.5 days (IQR, 12–20 days). A(H7N9) RNA shedding was shorter in survivors than in patients who died (P < .001). Corticosteroid administration (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .50-.77]) and delayed NAI treatment (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, .91-.96]) were independent risk factors for prolonged A(H7N9) shedding. There was no significant difference in A(H7N9) shedding duration between NAI combination treatment and monotherapy (P = .65) or between standard-dose and double-dose oseltamivir treatment (P = .70). CONCLUSIONS. Corticosteroid therapy and delayed NAI treatment were associated with prolonged A(H7N9) RNA shedding. NAI combination therapy and double-dose oseltamivir treatment were not associated with a reduced A(H7N9) shedding duration as compared to standard-dose oseltamivir.","Wang, Yeming; Guo, Qiang; Yan, Zheng; Zhou, Daming; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Shujun; Li, Yu-Ping; Yuan, Jing; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Shen, Xinghua; Wu, Wenjuan; Zhao, Hui; Wu, Yun-Fu; Shang, Jia; He, Zhengguang; Yang, Yi; Zhao, Hongsheng; Hong, Yongqing; Zhang, Zehua; Wu, Min; Wei, Tiemin; Deng, Xilong; Deng, Yijun; Cai, Li-hua; Lu, Weihua; Shu, Hongmei; Zhang, Lin; Luo, Hong; Zhou, Ying; Weng, Heng; Song, Keyi; Yao, Li; Jiang, Mingguang; Zhao, Boliang; Chi, Ruibin; Guo, Boqi; Fu, Lin; Yu, Long; Min, Haiyan; Chen, Pu; Chen, Shuifang; Hong, Liang; Mao, Wei; Huang, Xiaoping; Gu, Lijun; Li, Hui; Wang, Chen; Cao, Bin",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648602/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/217/11/1708/24789949/jiy115.pdf,504

The pandemic's rapid evolution has resulted in a knowledge gap in how COVID-19 has affected MS clinical practice. Our objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice patterns in a nationwide cohort of MS clinicians across the United States. METHODS: In collaboration with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), we developed a 28-item SurveyMonkey(TM) electronic questionnaire exploring MS specialists’ perceptions of how COVID-19 has altered how they prescribe MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), provide telehealth and other services, and view issues affecting their own well-being including re-deployment to the front lines of COVID-19 care and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). NMSS staff sent a recruitment email containing the electronic survey link to 188 clinicians who serve on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US, 86 (45.7%) of whom were MS specialist physicians. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 188 potential respondents (45.7%) from 32 US states completed the survey including 45 physicians (41 neurologists, 3 physiatrists and 1 family physician), 18 rehabilitation therapists, 7 psychologists, 6 nurse practitioners, 4 social workers, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurses and 2 health professionals from other disciplines. More than 80% of all respondents working on-site in a health care setting believed they had adequate PPE. More than 41% were able to distance safely from others at work. Nearly 10% of respondents reported they had been re-deployed to the front lines of COVID-19 patient care, and an additional 16.9% anticipated being re-deployed. Among the MS specialist physician subgroup, nearly one-third reported using telemedicine to provide over 75% of their clinical care. Only 16.7% believed COVID-19 had not changed how they prescribe DMTs. Therapies prescribed more often during the pandemic included β-IFNs (28.6% of prescribers), natalizumab (23.8%), glatiramer acetate (21.4%) and teriflunomide (19%). DMTs prescribed less often included alemtuzumab (64.3% of prescribers), cladribine (54.8%), ocrelizumab and rituximab (50%), and fingolimod and siponimod (40.5%). For at least some of their patients during the pandemic, some MS specialists reported suspending certain DMTs including alemtuzumab (21.4% of prescribers), ocrelizumab and rituximab (16.7%) and cladribine (11.9%). Others reported extending DMT dosing intervals for natalizumab (38.1%), fingolimod and siponimod (11.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide survey, MS specialist physicians and other clinicians serving on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US reported profound changes in how they are delivering MS care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Morrison, Elizabeth H.; Michtich, Katelyn; Hersh, Carrie M.",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034821001802?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839482/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.102913; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034821001802,504

Some evidence suggests that lockdown strategies have significantly reduced traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) in regions across the world. However, the impact of COVID-19 on TRAP on roadside is still not clearly understood. In this study, we assessed the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on the levels of traffic-related air pollutants in Shanghai. The pollution data from two types of monitoring stations—roadside stations and non-roadside stations were compared and evaluated. The results show that NO(2), PM(2.5), PM(10), and SO(2) had reduced by ∼30–40% at each station during the COVID-19 pandemic in contrast to 2018–2019. CO showed a moderate decline of 28.8% at roadside stations and 16.4% at non-roadside stations. In contrast, O(3) concentrations increased by 30.2% at roadside stations and 5.7% at non-roadside stations. This result could be resulted from the declined NOx emissions from vehicles, which lowered O(3) titration. Full lockdown measures resulted in the highest reduction of primary pollutants by 34–48% in roadside stations and 18–50% in non-roadside stations. The increase in O(3) levels was also the most significant during full lockdown by 64% in roadside stations and 33% in non-roadside stations due to the largest decrease in NO(2) precursors, which promote O(3) formation. Additionally, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between NO(2) and other pollutants significantly decreased, while the values between NO(2) and O(3) increased at roadside stations.","Wu, Cui-Lin; Wang, Hong-Wei; Cai, Wan-Jin; He, Hong-Di; Ni, An-Ning; Peng, Zhong-Ren",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633432/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321001293?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107718; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132321001293,504

METHODS: A survey was distributed to 14 different hospitals of the Milan area to analyze the variation of EGS procedures. Each hospital reported the number of EGS procedures in the same time frame comparing 2019 and 2020. The survey revealed that the number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 was reduced by 19% when compared with 2019. The decrease was statistically significant only for abdominal wall surgery. Interestingly, in 2020, there was an increase of three procedures: surgical intervention for acute mesenteric ischemia (p = 0.002), drainage of perianal abscesses (p = 0.000285), and cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the metropolitan area of Milan, the number of patients operated for emergency diseases decreased by around 19%. We believe that this decrease is related either to the fear of the population to ask for emergency department (ED) consultation and to a shift towards a more non-operative management in the surgeons ‘decision making’ process. The increase of acute mesenteric ischaemia and perianal abscess might be related to the modification of dietary habits and reduction of physical activity related to the lockdown.","Kurihara, Hayato; Marrano, Enrico; Ceolin, Martina; Chiara, Osvaldo; Faccincani, Roberto; Bisagni, Pietro; Fattori, Luca; Zago, Mauro",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-021-01691-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944976/,504

Our results show that during the study period COVID-19 cumulative incidence and mortality was lower in NI than the rest of the UK. Incidence and mortality were also lower than in the Republic of Ireland (ROI), although these observed differences are difficult to interpret given considerable differences in testing and surveillance between the two nations.

668582,"COVID-19, Unemployment, and Behavioral Health Conditions: The Need for Supported Employment",2021-03-31,"Abstract Introduction The 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak impacted the United States. Due to the sporadic occurrence of the Ebola infection, there is insufficient research regarding how the United States emergency nurses provide care to patients potentially infected with the Ebola virus and the nurses’ motivation to protect themselves when providing care to these patients. This study was aimed to investigate the predictors of emergency room nurse’s protection motivation. Method A cross-sectional design was employed in the study. A survey developed based on a modified Protection Motivation Theory was administered to randomly selected emergency room nurses who are members of the Emergency Nurses Association. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H-Test (as well as post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni test), Spearman Rho correlation, and Stepwise Multiple Linear regression were conducted for data analysis. Result Protection motivation was found in two components: proactive and passive protection motivation. The regression analysis indicated that response efficacy (β=.27, p<.001) and self-efficacy (β=.17, p<.01) significantly predict emergency nurses’ proactive protection motivation, while perceived vulnerability (β=.26, p<.001), response cost (β=.19, p=.001) and knowledge (β=-.15, p<.01) significantly predict emergency nurses’ passive protection motivation. Conclusion Results indicate the need for interventions to improve emergency nurses’ response efficacy, self-efficacy, and knowledge, while simultaneously reducing the nurses’ perceived vulnerability and response cost. Such interventions would be expected to proactively motivate nurses to protect themselves when providing care to patients that exhibit the signs and symptoms of an Ebola infection and reduce their passive protection motivation.","Leigh, Laurasona; Taylor, Colleen; Glassman, Tavis; Thompson, Amy; Sheu, Jiunn-Jye",J Emerg Nurs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099176720301495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800328/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2020.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099176720301495?v=s5,504

We hypothesized that aging may differentially alter the expression of mitochondrial, cellular senescence and telomere genes in smokers and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers. Total RNA from human lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed based on their ages (younger: <55 yrs and older: >55 yrs). NanoString nCounter panel was used to analyze the gene expression profiles using a custom designed codeset containing 112 genes including 6 housekeeping controls (mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cellular senescence, telomere replication and maintenance). mRNA counts were normalized, log2 transformed for differential expression analysis using linear models in the limma package (R/Bioconductor). Data from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD and IPF were analyzed based on the age groups (pairwise comparisons between younger vs. older groups). Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A) and telomere replication/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and other quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases. Elderly patients with chronic lung disease and smokers were found to have high incidence and mortality rates in the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoblot analysis in the lung homogenates of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased protein abundance of important proteases and spike proteins like TMPRSS2, furin and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 levels. This may further strengthen the observation that smokers, COPD and IPF subjects are more prone to COVID-19 infection. Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition add to the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF and other smoking-related chronic lung disease in associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis for COVID-19 infection.","Maremanda, Krishna P.; Sundar, Isaac K.; Li, Dongmei; Rahman, Irfan",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702724/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-35347/v1,504

Recent results have implicated −1PRF in quality control of mRNA and DNA stability in eukaryotes. Biophysical experiments demonstrated that the ribosome changes the reading frame while attempting to move over a slippery sequence of the mRNA – when a roadblock formed by a folded downstream segment in the mRNA stalls the ribosome in a metastable conformational state. The efficiency of −1PRF is modulated not only by cis-regulatory elements in the mRNA but also by trans-acting factors such as proteins, miRNAs, and antibiotics. These recent results suggest a molecular mechanism and new important cellular roles for −1PRF.","Caliskan, Neva; Peske, Frank; Rodnina, Marina V.",Trends Biochem Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000415000444; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968000415000444; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2015.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25850333/,504

Primary prevention of childhood obesity, can lessen its consequences. This study aims to assess childhood obesity prevention policies in Iran through a policy analysis of agenda-setting using Kingdon’s multiple streams. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews with 39 key informants and document review from different stages of the policymaking process of childhood and adolescent obesity prevention programs in Iran. The analysis of documents and interviews were guided based on Kingdon’s multiple streams (problem, policy and political streams). RESULTS: The important factors of the problem stream were the high prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity and its risk factors in Iran. In the policy stream, a focus on preventing non-communicable diseases in the health system, increasing the workforce in health centers, promoting health school programs, and creating healthy eating buffets in schools was identified. Under the political stream, the impact of the WHO ECHO program in 2015 and the implementation of the health system transformation plan in Iran in the new government took place after 2013, caused the Iran ECHO program entered the agenda and implemented from 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Now that a window of opportunity for childhood and adolescent obesity prevention policymaking has been created, the problems such as the therapeutic approach in the health system, the existence of sanctions against Iran and outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), have hindered the successful implementation of this policy and the opportunity window has not been well used. However, actors need political support from the high levels of government to keep this policy on the agenda.","Taghizadeh, Shahnaz; Khodayari-Zarnaq, Rahim; Farhangi, Mahdieh Abbasalizad",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044800/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-021-02731-y,504

Observing the spread, illness and death caused by COVID‐19, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID‐19 a pandemic. To date, there is no approved therapeutics or effective treatment available to combat the outbreak. This urgent situation is pressing the world to respond with development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutics for SARS‐CoV‐2. In line with these efforts, the structure of several proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 has been rapidly resolved and made publicly available to facilitate global efforts to develop novel drug candidates. In this paper, we aim to find out the small molecule inhibitors for ADP‐ribose phosphatase of SARS‐CoV‐2. In order to identify potential inhibitors, we applied sequential E‐pharmacophore and structure‐based virtual screening (VS) of MolPort database containing 113687 number of commercially available natural compounds using Glide module. Six potential inhibitors having admirable XP glide score range from −11.009 to −14.684 kcal/mol and good binding affinity towards active sites were identified. All the molecules are commercially available for further characterization and development by scientific community. The in vitro activity of selected inhibitors can be done easily which will provide useful information for clinical treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.","Debnath, Pradip; Debnath, Bimal; Bhaumik, Samhita; Debnath, Sudhan",ChemistrySelect,https://doi.org/10.1002/slct.202001419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835090/,504

The aim of the current study is to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of health care professionals in Greece towards SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From 10–25 February 2020, 500 health care workers were approached. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards SARS-CoV-2 were assessed via a personal interview questionnaire. For knowledge, each correct answer was given 1 point; attitudes, or concerns aimed at prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and practices, or behaviors towards performing preventive practices, were assigned 1 point each. Points were summed and a score for each category was calculated. Results: A total of 461 health care workers returned the questionnaire and were included in the analysis (mean age ± SD: 44.2 ± 10.78 years, 74% females). The majority were nurses (47.5%), followed by physicians (30.5%) and paramedics (19%). The majority of subjects (88.28%) had a good level of knowledge (knowledge score equal to 4, or more). The majority of participants (71%) agreed with the temporary traveling restrictions ban. The uptake of a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at 43%. Knowledge score was significantly associated with both attitudes score (p = 0.011) and practices score (p < 0.001), indicating that subjects with a high knowledge score demonstrated a more positive perception on preventive measures and would practice more preventive measures. Attitudes score was significantly associated with practices score (p = 0.009) indicating that subjects with a higher attitudes score are more likely to perform practices towards the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Conclusion: There is a high level of knowledge concerning SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among Greek health care workers and this is significantly associated with positive attitudes and practices towards preventive health measures. The high level of knowledge of health professionals about SARS-CoV-2 may have contributed considerably to the successful management of the pandemic in Greece. Tailored educational campaigns aiming to increase the proportion of health care workers willing to accept a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be of paramount importance in future proactive vaccine educational campaigns.","Papagiannis, Dimitrios; Malli, Foteini; Raptis, Dimitrios G.; Papathanasiou, Ioanna V.; Fradelos, Evangelos C.; Daniil, Zoe; Rachiotis, Georgios; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650614/,504

With much effort, STEM courses made this change in modality; however, many laboratory skills, such as measurement and handling equipment, are more difficult to teach in an online learning environment. A cohort of instructors who are part of the NSF RCN-UBE funded Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM (STEM)(2) Network (a working group of faculty from two community colleges and three 4-year universities) analyzed introductory biology and chemistry courses to identify essential laboratory skills that students will need in advanced courses. Seven essential laboratory proficiencies were derived from reviewing disciplinary guiding documents such as AAAS Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education, the American Society for Microbiology Recommended Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology Education, and the American Chemical Society Guidelines for Chemistry: data analysis, scientific writing, proper handling and disposal of laboratory materials, discipline-specific techniques, measurement, lab safety and personal protective equipment, and interpersonal and collaborative skills. Our analysis has determined that some of these skills are difficult to develop in a remote or online setting but could be recovered with appropriate interventions. Skill recovery procedures suggested include a skills “boot camp,” department or college coordinated club events, and a triage course.

DESIGN: Population‐based retrospective observational study. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. POPULATION: People with a cervix age of 21–69 years who completed at least one cervical screening cytology test, colposcopy or treatment procedure for cervical dysplasia between January 2019 and August 2020. METHODS: Administrative databases were used to compare cervical screening cytology, colposcopy and treatment procedure volumes before (historical comparator) and during the first 6 months of the COVID‐19 pandemic (March–August 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in cervical screening cytology, colposcopy and treatment volumes; individuals with high‐grade cytology awaiting colposcopy. RESULTS: During the first 6 months of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the monthly average number of cervical screening cytology tests, colposcopies and treatments decreased by 63.8% (range: −92.3 to −41.0%), 39.7% (range: −75.1 to −14.3%) and 31.1% (range: −43.5 to −23.6%), respectively, when compared with the corresponding months in 2019. Between March and August 2020, on average 292 (−51.0%) fewer high‐grade cytological abnormalities were detected through screening each month. As of August 2020, 1159 (29.2%) individuals with high‐grade screening cytology were awaiting follow‐up colposcopy. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on key cervical screening and follow‐up services in Ontario.

The purpose of this study was to explore the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 from a single centre. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Demographic and clinical factors and laboratory data were reviewed and collected to evaluate for significant associations. RESULTS: The study included 541 patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 (26.6%) patients had a history of CVD. The mortality of patients with CVD reached 22.2%, which was higher than that of the overall population of this study (9.8%). Patients with CVD were also more likely to develop liver function abnormality, elevated blood creatinine and lactic dehydrogenase (p<0.05). Symptoms of sputum production were more common in patients with CVD (p=0.026). Lymphocytes, haemoglobin and albumin below the normal range were pervasive in the CVD group (p<0.05). The proportion of critically ill patients in the CVD group (27.8%) was significantly higher than that in the non-CVD group (8.8%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that CVD (OR: 2.735 (95% CI 1.495 to 5.003), p=0.001) was associated with critical COVID-19 condition, while patients with coronary heart disease were less likely to reach recovery standards (OR: 0.331 (95% CI 0.125 to 0.880), p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high prevalence of CVD, a thorough CVD assessment at diagnosis and early intervention are recommended in COVID-19 patients with CVD.

A pair of siRNA duplexes identified as potent SCV inhibitors in vitro was evaluated for in vivo efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque SARS model using intranasal administration with clinical viable delivery carrier in three dosing regimens. Observations of SCV-induced SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence in the respiratory tract, microscopic inspections of lung histopathology, and immunohistochemistry sections from 21 tested macaques consistently demonstrated siRNA-mediated anti-SCV activity. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies resulted in relief of animals from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV in upper airway and lung alveoli, and milder acute diffuse alveoli damage (DAD). The dosages of siRNA used, 10 to 40 mg/kg, did not show any sign of siRNA-induced toxicity. These results support that a clinical investigation of this anti-SARS siRNA therapeutic agent is warranted.

Objective To determine whether practice of urologists is in line with guidelines for the management of common urological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic produced by leading (inter)national urological associations. Design, setting, and participants Self-selected urologists completed a voluntary survey available online from March 27 to April 11, 2020 and distributed globally by the Société Internationale d’Urologie. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Responses to two survey questions on the (1) management of 14 common urological procedures and (2) priority scoring of 10 common urological procedures were evaluated by practice setting and geographical region using chi-square and one-way analysis of variance analyses, respectively. Results and limitations There were 2494 respondents from 76 countries. Oncological conditions were prioritised over benign conditions, and benign conditions were deferred when feasible and safe. Oncological conditions with the greatest malignant potential were prioritised over less aggressive cancers. Respondents from Europe were least likely to postpone and most likely to prioritise conditions identified by guidelines as being of the highest priority. Respondents’ priority scoring of urological procedures closely matched the priorities assigned by guidelines. The main limitation of this study is that respondents were self-selected, and access to the survey was limited by language and technology barriers. Conclusions Prioritisation and management of urological procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic are in line with current guidelines. The greatest agreement was reported in Europe. Observed differences may be related to limited resources in some settings.

681866,Measurement of population mental health: evidence from a mobile phone survey in India,2021-03-09,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pneumonitis often have hypoxemic respiratory failure and a need of supplementary oxygen. Guidelines recommend controlled oxygen, for most patients with a recommended interval of SpO(2) between 92 and 96%. We aimed to determine if closed-loop control of oxygen was feasible in patients with COVID-19 and could maintain SpO(2) in the specified interval. METHODS: Patients were prospectively enrolled in an observational study on a medical ward dedicated to patients with COVID-19. Closed-loop controlled oxygen was delivered by O2matic® which can deliver 0–15 liters/min and adjusts flow every second based on 15 seconds averaging of SpO(2) measured by pulse oximetry. Lung function parameters were measured at admission. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (six women, nine men) participated in the study. Average age was 72 years. Lung function was severely impaired with FEV(1), FVC and PEF reduced to approximately 50%. The average stay on the ward was 3.2 days and O2matic was used on average for 66 hours, providing 987 hours of observation. O2matic maintained SpO(2) in the desired interval for 82.9% of the time. Time with SpO(2) > 2% below interval was 5.1% and time with SpO(2) > 2% above interval was 0.6%. CONCLUSION: Closed-loop control of oxygen to patients with COVID-19 is feasible and can maintain SpO(2) in the specified interval in the majority of time. Closed-loop automated control could be of particular benefit for patients in isolation with decreased visibility, surveillance and monitoring. Further studies must examine the clinical benefits.","Hansen, Ejvind Frausing; Bech, Charlotte Sandau; Vestbo, Jørgen; Andersen, Ove; Kofod, Linette Marie",European clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/20018525.2020.1833695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144929/,504
682111,Obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic: both cause of high risk and potential effect of lockdown? A population-based electronic health record study,2020-12-14,"Conflicting results have been obtained through meta-analyses for the role of obesity as a risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), possibly due to the inclusion of predominantly multimorbid patients with severe COVID-19. Here, we aimed to study obesity alone or in combination with other comorbidities as a risk factor for short-term all-cause mortality and other adverse outcomes in Mexican patients evaluated for suspected COVID-19 in ambulatory units and hospitals in Mexico. We performed a retrospective observational analysis in a national cohort of 71 103 patients from all 32 states of Mexico from the National COVID-19 Epidemiological Surveillance Study. Two statistical models were applied through Cox regression to create survival models and logistic regression models to determine risk of death, hospitalisation, invasive mechanical ventilation, pneumonia and admission to an intensive care unit, conferred by obesity and other comorbidities (diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, immunosuppression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). Models were adjusted for other risk factors. From 24 February to 26 April 2020, 71 103 patients were evaluated for suspected COVID-19; 15 529 (21.8%) had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2; 46 960 (66.1%), negative and 8614 (12.1%), pending results. Obesity alone increased adjusted mortality risk in positive patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.04–2.98), but not in negative and pending-result patients. Obesity combined with other comorbidities further increased risk of death (DM: HR = 2.79, 95% CI 2.04–3.80; immunosuppression: HR = 5.06, 95% CI 2.26–11.41; hypertension: HR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.77–3.01) and other adverse outcomes. In conclusion, obesity is a strong risk factor for short-term mortality and critical illness in Mexican patients with COVID-19; risk increases when obesity is present with other comorbidities.","Vera-Zertuche, J.

METHODS: We used 184 nasopharyngeal swab specimens to compare Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 (Abbott ID NOW), DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (DiaSorin Simplexa), and Roche cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (Roche cobas) assays. In a separate analysis, 3 specimens (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasal) were collected from 182 unique patients presenting to the emergency department with suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 and were tested utilizing Abbott ID NOW. To further characterize each assay, relative limits of detection were evaluated utilizing positive nasopharyngeal patient samples. RESULTS: The positive percent agreement was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.97) for Abbott ID NOW and 100% (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) for DiaSorin Simplexa and Roche cobas. The negative percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 0.98-1.00) for all 3 assays. All swab types tested with the Abbott assay produced concordant results. Polymerase chain reaction assays had approximately 10 to 100 times lower limits of detection than Abbott ID NOW. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these evaluations, a multiplatform testing approach is proposed, depending on patient population and assay sensitivity, to address testing needs during a public health emergency.","Cradic, Kendall; Lockhart, Marie; Ozbolt, Patrick; Fatica, Lisa; Landon, Lorie; Lieber, Michael; Yang, David; Swickard, Juanita; Wongchaowart, Nicholas; Fuhrman, Susan; Antonara, Stella",Am J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32462195/,504
684746,"Size-Segregated Particle Number Concentrations and Respiratory Emergency Room Visits in Beijing, China",2010-11-30,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences in refugees camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with 600,000 concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (mean age, 21 years; standard deviation [SD], 18 years; 52% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution. Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61%–92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 2–65), 54 (95% PI, 3–223), and 370 (95% PI, 4–1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300–463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300–567,000), and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800–595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55–136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660–2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030–3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090–3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.","Truelove, Shaun; Abrahim, Orit; Altare, Chiara; Lauer, Stephen A.; Grantz, Krya H.; Azman, Andrew S.; Spiegel, Paul",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32544156/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003144,504

Lack of COVID-19 patient data has hindered the data science community in developing models to aid in the response to the pandemic. Objectives To describe the rapid development and evaluation of clinical algorithms to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization using patient data by citizen scientists, provide an unbiased assessment of model performance, and benchmark model performance on subgroups. Design, Setting, and Participants This diagnostic and prognostic study operated a continuous, crowdsourced challenge using a model-to-data approach to securely enable the use of regularly updated COVID-19 patient data from the University of Washington by participants from May 6 to December 23, 2020. A postchallenge analysis was conducted from December 24, 2020, to April 7, 2021, to assess the generalizability of models on the cumulative data set as well as subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, and time of COVID-19 test. By December 23, 2020, this challenge engaged 482 participants from 90 teams and 7 countries. Main Outcomes and Measures Machine learning algorithms used patient data and output a score that represented the probability of patients receiving a positive COVID-19 test result or being hospitalized within 21 days after receiving a positive COVID-19 test result. Algorithms were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) scores. Ensemble models aggregating models from the top challenge teams were developed and evaluated. Results In the analysis using the cumulative data set, the best performance for COVID-19 diagnosis prediction was an AUROC of 0.776 (95% CI, 0.775-0.777) and an AUPRC of 0.297, and for hospitalization prediction, an AUROC of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.794-0.798) and an AUPRC of 0.188. Analysis on top models submitting to the challenge showed consistently better model performance on the female group than the male group. Among all age groups, the best performance was obtained for the 25- to 49-year age group, and the worst performance was obtained for the group aged 17 years or younger. Conclusions and Relevance In this diagnostic and prognostic study, models submitted by citizen scientists achieved high performance for the prediction of COVID-19 testing and hospitalization outcomes. Evaluation of challenge models on demographic subgroups and prospective data revealed performance discrepancies, providing insights into the potential bias and limitations in the models.","Yan, Yao; Schaffter, Thomas; Bergquist, Timothy; Yu, Thomas; Prosser, Justin; Aydin, Zafer; Jabeer, Amhar; Brugere, Ivan; Gao, Jifan; Chen, Guanhua; Causey, Jason; Yao, Yuxin; Bryson, Kevin; Long, Dustin R; Jarvik, Jeffrey G; Lee, Christoph I; Wilcox, Adam; Guinney, Justin; Mooney, Sean",JAMA network open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633425/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.24946,504

La couverture médiatique omniprésente de la pandémie nous empêche souvent de prendre du recul. Les représentations schématiques, l’humour et les métaphores utilisées dans la bande dessinée pourraient faciliter la compréhension d’informations complexes et ainsi peut-être nous aider à favoriser l’attention du grand public. La bande dessinée est également accessible à un public plus large que les médias habituels, notamment grâce à leur diffusion sur les médias sociaux. Dans le domaine des pandecomics, la collaboration entre professionnels de santé et artistes (scénaristes et illustrateurs) revêt une importance particulière, et elle est ici illustrée par trois projets de bande dessinée menés pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes « Faire Face » est un projet collaboratif entre des professionnels de santé hospitaliers et l’association TheInkLink, un réseau engagé de professionnels de la bande dessinée et du développement, travaillant souvent avec l’OMS. À partir de 22 témoignages de professionnels travaillant en CHU, 11 auteurs ont créé 10 histoires fictives qui racontent avec humour et gravité les initiatives des professionnels de santé pendant la pandémie. Ces témoignages ont donné naissance à un livre financé par le mécénat du CHU et une campagne de financement participatif. Résultats « Coronaaah, c’est quoi ? » est une bande dessinée de vulgarisation scientifique sur le COVID-19, créée par une médecin infectiologue et une autrice de bande dessinée, et soutenue par le Collège santé d’une université française. Le format de la bande dessinée a permis d’expliquer des informations scientifiques complexes de manière amusante au grand public. « Coco-le-virus » est une bande dessinée pour enfants, créée par Marguerite et Paul de Livron pour aider les familles et les professionnels de l’enfance pendant la pandémie, en abordant avec humour et tendresse plusieurs thèmes autour du COVID-19. Ils ont collaboré avec plusieurs professionnels de santé afin de préparer les enfants à la réouverture des écoles et plus récemment pour expliquer comment les enfants peuvent prendre soin de leur système immunitaire en améliorant leur hygiène de vie. Conclusion La collaboration avec des artistes de bande dessinée peut être très utile pour aider les professionnels de santé à délivrer des messages complexes de manière simple, ce qui semble crucial en ces temps troublés.

METHODS: Electronic databases of PubMed, WHO, CDC, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Google, and Cochrane library were extensively searched for ZIKV. Articles were reviewed, scrutinized and critically appraised and the most relevant articles were utilized. RESULTS: ZIKV is an emerging Flavivirus which was first isolated from Uganda in 1947. It is transmitted mainly through bite of Aedes mosquitoes. Sexual, perinatal and blood-borne transmissions are implicated. ZIKV is incriminated to cause microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The spiky spread of ZIKV and its epidemic potential are especially problematic in countries which host big MGs with endogenous ZIKV circulation. This put millions of international travelers and local inhabitants at risk of acquiring ZIKV, especially in absence of vaccine until now. Brazil Olympic and Paralympics Games, and Muslims Hajj in Saudi Arabia are important upcoming MGs. Regarding Brazil, swiftly epidemic of ZIKV causes phobia and provokes claims and counter-claims about possible postponing or cancellation of such events. RECOMMENDATIONS: Intensifying ZIKV epidemiological surveillance (sentinel, syndromic, environmental, laboratory and electronic), and conduction of educational programs are required.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document the change in diet quality and in food insecurity observed during the COVID-19–related early lockdown. We hypothesized that the lockdown was associated with a deterioration in overall diet quality and an increase in food insecurity. METHODS: Data are from a COVID-19 subsample of NutriQuébec, a web-based cohort destined to study temporal changes in dietary habits among adults in Quebec, Canada. Participants completed questionnaires before (between June 2019 and February 2020) and during (April to May 2020) early lockdown, including a validated web-based 24-h recall (n = 853) and a questionnaire on food security (n = 922). Primary study outcomes were temporal changes in diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)–2015 and in the prevalence of food insecurity. RESULTS: There was a small increase in the HEI-2015 during the COVID-19 early lockdown compared with baseline (+1.1 points; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.5), mostly due to small improvements in the intakes of whole grains, greens and beans, refined grains, total vegetables, total dairy, seafood and plant proteins, added sugar, and total protein subscores of the HEI-2015. Exploratory analyses suggested that individuals aged 18–29 y (+3.6 points; 95% CI: 2.4, 4.7), participants with lower education (+1.9 points; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.6), or with obesity (+3.8 points; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.8) showed particularly important increases in the HEI-2015. The prevalence of food insecurity was reduced from 3.8% at baseline to 1.0% during the early lockdown (prevalence ratio = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypotheses, diet quality has slightly improved and prevalence of food insecurity was reduced in this sample of adults from Quebec during the COVID-19–related early lockdown. These results may be generalizable only to relatively healthy populations.","Lamarche, Benoît; Brassard, Didier; Lapointe, Annie; Laramée, Catherine; Kearney, Michèle; Côté, Mélina; Bélanger-Gravel, Ariane; Desroches, Sophie; Lemieux, Simone; Plante, Céline",Am J Clin Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398347/,504

In this study, we apply the singular perturbed vector field (SPVF) method to the COVID-19 mathematical model of to expose the hierarchy of the model. This decomposition enables us to rewrite the model in new coordinates in the form of fast and slow subsystems and, hence, to investigate only the fast subsystem with different asymptotic methods. In addition, this decomposition enables us to investigate the stability analysis of the model, which is important in case of COVID-19.

690655,"Association of Public Health Interventions With the Epidemiology of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Wuhan, China",2020,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer patients are a highly vulnerable subgroup in this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This crisis has dramatically disrupted the continuous care provided to cancer patients, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Thus, studies that help gain insights into COVID-19 prevalence, disease severity, prognosis, and clinical outcomes in cancer patients are of great importance. In this review, we outline the current knowledge of disease outcomes and prognoses for cancer patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and learn if the severity is exacerbated by cancer type, anticancer therapies, gender, behavioral risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption), and comorbidities. Our article will help clinicians determine cases where treatment can be postponed during the pandemic and will encourage further research to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cancer patients. ABSTRACT: The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and outcomes vary immensely among patients. Predicting disease progression and managing disease symptoms is even more challenging in cancer patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, often suppress the immune system, rendering cancer patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe complications. However, data on the effects of immunosuppression on COVID-19 outcomes in cancer patients remain limited. Further investigations are warranted to better understand the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients, particularly those that are immunocompromised. In this review, we outline the current knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients.","Seth, Gaurav; Sethi, Saira; Bhattarai, Shristi; Saini, Geetanjali; Singh, Chandra Bhushan; Aneja, Ritu",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12113266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167313/,504
