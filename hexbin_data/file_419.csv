4275,Effect of trauma-informed care on hair cortisol concentration in youth welfare staff and client physical aggression towards staff: results of a longitudinal study,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Professional caregivers working in child and youth welfare institutions are frequently faced with the complex mental health issues, emotional needs and challenging coping strategies of clients with cumulated traumatic experiences, leaving them prone to developing high levels of stress, burn-out and compassion fatigue. Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a milieu-therapeutic approach that aims to promote the self-efficacy and self-care of youth welfare staff by guiding them to a better understanding of their own and their clients’ stress symptoms and countertransference. Despite increasing efforts to implement TIC practices, and more widespread recognition of their value in youth welfare systems, there is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of this approach. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of TIC practices in youth welfare institutions on both the physiological stress of staff members and clients’ physical aggression towards their caregivers. . METHODS: Data was obtained from a longitudinal study investigating the effectiveness of TIC in 14 residential youth welfare institutions. Our sample consisted of 47 youth welfare employees (66.0% female) aged from 23 to 60 years (M = 37.4, SD = 10.4 years). Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and occurrences of client physical aggression were assessed at four annual measurement time points (T1 to T4). RESULTS: Participants in five institutions employing TIC practices (intervention group) showed significantly lower HCC at T4 than staff members from institutions who did not receive training in TIC (control group), indicating reduced physiological stress levels. At T4, the intervention group reported significantly less physical aggression than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: TIC might be a promising approach for reducing the emotional burden of employees and institutions should invest in training their staff in TIC practices. More research is necessary, to investigate the benefits and efficacy of TIC, both to youths and staff members, and to foster a better understanding of which specific factors may contribute to stress reduction.","Schmid, Marc; Lüdtke, Janine; Dolitzsch, Claudia; Fischer, Sophia; Eckert, Anne; Fegert, Jörg M.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947862/,419

METHODS: This phase 2, open-label, dose-response study randomized patients with AP, accompanying SIRS, and hypoxemia (n = 21) to receive low-dose or high-dose Auxora plus standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone. All patients received pancreatic contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans at screenings, day 5/discharge, and as clinically required 90 days postrandomization; scans were blinded and centrally read to determine AP severity using computed tomography severity index. Solid food tolerance was assessed at every meal and SIRS every 12 hours. RESULTS: The number of patients experiencing serious adverse events was not increased with Auxora versus SOC alone. Three (36.5%) patients with moderate AP receiving low-dose Auxora improved to mild AP; no computed tomography severity index improvements were observed with SOC. By study end, patients receiving Auxora better tolerated solid foods, had less persistent SIRS, and had reduced hospitalization versus SOC. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and patient outcomes suggest Auxora may be an appropriate early treatment for patients with AP and SIRS. Clinical development will continue in a randomized, controlled, blinded, dose-ranging study.","Bruen, Charles; Miller, Joseph; Wilburn, John; Mackey, Caleb; Bollen, Thomas L.; Stauderman, Kenneth; Hebbar, Sudarshan",Pancreas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104014/,419

Surgically placed drains under suction or gravity are routinely used to help mitigate the complications associated with POPF. Controversy exists as to whether one of these drain management strategies is superior. The objective was to identify and compare the incidence of POPF, adverse events, and resource utilization associated with passive gravity (PG) versus active suction (AS) drainage following pancreatic resection. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to May 18, 2020. Outcomes of interest included POPF, post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH), surgical site infection (SSI), other major morbidity, and resource utilization. Descriptive qualitative and pooled quantitative meta-analyses were performed. One randomized control trial and five cohort studies involving 10 663 patients were included. Meta-analysis found no difference in the odds of developing POPF between AS and PG (p = 0.78). There were no differences in other endpoints including PPH (p = 0.58), SSI (wound p = 0.21, organ space p = 0.05), major morbidity (p = 0.71), or resource utilization (p = 0.72). The risk of POPF or other adverse outcomes is not impacted by drain management following pancreatic resection. Based on current evidence, a suggestion cannot be made to support the use of one drain over another at this time. There is a trend toward increased intra-abdominal wound infections with AS drains (p = 0.05) that merits further investigation.","Park, Lily J; Baker, Laura; Smith, Heather; Lemke, Madeline; Davis, Alexandra; Abou-Khalil, Jad; Martel, Guillaume; Balaa, Fady K; Bertens, Kimberly A",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-021-06158-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046692/,419

We explore the economic aspects of stockpiling various types and combinations of RPDs by adapting a pandemic model that estimates the impact of a severe pandemic on a defined population, the number of potential interactions between patients and health care personnel, and the potential number of health care personnel needed to fulfill those needs. Our model calculates the number of the different types of RPDs that should be stockpiled and the consequent cost of purchase and storage, prorating this cost over the shelf life of the inventory. Compared with disposable N95 or powered air-purifying respirators, we show that stockpiling reusable elastomeric half-face respirators is the least costly approach. Disposable N95 respirators take up significantly more storage space, which increases relative costs. Reusing or extending the usable period of disposable devices may diminish some of these costs. We conclude that stockpiling a combination of disposable N95 and reusable half-face RPDs is the best approach to preparedness for most health care organizations. We recommend against stockpiling powered air-purifying respirators as they are much more costly than alternative approaches.","Baracco, Gio; Eisert, Sheri; Eagan, Aaron; Radonovich, Lewis",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2015.12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25874891/,419

Based on trauma research, one might expect that survivors of childhood abuse would be susceptible to these negative outcomes during the pandemic, and that among this population a stronger relation between emotion regulation difficulties and symptomatology would be found. Aiming to explore these suppositions, an online survey was conducted among 710 Israeli adults. Of them, 370 were childhood abuse survivors. A history of childhood abuse, COVID-19-related stressors, overall psychological distress, and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the pandemic were assessed via self-report measures. Participants with a history of childhood abuse had elevated overall psychological distress as well as peritraumatic stress symptoms during the pandemic, compared to nonabused participants, above and beyond demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors. Emotion regulation difficulties were related to elevated psychological distress and peritraumatic stress symptoms among both childhood abuse survivors and nonabused participants. Nonetheless, a history of childhood abuse moderated the relations between the emotion regulation difficulty of being unable to engage in goal-directed behaviors when distressed (on one hand) and mental outcomes (on the other): Although the associations between inability to engage in goal-directed behaviors, overall psychological distress, and peritraumatic stress symptoms were nonsignificant among nonabused participants, they were significant among childhood abuse survivors. The current findings suggest that a history of childhood abuse might be a risk factor for distress in the face of COVID-19, and that childhood abuse survivors would benefit from clinical interventions that promote emotion regulation skills during this ongoing global health crisis.","Siegel, Alana; Lahav, Yael",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605211021968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088243/,419

Theoretical advantages of NOTES include decreased postoperative pain, reduction/elimination of general anesthesia, improved cosmetic outcomes, elimination of skin incision-related complications such as wound infections and hernias, and increased overall patient satisfaction. Although various forms of port creation to accomplish thoracic NOTES procedures have been proposed, transesophageal NOTES has been shown to be the most reliable one. The evolution of endoscopic submucosal transesophageal access resulted in the development of per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), which had a fast transition to clinical practice.

72877,Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with ustekinumab treatment.,2021-04-04,"Initially discovered in the context of immunomodulation, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) were soon identified as enzymes catalyzing the rate-limiting protein folding step at peptidyl bonds preceding proline residues. Intense searches revealed that PPIases are a superfamily of proteins consisting of three structurally distinguishable families with representatives in every described species of prokaryote and eukaryote and, recently, even in some giant viruses. Despite the clear-cut enzymatic activity and ubiquitous distribution of PPIases, reports on solely PPIase-dependent biological roles remain scarce. Nevertheless, they have been found to be involved in a plethora of biological processes, such as gene expression, signal transduction, protein secretion, development, and tissue regeneration, underscoring their general importance. Hence, it is not surprising that PPIases have also been identified as virulence-associated proteins. The extent of contribution to virulence is highly variable and dependent on the pleiotropic roles of a single PPIase in the respective pathogen. The main objective of this review is to discuss this variety in virulence-related bacterial and protozoan PPIases as well as the involvement of host PPIases in infectious processes. Moreover, a special focus is given to Legionella pneumophila macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip) and Mip-like PPIases of other pathogens, as the best-characterized virulence-related representatives of this family. Finally, the potential of PPIases as alternative drug targets and first tangible results are highlighted.","Ünal, Can M; Steinert, Michael",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00015-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25184565/,419
73913,"Organizational commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion: A strategic path forward.",2021-08-09,"As a major analytical method for outbreak detection, Kulldorff's space-time scan statistic (2001, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A 164, 61-72) has been implemented in many syndromic surveillance systems. Since, however, it is based on circular windows in space, it has difficulty correctly detecting actual noncircular clusters. Takahashi et al. (2008, International Journal of Health Geographics 7, 14) proposed a flexible space-time scan statistic with the capability of detecting noncircular areas. It seems to us, however, that the detection of the most likely cluster defined in these space-time scan statistics is not the same as the detection of localized emerging disease outbreaks because the former compares the observed number of cases with the conditional expected number of cases. In this article, we propose a new space-time scan statistic which compares the observed number of cases with the unconditional expected number of cases, takes a time-to-time variation of Poisson mean into account, and implements an outbreak model to capture localized emerging disease outbreaks more timely and correctly. The proposed models are illustrated with data from weekly surveillance of the number of absentees in primary schools in Kitakyushu-shi, Japan, 2006.","Tango, Toshiro; Takahashi, Kunihiko; Kohriyama, Kazuaki",Biometrics,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01412.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20374242/,419
75358,Efficient removal of selenate in water by cationic poly(allyltrimethylammonium) grafted chitosan and biochar composite.,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is preferred as the initial ventilatory support to treat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) may be an alternative method; however, the effects of HFNC in hypercapnic COPD are not well known. This preliminary study aimed at assessing the physiologic effects of HFNC at different flow rates in hypercapnic COPD and to compare it with NIV. METHODS A prospective physiologic study enrolled 12 hypercapnic COPD patients who had initially required NIV, and were ventilated with HFNC at flow rates increasing from 10 to 50 L/min for 15 min in each step. The primary outcome was the effort to breathe estimated by a simplified esophageal pressure-time product (sPTPes). The other studied variables were respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and transcutaneous CO2 pressure (PtcCO2). RESULTS Before NIV initiation, the median [interquartile range] pH was 7.36 [7.28-7.37] with a PaCO2 of 51 [42-60] mmHg. sPTPes per minute was significantly lower with HFNC at 30 L/min than 10 and 20 L/min (p < 0.001), and did not significantly differ with NIV (median inspiratory/expiratory positive airway pressure of 11 [10-12] and [5-5] cmH2O, respectively). At 50 L/min, sPTPes per minute increased compared to 30 L/min half of the patients. Respiratory rate was lower (p = 0.003) and SpO2 was higher (p = 0.028) with higher flows (30-50 L/min) compared to flow rate of 10 L/min and not different than with NIV. No significant differences in PtcCO2 between NIV and HFNC at different flow rates were observed (p = 0.335). CONCLUSIONS Applying HFNC at 30 L/min for a short duration reduces inspiratory effort in comparison to 10 and 20 L/min, and resulted in similar effect than NIV delivered at modest levels of pressure support in hypercapnic COPD with mild to moderate exacerbation. Higher flow rates reduce respiratory rate but sometimes increase the effort to breathe. Using HFNC at 30 L/min in hypercapnic COPD patients should be further evaluated.

76776,Intravenous levothyroxine stewardship program at a tertiary academic medical center.,2021-04-04,"BACKGROUND The vertebral artery (VA) ostium (VAO) is a common stenosis site. Most patients with VAO stenosis refractory to medical treatment are treated endovascularly using stenting. To optimally cover the ostial plaque, which frequently extends into the adjacent subclavian artery, part of the stent must overhang in the subclavian artery. This configuration makes subsequent VA access very challenging in cases of in-stent or distal vertebrobasilar pathology; it also obstructs the distal subclavian artery. OBJECTIVE To determine whether angioplasty at the ostium with a dual balloon (Flash Ostial) specially designed to allow the subclavian end of the stent to flare might circumvent these problems and, most importantly, provide optimal plaque coverage around the vertebral ostium. METHODS Between June 2012 and July 2014, 11 patients with symptomatic VAO stenosis refractory to best medical therapy were treated with stenting and dual balloon Flash angioplasty. Demographics, results, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 12 VAO stenting-dual balloon angioplasty procedures were performed (mean stenosis, 83.6%; range, 78-90%). Nine patients had mild-to-moderate (40-60%) contralateral VAO stenosis. The initial average modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 1.25. In all cases, immediate postangioplasty angiography showed excellent stent apposition against the VA and around the ostium in the subclavian artery. No permanent perioperative complications or deaths occurred. At a mean follow-up of 10.8 months (range 2-24), all patients had symptom resolution and no evidence of symptomatic restenosis on neuroimaging/Doppler studies; the average mRS score was 0.66. Three patients continued to have previously diagnosed mid-cervical VA stenosis; one of them had postprocedure dissection and an asymptomatic in-stent stenosis at 8 months. CONCLUSIONS Safety and feasibility were demonstrated using the Ostial Flash system for VAO stenting and angioplasty. No permanent perioperative complications were seen.","Rangel-Castilla, Leonardo; Gandhi, Sirin; Munich, Stephan A; Cress, Marshall C; Sonig, Ashish; Krishna, Chandan; Hopkins, L Nelson; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838198/,419

This monocenter retrospective study assessed the value of preoperative pH-impedance monitoring 'on' therapy to predict functional outcome after laparoscopic fundoplication in patients with refractory reflux symptoms. METHODS Patients with a preoperative pH-impedance monitoring 'on' proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) twice daily were assessed at least 6 months after a laparoscopic fundoplication for refractory reflux symptoms. Failure of fundoplication was defined by a Visick score > 2. Postoperative symptoms were assessed by the reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ). The pH-impedance parameters analyzed were the number of reflux events (total, acid, non-acid), esophageal acid exposure time, esophageal bolus exposure time, and symptom-reflux association defined by symptom index (SI) >50% and symptom association probability (SAP) >95%. KEY RESULTS Thirty-three patients (18 female patients, median age 46 years) were assessed after a mean follow-up of 41.3 (range 7-102.2) months. Seven (21.2%) patients were considered as failures. Compared to patients with favorable outcome, these patients were more often 'on' PPI therapy (86% vs 23%, p < 0.05) and had higher RDQ scores in each domain: heartburn (p < 0.05), regurgitation (p < 0.05) and dyspepsia (p < 0.05). A positive SAP was the only pH-impedance parameter statistically associated with successful postoperative outcome (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES On therapy, a preoperative positive symptom association probability is the only pH-impedance parameter associated with favorable outcome after laparoscopic fundoplication for refractory reflux symptoms. These results should be confirmed by prospective studies.","Desjardin, M; Luc, G; Collet, D; Zerbib, F",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26526815/,419

85434,Toileting Behaviors Related to Urination in Women: A Scoping Review.,2019,"Human coronavirus NL63 (NL63), a member of the group I coronaviruses, may cause acute respiratory diseases in young children and immunocompromised adults. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), NL63 also employs the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor for cellular entry. To identify residues in the spike protein of NL63 that are important for hACE2 binding, this study first generated a series of S1-truncated variants, examined their associations with the hACE2 receptor and subsequently mapped a minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) that consisted of 141 residues (aa 476-616) towards the C terminus of the S1 domain. The data also demonstrated that the NL63 RBD bound to hACE2 more efficiently than its full-length counterpart and had a binding efficiency comparable to the S1 or RBD of SARS-CoV. A further series of RBD variants was generated using site-directed mutagenesis and random mutant library screening assays, and identified 15 residues (C497, Y498, V499, C500, K501, R518, R530, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, E582, W585 and T591) that appeared to be critical for the RBD-hACE2 association. These critical residues clustered in three separate regions (designated RI, RII and RIII) inside the RBD, which may represent three receptor-binding sites. These results may help to delineate the molecular interactions between the S protein of NL63 and the hACE2 receptor, and may also enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of NL63 and SARS-CoV.","Lin, Han-Xin; Feng, Yan; Wong, Gillian; Wang, Liping; Li, Bei; Zhao, Xuesen; Li, Yan; Smaill, Fiona; Zhang, Chengsheng",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.83331-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18343844/,419

METHODS A randomised prospective clinical study. Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed under general anaesthesia on 10 healthy female dogs admitted for elective ovariectomy. Each ovary was randomly assigned to removal by use of either a SonoSurg™ ultrasonic surgical device (Olympus), or a LigaSure™ vessel-sealing system (Valleylab/Covidien). Surgical time for removal of each ovary was measured and the frequency of intra-operative complications was recorded. A follow-up was made by interview with the owners, 2·5 years after surgery. RESULTS The two techniques did not statistically differ with regard to surgical time, or frequency of complications. All owners were very satisfied with the procedure.

An earlier and accurate diagnosis of the brain tumor is of foremost important to avoid future complications. Precise segmentation of brain tumors provides a basis for surgical planning and treatment to doctors. Manual detection using MRI images is computationally complex in cases where the survival of the patient is dependent on timely treatment, and the performance relies on domain expertise. Therefore, computerized detection of tumors is still a challenging task due to significant variations in their location and structure, i.e., irregular shapes and ambiguous boundaries. In this study, we propose a custom Mask Region-based Convolution neural network (Mask RCNN) with a densenet-41 backbone architecture that is trained via transfer learning for precise classification and segmentation of brain tumors. Our method is evaluated on two different benchmark datasets using various quantitative measures.

87334,Pandemic exerts emotional toll.,2020-08-06,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This article describes the use and findings of the Hospital Medical Surge Preparedness Index (HMSPI) tool to improve the understanding of hospitals' ability to respond to mass casualty events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For this investigation, data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Dartmouth Atlas Project, and the 2005 to 2014 annual surveys of the American Hospital Association (AHA) were analyzed. The HMSPI tool uses variables from the AHA survey and the other two sources to allow facility, county, and referral area index calculations. Using the three data sets, the HMSPI also allows for an index calculation for per capita ratios and by political (state or county) boundaries. In this use case, the results demonstrated increases in county and state HMSPI scores through the period of analysis; however, no statistically significant difference was found in HMSPI scores between 2013 and 2014. The HMSPI builds on the limited scientific foundation of medical surge preparedness and could serve as an objective and standardized measure to assess the nation's medical readiness for crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other large-scale emergencies such as mass shootings. Future studies are encouraged to refine the score, assess the validity of the HMSPI, and evaluate its relevance in response to future legislative and executive policies that affect preparedness measures.","Marcozzi, David E; Pietrobon, Ricardo; Lawler, James V; French, Michael T; Mecher, Carter; Baehr, Nicole E; Browne, Brian J",Journal of healthcare management / American College of Healthcare Executives,https://doi.org/10.1097/jhm-d-20-00294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149035/,419

We fabricated tubes of fibroblast-derived collagenous matrix that have been shown to regenerate and grow as a pulmonary artery replacement in lambs and implemented a design for a valved conduit consisting of three tubes sewn together. Seven lambs were implanted with tri-tube valved conduits in sequential cohorts and compared to bioprosthetic conduits. Valves implanted into the pulmonary artery of two lambs of the first cohort of four animals functioned with mild regurgitation and systolic pressure drops <10 mmHg up to 52 weeks after implantation, during which the valve diameter increased from 19 mm to a physiologically normal ~25 mm. In a second cohort, the valve design was modified to include an additional tube, creating a sleeve around the tri-tube valve to counteract faster root growth relative to the leaflets. Two valves exhibited trivial-to-mild regurgitation at 52 weeks with similar diameter increases to ~25 mm and systolic pressure drops of <5 mmHg, whereas the third valve showed similar findings until moderate regurgitation was observed at 52 weeks, correlating to hyperincrease in the valve diameter. In all explanted valves, the leaflets contained interstitial cells and an endothelium progressing from the base of the leaflets and remained thin and pliable with sparse, punctate microcalcifications. The tri-tube valves demonstrated reduced calcification and improved hemodynamic function compared to clinically used pediatric bioprosthetic valves tested in the same model. This tri-tube valved conduit has potential for long-term valve growth in children.","Syedain, Zeeshan H; Haynie, Bee; Johnson, Sandra L; Lahti, Matthew; Berry, James; Carney, John P; Li, Jirong; Hill, Ryan C; Hansen, Kirk C; Thrivikraman, Greeshma; Bianco, Richard; Tranquillo, Robert T",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abb7225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731437/,419

Models of the conditional odds function are employed to understand the various random forest flavours. Existing random forest variants for ordinal outcomes, such as Ordinal Forests and Conditional Inference Forests, are evaluated in the presence of a non-proportional odds impact of prognostic variables. We propose two novel random forest variants in the model-based transformation forest family, only one of which explicitly assumes proportional odds. These two novel transformation forests differ in the specification of the split procedures for the underlying ordinal trees. One of these split criteria is able to detect changes in non-proportional odds situations and the other one focuses on finding proportional-odds signals.

Furthermore, this standardisation experiment demonstrates the performance and applicability of the recently developed 4πβ (plastic scintillator)-γ coincidence system for radionuclides decaying with complex decay schemes as well as for e, X-γ emitters. Additionally, 133Ba solution standards were prepared to calibrate the pressurized 4π γ ionisation chamber and determination of the calibration coefficient. The En score is a statistical indicator of the agreement between two independent estimations. Thus, the performance of the PS system was compared to the result obtained with the PC system using the En score as specified in the ISO13528:2015. The results of measurements are acceptable if En ≦ 1.0. An En score of 0.2 was obtained which indicates that, the 133Ba activity concentration obtained by the 4πβ (plastic scintillator) -γ coincidence and 4πβ (proportional counter) -γ coincidence systems are in agreement.

We describe our contemporary experience and technique for attaining retroperitoneal access. MATERIALS AND METHODS We outline our institutional approach to retroperitoneal access for the instruction of urologists at the beginning of the learning curve. The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position. The first incision is made just inferior to the tip of the twelfth rib as described by Hsu, et al. After the lumbodorsal fascia is traversed, the retroperitoneal space is dilated with a round 10 millimeter AutoSutureTM (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) balloon access device. The following trocars are used: A 130 millimeter KiiR balloon trocar (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA), three robotic, and one assistant. Key landmarks for the access and dissection are detailed. RESULTS 177 patients underwent a retroperitoneal robotic procedure from 2007 to 2015. Procedures performed include 158 partial nephrectomies, 16 pyeloplasties, and three radical nephrectomies. The robotic fourth arm was utilized in all cases. When compared with the transperitoneal approach, the retroperitoneal approach was associated with shorter operative times and decreased length of stay (1). Selection bias and surgeon preference accounted for the higher proportion of patients who underwent partial nephrectomy off-camp via the retroperitoneal approach. CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneal robotic surgery may confer several advantages. In patients with previous abdominal surgery or intra-abdominal conditions, the retroperitoneum can be safely accessed while avoiding intraperitoneal injuries. The retroperitoneum also provides a confined space that may minimize the sequelae of potential complications including urine leak. Moreover, at our institution, retroperitoneal robotic surgery is associated with shorter operative times and a decreased length of stay when compared with the transperitoneal approach (2). In selected patients, the retroperitoneal approach is a viable alternative to the transperitoneal approach for a variety of renal procedures.","Anderson, Barrett G; Wright, Alec J; Potretzke, Aaron M; Figenshau, R Sherburne",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1677-5538.ibju.2016.0633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727386/,419
99008,Pandemic places pharmacist in unexpected role.,2020-06-17,"RATIONALE It has been recognized that exposure to mass trauma tends to increase the time spent watching television (TV) news. Yet, research on the effects of this tendency on individuals' well-being yielded inconclusive findings. OBJECTIVE The aim of this longitudinal study is to examine the effects of prior trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on changes in the amount of TV news watching and its effect on subsequent PTSD. More specifically, we examined the interrelations of prior exposure to war captivity, long-term PTSD trajectories, and amount of change TV news watching with PTSD severity during the COVID-19 pandemic, among aging Israeli combat veterans. METHODS One-hundred-and-twenty Israeli ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) from 1973 Yom Kippur War and 65 matched controls (combat veterans from the same war) were followed up at five points of time: 1991 (T1), 2003 (T2), 2008 (T3), 2015 (T4), and in April-May 2020 (T5), during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Ex-POWs had higher odds of COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to PTSD severity at T5. In addition, delayed PTSD trajectory was associated with COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to more severe PTSD at T5. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight the negative implications of TV news watching during a mass trauma for traumatized individuals. More specifically, they demonstrate its potential pathogenic role in exacerbating prior PTSD among trauma survivors.","Solomon, Zahava; Ginzburg, Karni; Ohry, Avi; Mikulincer, Mario",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930678/,419

Methods: From January 20 to February 5, 2020, a total of 130 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from seven hospitals in China were collected. The imaging data were reviewed and analyzed in detail. Results: (1) Distribution: the lesion detected in the lung unilaterally in 14 cases (10.7%) and bilaterally in 116 cases (89.3%). According to the distribution in the lobes of the lung, all cases could be classified into subpleural distribution (102 cases, 78.4%), centrilobular distribution (99 cases, 76.1%) and diffused distribution (8 cases, 6.1%). (2) Number of lesions: single lesion 9 cases (6.9%); multiple lesions 113 cases (86.9%), diffuse lesions 8 cases (6.1%). (3) Imaging density: 70 cases (53.8%) of ground-glass opacity (GGO), 60 cases (46.2%) of GGO + consolidation. (4) Accompanying signs: 100 cases (76.9%) with vascular thickening, 98 cases (75.3%) with ""pleural parallel sign"" ; ""intralobular septal thickening"" in 100 cases (76.9%); ""halo sign"" in 13 cases (10%); ""reversed-halo sign"" in 6 cases (4.6%); pleural effusion in 3 cases (2.3 %), and pneumatocele in 2 cases (1.5%); no case with pulmonary cavity. Among 35 patients that underwent follow-up CT, 21 patients (60%) improved while 14 (40%) exacerbated. Conclusions: COVID-19 imaging characteristic mainly has subpleural, centrilobular and diffused distribution. The first two distributions can overlap or progress to diffused distribution. In the later period, it was mainly manifested as organizing pneumonia and fibrosis. The most valuable characteristic is the pleural parallel sign.","Wu, J; Feng, C L; Xian, X Y; Qiang, J; Zhang, J; Mao, Q X; Kong, S F; Chen, Y C; Pan, J P",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200217-00106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125131/,419

Unique patterns of shell protein disorder can be seen especially when GAG proteins (matrix M, capsid C, and nucleocapsid N) of primate and non-primate retroviruses are compared. HIV-1 presents the most unique pattern of disorder distribution with generally high levels of disorder in all three proteins, while EIAV (PIDs:: 26, 29, 13) is diametrically different from HIV-1 (N C M PIDs: 39.5 ± 3.0, 44.5 ± 2.6, 56.5 ± 10.8). The HTLV viruses (CPID: 32.8 ± 3.4) resemble HIV-2 (C PID: 26.6 ± 2.9) with a moderately disordered capsid. Totally distinct patterns, however, are seen for the non-primate retroviruses. They generally have highly disordered nucleocapsids (PID > 65%) and more ordered outer shells especially the matrix. These characteristics might be attributed to the differences in the way the retroviruses are transmitted, with non-primate viruses having greater non-sexual transmission components such as oral-fecal transmission. These differences are also evolutionarily related to the ways the viruses evade the host immune systems, and thus, have implications for oncolytic virotherapy and animal models in vaccine research. The importance of protein shell disorder in immune evasion, as related to the case of HIV-1, and the difficult search for its vaccines are highlighted.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A Keith; Uversky, Vladimir N",Molecular bioSystems,https://doi.org/10.1039/c5mb00277j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26080321/,419

Whereas neuroimaging studies have shown wide overlapping brain networks underpinning AM and empathic processes, studies on clinical populations with memory loss have not always shown empathy is impaired. The current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography study will seek to shed light on this neuropsychological puzzle by testing whether self-perceived empathy is causally linked to AM retrieval. Cortical activity, together with self-rating of empathy, will be recorded for scenarios that echo personal experiences while a brain region critical for AM retrieval will be transiently inhibited using TMS before task performance.","Meconi, Federica; Hodsoll, John; Goranova, Zheni; Degano, Giulio; Di Lello, Nicolò; Miniussi, Carlo; Avenanti, Alessio; Mevorach, Carmel",Journal of neuroscience research,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185890/,419

We cross-validated manual and automated high-throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, evaluated SARS-CoV-2-loads in nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS), lower respiratory-fluids, and plasma, and analyzed detection rates after lockdown- and relaxation-measures. METHODS Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas®6800-Target1 and Target2 were prospectively validated in 1'344 NOPS submitted during the first pandemic peak (week 13). Follow-up-cohort-(FUP)-1, -2 and -3 comprised 10'999, 10'147 and 19'389 NOPS submitted during 10-week-periods until week 23, 33, and 43, respectively. RESULTS Concordant results were obtained in 1'308 cases (97%) including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman r>0.95; p<0.001) for all assays and high precision by Bland-Altman analysis. Discordant samples (N=36, 3%) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2-loads (p<0.001). Following lockdown, detection rates declined to <1% in FUP-1 reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% and 12% in FUP-2 and -3, but infected patients were younger than during lockdown (34 versus 52 years, p<0.001). In 261 patients providing 936 NOPS, SARS-CoV-2-loads declined by three orders of magnitude within 10 days post-diagnosis (p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in NOPS correlated with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids or in plasma, but remained detectable in some cases with negative follow-up NOPS, respectively. CONCLUSION Manual and automated assays significantly correlated qualitatively and quantitatively. Following successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require independent dual-target-confirmation for reliable assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be obtained within <5 days, and consider lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.

118912,ASHP Policy Week 2020 tackles vital issues in pharmacy.,2020-12-04,"Type-I interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines that represent a first line of defense against virus infections. The 12 different IFN-? subtypes share a common receptor on target cells and trigger similar signaling cascades. Several studies have collectively shown that this apparent redundancy conceals qualitatively different responses induced by individual subtypes, which display different efficacies of inhibition of HIV replication. Some studies, however, provided evidence that the disparities are quantitative rather than qualitative. Since RNA-expression analyses show a large but incomplete overlap of the genes induced, they may support both models. To explore if the IFN-? subtypes induce functionally relevant different anti-HIV activities, we have compared the efficacy of inhibition of all 12 subtypes on HIV spread and on specific steps of the viral replication cycle, including viral entry, reverse transcription, protein synthesis and virus release. Finding different hierarchies of inhibition would validate the induction of qualitatively different responses. We found that while most subtypes similarly inhibit virus entry, they display distinctive potencies on other early steps of HIV replication. In addition, only some subtypes were able to target effectively the late steps. The extent of induction on known anti-HIV factors helps to explain some, but not all differences observed, confirming the participation of additional IFN-induced anti-HIV effectors. Our findings support the notion that different IFN-? subtypes can induce the expression of qualitatively different antiviral activities.ImportanceThe initial response against viruses relies in large part on type-I interferons, which include 12 subtypes of IFN-α. These cytokines bind to a common receptor on the cell surface and trigger the expression of incompletely overlapping sets of genes. Whether the anti-HIV responses induced by IFN-α subtypes differ in the extent of expression or in the nature of the genes involved remains debated. Also, RNA expression profiles led to opposite conclusions, depending on the importance attributed to the induction of common or distinctive genes. To explore if relevant anti-HIV activities can be differently induced by the IFN-α subtypes, we compared their relative efficacies on specific steps of the replication cycle. We show that the hierarchy of IFN potencies depends on the step analyzed, supporting qualitatively different responses. This work will also prompt the search for novel IFN-induced anti-HIV factors acting on specific steps of the replication cycle.","Tauzin, Alexandra; Ortiz, Armando Espinosa; Blake, Olivia; Soundaramourty, Calaiselvy; Joly-Beauparlant, Charles; Nicolas, Alexandre; Droit, Arnaud; Dutrieux, Jacques; Estaquier, Jérôme; Mammano, Fabrizio",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02311-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980591/,419

127773,Pragmatic application of area under the concentration-time curve monitoring from the 2020 vancomycin consensus guidelines.,2021-03-25,"In this report the basis for the structural architecture of the envelope of hantaviruses, family Bunyaviridae, is systematically studied by the interactions of two glycoproteins N and C (Gn and Gc, respectively) and their respective disulfide bridge-mediated homo- and heteromeric oligomerizations. In virion extracts Gn and Gc associated in both homo- and hetero-oligomers which were, at least partially, thiol bridge mediated. Due to strong homo-oligomerization, the hetero-oligomers of Gn and Gc are likely to be mediated by homo-oligomeric subunits. A reversible pH-induced disappearance of a neutralizing epitope in Gc and dissociation of the Gn-Gc complex at pH values below 6.2 provide proteochemical evidence for the fusogenicity of Gc. Incomplete inactivation of virions at acidic pH indicates that additional factors are required for hantavirus fusion, as in the case of pestiviruses of the Flaviviridae. Based on similarities to class II fusion proteins, a structure model was created of hantavirus Gc using the Semliki Forest virus E1 protein as a template. In total, 10 binding regions for Gn were found by peptide scanning, of which five represent homotypic (Gn(I) to Gn(V)) and five represent heterotypic (Gc(I) to Gc(V)) interaction sites that we assign as intra- and interspike connections, respectively. In conclusion, the glycoprotein associations were compiled to a model wherein the surface of hantaviruses is formed of homotetrameric Gn complexes interconnected with Gc homodimers. This organization would create the grid-like surface pattern described earlier for hantaviruses in negatively stained electron microscopy specimens.","Hepojoki, Jussi; Strandin, Tomas; Vaheri, Antti; Lankinen, Hilkka",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00481-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828613/,419

We explored the effect of the number of Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs; Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) deployed on rates of aneurysm occlusion and complications. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent saccular intracranial aneurysm treatment solely with the PED were included in this retrospective study. Computed tomographic, magnetic resonance, or digital subtraction angiographic images at 6 and 12 months and last follow-up (>12 months) were reviewed for aneurysm occlusion. Complication and retreatment rates were recorded and analyzed statistically. RESULTS The study included 141 aneurysm treatments in 119 patients. A single PED was deployed in 105 cases, two PEDs in 31 cases, and three PEDs in 5 cases (total = 182 devices). Six-month angiographic data were available for 103 patients. Occlusion rates were 67.1% for single-PED cases and 90.0% for cases with > 1 PED (p = 0.028). The 12-month occlusion rate (follow-up available for 132) for single-PED cases was 74.7% compared to 91.7% for multiple-PED cases (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, number of PEDs was an independent predictor of aneurysm occlusion at 12 months (odds ratio 6.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-22.8, p = 0.005). Thromboembolic complication rates were the same in the single- and multiple-PED treatment groups (2.8%). The retreatment rate was higher in patients treated with a single PED (16.2% vs. 0%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Deployment of > 1 Pipeline embolization device was associated with higher intracranial aneurysm occlusion and lower retreatment rates. No significant difference was found in complication rates.","Waqas, Muhammad; Vakharia, Kunal; Gong, Andrew D; Rai, Hamid H; Wack, Audrey; Fayyaz, Najya; Snyder, Kenneth V; Davies, Jason M; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919888130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766960/,419

The model independently assessed the relative contributions of microbial proliferation to the distal tip and microaspiration of contaminated secretions past the cuff by testing in three modes: microaspiration only, microbial proliferation only, and simultaneous microaspiration and microbial proliferation. We evaluated transmission of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in the presence of a standard ETT; a soft, tapered cuff ETT with subglottic suctioning; and a novel antimicrobial gendine (combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine) ETT in the model. In the microaspiration only mode, when leakage past the cuff occurred quickly, no ETT prevented transmission. When microaspiration was delayed, the gendine ETT was able to completely disinfect the fluid above the cuff and thereby prevent transmission of pathogens. In microbial proliferation only mode, the gendine ETT was the sole ETT that prevented transmission. With both mechanisms simultaneously available, transmission was dependent on how long microaspiration was delayed. Potent antimicrobial ETTs, such as a gendine ETT, can make unique contributions to prevent VAP when microaspiration is gradual.","Rosenblatt, Joel; Reitzel, Ruth; Jiang, Ying; Hachem, Ray; Raad, Issam",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/120468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818125/,419

We describe our utilization and implementation of telehealth (TH) for pediatric colorectal surgery MDC visits and collate patient satisfaction using TH compared to in-person (IP) visits. METHODS Implementation of a single-institution MDC TH platform to perform patient visits on February 1, 2020 was studied. Following 6 months of implementation, TH visits' characteristics were compared with IP visits in the 3 months before implementation by patient volume, length of clinic visits, and patient satisfaction survey results. RESULTS Before implementation, 152 (100%) of clinic visits were IP. During the implementation, 87 (37.7%) were TH visits. Seventy-four (49%) were MDC visits, 17 (23%) of these using the TH platform. Each TH visit's median length was 25 minutes (IQR 15-30), while the median length of IP visits was 45 minutes (IQR 30-45). Pre-implementation satisfaction scores were 88.6% positive, while satisfaction scores after implementation were 96.8% positive. None of the patients who utilized the TH platform had an unplanned hospital admission within 24 hours of being seen. CONCLUSION Our experience demonstrates that the TH platform can provide an efficient avenue for established patients and families to receive highly complex multidisciplinary follow-up care. High levels of patient satisfaction indicated that TH should become part of the routine care plan for patients who require long-term or consistent follow-up.","Lopez, Joseph J; Svetanoff, Wendy Jo; Rosen, John M; Carrasco, Alonso; Rentea, Rebecca M",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/00031348211023428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105388/,419

133609,"Epidemiology, virology and clinical aspects of hantavirus infections: an overview.",2021-04-22,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used quite successfully for semantic segmentation of brain tumors. However, current CNNs and attention mechanisms are stochastic in nature and neglect the morphological indicators used by radiologists to manually annotate regions of interest. In this paper, we introduce a channel and spatial wise asymmetric attention (CASPIAN) by leveraging the inherent structure of tumors to detect regions of saliency. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed layer, we integrate this into a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve higher Dice scores, with less GPU resources. Also, we investigate the inclusion of auxiliary multiscale and multiplanar attention branches to increase the spatial context crucial in semantic segmentation tasks. The resulting architecture is the new CASPIANET++, which achieves Dice Scores of 91.19%, 87.6% and 81.03% for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor respectively. Furthermore, driven by the scarcity of brain tumor data, we investigate the Noisy Student method for segmentation tasks. Our new Noisy Student Curriculum Learning paradigm, which infuses noise incrementally to increase the complexity of the training images exposed to the network, further boosts the enhancing tumor region to 81.53%. Additional validation performed on the BraTS2020 data shows that the Noisy Student Curriculum Learning method works well without any additional training or finetuning.","Liew, Andrea; Lee, Chun Cheng; Lan, Boon Leong; Tan, Maxine",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352452/,419

BACKGROUND The medication management process includes all structures and practices within the organisation that guide and support medication administration and related procedures. DESIGN A cross-sectional survey. METHODS A Finnish version of the Medication Administration System - Nurses Assessment of Satisfaction (modified MAS-NAS) paper-based questionnaire was sent to all nursing staff (N = 855) working in operative (n = 498) and psychiatric (n = 357) domains in one central hospital. Data were analysed using statistical methods. RESULTS In total, 324 nursing staff members participated. More than half agreed that medication management is efficient (64%), safe for patients (76%), and that the current medication administration system provides the necessary medical treatment information (e.g. prescriptions by physicians, medication data) (64%). Respondents' overall satisfaction with medication management process was slightly above average on a scale from 1 to 10 (mean = 6.2; SD = 1.8; median = 7, range 2-9). Respondents who used electronic medication chart reported higher overall satisfaction with medication management process (median = 7, mean = 6.1, SD = 1.8 and range 2-9) than those not using it (median = 6.5, mean = 6.3, SD = 1.6 and range 2-9). No statistically significant difference was found (U = 8552.000, p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed several problems in the medication management process. The results can be used in developing the medication management process.

Rodent models of I/R injury are providing significant insights into mechanisms and treatment strategies for human I/R injury, especially with regard to neurodegenerative damage in the retinal neurovascular unit. Presented here is a protocol for inducing retinal I/R injury in mice through elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). In this protocol, the ocular anterior chamber is cannulated with a needle, through which flows the drip of an elevated saline reservoir. Using this drip to raise IOP above systolic arterial blood pressure, a practitioner temporarily halts inner retinal blood flow (ischemia). When circulation is reinstated (reperfusion) by removal of the cannula, severe cellular damage ensues, resulting ultimately in retinal neurodegeneration. Recent studies demonstrate inflammation, vascular permeability, and capillary degeneration as additional elements of this model. Compared to alternative retinal I/R methodologies, such as retinal arterial ligation, retinal I/R injury by elevated IOP offers advantages in its anatomical specificity, experimental tractability, and technical accessibility, presenting itself as a valuable tool for examining neuronal pathogenesis and therapy in the retinal neurovascular unit.","Hartsock, Matthew J; Cho, Hongkwan; Wu, Lijuan; Chen, Wan-Ju; Gong, Junsong; Duh, Elia J",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/54065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501124/,419

We explored the impact on hypertension care in the Excellence Center (EC) network of the European Society of Hypertension. METHODS We conducted a 17-question electronic survey among ECs. RESULTS Overall, 52 ECs from 20 European and three non-European countries participated, providing hypertension service for a median of 1500 hypertensive patients per center per year. Eighty-five percent of the ECs reported a shutdown lasting for 9 weeks (range 0-16). The number of patients treated per week decreased by 90%: from a median of 50 (range 10-400) before the pandemic to a median of 5.0 (range 0-150) during the pandemic (P < 0.0001). 60% of patients (range 0-100%) declared limited access to medical consultations. The majority of ECs (57%) could not provide 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, whereas a median of 63% (range 0-100%) of the patients were regularly performing home BP monitoring. In the majority (75%) of the ECs, hypertension service returned to normal after the first wave of the pandemic. In 66% of the ECs, the physicians received many questions regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. Stopping RAS-blocker therapy (in a few patients) either by patients or physicians was reported in 27 and 36.5% of the ECs.

149932,"Miles and days until medical abortion via TelAbortion versus clinic in Oregon and Washington, USA.",2021-03-31,"INTRODUCTION Organisms have evolved a rapid and non-specific way to defend themselves via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize specific signatures present on invading microbes and viruses. Once detected, these receptors flood the cell with cytokines and IFNs that not only help to eradicate the invading viruses but also activate the adaptive immune response. Owing to difficulties in viral detection, a whole class of TLRs is dedicated to sensing viral nucleic acids, while other TLRs detect viral coat proteins and aid in establishing antiviral immunity. To protect humans better, TLRs and their downstream mediators can be used as potential drug targets, which can be either activated or inhibited, to counter viral infections. AREAS COVERED The current review focuses on TLR-targeting investigational drugs developed to treat viral diseases and virus-induced complications. EXPERT OPINION TLRs are a good choice for eradicating viral infections because they can fine-tune the immune response. However, TLRs should be exploited carefully, as there have been instances where their activation has led to unwanted responses in terms of both immune and viral activation. Therefore, more focus should be placed on novel drugs that can induce significant and long-term immunity, while concomitantly alleviating side effects.","Shah, Masaud; Anwar, Muhammad Ayaz; Kim, Jae-Ho; Choi, Sangdun",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,https://doi.org/10.1517/13543784.2016.1154040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26878224/,419

Still, the manner in which emotion impacts episodic memory is complex: Whereas emotion enhances some aspects of episodic memory-particularly central aspects-it dampens memory for peripheral/contextual information. Extending previous work, we examined the effects of emotion on one often overlooked aspect of memory, namely, temporal context. We tested whether emotion would impair memory for when an event occurred. Participants (N = 116 adults) watched videos wherein negative and neutral images were inserted. Consistent with prior work, results showed that emotion enhanced and impaired memory, respectively, for ""what"" and ""which."" Unexpectedly, emotion was associated with enhanced accuracy for ""when"": We found that participants estimated that neutral images occurred relatively later, but there was no such bias for negative images. By examining multiple features of episodic memory, we provide a holistic characterization of the myriad effects of emotion.","Palombo, Daniela J; Te, Alessandra A; Checknita, Katherine J; Madan, Christopher R",Psychological science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797621991548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160303/,419

Pneumococcal disease occurs more frequently in younger children and older adults. It is estimated that, in 2050, 30.3% of the European population will be ≥65 yrs old, compared with 15.7% in 2000. Preventive medicine, including vaccination, is essential for the promotion of healthy ageing. Uptake rates for influenza vaccination in the elderly are generally low, despite recommendations in many countries. In addition, it has been reported that influenza infections can make people more susceptible to pneumococcal infections. Despite pneumococcal vaccination, case fatality rates for patients hospitalised with invasive pneumococcal disease have remained at around 12% since the 1950s. Even when effective antibiotic therapy is administered, mortality can be high amongst immunocompetent patients in intensive care. Timely and accurate diagnosis of pneumococcal disease and identification of patients at high risk of poor outcome is essential to ensure that adequate treatment, including hospitalisation when necessary, is implemented as early as possible. Improved diagnostic techniques and more efficacious treatments may help to reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease, but preventive measures, such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, should be promoted in order to avoid preventable disease, particularly in the elderly.","Ludwig, E; Bonanni, P; Rohde, G; Sayiner, A; Torres, A",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/09059180.00008911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22379175/,419

Increasing recognition of paradoxical skin reactions induced by older biologic therapies used for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as adalimumab and infliximab, has led to the investigation of ustekinumab for the treatment of the cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations of IBD. In addition, ustekinumab may show efficacy in treating paradoxical cutaneous reactions to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. A search of the Medline/PubMed database, with additional citations obtained from the references section of relevant articles, yielded 22 articles that were included in this review. Ustekinumab is a safe and effective option for treating the cutaneous manifestations of IBD, such as metastatic Crohn's disease and pyoderma gangrenosum. It is also an effective treatment for TNF-α inhibitor-induced paradoxical skin reactions such as psoriasis that do not remit spontaneously or with conventional treatment.

These children need end-of-life services such as palliative care. The aim of this study was to identify the frequency of patients with CCC among all hospitalized children at our general pediatrics services and to describe the demographics, diagnosis, clinical spectrum, long-term care needs, and mortality data of patients with CCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS All hospitalizations in 2018 at the general pediatric services were screened retrospectively. Patients' hospitalization diagnoses, gender, age, comorbid conditions, number of emergency admissions in 2018, intensive care unit needs, mortality rates, and the number of hospitalizations in 2018 were investigated. RESULTS A total of 1591 patients were hospitalized for 2083 times in 2018. Overall, 145 of 1591 patients (9%) had CCC. Patients with CCC were hospitalized for 472 times (23% of all hospitalizations). The number of emergency admissions, the number of hospitalizations in 2018 and the need for intensive care, and the mortality rate during hospitalization for patients with CCC were significantly higher than those for patients without CCC. The median length of hospitalization in patients with CCC was significantly longer. CONCLUSION Patients with CCC were hospitalized frequently and longer, had increased emergency and PICU admissions, and special long-term care needs. Pediatricians who pioneer care for children with CCC need education, training, and coordinated support to ensure qualified long-term care for these patients.","Oztek Celebi, F Z; Senel, S",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2021.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140218/,419

Many serological tests have been developed to detect Abs against SARS-CoV-2. However, these tests have considerable variations in their specificity and sensitivity, and whether they can predict levels of neutralizing activity is yet to be determined. This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various Ag-specific Ab isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients confirmed via PCR test. We developed IgG, IgM, and IgA measurement assays for each Ag, including receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein, S1 domain, full-length S protein, S trimer, and nucleocapsid (N) domain, based on ELISA. The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed high specificity, whereas the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity. The sensitivity of all Ag-specific Ab isotypes depended on the timing of the serum collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-21 d postsymptom onset. The best correlation with virus-neutralizing activity was found for IgG against RBD, and levels of IgG against RBD in sera from four patients with severe COVID-19 increased concordantly with neutralizing activity. Our results provide valuable information regarding the selection of serological test for seroprevalence and vaccine evaluation studies.","Fujigaki, Hidetsugu; Inaba, Masato; Osawa, Michiko; Moriyama, Saya; Takahashi, Yoshimasa; Suzuki, Tadaki; Yamase, Kenya; Yoshida, Yukihiro; Yagura, Yo; Oyamada, Takayoshi; Takemura, Masao; Doi, Yohei; Saito, Kuniaki",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941657/,419

161654,A practical approach to remote precepting in a chronic disease management call center setting during a pandemic.,2020-11-27,"Mass disasters result in extensive health problems and make health care delivery problematic, as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although COVID-19 was initially considered a pulmonary problem, it soon became clear that various other organs were involved. Thus, many care providers, including kidney health personnel, were overwhelmed or developed burnout. This review aims to describe the spectrum of burnout in mass disasters and suggests solutions specifically for nephrology personnel by extending previous experience to the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout (a psychologic response to work-related stress) is already a frequent part of routine nephrology practice and, not surprisingly, is even more common during mass disasters due to increased workload and specific conditions, in addition to individual factors. Avoiding burnout is essential to prevent psychologic and somatic health problems in personnel as well as malpractice, understaffing, and inadequate health care delivery, all of which increase the health care burden of disasters. Burnout may be prevented by predisaster organizational measures, which include developing an overarching plan and optimizing health care infrastructure, and ad hoc disaster-specific measures that encompass both organizational and individual measures. Organizational measures include increasing safety, decreasing workload and fear of malpractice, optimizing medical staffing and material supplies, motivating personnel, providing mental health support, and enabling flexibility in working circumstances. Individual measures include training on coping with stress and problematic conditions, minimizing the stigma of emotional distress, and maintaining physical health. If these measures fall short, asking for external help is mandatory to avoid an inefficient disaster health care response. Minimizing burnout by applying these measures will improve health care provision, thus saving as many lives as possible.","Sever, Mehmet Sukru; Ortiz, Alberto; Maggiore, Umberto; Bac-García, Enrique; Vanholder, Raymond",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.08400520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33414153/,419
161785,Psychometric Properties of the Schizophrenia Oral Health Profile: Preliminary Results.,2021-08-28,"OBJECTIVE Renal transplantation is the most successful therapy to improve survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Living donors have been used as an alternative to reduce the stay on the waiting list. Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy has become the standard procedure for renal transplantation. Minimally invasive surgery involves less postoperative pain with less analgesic requirements allowing shorter hospital stay for the donor. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed demographic and intraoperative data and surgical complications for 46 patients who underwent laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy between March 2001 and March 2011. RESULTS Mean donor age was 41 years. Mean operative time was 170 ± 45 minutes. The average cold ischemic time was 40 minutes and warm ischemic time was 26 minutes. Twenty-one patients were donors for pediatric receptors. Fourty patients underwent left laparoscopic nephrectomy, the other 6 patients underwent right laparoscopic nephrectomy due to vascular anatomic variant. Right laparoscopic nephrectomy was converted in 1 case (2.2%) due to renal vein laceration without donor morbidity and without compromise of graft function. Renal function at the second day post donor nephrectomy was measured using serum creatinine averaged 1.2 mg/dL with a mean increase of 0.4 mg/dL from baseline, with normalization after 30 days. No patient required blood transfusion, and there were no immediate surgical complications, infections, or mortality. One patient developed an incisional hernia in relation to the site of kidney removal. The mean hospital stay was 5 ± 1 days. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic nephrectomy in our experience is a safe technique without postoperative morbidity or mortality. It is associated with low levels of pain, early discharge and early return to physical activity and work, good sense of aesthetic results, and long-term graft function comparable to traditional nephrectomy and cadaveric grafts.","Ferrario, M; Buckel, E; Astorga, C; Godoy, J; Aguiló, J; González, G; Ormazábal, J; Cámbara, A; Derosas, C; Herzog, C; Calabrán, L",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2013.08.089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24315006/,419

Currently, COVID-19 is spreading worldwide and consequently risking human lives. In this regard, maintaining physical distance has turned into an essential precautionary measure to curb the spread of the virus. In this paper, we propose an autonomous monitoring system that is able to enforce physical distancing rules in large areas round the clock without human intervention. We present a novel system to automatically detect groups of individuals who do not comply with physical distancing constraints, i.e., maintaining a distance of 1 m, by tracking them within large areas to re-identify them in case of repetitive non-compliance and enforcing physical distancing. We used a distributed network of multiple CCTV cameras mounted to the walls of buildings for the detection, tracking and re-identification of non-compliant groups. Furthermore, we used multiple self-docking autonomous robots with collision-free navigation to enforce physical distancing constraints by sending alert messages to those persons who are not adhering to physical distancing constraints. We conducted 28 experiments that included 15 participants in different scenarios to evaluate and highlight the performance and significance of the present system. The presented system is capable of re-identifying repetitive violations of physical distancing constraints by a non-compliant group, with high accuracy in terms of detection, tracking and localization through a set of coordinated CCTV cameras. Autonomous robots in the present system are capable of attending to non-compliant groups in multiple regions of a large area and encouraging them to comply with the constraints.","Shah, Syed Hammad Hussain Steinnes Ole-Martin Hagen Gustafsson Eirik Gribbestad Hameed Ibrahim A.",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11167200,419

The precise surgical skills required and the high equipment and institutional costs have been deterrents to initiating programs in developing countries. The authors report their 15-year international effort in facilitating the development of microsurgical techniques in Vietnam. METHODS The authors reviewed their educational, logistical, and operative experience from 11 Operation Smile International missions to Vietnam and the microsurgical procedures performed independently by Vietnamese surgeons at the Central Military Hospital 108 in Hanoi. RESULTS Over 15 years, Operation Smile International missions to Vietnam performed 108 free tissue transfer operations with 15 peripheral nerve transfer procedures and 143 nonmicrosurgical reconstructive operations. Visiting surgeons with specialized expertise taught facial reanimation, flap prefabrication, and perforator flaps. During this same period, Vietnamese surgeons became facile with microsurgical techniques and independently performed a wide array of these procedures in the institutions visited. Vietnamese surgeons have organized microsurgery divisions within some hospital departments and now teach microsurgical techniques. Repeated missions allowed for patient follow-up, staged procedures, educational exchange, and quality control. Several Vietnamese surgeons have traveled abroad to obtain additional training and have set up training programs in other areas of Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS Charitable organizations can help surgeons in developing countries master complex microsurgical techniques through short-term medical missions, donation of equipment and supplies, and the encouragement of institutional support. A continuing education program, including local conferences, microsurgical laboratory training facilities, and study abroad, can aid this introduction.","Merrell, J Craig; Tien, Nguyen Viet; Son, Nguyen Tai; An, Luu Ngoc; Sellers, Daniel; Russell, Robert; Manktelow, Ralph; Wei, Fu-Chan; Orgill, Dennis P",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17496600/,419

We moved beyond an overreliance on resource-intensive formal discrete events - such as in-person design workshops, focus groups, or traditional field studies and observations - towards including more continuous inputs to create a more sustainable and fluid approach within a living lab ecosystem. User-centered data collection methods were organized in a framework across three dimensions of interaction: 1) Communication; 2) Timing; and 3) Presence. Expanding methodological options along these differing dimensions increased opportunities for more diversified inputs and sample recruitment, while increasing overall data and design feedback collected.

HP infection could lead to decreased sperm parameters, and treating the HP infection could improve the quality of sperm. However, studies investigating the relationship between infertility and HP infection are still limited, and more evidence is required. Therefore, we performed the present study to investigate the impact of HP infection on sperm quality in males and on ovarian reserve in females. METHODS: A total of 16,522 patients who visited the Second Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 2016 to June 2019 due to abdominal discomfort and underwent a 13/14C-urea breath HP test were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Among them, 565 had performed sperm analysis or ovarian reserve tests in the past three months and were involved for further analyses. Sperm parameters were examined with a computer-assisted sperm analysis system, and serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and sex hormones were tested with an electrochemiluminescence method. RESULTS: Among 363 patients who underwent the sperm test, 136 (37.47%) had HP infection. Among 202 patients who underwent the AMH test, 55 (27.23%) had HP infection. There was no difference in sperm concentration and motility between the HP+ and HP- groups (P > 0.05). Further subgroup analyses stratified into 5-year age groups confirmed that there was no significant difference in sperm parameters (P > 0.05). When pooled with previously published data, no significant difference in sperm concentration or motility was found (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, this study found that the serum AMH level was similar between the HP+ and HP- groups (P > 0.05). Further subgroup analyses confirmed that there was no significant difference in serum AMH level (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in sperm parameters and AMH levels based on history of HP infection among Chinese patients.","Feng, Chun; Lv, Ping-Ping; Huang, Chang-Chang; Yang, Song-Qing; Yao, Qiu-Ping; Shen, Jin-Ming; Jin, Min",BMC Urol,,419

A total of 22,883 students completed the online questionnaire. The prevalence rate of probable PTSD, assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, was 19.5% [19.0-20.0]. Female (1.32 [1.21-1.45]) or non-binary gender (1.76 [1.35-2.31]), exposure to a non-COVID-19-related traumatic event (3.37 [3.08-3.67]), having lived through quarantine alone (1.22 [1.09-1.37]), poor quality of social ties (2.38 [2.15-2.62]), loss of income (1.20 [1.09-1.31]), poor quality housing (1.90 [1.59-2.26]), low-quality of the information received (1.50 [1.35-1.66]) and a high level of exposure to COVID-19 (from 1.38 [1.24-1.54] to 10.82 [2.33-76.57] depending on the score) were associated with PTSD. Quarantine was considered potentially traumatic by 78.8% of the students with probable PTSD. These findings suggest the pandemic context and lockdown measures could have post-traumatic consequences, stimulating debate on the nosography of PTSD.","Wathelet, Marielle; Fovet, Thomas; Jousset, Améliane; Duhem, Stéphane; Habran, Enguerrand; Horn, Mathilde; Debien, Christophe; Notredame, Charles-Edouard; Baubet, Thierry; Vaiva, Guillaume; D039,; Hondt, Fabien",Transl Psychiatry,,419

Various models have tried to explain it, but there are few inferential studies in the Colombian population. The structural equation models used in controlled social sciences to explain this problem and their analytical power allow generalisations to be made with a certain degree of precision. These analyses require a large amount of data for robust estimation, which limits their usability when there are restrictions to access the data, as is the case today due to Covid-19, and a question that stands out in these models is the evaluation of the fit. Through a set of 1,200 simulated data, an appropriate model fit was found (x5242=1.732,300;p<0,001, CFI = 0.97, GFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.04[0.042-0.046], SRMR = 0.06) for the predictors of depression and perceived burdensomeness, which were analysed using the JASP program.

236078,"""Thought I'd Share First"" and Other Conspiracy Theory Tweets from the COVID-19 Infodemic: Exploratory Study",2021,"BACKGROUND: The Typus Melancholicus (TM) is the premorbid personality of endogenous depression defined by Tellenbach and Kraus and characterized by orderliness, conscientiousness, norm orientation and intolerance of ambiguity. Tellenbach's hypothesis was to find around 50% of TM in the sample of patients with an Unipolar Depression (UD). The present paper aims to make a literature review on the relationship between the Typus Melancholicus (TM) and Unipolar Depression (UD). METHODS: Nineteen references were selected through searches on PubMed, Google Scholar and Sciences-Direct with the following MeSH terms in the title: Typus Melancholicus AND Depressive or Depression or Dépression or Depressione. Nine of them were selected for our review. RESULTS: Eight of the nine reviewed articles confirm Tellenbach's hypothesis. The literature review also shows that, in a population of UD, TM is always constant regardless of age or sex, has no relationship to clinical characteristics and could contribute to the chronicity of depression. The TM with depression have increased levels of ""lack of vital drive"" and ""feelings of guilt"" and low scores in irritability and dysphoria compared to Non-Typus Melancholicus (NTM). Due to its characteristics, TM could also be involved in some pathologies such as burnout or postpartum depression. TM does not seem to be linked to a particular Personality Disorder or maladaptive personality, but the two may coexist in certain circumstances. It has been suggested that specific psychotherapeutic methods can be used to treat TM with UD. CONCLUSIONS: The TM could be very useful in our clinical practice. Better practical knowledge of TM could lead to more efficient psychiatric care as well as heightened capacity to predict new episodes.","Oudart, Emilie; Hanak, Catherine; Ammendola, Sarah",Psychiatr Danub,,419

This has become most evident with the current COVID-19 pandemic by the new coronavirus that is wreaking havoc across the planet. Health care providers are facing unprecedented challenges to intervene on numerous nonlinear uncertainties in science and society as the pandemic evolves. In Afghanistan, health care delivery is already a major crosscutting challenge. Although efforts to rebuild the health care systems in Afghanistan have been made (Acerra et al.), both acute and chronic illnesses remain as major medical and critical governance gaps to be remedied. In addition, health care facilities and medical equipment are not adequate in the country. There is a need for medical and scientific expertise to clinically and sociologically contextualize and interpret diagnostic tests as well as drugs and vaccines that will be deployed in the coming months as part of the planetary collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a time of pandemic and facing a novel infectious pathogen, health care workers are in need of planetary scale consultation and support. Even creating a small consultation network using mobile applications might offer improved health outcomes.

247601,Considerations for Postacute Rehabilitation for Survivors of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal endoscopy may be associated with pain and anxiety. Predictors for high pain scores after endoscopies in children are not known. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for prolonged recovery and higher pain scores after gastrointestinal endoscopy in children. METHODS: All the children that were electively admitted for gastrointestinal endoscopies were included. We retrospectively collected demographic, clinical and endoscopic data as well as information on the recovery process. A numerical rating scale and the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Scale were used for pain scoring. RESULTS: During the study period (01/2016-10/2016), 284 children (median age 10.7 years, interquartile range 6.7-14.8) were recruited. In a univariate analysis, older age, higher pre-procedure pain scores, longer procedure durations, higher number of biopsies and longer recovery duration were associated with higher post-procedure pain scores. In a multivariate analysis higher pain scores before the procedure (OR 12.42, 95% CI 3.67-42, P < 0.001) and older age (OR 1.016, 95% CI 1.007-1.025, P < 0.001) were associated with higher pain scores after the procedure. Children with a higher pain score before the procedure also had a longer recovery period (OR 5.28, 95% CI (1.93-14.49), P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Older age and higher pain score before the procedure were identified as predictors for higher pain score after pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopies. Children with these risk factors should be identified before the procedure in order to personalize their post-procedure management.","Galai, Tut; Yerushalmy-Feler, Anat; Heller, Nathan P; Ben-Tov, Amir; Weintraub, Yael; Amir, Achiya; Moran-Lev, Hadar; Zac, Lilach; Cohen, Shlomi",BMC Gastroenterol,,419
249118,Preparation for Quarantine on the Cruise Ship Diamond Princess in Japan due to COVID-19,2020,"Recent executive orders have led some applied behavior analysis (ABA) providers to interpret themselves as ""essential personnel"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue against a blanket interpretation that being labeled ""essential personnel"" means that all in-person ABA services for all clients should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this argument holds even if ABA providers are not in a jurisdiction currently under an active shelter-at-home or related order. First, we provide a brief description of risks associated with continued in-person ABA service delivery, as well as risks associated with the temporary suspension of services or the transition to remote ABA service delivery. For many clients, continued in-person service delivery carries a significant risk of severe harm to the client, family and caregivers, staff, and a currently overburdened health care system. In these situations, ABA providers should temporarily suspend services or transition to telehealth or other forms of remote service delivery until information from federal, state, and local health care experts deems in-person contact safe. In rare cases, temporary suspension of services or a transition to remote service delivery may place the client or others at risk of significant harm. In these situations, in-person services should likely continue, and ongoing assessment and risk mitigation are essential.","Cox, David J; Plavnick, Joshua B; Brodhead, Matthew T",Behav Anal Pract,,419

Our goal was to understand the impact of the epidemic on kidney transplantation (KT), at both the national and center levels, accounting statistically for waitlist composition. Using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data, we compared data on observed waitlist registrations, waitlist mortality, and living-donor and deceased-donor kidney transplants (LDKT/DDKT) March 15-April 30, 2020 to expected events calculated from preepidemic data January 2016-February 2020. There were few changes before March 15, at which point the number of new listings/DDKT/LDKT dropped to 18%/24%/87% below the expected value (all P < .001). Only 12 centers performed LDKT March 15-31; by April 30, 40 centers had resumed LDKT. The decline in new listings and DDKT was greater among states with higher per capita confirmed COVID-19 cases. The number of waitlist deaths was 2.2-fold higher than expected in the 5 states with highest COVID-19 burden (P < .001). DCD DDKT and regional/national imports declined nationwide but most steeply in states with the highest COVID-19 burden. The COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in substantial changes to KT; we must adapt and learn rapidly to continue to provide safe access to transplantation and limit the growing indirect toll of an already deadly disease.","Boyarsky, Brian J; Werbel, William A; Durand, Christine M; Avery, Robin K; Jackson, Kyle R; Kernodle, Amber B; Snyder, Jon; Hirose, Ryutaro; Massie, Indraneel M; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M; Segev, Dorry L; Massie, Allan B",Am. j. transplant,,419
251496,Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire: Psychometric Properties Using Rasch Model and Structural Equation Modeling,2021,"BACKGROUND: The evolving COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to present a threat to health system capacity. Rapidly expanding an existing acute care physician workforce is critical to pandemic response planning in large urban academic health systems. INTERVENTION: The Medical Emergency-Pandemic Operations Command (MEOC)-a multi-specialty team of physicians, operational leaders, and support staff within an academic Department of Medicine in Calgary, Canada-partnered with its provincial health system to rapidly develop a comprehensive, scalable pandemic physician workforce plan for non-ventilated inpatients with COVID-19 across multiple hospitals. The MEOC Pandemic Plan comprised seven components, each with unique structure and processes. METHODS: In this manuscript, we describe MEOC's Pandemic Plan that was designed and implemented from March to May 2020 and re-escalated in October 2020. We report on the plan's structure and process, early implementation outcomes, and unforeseen challenges. Data sources included MEOC documents, health system, public health, and physician engagement implementation data. KEY RESULTS: From March 5 to October 26, 2020, 427 patients were admitted to COVID-19 units in Calgary hospitals. In the initial implementation period (March-May 2020), MEOC communications reached over 2500 physicians, leading to 1446 physicians volunteering to provide care on COVID-19 units. Of these, 234 physicians signed up for hospital shifts, and 227 physicians received in-person personal protective equipment simulation training. Ninety-three physicians were deployed on COVID-19 units at four large acute care hospitals. The resurgence of cases in September 2020 has prompted re-escalation including re-activation of COVID-19 units. CONCLUSIONS: MEOC leveraged an academic health system partnership to rapidly design, implement, and refine a comprehensive, scalable COVID-19 acute care physician workforce plan whose components are readily applicable across jurisdictions or healthcare crises.

METHODS: 403 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited and prospectively followed-up at a major hospital in the United Arab Emirates. The primary endpoint was time from admission until the development of a composite outcome, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death from any cause. Patients discharged alive were considered as competing events to the primary outcome. Competing risk regression was used to quantify the association between suPAR and the incidence of the primary outcome. RESULTS: 6.2% of patients experienced ARDS or ICU admission, but none died. Taking into account competing risk, the incidence of the primary outcome was 11.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-16.3) in patients with suPAR levels >3.91 ng/mL compared to 2.9% (95% CI, 0.4-5.5) in those with suPAR &#8804;3.91 ng/mL. Also, an increase by 1 ng/mL in baseline suPAR resulted in a 58% rise in the hazard of developing the primary outcome (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI, 1.2-2.1, p = 0.003).

Until now, no precise treatment modality has been developed. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a host cell receptor, has been found to play a crucial role in virus cell entry; therefore, ACE2 blockers can be a potential target for anti-viral intervention. In this study, we evaluated the ACE2 inhibitory effects of 10 essential oils. Among them, geranium and lemon oils displayed significant ACE2 inhibitory effects in epithelial cells. In addition, immunoblotting and qPCR analysis also confirmed that geranium and lemon oils possess potent ACE2 inhibitory effects. Furthermore, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis displayed 22 compounds in geranium oil and 9 compounds in lemon oil. Citronellol, geraniol, and neryl acetate were the major compounds of geranium oil and limonene that represented major compound of lemon oil. Next, we found that treatment with citronellol and limonene significantly downregulated ACE2 expression in epithelial cells.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have the potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis - including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA), and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter 2 are specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Blair, Christopher; Weber, Andrew; Barnes, Betsy J; Egeblad, Mikala; Woods, Robert J; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S",JCI insight,,419

In this way, Mg deficiency may exacerbate the course of COVID-19. Therefore, in patients with Covid-19 permanent monitoring of the Mg status and, if necessary, supplementation should be carried out. The possible importance of Mg in COVID-19 was only recently discussed also by Iotti et al. and the German Society for Magnesium Research e.V. Considering the meaningful connections between Mg and COVID-19 there are relevant research topics that should be addressed: Does Mg deficiency increase the risk of infection with COVID-19 or the risk of a severe course of the disease? Is there an increased prevalence of Mg deficiency in COVID-19 patients? Could Mg supplementation alleviate the course of the disease in COVID-19 or reduce complications?

METHODS: This is a commentary based on established occupational safety and health principles, published articles, and other pertinent literature, including non-peer-reviewed preprints in medrixiv.org prior to April 16, 2021. RESULTS: Not applicable to this commentary/viewpoint article. CONCLUSION: Antigen testing is a rapidly evolving and useful public health tool that can be used to guide measures to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and in selected workplaces. This commentary provides a proposed framework for occupational safety and health practitioners and employers for considering antigen testing as a method to screen asymptomatic workers in selected non-healthcare settings. When applied selectively, antigen testing can be a useful, effective part of a comprehensive workplace program for COVID-19 prevention and control.","Schulte, Paul A; Piacentino, John D; Weissman, David N; de Perio, Marie A; Chiu, Sophia K; Radonovich, Lewis J; Trout, Douglas; Beezhold, Don; Hearl, Frank J; Howard, John",J. occup. environ. med,,419
299104,Preparation for the Quarantine of The Diamond Princess Cruise Ship for COVID-19 in Japan: Study Design,2020,"COVID-19 is a pandemic with no end in sight. There is only one approved antiviral agent but global stocks are deemed insufficient. Despite in vitro antiviral activity, clinical trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were disappointing, and they may even impair outcomes. Chloroquine causes zebroid deposits reminiscent of Fabry disease (&#945;-galactosidase A deficiency) and endothelial cells are key targets of COVID-19. We have explored the effect of chloroquine on cultured endothelial cells and its modulation by recombinant &#945;-galactosidase A (agalsidase). Following dose-response studies, 0.5 µg/mL chloroquine was added to cultured human endothelial cells. Neutral red and Lysotracker were used to assess lysosomes. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) - MTT assay and cell stress by assessing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). In endothelial cells, chloroquine induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity at in vitro test concentrations for COVID-19 therapy. At a sublethal concentration, chloroquine significantly induced the accumulation of acid organelles (P < 0.05), increased ROS levels, and decreased NO production (P < 0.05). These adverse effects of chloroquine on endothelial cell biology were decreased by agalsidase-ß (P < 0.05). Chloroquine-induced endothelial cell cytotoxicity and stress is attenuated by agalsidase-ß treatment. This suggests that endothelial cell injury may contribute to the failure of chloroquine as therapy for COVID-19 and may be at least in part related to causing dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme &#945;-galactosidase A.","Gregório, PauloC; da Cunha, Regiane S; Biagini, Gilson; Bosquetti, Bruna; Budag, Júlia; Ortiz, Alberto; Sánchez-Niño, Maria Dolores; Barreto, Fellype C; Stinghen, Andréa E M",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,,419
302247,Acceptability of COVID-19 Vaccines and Protective Behavior among Adults in Taiwan: Associations between Risk Perception and Willingness to Vaccinate against COVID-19,2021,"Vaccinations are a safe and effective way to protect against infectious diseases. The World Health Organization estimates vaccines have saved more lives than any other interventions and every year about two to three million deaths are averted worldwide through immunization. To improve vaccination coverage, pharmacists have been increasingly involved in immunization roles in their communities-as advocates, educators, and immunizers. Community pharmacy-based vaccination services have increased both in the number of immunization providers and the number of sites where patients can receive immunizations. In Canada, health care is under provincial legislation-and so, there are distinct differences in scope of pharmacist practice across the country. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, in Québec, Canada's second-largest province, pharmacists did not have the authority to administer vaccines. To help prepare pharmacists in Québec to become immunizers, we developed and deployed a series of accredited workshops. In these facilitated workshops, pharmacists were able to share best practices that may lead to providing effective vaccination services, identify common competency gaps, discuss effective patient communication skills, and determine how to target the most vulnerable population groups. Participants were also asked to evaluate the workshop. Our results indicate the evaluation was very reliable in measuring participant satisfaction (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.94) and pharmacists commented that the workshops' learning outcomes exceeded their expectations, and the topics covered were relevant and applicable. The evaluation also asked participants to identify weaknesses of training, so future educational interventions can be planned accordingly. We believe this work will contribute to the continual growth and advancement of the pharmacy profession in Canada.","Srirangan, Kajan; Lavenue, Arnaud",,,419
310360,A Web- and App-Based Connected Care Solution for COVID-19 In- and Outpatient Care: Qualitative Study and Application Development,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that people understand and comply with self-isolation guidelines. We tested whether a simplified version of the guidelines and a simplified version with visual aids would affect comprehension and intention to self-isolate during the containment phase of the pandemic in the UK, in March 2020, compared to the standard guidelines. METHODS: We conducted an online, three-armed parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants were English and over 18. The survey software randomized them into conditions; they were blind to condition. The control group read the 7-page standard guidelines (the current version at the time of the trial). The intervention groups were given either a 3-page simplified version, with a summary box on the front page and numbered bullet points, or the same simplified version with pictograms illustrating the points in the box. Primary outcomes were comprehension of the guidelines, as measured by the number of correct answers given to six questions about the content, and the proportion who answered that they would 'definitely' stay at home for 7 days if symptomatic. FINDINGS: Recruitment was from 13 to 16 March 2020, with 1845 participants randomised and all data analysed. The Control group averaged 4.27 correct answers, the Simplified 4.20, and the Simplified + visual aids 4.13, out of a possible total of 6 correct answers. There were no differences in comprehension in the unadjusted models; however, when the model was adjusted for demographic variables, there was lower comprehension in the simplified + visual aids condition than in the control, (ß = - 0.16, p = 0.04998). There were no statistically significant differences in intention to stay home: Control was 85%, Simplified 83%, and Simplified + visual aids condition 84%. CONCLUSION: Simplified guidance did not improve comprehension compared to the standard guidance issued in the containment phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, and simplified guidance with visual aids may even have worsened comprehension. Simplified guidance had no effect on intention to stay home if symptomatic. This trial informed COVID-19 policy and provides insights relevant to guidance production in the acute phase of a major public health emergency.","Gold, Natalie; Watson, Robin; Weston, Dale; Greaves, Felix; Amlôt, Richard",BMC Public Health,,419

This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement. Materials and Methods: 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization. Result: The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14 ± 14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1%), 72 (63.1%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ugur Chousein, Efsun Gonca; Çörtük, Mustafa; Cinarka, Halit; Tanriverdi, Elif; Turan, Demet; Yildirim, Binnaz Zeynep; Sezen, Celal Bugra; Özgül, Mehmet Akif",Tuberk Toraks,,419

320292,"An Urban Population Health Observatory System to Support COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness, Response, and Management: Design and Development Study",2021,"Over 80,000 angiosperm species produce flowers with petals fused into a corolla tube. The corolla tube contributes to the tremendous diversity of flower morphology and plays a critical role in plant reproduction; yet it remains one of the least understood plant structures from a developmental genetics perspective. Through mutant analyses and transgenic experiments, we show that the tasiRNA-ARF pathway is required for corolla tube formation in the monkeyflower species Mimulus lewisii. Loss-of-function mutations in the M. lewisii orthologs of ARGONAUTE7 and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 cause a dramatic decrease in abundance of TAS3-derived small RNAs and a moderate up-regulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 3 (ARF3) and ARF4, which lead to inhibition of lateral expansion of the bases of petal primordia and complete arrest of the upward growth of the inter-primordial regions, resulting in unfused corollas. Using the DR5 auxin responsive promoter, we discovered that auxin signaling is continuous along the petal primordium base and the inter-primordial region during the critical stage of corolla tube formation in the wild-type, similar to the spatial pattern of MlARF4 expression. Auxin response is also much weaker and more restricted in the mutant. Furthermore, exogenous application of polar auxin transport inhibitor to wild-type floral apices disrupted petal fusion. Together, these results suggest a new conceptual model highlighting the central role of auxin-directed synchronized growth of the petal primordium base and the inter-primordial region in corolla tube formation.","Ding, Baoqing; Xia, Rui; Lin, Qiaoshan; Gurung, Vandana; Sagawa, Janelle M; Stanley, Lauren E; Strobel, Matthew; Diggle, Pamela K; Meyers, Blake C; Yuan, Yao-Wu",Plant cell,,419

323980,Ten recommendations to increase Black representation within pharmacy organization leaderships,2021,"Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It rapidly spread due to human-to-human transmission, resulting in a global pandemic. Nearly every country, including Qatar, has established guidelines and regulations to limit the spread of the virus and to preserve public health. However, these procedures have been associated with negative effects on the psychological and intellectual well-being of individuals, including children and adolescents. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the psychological influence of home isolation and social distancing on children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar, and the strategies used to cope with these measures. Methods: This cross-sectional study was undertaken using an online questionnaire administered through SMS text messaging. All home-isolated children and adolescents registered at the Primary Health Care Corporation aged 7-18 years were invited to participate in the study. Children and adolescents with intellectual disadvantages were excluded. A P value of .05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. Results: Data were collected from 6608 participants from June 23 to July 18, 2020. Nearly all participants adhered to the official regulations during the period of home isolation and social distancing;however, 69.1% (n=4568) of parents believed their children were vulnerable to the virus compared to 25% (n=1652) who expressed they were not vulnerable at all. Higher levels of anger, depression, and general anxiety were prevalent among 1.3% (n=84), 3.9% (n=260), and 1.6% (n=104) of participants, respectively. The mean score for the emotional constructs anger and depression decreased with increased compliance with regulations (P=.04 and P=.11, respectively). The differences in mean score for all psychological and coping strategies used among participants across the 3 levels of vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 were statistically significant. The mean score varied little with increasing reported vulnerability to the virus. This mild variation can make a difference when the sample size is large, as is the case in this study. Conclusions: Screening for psychological and social disruptions is important for the development of strategies by schools and health care providers to assess and monitor behavioral changes and negative psychological impact during post–COVID-19 reintegration. Participants experiencing higher levels of anxiety should be given more attention during reintegration and transitional phases in schools. Although electronic devices and social media platforms may have lowered anxiety levels in some cases, it is important to address how they are used and how content is tailored to children and adolescents. It is also important to maintain an active lifestyle for children and young persons, and encourage them not to neglect their physical health, as this promotes a better psychological state of mind.","Zainel, Abduljaleel Abdullatif Qotba Hamda Al-Maadeed Alyaa Al-Kohji Sadriya Hanan Al Mujalli Ali Atif Lolwa Al Mannai Aladab Aisha AlSaadi Hamda Khalid Ali AlKarbi Al-Baghdadi Tholfakhar",JMIR Formative Research,,419

This infection affects respiratory system and provides uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response as cytokine storm. The main concern about SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is high viral pathogenicity with no specific drugs. MicroRNAs (miRs) as small non-coding RNAs (21-25â¯nt) regulate gene expression. The SARS-CoV-2 encoded-miRs affect human genes that involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis, immune response and inflammation. Also, they alter self-gene regulation and hijacked host miRs that provide protective environment to maintain its latency. On the other hand, Host miRs play critical role in viral gene expression to restrict infection. Over expression/inhibition of miRs might result in cell cycle irregularity, impaired immune response or cancer. In this manner, exact role of each miR should be specified. Mimic encoded-miRs like antagomirs showed successful result in phases of clinical trial prevent from negative effects of viral encoded-miRs.

Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine women's precaution practices among six independent socio-demographic variables, including age, ethnicity, education, front-line jobs, history of miscarriage and type of antenatal clinic (general, high risk). RESULTS: A total of 167 survey responses were obtained over 8 weeks from April to June 2020. The majority of women were aged &#8804;35 years (76%, n = 127), were of Chinese ethnicity (55%, n = 91), attained tertiary education (62%, n = 104) and were not working as frontline staff (70%). Using multiple linear regression models, Malay ethnicity (vs. Chinese, ß 0.24; 95% CI 0.04, 0.44) was associated with higher frequency of practicing social distancing. Malay women (ß 0.48; 95% CI 0.16, 0.80) and those who worked as frontline staff (ß 0.28; 95% CI 0.01, 0.56) sanitized their hands at higher frequencies. Age of &#8805;36 years (vs. &#8804;30 years, ß 0.24; 95% CI 0.01, 0.46), Malay (vs. Chinese, ß 0.27; 95% CI 0.06, 0.48) and Indian ethnicity (vs. Chinese, ß 0.41; 95% CI 0.02, 0.80), and attendance at high-risk clinic (vs. general clinic, ß 0.20; 95% CI 0.01, 0.39) were associated with higher frequency of staying-at-home. CONCLUSION: Social demographical factors including age > 36 years old, Malay ethnicity, employment in front line jobs and attendance at high-risk clinics are likely to influence the attitudes and precaution practices among pregnant women towards COVID-19 in Singapore. Knowledge gained from our cross-sectional online survey can better guide clinicians to communicate better with pregnant women. Hence, it is important for clinicians to render appropriate counselling and focused clarification on the effect of COVID-19 among pregnant women for psychological support and mental well being.","Lee, Ryan Wai Kheong; Loy, See Ling; Yang, Liying; Chan, Jerry Kok Yen; Tan, Lay Kok",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,419

METHODS: We revised the CT scan of 62 patients (34 male, 28 female, mean age 71 +/- 14 years) with clinical and laboratory signs of COVID-19, as assessed by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. All patients underwent chest CT at the time of admission to the hospital. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to evaluate the extension of the disease. RESULTS: Out of the 62 patients the main radiological findings were reticular pattern (29%), ground-glass opacities (24%), crazy paving pattern (11%) and consolidation (35%). Most of the lesions were bilateral (97%), posterior (95%) and located near pleura (50%) or lung fissures (45%), mainly involving the lower right lobe (56%) and lower left lobe (23%). Pleural thickening was observed in 72.6% of patients and pleural effusion in 18%. Median value of the score was 7.0 and was significantly higher in male than female (8.5 vs 6.0, p=0.03) and in patients with pleural thickening compared to those without this finding (8.0 vs 5.0, p=0.03).","Martino, Alberigo; Fiore, Emilio; Mazza, Emerico Maria; Minichiello, Stefana; Brogna, Barbara; Petronilla, Salvatore; Megliola, Antonia; Musto, Lanfranco",Infez Med,,419
356771,In-pandemic development of an application ontology for COVID-19 surveillance in a primary care sentinel network,2020,"The SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) has become a pandemic and has expanded all over the world. Because of increasing number of cases day by day, it takes time to interpret the laboratory findings thus the limitations in terms of both treatment and findings are emerged. Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we perform clinical predictive models that estimate, using deep learning and laboratory data, which patients are likely to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, precision, F1-score, recall, AUC, and accuracy scores calculated. Models were tested with 18 laboratory findings from 600 patients and validated with 10 fold cross-validation and train-test split approaches. The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 86.66%, F1-score of 91.89%, precision of 86.75%, recall of 99.42%, and AUC of 62.50%. It is observed that predictive models trained on laboratory findings could be used to predict COVID-19 infection, and can be helpful for medical experts to prioritize the resources correctly. Our models (available at (https://github.com/burakalakuss/COVID-19-Clinical)) can be employed to assists medical experts in validating their initial laboratory findings, and can also be used for clinical prediction studies.","Alakus, Talha Burak; Turkoglu, Ibrahim",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,419

To reach the full potential of an assistant, it is desirable that individuals can create skills to automate their personal web browsing routines. Many seemingly simple routines, however, such as monitoring COVID-19 stats for their hometown, detecting changes in their child's grades online, or sending personally-addressed messages to a group, cannot be automated without conventional programming concepts such as conditional and iterative evaluation. This paper presents VASH (Voice Assistant Scripting Helper), a new system that empowers users to create useful web-based virtual assistant skills without learning a formal programming language. With VASH, the user demonstrates their task of interest in the browser and issues a few voice commands, such as naming the skills and adding conditions on the action. VASH turns these multi-modal specifications into skills that can be invoked invoice on a virtual assistant. These skills are represented in a formal programming language we designed called WebTalk, which supports parameterization, function invocation, conditionals, and iterative execution. VASH is a fully working prototype that works on the Chrome browser on real-world websites. Our user study shows that users have many web routines they wish to automate, 81% of which can be expressed using VASH.

However, by reducing the risk of being infected by others, more self-protection may lead each individual to go outside the house more often. In the absence of lockdown, this creates a ""collective offsetting effect"", since more people outside means that the risk of infection is increased for all. However, wearing masks also creates a positive externality on others, by reducing the risk of infecting them. We show how to integrate these different effects in a simple model, and we discuss when self-protection efforts should be encouraged (or deterred) by a social planner.","Salanié, François; Treich, Nicolas",Geneva Risk Insur Rev,,419
361612,"Resilient and inclusive healthcare leadership: Black Swans, COVID-19, and beyond",2020,"BACKGROUND: The acute respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and caused a worldwide pandemic. Concerns arose about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood donations and potential significant blood transfusion needs in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Data on blood usage in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are scarce. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of blood component transfusions in the first 4 weeks of COVID-19 ward admissions. The study period began 14 days before the first COVID-19 cohort wards opened in our hospital in March 2020 and ended 28 days afterward. The number of patients and blood components transfused in the COVID-19 wards was tabulated. Transfusion rates of each blood component were compared in COVID-19 wards versus all other inpatient wards. RESULTS: COVID-19 wards opened with seven suspected patients and after 4 weeks had 305 cumulative COVID-19 admissions. Forty-one of 305 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (13.4%) received transfusions with 11.1% receiving red blood cells (RBCs), 1.6% platelets (PLTs), 1.0% plasma, and 1.0% cryoprecipitate (cryo). COVID-19 wards had significantly lower transfusion rates compared to non-COVID wards for RBCs (0.03 vs 0.08 units/patient-day), PLTs (0.003 vs 0.033), and plasma (0.002 vs 0.018; all p < 0.0001). Cryo rates were similar (0.008 vs 0.009, p = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients required many fewer blood transfusions than other hospitalized patients. COVID-19 transfusion data will inform planning and preparation of blood resource utilization during the pandemic.","Barriteau, Christina M; Bochey, Patricia; Lindholm, Paul F; Hartman, Karyn; Sumugod, Ricardo; Ramsey, Glenn",Transfusion,,419
368989,Teaching residents how to deliver active learning during didactic lectures,2021,"Resistance represents a major challenge for antibody-based therapy for COVID-191-4. Here we engineered an immunoglobulin M (IgM) neutralizing antibody (IgM-14) to overcome the resistance encountered by immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based therapeutics. IgM-14 is over 230-fold more potent than its parental IgG-14 in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. IgM-14 potently neutralizes the resistant virus raised by its corresponding IgG-14, three variants of concern-B.1.1.7 (Alpha, which first emerged in the UK), P.1 (Gamma, which first emerged in Brazil) and B.1.351 (Beta, which first emerged in South Africa)-and 21 other receptor-binding domain mutants, many of which are resistant to the IgG antibodies that have been authorized for emergency use. Although engineering IgG into IgM enhances antibody potency in general, selection of an optimal epitope is critical for identifying the most effective IgM that can overcome resistance. In mice, a single intranasal dose of IgM-14 at 0.044 mg per kg body weight confers prophylactic efficacy and a single dose at 0.4 mg per kg confers therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. IgM-14, but not IgG-14, also confers potent therapeutic protection against the P.1 and B.1.351 variants. IgM-14 exhibits desirable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles when administered intranasally in rodents. Our results show that intranasal administration of an engineered IgM can improve efficacy, reduce resistance and simplify the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Ku, Zhiqiang; Xie, Xuping; Hinton, Paul R; Liu, Xinli; Ye, Xiaohua; Muruato, Antonio E; Ng, Dean C; Biswas, Sujit; Zou, Jing; Liu, Yang; Pandya, Deepal; Menachery, Vineet D; Rahman, Sachi; Cao, Yu-An; Deng, Hui; Xiong, Wei; Carlin, Kevin B; Liu, Junquan; Su, Hang; Haanes, Elizabeth J; Keyt, Bruce A; Zhang, Ningyan; Carroll, Stephen F; Shi, Pei-Yong; An, Zhiqiang",Nature,,419

Nevertheless, standard economic evaluations of vaccines continue to focus on a relatively narrow set of health-centric benefits, with consequences for vaccination policies and public investments.The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates in stark terms the multiplicity and magnitude of harms that infectious diseases may inflict on society. COVID-19 has overtaxed health systems, disrupted routine immunization programs, forced school and workplace closures, impeded the operation of international supply chains, suppressed aggregate demand, and exacerbated existing social inequities.The obvious nature of the pandemic's broad effects could conceivably convince more policymakers to identify and account for the full societal impacts of infectious disease when evaluating the potential benefits of vaccination.

Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the vulnerability of human fetuses and infants to the effects of OPs because of their rapid growth and organ development, cell differentiation, and immaturity of metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prenatal exposure to OPs characterized by different physicochemical properties using non-invasive biological samples (meconium and placenta). A total of 88 placenta and 53 meconium samples were collected in Ourense, a city located in northwestern Spain, at the delivery and after birth from mothers and their infants from the University Hospital of Ourense, respectively. Selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) methodologies were used to determine the targeted OPs in the selected biological samples. Cleanup of extracts was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using EZ-POP cartridges and detection by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS/MS).

377685,A Case for Participatory Disease Surveillance of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India,2020,"ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly stressed healthcare systems. The addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions, which prevent severe disease and reduce hospitalizations, to the repertoire of COVID-19 countermeasures offers the opportunity to reduce system stress but requires strategic planning and use of novel approaches. Our objective was to develop a web-based decision-support tool to help existing and future mAb infusion facilities make better and more informed staffing and capacity decisions. Materials and MethodsUsing real-world observations from three medical centers operating with federal field team support, we developed a discrete-event simulation model and performed simulation experiments to assess performance of mAb infusion sites under different conditions. Results162,000 scenarios were evaluated by simulations. Our analyses revealed that it was more effective to add check-in staff than to add additional nurses for middle-to-large size sites with [≥] 2 infusion nurses; that scheduled appointments performed better than walk-ins when patient load was not high; and that reducing infusion time was particularly impactful when load on resources was only slightly above manageable levels. DiscussionPhysical capacity, check-in staff, and infusion time were as important as nurses for mAb sites. Health systems can effectively operate an infusion center under different conditions to provide mAb therapeutics even with relatively low investments in physical resources and staff. ConclusionSimulations of mAb infusion sites were used to create a capacity planning tool to optimize resource utility and allocation in constrained pandemic conditions, and more efficiently treat COVID-19 patients at existing and future mAb infusion sites.","Caglayan, Caglar; Thornhill, Jonathan; Stewart, Miles A.; Lambrou, Anastasia S.; Richardson, Donald; Rainwater-Lovett, Kaitlin; Freeman, Jeffrey D.; Pfundt, Tiffany; Redd, John T.",,,419
377686,A Case for Participatory Disease Surveillance of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India,2020,"There are increasing reports of a drastic drop in consultations and cardiovascular procedures (including urgencies and emergencies) in regions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a consequent marked increase in total mortality that is not fully explained by COVID-19. Cardiovascular disease leads the ranking in deaths in adults in Argentina with 280 deaths per day, and in recent decades we have reduced its mortality by 20-30% through various evidence-based interventions. Herein we conducted predictive analyses to understand what could be the consequences of a worse implementation of those interventions. We estimate that less control of cardiovascular risk factors from April to October 2020 could cause up to 10 500 new preventable cases of cardiovascular disease. In terms of myocardial infarction, a drop from 40% to 60% of the reperfusion treatment could increase mortality by 3% to 5%. A marginal 10% to 15% increase in relative risk of cardiovascular death would be equivalent to an excess of 6000 to 9000 preventable deaths. In conclusion, given the high prevalence and fatality of cardiovascular disease, even a small negative impact on the efficacy of its care will translate into large numbers of people affected in Argentina. It is necessary to inform the authorities and educate the public so cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors remain a health priority, as long as resources exist and minimizing the risk of contagion and spread of the virus.","Lamelas, Pablo; Botto, Fernando; Pedernera, Gustavo; Alves De Lima, Alberto; Costabel, Juan Pablo; Belardi, Jorge",Medicina (B Aires),,419
378546,The Effect of Social Isolation on Physical Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic in France,2021,"1. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,5 million people and caused the death of more than a hundred thousand people across the globe as of writing. Recently, Mao et al. [1] investigated the penetration potential of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system in 214 patients. They reported that 36.4% of the patients had some neurologic findings which are ranged from nonspecific manifestations, e.g., dizziness, headache, and seizure, to specific manifestations, e.g., loss of sense of smell or taste, and stroke. Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients. Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2]. Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates via human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) that was also utilized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3]. Glial cells and neurons have been reported to express ACE-2 receptors, which make them a potential target of COVID-19. It was indicated that SARS CoV causes neuronal death by invading the brain via olfactory epithelium [4]. The electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings have corroborated the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue [4] and cerebrospinal fluid [5]. Together, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by penetrating the brain via the cribriform plate, which can account for the early findings of the COVID-19 like altered sense of smell or hyposmia. Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6]. Therefore, in the countries that have taken action to the virus, clinic studies of AD have been stopped to protect the patients. However, rigorous quarantine of elders has aborted clinic trials and experimental studies conducted with transgenic animals. Transgenic models are quite expensive; the loss of these animals has costly consequences. There is no doubt that this storm will stop, but its catastrophic effects on dementia research will continue for a time. Thus, dementia researchers and pharmaceutical companies should determine an emergency action plan to exit the chaos of this pandemic. Here, we listed some challenges in dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak and table some suggestions. All countries try to control SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing. Therefore, neurology clinics were closed, and routine examination of Alzheimer's patients was stopped. However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research. Additionally, the arrest of experimental studies due to the closing of universities in two hundred countries also deprives experimental achievements. The closing of universities may lead to data loss, death of expensive transgenic animals, international researchers to be faced with visa problems, and be lost the laboratory staff whose contract has expired [7]. It is impossible that forecasting when this COVID-19 pandemic will end is impossible and thus, it is essential that a solution be developed to continue dementia studies on Alzheimer's patients. Remote monitoring of the patients with the use of technology is in the lead of possible solutions. Clinicians can continue to follow their patients by telemedicine [8], but extended lockdown of patients may cause depression in both patients and their caregivers [9]. It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10]. The monitorization of the patient in this condition with telemedicine would not provide objective data. In addition, when patients living in rural areas are considered, it will not be a surprise that reaching equally all patients is impossible. Therefore, a collective action plan protecting dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak should be prepared by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, and patients. Data loss is in the lead of expected problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the planned ending dates of phase 2/3 trials of gantenerumab (Roche) and solanezumab (Lilly) were missed [11]. It is highly essential that patients be monitored from their homes with telemedicine to protect them. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies. We suggest that patients of phase trails should be isolated in fully-equipped nursing homes managed by qualified personnel. In this way, the patients can be more effectively protected from SARS-CoV-2 and the depression caused by the lockdown.Young family members going out for basic needs could infect older family members. Also, patients with AD pay less attention to hand hygiene, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, cats have recently been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Patients with AD may not follow directions of neurologists on telemedicine and thus, the interaction of Alzheimer's patients with pets can cause a dangerous scenario. Consequently, the lockdown of patients with dementia in their homes might not be an appropriate exit strategy for the future of dementia research. On the other hand, it is important to mention here that the nursing home capacity of the United States may not be sufficient for 5,8 million Alzheimer's patients aged 65 years and older [13]. Thus, we highlight that only the patients involved in the clinic trails should be followed in the nursing homes. The other patients can be monitored with telemedicine from their homes. The data will hardly be lost in patients isolated in nursing homes. In this strategy, secondary risk factors affecting the clinic trails like depression are also removed. The motivations of clinicians and researchers is as important as the patients in the catastrophic atmosphere of the outbreak. Governments, media, and funders can support the motivations of clinicians and researchers. For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails. Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research. At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders. However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.","Bostanciklioglu, Mehmet",Current neurovascular research (Online),,419

382309,Deployment of a Smart Handwashing Station in a School Setting During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Field Study,2020,"The current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a huge impact on emergency surgical services in the UK. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) published guidelines about COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020 to aid decision making for the surgeons. These guidelines recommended that all patients requiring urgent surgery should have reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or computed tomography (CT) thorax pre-operatively. However, it is currently unclear whether the use of CT thorax is a sensitive and specific diagnostic test. The objective of this study was to find out whether CT thorax is a reliable and accurate test in the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to RT-PCR. This is particularly important in surgical patients where there is no time to wait for RT-PCR results. A prospective cohort study of patients presented with acute surgical emergencies at a University Teaching Hospital was conducted. Data was collected from March 23, to May 15, 2020, during the peak of the crisis in the UK. All adult patients presented with operable general surgical emergencies were considered eligible. Another group of patients, admitted with acute medical emergencies but with suspected COVID-19 infection, was used for comparison. Data was manually collected, and sensitivity, specificity and predictive value were calculated using the MedCalc statistical software version 19.2.6. Standard reporting for COVID-19 infection for CT chest based on guidelines from British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) and Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) was used. Patients who had their CT thorax reported as typical or classic of COVID 19 (high probability) were treated as infected cases with extra precautions in the wards and surgical theatres as suggested by health and safety executive (HSE). These patients had serial RT-PCR during their admissions or in the post-operative phase, if the first swab was negative. For the study, 259 patients were considered eligible for inclusion from both groups. Patients admitted for acute surgical emergencies were treated according to RCS guidelines and subjected to RT-PCR test and/or CT scan of the thorax. There were 207 patients with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19. Of those 207 patients, 77 patients had CT thorax with radiographic features consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, only 40 patients had a positive RT-PCR result. CT thorax was normal in 130 patients, out of which 29 patients were found to have COVID-19 diagnosis after swab test. Sensitivity of CT scan to diagnose COVID-19 infection was found to be 58% (95% CI; 45.48% to 69.76%) whilst specificity was 73% (95% CI; 64.99% to 80.37%) with a negative predictive value of 77.69% (95% CI; 72.17% to 82.39%). CT scan was found to be a reliable tool in the diagnosis of COVID-19. With a negative predictive value of up to 82.4%, CT thorax can play an important role to help surgeons in their decision making for asymptomatic suspected cases of COVID-19.

In this exploratory study, we examined Italian athletes’ perceived stress and functional/dysfunctional psychobiosocial states during the COVID-19 crisis, comparing current assessment scores with data collected prior to the pandemic. Differences by gender, sport (i.e., individual vs team sport), and competitive level (elite/expert vs novice athletes) were also examined. The perceived stress scale and the psychobiosocial states scale were administered to 1132 competitive athletes about one month after the beginning of Italian lockdown. The comparison between the data collected during COVID-19 with the data collected before the pandemic outbreak revealed highly significant differences with medium to large effects sizes. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 crisis increased athletes’ perceived stress and dysfunctional psychobiosocial states, while decreased functional psychobiosocial states. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences by gender on perceived stress and both types of psychobiosocial states, as well as by competitive level on perceived stress and functional psychobiosocial states. Specifically, women reported higher perceived stress and dysfunctional psychobiosocial states scores than men, and lower functional psychobiosocial states scores. Elite/expert athletes reported lower perceived stress and higher functional psychobiosocial states scores than novice athletes. From a practical point of view, training regimens and healthy behaviours during pandemic crises should be introduced as standard habits for health and well-being. The application of specific well-being protocols for women and novice athletes should be encouraged.","di Fronso, Selenia; Costa, Sergio; Montesano, Cristina; Di Gruttola, Francesco; Ciofi, Edoardo Giorgio; Morgilli, Luana; Robazza, Claudio; Bertollo, Maurizio",Int.

407926,51.20 the Mediating Role of Acceptance in the Relationship between Covid-19 Impact and Depression in Young Adults,2020,"BACKGROUND: Myeloperoxidase-specific ANCA (MPO-ANCA) are implicated in the pathogenesis of vasculitis and GN. Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS: To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS: B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","Hu, Peiqi; Su, Hua; Xiao, Hong; Gou, Shen-Ju; Herrera, Carolina A; Alba, Marco A; Kakoki, Masao; Falk, Ronald J; Jennette, J Charles",J Am Soc Nephrol,,419
409855,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes: Social Determination of Health,2020,"How migrating cells differentially adapt and respond to extracellular track geometries remains unknown. Using intravital imaging, we demonstrate that invading cells exhibit dorsoventral (top-to-bottom) polarity in vivo. To investigate the impact of dorsoventral polarity on cell locomotion through different confining geometries, we fabricated microchannels of fixed cross-sectional area, albeit with distinct aspect ratios. Vertical confinement, exerted along the dorsoventral polarity axis, induces myosin II-dependent nuclear stiffening, which results in RhoA hyperactivation at the cell poles and slow bleb-based migration. In lateral confinement, directed perpendicularly to the dorsoventral polarity axis, the absence of perinuclear myosin II fails to increase nuclear stiffness. Hence, cells maintain basal RhoA activity and display faster mesenchymal migration. In summary, by integrating microfabrication, imaging techniques, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that dorsoventral polarity, observed in vivo and in vitro, directs cell responses in confinement by spatially tuning RhoA activity, which controls bleb-based versus mesenchymal migration.","Wisniewski, Emily O; Mistriotis, Panagiotis; Bera, Kaustav; Law, Robert A; Zhang, Jitao; Nikolic, Milos; Weiger, Michael; Parlani, Maria; Tuntithavornwat, Soontorn; Afthinos, Alexandros; Zhao, Runchen; Wirtz, Denis; Kalab, Petr; Scarcelli, Giuliano; Friedl, Peter; Konstantopoulos, Konstantinos",Sci.

413945,Spatiotemporal Big Data for PM2.5 Exposure and Health Risk Assessment during COVID-19,2020,"Pulmonary thromboembolism and deep venous thrombosis occur frequently in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, the prevalence increases on the intensive care unit (ICU) and is very high in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We undertook a literature review to assess the usefulness of screening for peripheral venous thrombosis or pulmonary thrombosis in patients admitted with COVID-19. Outside of the ICU setting, D-dimer elevation on presentation or marked increase from baseline should alert the need for doppler ultrasound scan of the lower limbs. In the ICU setting, consideration should be given to routine screening with doppler ultrasound, given the high prevalence of thrombosis in this cohort despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. However, absence of lower limb thrombosis on ultrasound does not exclude pulmonary venous thrombosis. Screening with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not justified in patients on the general wards, unless there are clinical features and/or marked elevations in markers of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. However, the risk of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary thrombosis in ICU patients is very high, especially in patients on ECMO, where studies that employed routine screening for thrombosis with CT scanning have uncovered up to 100% incidence of pulmonary thrombosis despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, in patients at low bleeding risk and high clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism, therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered even before screening, Our review highlights the need for increased vigilance for VTE, with a low threshold for doppler ultrasound and CTPA in high risk in-patient cohorts, where clinical features and D-dimer levels may not accurately reflect the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism.","Vandenbriele, Christophe; Gorog, Diana A",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,419

Phase 1 (protocol U) tested 240 matched NPS and saliva sample pairs; phase 2 (SalivaAll protocol) tested 189 matched NPS and saliva sample pairs, with an additional sample homogenization step before RNA extraction. A total of 85 saliva samples were evaluated with both protocols. In phase 1, 28.3% (68/240) samples tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from saliva, NPS, or both. The detection rate was lower in saliva compared with NPS samples (50.0% versus 89.7%). In phase 2, 50.2% (95/189) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from saliva, NPS, or both.

The prevalence of symptom-defined PTSD was assessed using the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Determinants of symptom-defined PTSD and PTSD symptoms were analyzed using multivariable logistic and linear regression analysis. In total, 583 (51%) subjects responded at median 116 (range 41-200) days after COVID-19 onset. The prevalence of symptom-defined PTSD was 9.5% in hospitalized and 7.0% in non-hospitalized subjects (p = 0.80). Female sex, born outside of Norway, and dyspnea during COVID-19 were risk factors for persistent PTSD symptoms. In non-hospitalized subjects, previous depression and COVID-19 symptom load were also associated with persistent PTSD symptoms.

430257,Pragmatic application of area under the concentration-time curve monitoring from the 2020 vancomycin consensus guidelines,2021,"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to quantify out-of-pocket spending associated with respiratory hospitalizations for conditions similar to those caused by coronavirus disease 2019 and to compare out-of-pocket spending differences among those enrolled in consumer-directed health plans and in traditional, low-deductible plans. METHODS: This study used deidentified administrative claims from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (January 1, 2016-August 31, 2019) to identify patients with a respiratory hospitalization. It compared unadjusted out-of-pocket spending among consumer-directed health plan enrollees with that among traditional plan enrollees using difference of mean significance tests and repeated the analysis separately by age category and calendar year quarter. These data were collected on a rolling basis by OptumLabs and were analyzed in March 2020. RESULTS: Commercially insured consumer-directed health plan enrollees had significantly higher out-of-pocket spending than traditional plan enrollees, and these differences were largest among younger populations. The largest difference in out-of-pocket spending occurred during the first half of the year. CONCLUSIONS: Consumer-directed health plan enrollees may experience differential financial burden from a hospitalization related to coronavirus disease 2019. Although some insurers are waiving cost-sharing payments for coronavirus disease 2019 treatment, self-insured employers remain exempt. As of now, policy responses may be insufficient to reduce the financial burden on consumer-directed health plans enrollees with respiratory hospitalizations related to coronavirus disease 2019.","Eisenberg, Matthew D; Barry, Colleen L; Schilling, Cameron L; Kennedy-Hendricks, Alene",Am J Prev Med,,419

The reliance on antimicrobials such as antibiotics has become a major issue for both medicine and agriculture, particularly given the slow development of new medicines and pharmaceutical industry investment. The UK government has been working with other international bodies in the search for solutions to the many challenges AMR poses. Herbal medicines may provide a useful modality in the fight against AMR and can work solely or in tandem with current antimicrobial approaches. Recommendations for herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak have featured in Chinese national guidelines and policies, but UK strategies have no such guidance. More research is urgently needed to explore the biological plausibility and safety of herbal medicines to manage AMR. AMR is universal, affecting anyone and everyone, at any age and in any country. Investigating how such approaches can be integrated into western medicine will be important to elucidate.","Hu, Xiao-Yang; Logue, Martin; Robinson, Nicola",Eur J Integr Med,,419

The SARS-CoV-2 though shares similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, immunopathology of the novel virus is not understood properly. Previous reports from SARS and MERS-CoV documents that preexisting, non-neutralizing or poorly neutralizing antibodies developed as a result of vaccine or infection enhance subsequent infection, a phenomenon called as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Since immunotherapy has been implicated for COVID-19 treatment and vaccine is under development, due consideration has to be provided on ADE to prevent untoward reactions. ADE mitigation strategies like the development of vaccine or immunotherapeutics targeting receptor binding motif can be designed to minimize ADE of SARS-CoV-2 since full-length protein-based approach can lead to ADE as reported in MERS-CoV. The present mini-review aims to address the phenomenon of ADE of SARS-CoV-2 through the lessons learned from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and ways to mitigate them so as to develop better vaccines and immunotherapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Senthilkumar, Tuticorin Maragatham Alagesan; Udhayavel, Shanmugasundaram; Raj, Gopal Dhinakar",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,419
466000,Regulation and Trust: 3-Month Follow-up Study on COVID-19 Mortality in 25 European Countries,2020,"Background. Forecasting the time of forthcoming pandemic reduces the impact of diseases by taking precautionary steps such as public health messaging and raising the consciousness of doctors. With the continuous and rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19, statistical and outbreak prediction models including various machine learning (ML) models are being used by the research community to track and predict the trend of the epidemic, and also in developing appropriate strategies to combat and manage its spread. Methods. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various ML approaches including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural Network in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in the epidemiological domain. We first apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to identify and model the short and long-run relationships of the time-series COVID-19 datasets. That is, we determine the lags between a response variable and its respective explanatory time series variables as independent variables. Then, the resulting significant variables concerning their lags are used in the regression model selected by the ARDL for predicting and forecasting the trend of the epidemic. Results. Statistical measures i.e., Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used for model accuracy. The values of MAPE for the best selected models for confirmed, recovered and deaths cases are 0.407, 0.094 and 0.124 respectively, which falls under the category of highly accurate forecasts. In addition, we computed fifteen days ahead forecast for the daily deaths, recover, and confirm patients and the cases fluctuated across time in all aspects. Besides, the results reveal the advantages of ML algorithms for supporting decision making of evolving short term policies.","Naeem, Muhammad; Yu, Jian; Aamir, Muhammad; Khan, Sajjad Ahmad; Adeleye, Olayinka; Khan, Zardad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05960v1.pdf,419
466235,A framework for graduate and postgraduate specialty pharmacy training,2021,"Clinical clerkships have long been a pillar of veterinary medical education. These experiences provide students a unique opportunity to apply skills learned in pre-clinical training through hands-on practice. However, the emergence of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the subsequent global pandemic of 2020 forced many clinical instructors to adapt to teaching online. This teaching tip describes the use of backward design to create a three-part online clinical learning environment for the delivery of small animal primary care consisting of synchronous rounds, simulated online appointments, and independent learning activities. Results of a survey of students' perspectives on the experience demonstrate that the majority of students found that the online clinical experience met or exceeded expectations and provided a meaningful learning experience. Recommendations based on student feedback and instructor reflection are provided to guide creation and implementation of future online clinical courses. As the field of telemedicine grows, we view incorporation of such learning environments into veterinary medical education curriculum as essential to preparing students to enter the modern veterinary workplace.","Ross-Estrada, M.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all patients admitted to the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, UK, with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack between March 15th and April 14th, 2020 (COVID). Patient demographics, characteristics of the stroke, treatment details and logistics were compared with patients admitted in the corresponding weeks in the year before (2019). RESULTS: There was a 39.5% (n = 101 vs n = 167) reduction in admissions in the COVID cohort compared with 2019 with more severe strokes (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 7 vs 4, p = 0.02), and fewer strokes with no visible acute pathology (21.8 vs 37.1%, p = 0.01) on computed tomography. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of thrombolysis (10.9 vs 13.2%, p = 0.72) and/or thrombectomy (5.9 vs 4.8%, p = 0.90) and no statistically significant difference in time from stroke onset to arrival at hospital (734 vs 576 min, p = 0.34), door-to-needle time for thrombolysis (54 vs 64 min, p = 0.43) and door-to-thrombectomy time (181 vs 445 min, p = 0.72). Thirty-day mortality was not significantly higher in the COVID year (10.9 vs 8.9%, p = 0.77). None of the 7 stroke patients infected with COVID-19 died. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of stroke admissions fell, and stroke severity increased. There was no statistically significant change in the delivery of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy and no increase in mortality.","Padmanabhan, Nishita; Natarajan, Indira; Gunston, Rachel; Raseta, Marko; Roffe, Christine",Neurol. sci,,419

Simulation results show that if there is no specific medicine for it, it will form a global pandemic. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and the United States are the most vulnerable. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows an exponential decrease. We successfully predicted the outbreak of South Korea, Japan, and Italy in the early stages of the global pandemic based on the information before February 12, 2020.

In order to analyze the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 by statistical data based on the confirmed positive cases which are collected between December 31, 2019 to April 25, 2020. The present analysis reveals that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the major countries lie on the Equator is 78,509 cases, the countries lie on the Tropic of Cancer is 62,930 cases (excluding China) and the countries lie on the Tropic of Capricorn is 22,842 cases. The tropical countries, which comes between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn is reported to be 1,77,877 cases. The temperate zone countries, which are above and below the tropical countries are reported to be 25,66,171 cases so, the pandemic analysis describes the correlation between latitude, temperate zones, PM2.5 and local environmental factors. Hence, the temperature plays a pivotal role in the spreading of coronavirus at below 20 °C. The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Northern and Southern Hemispheres has inverse order against absorption of insolated energy. In temperate zone countries, the concentration of PM2.5 at below 20 µg/m3 has higher spreading rate of SARS-CoV-2 cases. The effect of insolation energy and PM2.5, it is confirmed that the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 is explained by dumb-bell model and solid/liquid interface formation mechanism. The present meta-analysis also focuses on the impact of GHSI, HDI, PD and PM2.5 on spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases.","Chennakesavulu, K; Reddy, G Ramanjaneya",Environ Pollut,,419

Objective: To examine changes in US emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions (MHCs), suicide attempts (SAs), overdose (OD), and violence outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program to examine national changes in ED visits for MHCs, SAs, ODs, and violence from December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020 (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). The National Syndromic Surveillance Program captures approximately 70% of US ED visits from more than 3500 EDs that cover 48 states and Washington, DC. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome measures were MHCs, SAs, all drug ODs, opioid ODs, intimate partner violence (IPV), and suspected child abuse and neglect (SCAN) ED visit counts and rates. Weekly ED visit counts and rates were computed overall and stratified by sex. Results: From December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020, a total of 187â¯508â¯065 total ED visits (53.6% female and 46.1% male) were captured; 6â¯018â¯318 included at least 1 study outcome (visits not mutually exclusive). Total ED visit volume decreased after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in the US beginning on March 16, 2020.

Conversely, ED visit rates increased beginning the week of March 22 to 28, 2020. When the median ED visit counts between March 15 and October 10, 2020, were compared with the same period in 2019, the 2020 counts were significantly higher for SAs (n = 4940 vs 4656, P = .02), all ODs (n = 15â¯604 vs 13â¯371, P < .001), and opioid ODs (n = 5502 vs 4168, P < .001); counts were significantly lower for IPV ED visits (n = 442 vs 484, P < .001) and SCAN ED visits (n = 884 vs 1038, P < .001). Median rates during the same period were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019 for all outcomes except IPV. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ED care seeking shifts during a pandemic, underscoring the need to integrate mental health, substance use, and violence screening and prevention services into response activities during public health crises.","Holland, Kristin M; Jones, Christopher; Vivolo-Kantor, Alana M; Idaikkadar, Nimi; Zwald, Marissa; Hoots, Brooke; Yard, Ellen; D039,; Inverno, Ashley; Swedo, Elizabeth; Chen, May S; Petrosky, Emiko; Board, Amy; Martinez, Pedro; Stone, Deborah M; Law, Royal; Coletta, Michael A; Adjemian, Jennifer; Thomas, Craig; Puddy, Richard W; Peacock, Georgina; Dowling, Nicole F; Houry, Debra","JAMA psychiatry (Chic.

The present case reports show two COVID-19 patients with severe refractory hypoxemia despite NIV treatment during the first wave (first half year 2020) and the resulting influence on the treatment regimen during the second wave (since October 2020) of the pandemic. Both patients (aged 63 years and 77 years) voluntarily positioned themselves on the side or in a prone position without prior sedation and oral intubation. Positional treatment promptly improved the arterial oxygenation level. The oxygenation index improved in the following days with continued NIV and intermittent prone and side position. The recovered patients were transferred from the intensive care unit at days 5 and 14, respectively after admission. The case reports, along with other reports, show that prone or lateral positioning may be important in the treatment of SARS-CoV­2 pneumonia in awake and not yet intubated patients.","Sellmann, Timur; Maurer, Clemens; Thal, Serge C",Anaesthesist,,419

In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine. We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population. RESULTS: A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%. Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years. Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine. Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5 (95% CI: 0.31-4.37).

AIM: To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey, in March 2020. SETTING: Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 regional prevalence categorised as high (>25), medium (15-25) and low prevalence (<15) COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: Seven high, five medium and four low prevalence hospices provided data. Two high prevalence hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute planning response. CONCLUSION: The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential. Hospices may also need to be proactive in connecting with the acute pandemic response.","Costantini, Massimo; Sleeman, Katherine E; Peruselli, Carlo; Higginson, Irene J",Palliat Med,,419

We compared emergency medical services responses to out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and ST‐segment‒elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the 2020 COVID‐19 pandemic to 2018 to 2019 and evaluated the impact of California's March 19, 2020 stay‐at‐home order. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a population‐based cross‐sectional study using Los Angeles County emergency medical services registry data for adult patients with paramedic provider impression (PI) of OHCA or STEMI from February through May in 2018 to 2020. After March 19, 2020, weekly counts for PI‐OHCA were higher (173 versus 135; incidence rate ratios, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.19‒1.37; P<0.001) while PI‐STEMI were lower (57 versus 65; incidence rate ratios, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78‒0.97; P=0.02) compared with 2018 and 2019. After adjusting for seasonal variation in PI‐OHCA and decreased PI‐STEMI, the increase in PI‐OHCA observed after March 19, 2020 remained significant (P=0.02). The proportion of PI‐OHCA who received defibrillation (16% versus 23%; risk difference [RD], −6.91%; 95% CI, −9.55% to −4.26%; P<0.001) and had return of spontaneous circulation (17% versus 29%; RD, −11.98%; 95% CI, −14.76% to −9.18%; P<0.001) were lower after March 19 in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019. There was also a significant increase in dead on arrival emergency medical services responses in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019, starting around the time of the stay‐at‐home order (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Paramedics in Los Angeles County, CA responded to increased PI‐OHCA and decreased PI‐STEMI following the stay‐at‐home order. The increased PI‐OHCA was not fully explained by the reduction in PI‐STEMI. Field defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation were lower. It is critical that public health messaging stress that emergency care should not be delayed.","Rollman, Jeffrey Eric; Kloner, Robert A.; Bosson, Nichole; Niemann, James T.; Gausche‐Hill, Marianne; Williams, Michelle; Clare, Christine; Tan, Weiyi; Wang, Xiaoyan; Shavelle, David M.; Rafique, Asim M.",J Am Heart Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.019635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058862/,419

Since ECMO is a highly invasive procedure with several, potentially devastating complications and its implementation is complex and expensive, simpler and less invasive therapeutic options should be first exploited. Low tidal volume and driving pressure ventilation, prone position, neuromuscular blocking agents and individualized ventilation based on transpulmonary pressure measurements have been demonstrated to successfully treat the vast majority of mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia. Veno-venous ECMO has a place in the small portion of severely hypoxemic patients in whom these strategies fail. A combined analysis of recent ARDS trials revealed that ECMO was used in only 2.15% of patients (n = 145/6736). Nevertheless, ECMO use has sharply increased in the last decade, raising questions regarding its thoughtful use. Such a policy could be harmful both for patients as well as for the ECMO technique itself. This narrative review attempts to describe together the practical approaches that can be offered to the sickest patients before going to ECMO, as well as the rationale and the limitations of ECMO.

Malaria has been successfully eradicated since 1961 in Japan and now only imported malaria cases are encountered. However, as the number of Japanese people who are going abroad and also the number of foreigners who are visiting Japan increases (about 16 and 5 millions, respectively, in 2001), so does the chance for Japanese doctors to see imported malaria or transfusion-transmitted malaria cases. In fact, the total number of the patients with acute malaria in Japan has been around 100–150 annually for the last 10 years. Of those, about 75% are Japanese and 25% are foreigners, and about 75% are male and 25% are female. The peak age is in the 20 s. Recently, about 45% of patients are Plasmodium falciparum and another 45% Plasmodium vivax infections. The former species is likely to be seen in travelers coming back from African countries and the latter is mainly from Asian countries. The important issue is that patients in Japan have not been diagnosed promptly nor treated properly because doctors in Japan are no longer familiar with tropical medicine. Therefore, some patients are dying from severe malaria as a consequence. As it is, most of the effective medicines for drug-resistant malaria or severe malaria have not been registered in Japan. There is now a need for medical practitioners to focus on travel medicine in Japan.","Kano, Shigeyuki; Kimura, Mikio",Acta Trop,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X03002729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14744553/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X03002729,419

In Molinette Hospital, a new communication model between healthcare providers and families of COVID-19 affected patients was developed by a team of physicians and psychologists. The study's aims were to investigate caregivers' distress and to analyse their satisfaction with the communications provided. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among caregivers of patients of Molinette Hospital COVID wards. Between April and June 2020, all caregivers were contacted 2 weeks after the patient's discharge/death to assess their satisfaction with the communications received through an online survey. Results: A total of 155 caregivers completed the survey. Caregivers' distress level was found to be higher in women than men (p = 0.048) and in caregivers whose relative died compared to the caregivers whose relative was discharged (p < 0.001). More than 85% of caregivers defined communication “excellent”/“very good”; being male was associated with higher satisfaction levels than women (β = −0.165, p = 0.046). Besides daily communication, 63 caregivers (40.6%) received additional support from a psychologist of the team. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study presenting, in an emergency, a new model of communication provided by a team of physicians and psychologists, and analyzing satisfaction with it. This model was highly appreciated by caregivers and it limited the discomfort caused by the restrictions on relatives' visits. It would be interesting to further evaluate the possibility of extending a communication model that includes doctors and psychologists in routine clinical practice.","Carletto, Sara; Corezzi, Michele; Furmenti, Maria Francesca; Olivero, Elena; Rapicavoli, Paola; Rossello, Paola; Stanizzo, Maria Rosa; Bovero, Andrea",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.621725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589497/,419

ACE2 and dilatory MAS1 clustered with nine RAS‐related genes, highly expressed in: Liver; Cardiac_Myocytes; Skeletal_Muscle; Uterus; Kidney; Lung; Small_Intestine; Smooth_Muscle. RAS and stress accumulation: While prorenin is active after binding to its receptor, binding of soluble renin increases its enzymatic activity several times. Increased renin secretion multiplies the overall capacity for producing Ang I, leading to hypertension and increased vascular resistance.

Also efficacy and safety of antiviral regimens were not compared according severity of the disease. In this study the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine plus atazanavir/ritonavir was compared in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes of 213 patients with COVID-19 during the hospitalization course and up to 56 days after the hospital discharge. The disease was categorized to moderate and severe based on the severity of pneumonia and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2). The patients received the national treatment protocol containing hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BD in first day and then 200 mg BD) plus atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg daily) for 7 days. Main outcomes included discharge rates at day 7, 14 and 28, 28-day mortality, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and intubation, length of hospital and ICU stay and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of patients was 60(14) years and 53% were male. According to WHO definition, 51.64% and 48.36% of the patients had moderate (SpO2 ≥ 90%) and severe disease (SpO2 < 90%) at baseline, respectively. The discharge rate of the moderate group was significantly higher than the severe group at day 7, 14 and 28 (HR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35–0.69, p = < 0.001 at day 7, HR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.35–0.66, p = < 0.001 at day 14 and HR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.36–0.67, p = < 0.001at day 28). The 28-day mortality of the severe group was six times higher than the moderate group (HR = 6.00; 95% CI: 2.50–14.44), p = < 0.001). The need of admission in ICU for the severe group and the moderate group was 37.86% and 18.18% of the patients. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the moderate group in comparison with the severe group (5 ± 4 vs. 8 ± 6 days, p < 0.001). Patients in the moderate group experienced the serious adverse events and complications less than the severe group. The discharged patients were followed up to 56 days after discharge. Some of the patients complained of symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, weakness and new-onset hair loss. CONCLUSION: Our study did not support the use of hydroxychloroquine plus atazanavir/ritonavir in patients who had SpO(2) < 90% at the time of hospital admission. SpO2 was the only predictor of clinical outcomes (duration of hospital stay, discharge from the hospital and mortality) in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine plus atazanavir/ritonavir.

While these symptoms arise acutely during the course of infection, less is known about the possible long-term consequences for the brain. Severely affected COVID-19 cases experience high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and acute respiratory dysfunction and often require assisted ventilation. All these factors have been suggested to cause cognitive decline. Pathogenetically, this may result from direct negative effects of the immune reaction, acceleration or aggravation of pre-existing cognitive deficits, or de novo induction of a neurodegenerative disease. This article summarizes the current understanding of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and hypothesizes that affected patients may be at higher risk of developing cognitive decline after overcoming the primary COVID-19 infection. A structured prospective evaluation should analyze the likelihood, time course, and severity of cognitive impairment following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Heneka, Michael T.; Golenbock, Douglas; Latz, Eicke; Morgan, Dave; Brown, Robert",Alzheimers Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498691/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-020-00640-3,419

The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the timing for safe tracheal intubation in elderly patients can be determined by acceleromyographically monitoring paralysis of the adductor pollicis muscle when high-dose rocuronium, given to block the respiratory muscles, is administered. METHODS: Forty elderly (65–92 years) patients were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to two groups, to receive rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg. After induction of anesthesia and observing acceleromyographic train-of-four (TOF) responses of the adductor pollicis muscle to ulnar nerve stimulation, the patients randomly received either dose of rocuronium. The onset times from rocuronium administration to TOF counts of 0 were measured. Soon thereafter, a single anesthesiologist who was blinded to the allocated dose of rocuronium performed laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, and assessed intubating conditions. Data were analyzed by the unpaired t-test and Chi-squared test. RESULTS: The averaged [SD] onset time of neuromuscular blockade was significantly shorter with 1 mg/kg than 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium (104.3 [30.1] s vs. 186.8 [37.5] s, p < 0.001). Patients who received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium variously showed either poor (n = 9) or good (n = 11) intubating conditions. However, all patients who received 1 mg/kg rocuronium had excellent intubating conditions. CONCLUSIONS: If 1 mg/kg rocuronium is administered, a TOF count of 0 acceleromyographically observed at the adductor pollicis muscle can reveal the adequate timing for tracheal intubation.","Takagi, Shunichi; Sugaya, Nami; Kiuchi, Naoto; Iwasa, Aya; Itagaki, Masumi; Seki, Aya; Suzuki, Junko; Suzuki, Takahiro",J Anesth,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-020-02831-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32705417/,419
620710,Multidisciplinary academic perspectives during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Although people experiencing homelessness (PEH) have the worst health outcomes in society, they have a low uptake of primary care services. GP outreach has developed as a way of increasing their access into primary care but little is known about the experience of patients receiving care in this way. AIM: To explore PEHs’ experiences of GP care in community outreach settings in UK; and to seek staff/volunteers’ views on the strengths and weaknesses of GP community outreach services. DESIGN AND SETTING: A multi-method qualitative study with PEH and staff/volunteers working in three different community outreach settings in the UK. METHOD: Individual semi-structured interviews were carried out with 22 PEH and two focus groups with key staff/volunteers. Data were analysed thematically using framework analysis. RESULTS: GP outreach services better enabled PEH to access medical care and staff/volunteers valued GP support to promote, and facilitate access to, healthcare services. In particular, the findings illuminate the high value that PEH placed on the organisational environment of the GP outreach service. Valued aspects of GP outreach were identified as comfortable, safe, and engendering a sense of belonging; convenient, opportunistic, and a one-stop shop; and being heard, having more time, and breaking down barriers. CONCLUSION: The organisational environment is important in enabling PEH to engage with GP services. The physical and organisational environment of the outreach settings were the most important factors; they created a space where professional barriers between the GP and patients were flattened, so facilitating a therapeutic relationship.","Hirst, Victoria; Cuthill, Fiona",British Journal of General Practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630748/; https://bjgp.org/content/bjgp/early/2021/02/23/BJGP.2020.0749.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp.2020.0749,419

This rapid, enormous, and unanticipated event had major implications for healthcare. Infection preventionists (IP) have a critical role in worker and patient safety. IPs’ lessons learned can guide future pandemic response. METHODS: Seven focus groups were conducted with APIC members in September and October, 2020 via Zoom to elicit IPs’ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sessions were recorded then transcribed verbatim. Major themes were identified through content analysis. RESULTS: In total, 73 IPs participated (average of 10 IPs per focus group) and represented all geographical areas and work settings. Participating IPs described multiple challenges they have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, including rapidly changing and conflicting guidance, a lack of infection prevention recommendations for nonacute care settings, insufficient personal protective equipment, healthcare personnel complacency with personal protective equipment and infection prevention protocols, and increases in healthcare associated infections and workload. CONCLUSIONS: The identified gaps in pandemic response need to be addressed in order to minimize healthcare associated infections and occupational illness. In addition, the educational topics identified by the participating IPs should be developed into new educational programs and resources.","Rebmann, Terri; Alvino, Rebecca T.; Mazzara, Rachel L.; Sandcork, Jessica",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655321004648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454681/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.07.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655321004648,419
627027,COVID-19: Protecting Health-Care Workers in South Korea,2021-06-07,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, a characteristic hyperinflammatory response, vascular damage, microangiopathy, angiogenesis and widespread thrombosis. Four stages of COVID-19 have been identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection; the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia; the third by a worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state; and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this emergency period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.","Stasi, Cristina; Fallani, Silvia; Voller, Fabio; Silvestri, Caterina",Eur J Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053381/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173644; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299920307366?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299920307366,419

However, few studies have examined the effect of local face mask policies on the pandemic. In this study, we developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in New York City (NYC), which was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We used data on daily and cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to calibrate and validate our model. We then used the model to assess the effect of the executive order on face mask use on infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in NYC. Our results showed that the executive order on face mask use was estimated to avert 99,517 (95% CIs 72,723–126,312) COVID-19 infections and 7978 (5692–10,265) deaths in NYC. If the executive order was implemented 1 week earlier (on April 10), the averted infections and deaths would be 111,475 (81,593–141,356) and 9017 (6446–11,589), respectively. If the executive order was implemented 2 weeks earlier (on April 3 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use), the averted infections and deaths would be 128,598 (94,373–162,824) and 10,515 (7540–13,489), respectively. Our study provides public health practitioners and policymakers with evidence on the importance of implementing face mask policies in local areas as early as possible to control the spread of COVID-19 and reduce mortality.

Specifically, it has shown a predilection towards obese patients as well as as well as other vulnerable groups including predilection of males over females, old age over young age and black races over Caucasian ones.. Single cell sequencing studies have highlighted the role of cell polarity and the co-expression of proteases, such as Furin, along with ACE2 in the genesis of coronavirus disease rather than exclusively link tissue involvement with ACE2 levels thought previously. It has also forged a connection between the genetic and immune cellular mechanisms underlying COVID infection and the inflammatory state of obese patients, offering a more accurate explanation as to why obese patients are at increased risk of poor COVID outcomes. These commonalities encompass macrophage phenotype switching, genetic expression switching, and overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, depletion of the regulatory cytokines, in situ T cell proliferation, and T cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of single cell sequencing as a rapid means to identify and treat those who are most likely to need hospital admission and intensive care, in the hopes of precision medicine. Furthermore, this study underlines the use of immune modulators such as Leptin sensitizers, rather than immune suppressors as anti-inflammation therapies to switch the inflammatory response from a drastic immunological type 1 response to a beneficial type 2 effective one.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Ye, Jianping; Kamel, Aya; Mishriky, Fady; Ismail, Habiba-Allah; El Qadi, Layla; Malak, Lauris; Mohamed, Maram; Arsanyous, Mariem; Hazem, Maysa; El-Husseiny, Miral; Ashraf, Mirette; Hafez, Nada; AlShehry, Nada; El-Husseiny, Nadine; AbdelRaouf, Nora; Shebl, Noura; Hafez, Nouran; Youssef, Nourhan; Afdal, Peter; Hozaien, Rafeef; Menshawey, Rahma; Saeed, Rana; Yasser, Reem; Hesham, Shereen; Zakarriah, Wesam; Khattab, Shahenda; Elammary, Yasmine; Fouda, Raghda",Obes Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100303; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451847620301238?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2451847620301238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995660/,419

Underlying racial discriminatory practices and policies catalyze and reinforce these disparities. Health care and academic medicine leaders must consider adopting strategies and programs that target health-related social needs by addressing underlying structural racism that shapes the uneven distribution of adverse social determinants. We present a groundwater allegory from the Racial Equity Institute to describe how leaders can leverage hospitals' role as anchor institutions within communities to ensure that the communities they serve have equitable resources and opportunities to improve their health. We describe how hospitals—through their economic power, policy influence, and wealth of data—can advance health equity through policies and practices that move beyond the individual level health-related social needs to change local social, political, and economic structural conditions that create disparities.

An individual’s risk of developing CRC is multi-factorial with known risk factors including increasing age, male sex, family history of CRC and raised body mass index. Population-based screening programmes for CRC exist in many countries, and in the United Kingdom (UK), screening is performed through the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP). Screening programmes offer a population-based approach for those at “average risk”, and do not typically offer enhanced screening for groups at increased risk. In the UK, such patients are managed via non-screening symptomatic services but in a non-systematic way. RECENT FINDINGS: There is growing evidence that conditions such as cystic fibrosis and a history of childhood cancer are associated with higher risk of CRC, and surveillance of these groups is advocated by some organizations; however, national recommendations do not exist in most countries.

Data sources: Studies in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Psycinfo, and medRxiv up to February 6, 2021. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: Prevalence rates of mental health symptoms in the general population and key sub-populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe. Data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression. Results: The meta-analysis identifies and includes 21 studies and 26 independent samples in Eastern Europe. Poland (n=4), Serbia (n=4), Russia (n=3), and Croatia (n=3) had the greatest number of studies. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in eleven Eastern European countries including Hungary, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 18 studies with 22 samples was 30% (95% CI: 24%-37%) and pooled prevalence of depression in 18 studies with 23 samples was 27% (95% CI: 21%-34%).

Various measures that focus on restricting social contacts have been implemented in order to reduce the spread of the virus. Understanding how daily activities and travel behaviour change during such global crisis and the reasons behind is crucial for developing suitable strategies for similar future events and analysing potential mid- and long-term impacts. METHODS: In order to provide empirical insights into changes in travel behaviour during the first Coronavirus-related lockdown in 2020 for Germany, an online survey with a relative representative sample for the German population was conducted a week after the start of the nationwide contact ban. The data was analysed performing descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results suggest in general an increase in car use and decrease in public transport use as well as more negative perception of public transport as a transport alternative during the pandemic. Regarding activity-related travel patterns, the findings show firstly, that the majority of people go less frequent shopping; simultaneously, an increase in online shopping can be seen and characteristics of this group were analysed. Secondly, half of the adult population still left their home for leisure or to run errands; young adults were more active than all other age groups. Thirdly, the majority of the working population still went to work; one out of four people worked in home-office. Lastly, potential implications for travel behaviour and activity patterns as well as policy measures are discussed.","Kolarova, Viktoriya; Eisenmann, Christine; Nobis, Claudia; Winkler, Christian; Lenz, Barbara",Eur,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12544-021-00486-2,419

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions have been undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan.

Its management remains a great challenge due to the high dependency on social behaviours. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and subscription accounts on social media platforms related to household waste management could be an effective and environmentally friendly publicity approach than traditional publicity via posters and newspapers. However, there is a paucity of literature on measuring social media publicity in household waste management, which brings challenges for practitioners to characterise and improve this publicity pathway. In this study, under an integrated framework, data mining approaches are employed or extended for multidimensional publicity analytics using the data of online footprints of propagandist and users. A real-world case study based on a subscription account on the WeChat platform, Shanghai Green Account, is analysed to reveal useful insights for personalised improvements of household waste management. This study suggests that the current publicity related to household waste management leans towards propagandist-centred in both timing and topic dimensions. The identified timing, which has high user engagement, is 12:00–13:00 and 21:00–22:00 on Thursday. The overall relative publicity quality of historical posts is calculated as 0.95. Average user engagement under the macro policy in Shanghai was elevated by 138.5% from 2018 to 2019, during which the collections of biodegradable food waste and recyclable waste were elevated by 88.8% and 431.8%.

Other aspects of investigation described in this article are the organization of the outbreak investigation and the importance of communication.","Mathieu, E.; Sodahlon, Y.",International Encyclopedia of Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123739605001830; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123739605001830,419
663214,Characterizing the COVID-19 Infodemic on Chinese Social Media: Exploratory Study,2021-02-05,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic viral disease affecting also obstetric patients and uncertainties exist about the prognostic role of inflammatory biomarkers and hemocytometry values in patients with this infection. To clarify that, we have assessed the values of several inflammatory biomarkers and hemocytometry variables in a cohort of obstetric patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and we have correlated the values at admission with the need of oxygen supplementation during the hospitalization. Overall, among 62 (27.3%) pregnant women and 165 (72.7%) postpartum women, 21 (9.2%) patients received oxygen supplementation and 2 (0.9%) required admission to intensive care unit but none died. During hospitalization leukocytes (p < 0.001), neutrophils (p < 0.001), neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (p < 0.001) and C reactive protein (p < 0.001) decreased significantly, whereas lymphocytes (p < 0.001), platelets (p < 0.001) and ferritin (p = 0.001) increased. Lymphocyte values at admission were correlated with oxygen need, with a 26% higher risk of oxygen supplementation for each 1000 cells decreases. Overall, in obstetric patients hospitalized with COVID-19, C reactive protein is the inflammatory biomarker that better mirrors the course of the disease whereas D-dimer or ferritin are not reliable predictors of poor outcome. Care to the need of oxygen supplementation should be reserved to patients with reduced lymphocyte values at admission.","Lombardi, Andrea; Duiella, Silvia; Piani, Letizia Li; Comelli, Agnese; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Oggioni, Massimo; Muscatello, Antonio; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea; Ferrazzi, Enrico",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92885-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172816/,419

Given the tolerability and minimal P450 interactions, antidepressants (i.e., citalopram, escitalopram etc.), antipsychotics (i.e., olanzapine) and valproate can be considered to be safe in combination with antiviral drugs.","Zhang, Kai; Zhou, Xiaoqin; Liu, Huanzhong; Hashimoto, Kenji",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270760/; https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2020.84,419
674330,COVID-19 Vaccine Perception in South Korea: Web Crawling Approach,2021-09-08,"To “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 contagion, several countries ordered lockdowns amid the pandemic along with indications on social distancing. These social isolation measures could potentially bring alterations to healthy behavior, including to alcohol consumption. However, there is hardly any scientific evidence of the impact of such measures on alcohol consumption and binge drinking (BD) among young adults, and how they relate to alcohol craving, stress, anxiety, and depression levels. We addressed these questions by conducting a longitudinal study with 146 Portuguese college students—regular binge drinkers (regular BDs), infrequent binge drinkers (infrequent BDs) and non-binge drinkers (non-BDs)—in three moments: before the pandemic (Pre-Lockdown), during lockdown (Lockdown) and 6 months after (Post-Lockdown). Results revealed that regular BDs decreased alcohol use during Lockdown, a change in behavior that was even greater during Post-Lockdown, when regular BDs displayed similar levels of consumption to infrequent/non-BDs. Additionally, alcohol craving and living with friends were predictive of alcohol use during Lockdown, whereas stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms did not contribute to explain changes in drinking behavior. Collectively, the results suggest that BD in young Portuguese college students can be stopped when the contexts in which alcohol intake usually takes place are suppressed, which may have important implications for future prevention and intervention strategies.","Vasconcelos, Margarida; Crego, Alberto; Rodrigues, Rui; Almeida-Antunes, Natália; López-Caneda, Eduardo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574745/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189822,419

686472,Deploying Health Care Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-04-19,"The main causes of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), health inequalities and health inequity include consumption of unhealthy commodities such as tobacco, alcohol and/or foods high in fat, salt and/or sugar. These exposures are preventable, but the commodities involved are highly profitable. The economic interests of ‘Unhealthy Commodity Producers’ (UCPs) often conflict with health goals but their role in determining health has received insufficient attention. In order to address this gap, a new research consortium has been established. This open letter introduces the SPECTRUM ( S haping Public h Ealth poli Cies To Reduce ineq Ualities and har M)Consortium: a multi-disciplinary group comprising researchers from 10 United Kingdom (UK) universities and overseas, and partner organisations including three national public health agencies in Great Britain (GB), five multi-agency alliances and two companies providing data and analytic support. Through eight integrated work packages, the Consortium seeks to provide an understanding of the nature of the complex systems underlying the consumption of unhealthy commodities, the role of UCPs in shaping these systems and influencing health and policy, the role of systems-level interventions, and the effectiveness of existing and emerging policies. Co-production is central to the Consortium’s approach to advance research and achieve meaningful impact and we will involve the public in the design and delivery of our research. We will also establish and sustain mutually beneficial relationships with policy makers, alongside our partners, to increase the visibility, credibility and impact of our evidence. The Consortium’s ultimate aim is to achieve meaningful health benefits for the UK population by reducing harm and inequalities from the consumption of unhealthy commodities over the next five years and beyond.","Horton, Marie; Perman-Howe, Parvati R.; Angus, Colin; Bishop, Julie; Bogdanovica, Ilze; Brennan, Alan; Britton, John; Brose, Leonie S.; Brown, Jamie; Collin, Jeff; Dockrell, Martin; Fitzgerald, Niamh; Friel, Sharon; Gillespie, Duncan; Gilmore, Anna B.; Hill, Sarah E.; Knai, Cecile; Langley, Tessa; Martin, Sancha; McNeill, Ann; Moore, Graham; Munafò, Marcus R.; Murray, Rachael L.; Opazo Breton, Magdelena; Pearce, Jamie; Petticrew, Mark; Reid, Garth; Robson, Deborah; Rutter, Harry; Shahab, Lion; Shortt, Niamh; Smith, Katherine; Syrett, Keith; Bauld, Linda",Wellcome Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16318.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33693062/,419
687946,A Case for Participatory Disease Surveillance of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India,2020-04-16,"Anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with a reduced quality of life, and an increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms involved in anemia associated to CKD are diverse and complex. They include a decrease in endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production, absolute and/or functional iron deficiency, and inflammation with increased hepcidin levels, among others. Patients are most commonly managed with oral or intravenous iron supplements and with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). However, these treatments have associated risks, and sometimes are insufficiently effective. Nonetheless, in the last years, there have been some remarkable advances in the treatment of CKD-related anemia, which have raised great expectations. On the one hand, a novel family of drugs has been developed: the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs). These agents induce, among other effects, an increase in the production of endogenous EPO, improve iron availability and reduce hepcidin levels. Some of them have already received marketing authorization. On the other hand, recent clinical trials have elucidated important aspects of iron supplementation, which may change the treatment targets in the future. This article reviews the current knowledge of the pathophysiology CKD-related anemia, current and future therapies, the trends in patient management and the unmet goals.","Portolés, Jose; Martín, Leyre; Broseta, José Jesús; Cases, Aleix",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842503/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.642296,419

We aim to study the similarities and differences between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza in order to provide better care to patients, particularly during the co-circulation of Influenza A Subtype H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in order to compare clinical characteristics, complications, and outcomes of hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed H1N1 influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 at a tertiary care center in Karachi, Pakistan. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were compared with 55 patients with H1N1 Influenza A pneumonia. Median age was similar in both COVID-19 patients (54 years) and in patients with H1N1 influenza (59 years), but there was male predominance in COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.95; 95% CI: 1.12-7.79). Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were 1.34 (95% CI: 1.14-1.62) times more likely to have a greater duration of illness prior to presentation compared to H1N1 influenza patients. COVID-19 patients were 4.59 times (95% CI: 1.32-15.94) more likely to be admitted to a general ward compared to H1N1 pneumonia patients. Moreover, patients with COVID-19 were 7.62 times (95% CI: 2.42-24.00) more likely to be treated with systemic steroids compared to patients with H1N1 pneumonia. The rate of nosocomial infections as well as mortality was similar in both H1N1 and COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Our study found a male predominance and longer duration of illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared to H1N1 influenza patients but no difference in outcomes with either infection.","Nasir, Nosheen; Khanum, Iffat; Habib, Kiren; Ahmed, Rimsha; Hussain, Mujahid; Hasan, Zahra; Irfan, Muhammad",Adv Respir Med,https://doi.org/10.5603/arm.a2021.0049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196377/,419
