Uncertain hazards (natural and engineering) have been successfully analyzed using probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). Unlike uncertain hazards, terrorists and hostile states are intelligent adversaries who can observe our vulnerabilities and dynamically adapt their plans and actions to achieve their objectives. This article compares uncertain hazard risk analysis with intelligent adversary risk analysis, describes the intelligent adversary risk analysis challenges, and presents a probabilistic defender–attacker–defender model to evaluate the baseline risk and the potential risk reduction provided by defender investments. The model includes defender decisions prior to an attack; attacker decisions during the attack; defender actions after an attack; and the uncertainties of attack implementation, detection, and consequences. The risk management model is demonstrated with an illustrative bioterrorism problem with notional data.","Parnell, Gregory S.; Smith, Christopher M.; Moxley, Frederick I.",Risk Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159100/,298
12683,"Hepatitis E Virus Genotype 7 RNA and Antibody Kinetics in Naturally Infected Dromedary Calves, United Arab Emirates",2020-09-11,"The present article aims to compare electromyographic (EMG) activity of the knee extensors during traditional resistance training (TRT) and no load resistance training with or without visual feedback (NL-VF and NL-NF). Sixteen healthy men (age: 25.2 ± 3.6) volunteered to participate in the study. Participants visited the laboratory on three occasions involving: (1) a 10 repetition maximum test (10 RM test), (2) familiarization and (3) performance of knee extensions using TRT, NL-VF and NL-NF in a random order, with 10 min of rest between them. TRT involved the performance of a set to momentary muscle failure using the 10 RM load. NL-NF involved the performance of 10 repetitions with no external load, but with the intention to maximally contract the muscles during the whole set. NL-VF involved the same procedure as NL-NF, but a monitor was positioned in front of the participants to provide visual feedback on the EMG activity. Peak and mean EMG activity were evaluated on the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF). Results: there were no significant differences in VM and VL peak EMG activity among different situations. There was a significant difference for peak EMG activity for RF, where TRT resulted in higher values than NL-VF and NL-NF (p < 0.05). Higher values of mean EMG activity were found for VM, VL and RF during TRT in comparison with both NL-VF and NL-NF. Conclusions: resistance training with no external load produced high levels of peak muscle activation, independent of visual feedback, but mean activation was higher during TRT. These results suggest that training with no external load might be used as a strategy for stimulating the knee extensors when there is limited access to specialized equipment. Although the clinical applications of no load resistance training are promising, it is important to perform long-term studies to test if these acute results will reflect in muscle morphological and functional changes.","Alves, Rafael Ribeiro; Vieira, Carlos Alexandre; Bottaro, Martim; de Araújo, Murilo Augusto Soares; Souza, Daniel Costa; Gomes, Bruno Cavalcante; Gentil, Paulo",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459905/,298

Frequency of Symptoms and Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in New Orleans, Louisiana",2020-12-31,"OBJECTIVES: Oncology health professionals experience high levels of burnout and compassion fatigue, affecting their health and the care they provide. This study aimed to establish whether present-centered awareness and attention (a component of mindfulness) is uniquely associated with burnout and compassion fatigue in oncology professionals. METHODS: An international sample of oncology professionals (n = 118) completed an online questionnaire with validated measures of present-centered awareness and attention, empathy, compassion fatigue, and burnout. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to model relations among the independent variable (present-centered awareness and attention) and the criterion variables of burnout (disengagement, exhaustion) and compassion fatigue (compassion satisfaction, compassion burnout, secondary traumatic stress) after statistically controlling for empathy, age, gender, years of experience, and patient contact hours. RESULTS: Mean hours of patient contact per week was 23.52 (SD = 13.62), with 26 (22.03%) reporting 40 h or more. Higher hours of patient contact per week were positively associated with secondary traumatic stress. Present-centered awareness and attention was associated with lower disengagement, lower emotional exhaustion, higher compassion satisfaction, lower secondary traumatic stress, and lower compassion burnout. In each model, present-centered awareness accounted for unique variance after controlling for age, gender, years of experience, patient contact hours per week, and empathy scores. The amount of unique variance accounted for by present-centered awareness ranged from 4 to 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Oncology professionals reporting higher levels of present-centered awareness and attention reported higher compassion satisfaction and lower secondary traumatic stress, compassion burnout, exhaustion, and disengagement. Promoting present-centered awareness may be a mechanism that contributes to less burnout in oncology professionals.","Hegel, Jamie; Halkett, Georgia K.

62144,Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Bat Coronavirus Closely Related to the Direct Progenitor of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,2015,"BACKGROUND Postoperative complications are still a major concern after liver resection (LR). Systemic inflammation and deregulated reactive oxygen species during major abdominal surgery may impair outcome after hepatectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing LR were included in this study (n = 40). Oxidative stress (OS) was measured peri- and post-operatively as static oxidation-reduction potential markers (sORP) and antioxidant capacity ORP (cORP) by using the RedoxSYS Diagnostic system. Furthermore, Th1- and Th2-specific cytokines were assessed. RESULTS Whereas there was no significant change in systemic sORP during LR and in the early postoperative course, there was a substantial decrease of cORP immediately post-surgery, and on postoperative days 1 and 3 (p<0.001). OS response was tightly regulated, as there was a significant correlation between sORP and cORP (p<0.0001; R2:0.457). An increase of OS (sORP) after LR of more than 3 mV was predictive for severe postoperative complications (53.8% vs. 12.5; p = 0.017). There was a significantly higher IL-2 (p = 0.006) and IL-5 (p = 0.001) increase during hepatectomy in patients who developed a severe morbidity. CONCLUSION Antioxidant capacity remained stable during LR but dropped during the post-surgical period, suggesting a consumption of antioxidants to maintain OS within healthy range. Severe postoperative complications were associated with a pronounced inflammatory response during surgery.","Schwarz, Christoph; Fitschek, Fabian; Bar-Or, David; Klaus, Daniel A; Tudor, Bianca; Fleischmann, Edith; Roth, Georg; Tamandl, Dietmar; Wekerle, Thomas; Gnant, Michael; Bodingbauer, Martin; Kaczirek, Klaus",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045432/,298
67295,Nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the nucleic acid-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 3.,2009,"INTRODUCTION : Omalizumab is used to treat severe uncontrolled allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), and is approved for self-administration in prefilled syringes. It is thus important to understand the advantages, critical issues, and indications for home administration. AREAS COVERED : The present review summarizes the available evidence on home administration of omalizumab in asthma and CSU to illustrate the advantages derived from self-administration of patients in this setting. EXPERT OPINION : The available data suggest that patients can safely administer biologics at home with suitable training, and that home administration is time saving and cost effective. The majority of patients with severe asthma or CSU treated with omalizumab are likely to be suitable candidates for self-administration, which can be proposed to anyone that the clinician deems suitable. In addition to clinicians, pharmacists can also play a key role in managing patients who are prescribed home administration. A practical flow chart is proposed on selection of patients and their management during home administration. Self-administration of biologics can be considered as a valid alternative to traditional injections in a clinical setting, and the evidence has shown that no major issues need to be overcome in terms of safety or efficacy.","Menzella, Francesco; Ferrari, Emanuele; Ferrucci, Silvia Mariel; Lombardi, Enrico; Alfano, Silvio; Bonavita, Ornella; Morini, Paolo; Rizzi, Andrea; Matucci, Andrea",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2021.1882990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504237/,298

We sought to determine if the rates and types of VAW changed during the COVID-19 pandemic at our level 1 trauma center (L1TC). METHODS We performed a retrospective review of female patients who presented to our L1TC because of violence from 2019 through 2020. Patients were grouped into a pre-COVID or COVID period. The primary aim of this study was to compare rates of VAW between groups. Secondary aims sought to evaluate for any difference in traumatic mechanism between periods and to determine if a temporal relationship existed between COVID-19 and VAW rates. RESULTS There was no difference in rates of VAW between the pre-COVID and COVID period (3.1% vs 3.6%, P = .6); however, rates of penetrating trauma were greater during the COVID period (38.2% vs 10.3%, P = .01). After controlling for patient age and race, the odds of penetrating trauma increased during the pandemic (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.6-28.5, P < .01). From February 2020 through October 2020, there was a direct relationship between rates of COVID-19 and VAW (r2 .78, P < .01). CONCLUSION Rates of VAW were unchanged between the pre-COVID and COVID periods, yet the odds of penetrating VAW were 5 times greater during the pandemic. Moving forward, trauma surgeons must remain vigilant for signs of violence and ensure that support services are available during future crises.","Tracy, Brett M; Whitson, Amy K; Chen, J C; Weiss, Brian D; Sims, Carrie A",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/00031348211047467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645329/,298

88951,"Development, characterization, and application of monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein.",2010,"The majority of viruses infecting hyperthermophilic archaea display unique virion architectures and are evolutionarily unrelated to viruses of bacteria and eukaryotes. The lack of relationships to other known viruses suggests that the mechanisms of virus-host interaction in Archaea are also likely to be distinct. To gain insights into archaeal virus-host interactions, we studied the life cycle of the enveloped, ∼2-μm-long Sulfolobus islandicus filamentous virus (SIFV), a member of the family Lipothrixviridae infecting a hyperthermophilic and acidophilic archaeon Saccharolobus islandicus LAL14/1. Using dual-axis electron tomography and convolutional neural network analysis, we characterize the life cycle of SIFV and show that the virions, which are nearly two times longer than the host cell diameter, are assembled in the cell cytoplasm, forming twisted virion bundles organized on a nonperfect hexagonal lattice. Remarkably, our results indicate that envelopment of the helical nucleocapsids takes place inside the cell rather than by budding as in the case of most other known enveloped viruses. The mature virions are released from the cell through large (up to 220 nm in diameter), six-sided pyramidal portals, which are built from multiple copies of a single 89-amino-acid-long viral protein gp43. The overexpression of this protein in Escherichia coli leads to pyramid formation in the bacterial membrane. Collectively, our results provide insights into the assembly and release of enveloped filamentous viruses and illuminate the evolution of virus-host interactions in Archaea.","Baquero, Diana P; Gazi, Anastasia D; Sachse, Martin; Liu, Junfeng; Schmitt, Christine; Moya-Nilges, Maryse; Schouten, Stefan; Prangishvili, David; Krupovic, Mart",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2105540118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341107/,298

98686,An ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR method using the PCR1100 to detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2.,2020-06-30,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered the development of various SARS-CoV-2 neutralization tests. A wild-type virus (using African green monkey VeroE6 cells), a pseudovirus (using human Caco-2 cells), and a surrogate neutralization test platform were applied to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization potential of a cohort of 111 convalescent plasma donors over a period of seven months after diagnosis. This allowed an in-depth validation and assay performance analysis of these platforms. More importantly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were stable or even increased within the observation period, which contradicts earlier studies reporting a rapid waning of Ab titers after three to four months. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation of neutralization titers with increasing age, number of symptoms reported, and the presence of the Rhesus Ag RhD. Validation of the platforms revealed that highest assay performances were obtained with the wild-type virus and the surrogate neutralization platforms. However, our data also suggested that selection of cutoff titers had a strong impact on the evaluation of neutralization potency. When taking strong neutralization potency, as demonstrated by the wild-type virus platform as the gold standard, up to 55% of plasma products had low neutralization titers. However, a significant portion of these products were overrated in their potency when using the surrogate assay with the recommended cutoff titer. In summary, our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers are stable for at least seven months after diagnosis and offers a testing strategy for rapid selection of high-titer convalescent plasma products in a biosafety level 1 environment.","Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Groß, Rüdiger; Seidel, Alina; Wettstein, Lukas; Ludwig, Carolin; Schwarz, Tatjana; Körper, Sixten; Rojewski, Markus; Lotfi, Ramin; Weinstock, Christoph; Seifried, Erhard; Corman, Victor Max; Drosten, Christian; Münch, Jan; Schrezenmeier, Hubert",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980583/,298

Nutrition composition was assessed using a software analyzing the frequency of food consumption. Two groups of children were distinguished: the main group (without dentoalveolar anomalies) and the comparison group (with bracket systems). The total sample size was 58 adolescents. It was found that in schoolchildren receiving orthodontic treatment the imbalance in the intake of macro- and micronutrients with diets is much higher than in schoolchildren of the main group. In the daily diet of the main group of children, adequate adequate energy value was noted (94.6% of the physiological requirements), in contrast to schoolchildren in the comparison group (76.7%). Diets in children of the main group are deficient in the content of total protein (90.1%) and carbohydrates (86.4%), and excess in fats (112.2%). In the comparison group, the intake of macronutrients with food averaged 77.7% of the norm. The limited use of certain foods in children with bracket systems has led to a significant deficit in diets of meat (70.0% of the recommended level of consumption), fish and seafood (37.6%), eggs (55.0%), bakery products (44.9%), potatoes (78.7%), vegetables (66.0%), fruits (51.6%). The installation of bracket systems for orthodontic treatment is necessary to eliminate dentoalveolar anomalies in children, but it becomes both a risk factor for the formation of nutritional disorders in patients and a risk factor for tooth enamel demineralization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop recommendations for correcting the nutrition of children during the period of orthodontic treatment.","Tapeshkina, M M; Kostritsin, A G; Tapeshkina, N V; Chernenko, S V",Stomatologiia,https://doi.org/10.17116/stomat20209903174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32608954/,298

Here we evaluated the efficacy of the Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) and its combination with other drugs in the treatment of COVID-19. We included 170 confirmed COVID-19 patients who had been cured and discharged. Their antiviral therapies were LPV/r alone or combinations with Interferon (IFN), Novaferon and Arbidol. We evaluated the medications efficacy by comparing the time of the negative nucleic acid conversion and the length of hospitalization mainly. The LPV/r+Novaferon [6.00(4.00-8.00) &7.50(5.00-10.00) days] had shorter time of the negative nucleic acid conversion (P=0.0036) and shorter time of hospitalization(P<0.001) compared with LPV/r alone [9.00(5.00-12.00) &12.00(11.00-15.00) days] and LPV/r+ IFN [9.00(7.25-11.00) &12.00(10.00-13.50) days]. On the contrary, LPV/r+IFN [9.00(7.25-11.00) & 12.00(10.00-13.50) days] had shorter time of the negative nucleic acid conversion (P=0.031) and shorter time of hospitalization (P<0.001) compared with LPV/r+IFN+Novaferon [10.00(8.00-11.25) & 13.50(11.50-17.00) days] and LPV/r+IFN+Arbidol [14.00(9.75-19.00) & 19.50(13.25-24.00) days].

METHODS In a randomized, open-label, 4-treatment (2-by-2), 4-period crossover design, 4 daytime measurements (60 min each) were performed in 20 subjects receiving home mechanical noninvasive ventilation plus supplemental oxygen (≥ 2 L/min) inserted near the ventilator: active valve circuit or leak port circuit with or without artificial leakage (4 mm inner diameter). Oxygen concentration near the ventilator, oxygen concentration at the mask, and blood gases were measured. RESULTS Overall, oxygen concentration at the mask (29 ± 5%) was lower than oxygen concentration at the ventilator (34 ± 4%), with a mean difference of 5.1% (95% CI 4.2-5.9%, P < .001)%. With the leak port circuit, oxygen concentration at the mask decreased by 3.2% (95% CI 2.6 to 3.9%, P < .001), compared to the active valve circuit. When artificial leakage was introduced into the circuit, oxygen concentration at the mask decreased by 5.7% (95% CI 5.1 to 6.4%, P < .001)%, PaO2 by 10.4 mm Hg (95% CI 3.1 to 17.7 mm Hg, P = .006), and PaCO2 increased by 1.8 mm Hg (95% CI 0.5 to 3.1 mm Hg, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS The use of a leak port circuit and the occurrence of leak around the interface significantly reduced oxygen concentration at the mask and negatively impacted gas exchange in subjects receiving home noninvasive ventilation and supplemental oxygen.

However, the regulation of STING still remains poorly defined. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the regulation of STING expression in relation to the RIG-I pathway. Our data show that signaling through RIG-I induces STING expression at both the transcriptional and protein levels in various cell types. STING induction by the RIG-I agonist 5'triphosphorylated RNA (5'pppRNA) was recognized to be a delayed event resulting from an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Indeed, cotreatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and type I/II interferon was found to have a synergistic effect on the regulation of STING expression and could be potently decreased by impairing NF-κB and/or STAT1/2 signaling. STING induction significantly contributed to sustainment of the immune signaling cascade following 5'pppRNA treatment. Physiologically, this cross talk between the RNA- and DNA-sensing pathways allowed 5'pppRNA to efficiently block infection by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) both in vitro and in vivo in a STING-dependent fashion. These observations demonstrate that STING induction by RIG-I signaling through the NF-κB and STAT1/2 cascades is essential for RIG-I agonist-mediated HSV-1 restriction. IMPORTANCE The innate immune system represents the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The dysregulation of this system can result in failure to combat pathogens, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, precise regulation at each level of the innate immune system is crucial. Recently, a number of studies have established STING to be a central molecule in the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA and RNA derived from pathogens. Here, we describe the regulation of STING via RIG-I-mediated innate immune sensing. We found that STING is synergistically induced via proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine cascades. In addition, we show that in vivo protection against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) by a RIG-I agonist required STING. Our study provides new insights into the cross talk between DNA and RNA pathogen-sensing systems via the control of STING.","Liu, Yiliu; Goulet, Marie-Line; Sze, Alexandre; Hadj, Samar Bel; Belgnaoui, Sidi Mehdi; Lababidi, Rassin R; Zheng, Chunfu; Fritz, Jörg Hermann; Olagnier, David; Lin, Rongtuan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00748-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27512060/,298

126555,Identification of diverse alphacoronaviruses and genomic characterization of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus from bats in China.,2014,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing Joint Estimates of the work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), with contributions from a large network of experts. Evidence from mechanistic data suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause ischaemic heart disease (IHD). In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from IHD that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. OBJECTIVES We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on IHD (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality). DATA SOURCES We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CISDOC, PsycINFO, and WHO ICTRP. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We included working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged < 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies which contained an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on IHD (prevalence, incidence or mortality). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined relative risks using random-effect meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. RESULTS Thirty-seven studies (26 prospective cohort studies and 11 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 768,751 participants (310,954 females) in 13 countries in three WHO regions (Americas, Europe and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (30 studies) or self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies). The outcome was defined as incident non-fatal IHD event in 19 studies (8 cohort studies, 11 case-control studies), incident fatal IHD event in two studies (both cohort studies), and incident non-fatal or fatal (""mixed"") event in 16 studies (all cohort studies). Because we judged cohort studies to have a relatively lower risk of bias, we prioritized evidence from these studies and treated evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. IHD incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). No eligible study was found on the effect of long working hours on IHD prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are uncertain about the effect on acquiring (or incidence of) IHD of working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.07, 20 studies, 312,209 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence) and 49-54 h/week (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17, 18 studies, 308,405 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working ≥55 h/week may have led to a moderately, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of acquiring IHD, when followed up between one year and 20 years (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.26, 22 studies, 339,680 participants, I2 5%, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are very uncertain about the effect on dying (mortality) from IHD of working 41-48 h/week (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 13 studies, 288,278 participants, I2 8%, low quality of evidence) and 49-54 h/week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.25, 11 studies, 284,474 participants, I2 13%, low quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working ≥55 h/week may have led to a moderate, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of dying from IHD when followed up between eight and 30 years (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31, 16 studies, 726,803 participants, I2 0%, moderate quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences by WHO region and sex, but RRs were higher among persons with lower SES. Sensitivity analyses found no differences by outcome definition (exclusively non-fatal or fatal versus ""mixed""), outcome measurement (health records versus self-reports) and risk of bias (""high""/""probably high"" ratings in any domain versus ""low""/""probably low"" in all domains). CONCLUSIONS We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as ""inadequate evidence for harmfulness"" for the exposure categories 41-48 and 49-54 h/week for IHD prevalence, incidence and mortality, and for the exposure category ≥55 h/week for IHD prevalence. Evidence on exposure to working ≥55 h/week was judged as ""sufficient evidence of harmfulness"" for IHD incidence and mortality. Producing estimates for the burden of IHD attributable to exposure to working ≥55 h/week appears evidence-based, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review could be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.","Li, Jian; Pega, Frank; Ujita, Yuka; Brisson, Chantal; Clays, Els; Descatha, Alexis; Ferrario, Marco M; Godderis, Lode; Iavicoli, Sergio; Landsbergis, Paul A; Metzendorf, Maria-Inti; Morgan, Rebecca L; Pachito, Daniela V; Pikhart, Hynek; Richter, Bernd; Roncaioli, Mattia; Rugulies, Reiner; Schnall, Peter L; Sembajwe, Grace; Trudel, Xavier; Tsutsumi, Akizumi; Woodruff, Tracey J; Siegrist, Johannes",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32505014/,298

We investigated long-term psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue among SARS survivors. METHODS All SARS survivors from the hospitals of a local region in Hong Kong were assessed by a constellation of psychometric questionnaires and a semistructured clinical interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) to determine the presence of psychiatric disorders and chronic fatigue problems. RESULTS Of 369 SARS survivors, 233 (63.1%) participated in the study (mean period of time after SARS, 41.3 months). Over 40% of the respondents had active psychiatric illnesses, 40.3% reported a chronic fatigue problem, and 27.1% met the modified 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Logistic regression analysis suggested that being a health care worker at the time of SARS infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12- 9.39; P = .03), being unemployed at follow-up (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.50-14.78; P = .008), having a perception of social stigmatization (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.20-7.60; P = .02), and having applied to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22; P = .02) were associated with an increased risk of psychiatric morbidities at follow-up, whereas application to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.07-6.51; P = .04) was associated with increased risk of chronic fatigue problems. CONCLUSIONS Psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue persisted and continued to be clinically significant among the survivors at the 4-year follow-up. Optimization of the treatment of mental health morbidities by a multidisciplinary approach with a view for long-term rehabilitation, especially targeting psychiatric and fatigue problems and functional and occupational rehabilitation, would be needed.","Lam, Marco Ho-Bun; Wing, Yun-Kwok; Yu, Mandy Wai-Man; Leung, Chi-Ming; Ma, Ronald C W; Kong, Alice P S; So, W Y; Fong, Samson Yat-Yuk; Lam, Siu-Ping",Archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2009.384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20008700/,298
130744,An update on Middle East respiratory syndrome: 2 years later.,2015,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for surgical teaching programs, as operating rooms closed and resources were redirected for patient care. As a result, both educational challenges and opportunities emerged. The objective of this study was to assess the changes used by plastic surgery programs as a result of the pandemic. METHODS A 34-question American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons-approved survey was distributed on April 29, 2020, to attendings in academic plastic surgery programs in the United States. Variables were controlled whenever multiple attending responses were submitted from the same program. RESULTS A total of 113 attendings, including 30 (27.8%) program directors, responded to the survey. Most respondents were located in the northeast (41.4%). The average percentage of elective case volume was 23% of pre-COVID states. Those who reported a decrease in emergent surgical case volume (55.2%) estimated it to be at an average of 45% of the normal. Almost all the respondents (95.6%) agreed that they were working fewer hours than usual, and 40.9% of those reported a decrease of more than 20 hours per week of work. Most attendings (82.1%) also reported a decrease in their monthly salary. The percentage projected current salary compared with normal was 85%. CONCLUSIONS Our survey data suggest that academic plastic surgery programs have had impactful changes to their operative and educational schedules, teaching, revenue, and patient care. The data described in this study could be used as a baseline for future pandemics affecting plastic surgery programs to help strategize their operational and educational structures.","Mehrzad, Raman; Akiki, Ronald; Liu, Paul Y; Schmidt, Scott; Woo, Albert S",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833168/,298

164929,"Occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality, sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms and self-reported productivity before and after relocation into WELL-certified office buildings",2021,"Introduction. To date, issues related to the protection of medical workers from COVID-19 infection, including immunological protection, are of particular interest. The aim of the study was to explore seroprevalence of the IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein in various groups of medical workers with the following assessment of the risk of COVID-19, depending on the seropositivity and occupational group. Materials and methods. The study of the strength of immunity to COVID-19 was carried out within the framework of the large-scale Rospotrebnadzor program to assess population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population of the Russian Federation, considering the protocol recommended by WHO, on the basis of the laboratories of the Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology in the Republic of Tatarstan. From the sample of the study conducted in the Republic of Tatarstan, medical workers (301) were selected without a history of a new coronavirus infection and with no clinical symptoms of this disease at the time of biomaterial sampling ( June 2020);the absence of the transferred new coronavirus infection was verified by the Unified State Information System ""Electronic Health of the Republic of Tatarstan"". The comparison group included 52 employees belonging to the engineering and technical personnel and not employed in medical institutions who met the above inclusion criteria. In the aggregate, the observation group (medical workers and the comparison group) included 12.1% of the participants in the population study. Results. The rate of seropositivity was 36.5% in the control groups, 23.7% — in doctors, and 38.9% — in nurses. Compared to doctors, seroprevalence was higher in nurses. The employment of medical workers in temporary infectious diseases hospitals did not affect the production of the IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein. A relatively low prevalence of seropositivity among doctors of temporary infectious diseases hospitals was revealed. The probability of seroconversion decreased with age and did not depend on gender or history of recent contacts with COVID-19 patients. The survival analysis showed that the probability of remaining healthy by the end of the follow-up was the lowest among doctors from medical and preventive institutions that did not serve as temporary infectious diseases hospitals. The risk of COVID-19 in seronegative individuals was higher, but without statistical significance. Conclusion. According to the data of immunological studies for the presence of IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it was found that the prevalence of seroprevalence in nurses is significantly higher than that of doctors, nurses of medical and prophylactic organizations of young age have higher seroprevalence to the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2. According to prospective observation, it was revealed that doctors of medical and prophylactic organizations that are not classified as temporary infectious diseases hospitals have a higher risk of developing a symptomatic form of COVID-19, which may be due to both the insufficient effectiveness of anti-epidemic measures and the peculiarities of the immune response and approaches, used to evaluate it. In the current epidemic situation, the detection of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be used to decide on the distribution of responsibilities among medical personnel. © 2021, Izmerov Research Institute of Occupational Medicine.

At this time, trial data was lacking, and we addressed this in a study of UK healthcare workers. The first vaccine dose induced protection from infection from the circulating alpha (B.1.1.7) variant over several weeks. In a sub-study of 589 individuals, we show that this single dose induces SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses and a sustained B and T cell response to spike protein. NAb levels were higher after the extended dosing interval (6-14 weeks) compared to the conventional 3-4 week regimen, accompanied by enrichment of CD4+ T cells expressing IL2. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection amplified and accelerated the response. These data on dynamic cellular and humoral responses indicate that extension of the dosing interval is an effective, immunogenic protocol.","Payne, Rebecca P.; Longet, Stephanie; Austin, James A.; Skelly, Donal T.; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Adele, Sandra; Meardon, Naomi; Faustini, Sian; Al-Taei, Saly; Moore, Shona C.; Tipton, Tom; Hering, Luisa M.; Angyal, Adrienn; Brown, Rebecca; Nicols, Alexander R.; Gillson, Natalie; Dobson, Susan L.; Amini, Ali; Supasa, Piyada; Cross, Andrew; Bridges-Webb, Alice; Reyes, Laura Silva; Linder, Aline; Sandhar, Gurjinder; Kilby, Jonathan A.; Tyerman, Jessica K.; Altmann, Thomas; Hornsby, Hailey; Whitham, Rachel; Phillips, Eloise; Malone, Tom; Hargreaves, Alexander; Shields, Adrian; Saei, Ayoub; Foulkes, Sarah; Stafford, Lizzie; Johnson, Sile; Wootton, Daniel G.; Conlon, Christopher P.; Jeffery, Katie; Matthews, Philippa C.; Frater, John; Deeks, Alexandra S.; Pollard, Andrew J.; Brown, Anthony; Rowland-Jones, Sarah L.; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Barnes, Eleanor; Hopkins, Susan; Hall, Victoria; Dold, Christina; Duncan, Christopher JA.; Richter, Alex; Carroll, Miles; Screaton, Gavin; de Silva, Thushan I.; Turtle, Lance; Klenerman, Paul; Dunachie, Susanna",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867421012216; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421012216?v=s5,298

183625,Design and synthesis of peptidomimetic severe acute respiratory syndrome chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors.,2005,"Rationing in health care is controversial, and even more so in pediatrics. Children are an inherently vulnerable group because they are reliant on their parents and caregivers to make decisions in their best interests and have no political voice. Historically, there has been general acceptance of the need to ration healthcare at a systems level, however there is controversy over whether healthcare professionals should be involved in rationing at the bedside. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that bedside rationing is unavoidable, at least in times of extreme resource scarcity. Internationally, there has been significant ethical analysis and guideline development to guide intensive care rationing decisions in the event that resources are overwhelmed. This paper explores the principles underlying distributive justice in healthcare rationing and discusses how these were operationalized in ethical guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, rationing is unavoidable and occurs constantly in everyday nursing and medical ICU practice, often in mundane and uncontroversial ways. Some argue that these everyday decisions are not true rationing decisions, but resource allocation, or stewardship decisions. We argue there are no dear lines between resource allocation and rationing decisions, rather that they occur on a spectrum. These everyday rationing decisions are particularly susceptible to personal biases that are often implicit. Due to the subtle and constant nature of most everyday rationing decisions, specific guideline development will rarely be practical or appropriate. however, it is possible to develop other processes to improve decision malting. There are a variety of strategies we recommend for this including, encouraging reflective practice;developing explicit frameworks that promote collaborative decision making;being transparent about resource allocation and rationing decisions with colleagues, patients, and families;and promoting a workplace culture of speaking up and accessing support in identifying and managing everyday rationing decisions.","Kirby, L.; Basu, S.; Close, E.; Jansen, M.",Translational Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-334,298

Neuroticism was positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and disordered sleep;extraversion was negatively correlated with anxiety, depression, and disordered sleep;openness was negatively correlated with disordered sleep;and conscientiousness was negatively correlated with both depression and disordered sleep. The results demonstrate that personality traits were risk factors for psychological disorders among students during the COVID-19 outbreak.

186669,Longitudinal analysis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-specific antibody in SARS patients.,2005,"Demyelination induced by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain JHM, is in large part immune mediated, but little is known about the mechanisms involved in this process. Previous results suggest that inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) contributes transiently to MHV-induced demyelination. Herein, we show that equivalent amounts of demyelination were evident at day 12 after MHV infection in mice genetically deficient in NOS2 (NOS2(-/-)) and in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, using an established adoptive transfer model and pharmacological inhibitors of NOS2 function, we could demonstrate no effect on MHV-induced demyelination. These results indicate that NOS2 function is not required for demyelination in mice infected with MHV.","Wu, G F; Pewe, L; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10906226/,298

Adoptive transfer of MHV-immune splenocytes depleted of either CD4 or CD8 T cells to infected mice deficient in recombination activation gene 1 resulted in demyelination. We showed previously that the process of CD8 T-cell-mediated demyelination was strongly dependent on the expression of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) by donor cells. In this report, we show, in contrast, that demyelination and lymphocyte infiltration were increased in recipients of IFN-gamma(-/-) CD4 T cells when compared to levels in mice receiving C57BL/6 CD4 T cells.","Pewe, Lecia; Haring, Jodie; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12072531/,298
187306,Monoclonal antibody-based antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reveals high sensitivity of the nucleocapsid protein in acute-phase sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients.,2005,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, has been shown to utilize carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as the receptor. We have demonstrated that MHV can utilize a different isoform of CEA, which is an alternatively spliced gene product that is expressed in different tissues, as a receptor. Furthermore, the CEA molecules from a resistant mouse strain (SJL) have different sequences and yet serve as functional viral receptors. Thus, MHV can use more than a single type of CEA molecule as the receptor. We have also shown that some mouse cell lines express functional CEA molecules and yet are resistant to infections by certain MHV strains. Biochemical studies of the infected cells indicate that MHV infections in these cell lines are blocked at the steps of virus entry. We conclude that MHV entry requires additional cellular factors other than CEA, the viral receptor. The significance of viral receptors and the additional cellular factors in regulating viral tropism is discussed.","Yokomori, K; Lai, M M",Archives of virology.

189201,Identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replicase products and characterization of papain-like protease activity.,2004,"BACKGROUND Hong Kong was struck by the community outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. In the same year, the elderly suicide rate in Hong Kong showed a sharp upturn from a previous downward trend. METHODS Secondary analyses using Poisson Regression Models on the suicide statistics from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Government were performed. RESULTS In a Poisson Regression Model on the annual suicide rates in elders aged 65 and over in years 1986-2003, 2002 served as the reference year. Suicide rates in 1986-1997 were significantly higher than the reference year, with an Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) of 1.34 to 1.61. However, rates in 1998-2001 did not differ from the reference year significantly, representing stabilization of suicide rates for 4 years after 1997. The elderly suicide rate increased to 37.46/100,000 in 2003, with an IRR of 1.32 (p=0.0019) relative to 2002. Such trend is preserved when female elderly suicide rates in 1993-2003 were analyzed, while suicide rates in elderly men and younger age groups did not follow this pattern. DISCUSSIONS Mechanistic factors such as breakdown of social network and limited access to health care might account for the findings. These factors could have potentiated biopsychosocial risk factors for suicide at individual levels, particularly in elderly. Female elders, by way of their previous readiness to utilize social and health services instituted in the past decade, are thus more susceptible to the effects of temporary suspension of these services during the SARS epidemic. CONCLUSIONS The SARS epidemic was associated with increased risk of completed suicide in female elders, but not in male elders or the population under 65 years of age.","Chan, Sau Man Sandra; Chiu, Fung Kum Helen; Lam, Chiu Wah Linda; Leung, Pui Yiu Vivian; Conwell, Yeates",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16416469/,298

Within each replicate of 3 calves, 2 were selected at random, to be given 100,000 to 146,000 sporulated coccidia oocysts (principally Eimeria bovis) orally 60 hours after arrival at the college research farm. On the thirteenth day after coccidia inoculation, 1 of the 2 calves that had been given coccidia and the third calf that had not been inoculated, were given coronavirus by intranasal and oral routes. Calves were observed daily, and consistency of feces was scored visually. Nasal swab specimens for indirect immunofluorescent antibody testing for coronavirus and fecal samples for oocyst determination were obtained approximately every third day. Of 7 calves that were given only coronavirus, 3 developed diarrhea of short duration. Of 7 calves that were given only coccidia oocysts, 6 developed diarrhea. All 7 calves inoculated initially with coccidia and subsequently with coronavirus developed diarrhea. For 5 of 7 replicates, calves that were given coccidia and coronavirus developed diarrhea first. When overall severity, measured by fecal score and by blood in the feces, was compared, calves inoculated with coccidia followed by coronavirus were more severely affected (P less than 0.05) than were calves that were given only coronavirus. Calves that were given only coccidia oocysts appeared more severely affected than calves that were given only coronavirus, but differences were not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Hoblet, K H; Shulaw, W P; Saif, L J; Weisbrode, S E; Lance, S E; Howard, R R; Angrick, E J; Redman, D R",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1324629/,298

We cloned ferret cDNA encoding SAA from the liver of a ferret via reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The sequence of the cDNA clone revealed that ferret SAA has an open reading frame of 387 bp that encodes 129 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of ferret SAA has 96.1, 89.9, 86.0, 83.8, 83.0, 73.8 and 65.3% similarity to the mink, dog, cat, cattle, horse, human and mouse SAA genes, respectively. Compared to human SAA, the deduced ferret SAA amino acid sequence had an insertion of an 8-amino acid fragment between amino acids 88 and 95. Recombinant ferret SAA (rfrSAA) was expressed using an Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain, BL21 Star. Using Western blot analysis, anti-SAA mAb provided with the multispecies SAA ELISA kit reacted with purified rfrSAA. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between the rfrSAA protein and a commercial multispecies SAA ELISA kit. In contrast, rfrSAA was not recognized with the antibodies included in a commercial human SAA ELISA kit. These results suggest that the structure of ferret SAA is antigenically similar to other domestic animal SAAs, and the multispecies ELISA kit allows for the detection and quantification of ferret SAA in vivo.","Aratani, Hitoshi; Segawa, Takao; Itou, Takuya; Sakai, Takeo",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972465/,298

The viral component of the microbiome (the virome) is receiving increasing attention for its role in neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD). Rotavirus and coronavirus have for a long time been associated with NCD and commercial vaccines have been produced against these agents. Recently, several other viruses which may play a role in diarrhea have been discovered in calf fecal samples, mostly by sequence-based methods. These viruses include torovirus, norovirus, nebovirus, astrovirus, kobuvirus, and enterovirus. Most studies have involved epidemiologic investigations seeking to show association with diarrhea for each virus alone or in combination with potential pathogens. However, determining the contribution of these viruses to calf diarrhea has been challenging and much uncertainty remains concerning their roles as primary pathogens, co-infection agents, or commensals.","Gomez, Diego E; Weese, J Scott",The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29203935/,298
193176,Reverse transcriptase PCR diagnostic assay for the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2004,"Objective This manuscript serves to provide an overview of the methods of the Multimorbidity in Children and Youth across the Life-course (MY LIFE) study, profile sample characteristics of the cohort, and provide baseline estimates of multimorbidity to foster collaboration with clinical and research colleagues across Canada. Method MY LIFE is comprised of 263 children (2-16 years) with a physical illness recruited from McMaster Children's Hospital, their primary caregiving parent, and their closest-aged sibling. Participants are followed with data collection at recruitment, 6, 12, and 24 months which includes structured interviews, self-reported measures, and biological samples and occur in a private research office or at participants' homes. Post-COVID-19, data collection transitioned to mail and telephone surveys. Results At recruitment, children were 9.4 (4.2) years of age and 52.7% were male. The mean duration of their physical illness was 4.5 (4.1) years; 25% represent incident cases (duration <1 year). Most (69.7%) had healthy body weight and intelligence in the average range (73.5%). Overall, 38.2% of children screened positive for ≥1 mental illness according to parent report (24.8% screened positive based on child self-report). Compared to 2016 Census data, the MY LIFE cohort overrepresents families of higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions Multimorbidity is common among children and these baseline data will serve to measure relative changes in the mental health of children with physical illness over time. MY LIFE will provide new information for understanding multimorbidity among children, though underrepresentation of lower socioeconomic families may have implications for the generalizability of findings.","Ferro, Mark A; Lipman, Ellen L; Van Lieshout, Ryan J; Timmons, Brian; Shanahan, Lilly; Gorter, Jan Willem; Georgiades, Kathy; Boyle, Michael",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953762/,298

The stated aims of Canada's arms export licensing decision-making process are, similarly, to assess such risks on a case-by-case basis. This paper examines Canada's ongoing arms transfer arrangements with Saudi Arabia in light of health-related international humanitarian and human rights law considerations enumerated in the Arms Trade Treaty. It assesses available information suggesting serious violations that implicate acts of commission by the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict in Yemen. The article centers on questions about the potential health-related consequences of Canadian-made, Saudi-coalition-used arms for people in Yemen and how risks are being assessed in export decision-making processes. Ultimately, it argues that Canada is failing to meaningfully take into account the possible negative impacts of its arms exports on people's health and health care in Yemen. It counters the government's approach to risk, which it argues is serviceable to exporter interests, with a health-based precautionary approach to exports.","Ferguson, Rhonda; Jamal, Zarlasht",Health and human rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390710/,298

196785,Synthesis and evaluation of keto-glutamine analogues as potent inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome 3CLpro.,2004,"Viral vaccines have had remarkable positive impacts on human health as well as the health of domestic animal populations. Despite impressive vaccine successes, however, many infectious diseases cannot yet be efficiently controlled or eradicated through vaccination, often because it is impossible to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of the population. Recent advances in molecular biology suggest that the centuries-old method of individual-based vaccine delivery may be on the cusp of a major revolution. Specifically, genetic engineering brings to life the possibility of a live, transmissible vaccine. Unfortunately, releasing a highly transmissible vaccine poses substantial evolutionary risks, including reversion to high virulence as has been documented for the oral polio vaccine. An alternative, and far safer approach, is to rely on genetically engineered and weakly transmissible vaccines that have reduced scope for evolutionary reversion. Here, we use mathematical models to evaluate the potential efficacy of such weakly transmissible vaccines. Our results demonstrate that vaccines with even a modest ability to transmit can significantly lower the incidence of infectious disease and facilitate eradication efforts. Consequently, weakly transmissible vaccines could provide an important tool for controlling infectious disease in wild and domestic animal populations and for reducing the risks of emerging infectious disease in humans.","Nuismer, Scott L; Althouse, Benjamin M; May, Ryan; Bull, James J; Stromberg, Sean P; Antia, Rustom",Proceedings.

As a result, approximately one million birds were destroyed within a three kilometer radius of the settlements. The Israeli population was instructed to take preventive measures against the spread of the infection. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of use of different sources of information by the population in the affected area with the general population during the first phase of a bird flu outbreak in Israel. METHODS A telephone survey among two randomly selected, representative samples of adults was conducted. One sample involved 500 adult Israeli residents; the other sample involved 103 adult residents from the affected area during the first phase of the outbreak. The use of different sources of information by the population concerning the disease was assessed. The differences in these parameters between the affected area and the nationwide population were analyzed using a chi-square and t-test analysis. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Television was a significantly more common source of information in Israel as a whole (p < 0.05), whereas friends (p < 0.05) and local authorities (p < 0.05) were significantly more common sources of information in the affected area. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of use of the sources of information by the population during the early phase of a bird flu outbreak is different in the affected area compared with the general population in the same country. Authorities must pay attention to this phenomenon and use the correct sources of information in each area in order to achieve better exposure of the population to the recommended behaviors during an outbreak.","Peltz, Rami; Galit, Avisar-Shohat; Ventura-Gabay, Miri; Bar-Dayan, Yaron",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18491662/,298
199171,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and Transfusion Medicine: reflections from Italy,2020,"The monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5B19.2, which has virus-neutralizing and fusion inhibition activities, binds to an epitope (S2A) consisting of nine hydrophobic amino acids in the S2 subunit of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) spike (S) protein. This suggests that the S2A epitope may be involved in binding the virus to the MHV receptor and/or in virus-cell fusion. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that while the binding of virus to the receptor was blocked by anti-S1 MAbs, it was not blocked by the S2A antiserum, indicating that S2A was not involved in receptor-binding. The S proteins prepared in this study with mutations in the S2A epitope were either fusogenic or non-fusogenic and their fusogenicity did not correlate with the hydrophobic feature of the S2A epitope. All of these wt and mutated S proteins were similarly transported onto the cell membrane independent of their fusogenicity capability. These results suggest that S2A may mediate the fusion activity of the MHV S protein during virus entry into cells.","Taguchi, F; Shimazaki, Y K",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11086117/,298

199307,Transmission dynamics and timing of key events for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers,2021,"Besides the conventional extracorporeal circulation, commonly used in cardiac surgery, the methods of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) have been applied ever more frequently in thoracic surgery in recent years. The most commonly used modalities of such supports include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and the Novalung interventional lung assist device (iLA). Successful application of ECLS has led to its more frequent use in general thoracic surgery, especially as a tool to treat hypercapnia and to ensure oxygenation and haemodynamic support. However, these methods are essential in lung transplant programmes; without their help, in most cases, it would not be possible to perform the transplantation or prevent the severe complications associated with critical primary graft dysfunction. Additionally, the extracorporeal circulation also facilitates the performing of specific surgical procedures that would not be feasible under standard conditions or would be associated with an inadequate risk. The application of extracorporeal life supports can fundamentally increase the level of resection when treating advanced intrathoracic malignancies that are in close contact with the heart and large vessels or even directly extend into them. Without the possibility of resecting such structures en bloc, together with the tumour, and, thus, achieving an R0 resection, these malignant tumours are often directly contraindicated for surgery or are operated non-radically, i.e. unsuccessfully. Complete tumour resection is the most important prognostic factor in the surgery.","Lischke, R; Burkert, J",Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242959/,298

202567,Estimates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in Iran - Authors' reply,2021,"The recent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has increased at an alarming rate, representing a substantial cause of mortality worldwide. Respiratory injuries are major COVID-19 related complications, leading to poor lung circulation, tissue scarring, and airway obstruction. Despite an in-depth investigation of respiratory injury's molecular pathogenesis, effective treatments have yet to be developed. Moreover, early detection of viral infection is required to halt the disease-related long-term complications, including respiratory injuries. The currently employed detection technique (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or qRT-PCR) failed to meet this need at some point because it is costly, time-consuming, and requires higher expertise and technical skills. Polymer-based nanobiosensing techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations. Polymeric nanomaterials have the potential for clinical applications due to their versatile features like low cytotoxicity, biodegradability, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and specific delivery at the targeted site of action. In recent years, innovative polymeric nanomedicine approaches have been developed to deliver therapeutic agents and support tissue growth for the inflamed organs, including the lung. This review highlights the most recent advances of polymer-based nanomedicine approaches in infectious disease diagnosis and treatments. This paper also focuses on the potential of novel nanomedicine techniques that may prove to be therapeutically efficient in fighting against COVID-19 related respiratory injuries.","Rana, Md Mohosin",J Biomater Sci Polym Ed,,298

Twelve percent of patients were discharged at diagnosis having potentially unstable fractures. These were all upper limb fractures which may go onto mal-union. Twenty-nine percent of patients were discharged who would have normally had clinal or radiological follow-up. No patients had any long-term union follow-up. Virtual telemedicine clinics have been incredibly successful. The average satisfaction was 4.8/5. In only 6% of cases, the clinician felt a further face-to-face evaluation was required. Eighty-nine percent of patients would have chosen virtual follow-up under normal conditions. CONCLUSION: Lessons for the future include potentially large numbers of upper limb mal-unions which may be symptomatic. The non-union rate is likely to be the same, but these patients are unknown due to lack of late imaging. Telemedicine certainly has a role in future orthopaedic management as it is well tolerated and efficient and provides economic and environmental benefits to both clinicians and patients.","Dunkerley, Sarah; Thelwall, Claire; Omiawele, Joshua; Smith, Adam; Deo, Sunny; Lowdon, Ian",Int Orthop,,298
203913,Role of testosterone in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A key pathogenic factor and a biomarker for severe pneumonia,2021,"Native Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The present study explores whether areas with high percentages of Native American residents are experiencing the equal risks of contracting COVID-19 by examining how the relationships between structural inequalities and confirmed COVID-19 cases spatially vary across Arizona using a geographically weighted regression (GWR). GWR helps with the identification of areas with high confirmed COVID-19 cases in Arizona and with understanding of which predictors of social inequalities are associated with confirmed COVID-19 cases at specific locations. We find that structural inequality indicators and presence of Native Americans are significantly associated with higher confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the relationships between structural inequalities and confirmed COVID-19 cases are significantly stronger in areas with high concentration of Native Americans, particular on Tribal lands. The findings highlight the negative effects that lack of infrastructure (i.e., housing with plumbing, transportation, and accessible health communication) may have on individual and population health, and, in this case, associated with the increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases.","Yellow Horse, Aggie J; Yang, Tse-Chuan; Huyser, Kimberly R",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,298

A diagnosis of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) was made when the patients had an HScore greater than 169. Histopathological examinations were performed to confirm the presence of hemophagocytosis. Of 268 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 17 (6.3%) patients had an HScore greater than 169. All the 17 patients with sHLH died. The interval from the onset of symptom of COVID-19 to the time of a diagnosis of sHLH made was 19 days and the interval from the diagnosis of sHLH to death was 4 days. Ten (59%) patients were infected with only SARS-CoV-2. Hemophagocytosis in the spleen and the liver, as well as lymphocyte infiltration in the liver on histopathological examinations, was found in 3 sHLH autopsy patients. Mortality in sHLH patients with COVID-19 is high. And SARS-CoV-2 is a potential trigger for sHLH.

It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 CAP patients underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the segmentations of infections and lung fields. A set of handcrafted location-specific features was proposed to best capture the COVID-19 distribution pattern, in comparison to conventional CT severity score (CT-SS) and Radiomics features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method (iSARF) was used for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded best performance when using the handcrafted features with sensitivity of 91.6%, specificity of 86.8%, and accuracy of 89.8% over state-of-the-art classifiers. Additional test on 734 subjects with thick slice images demonstrates great generalizability. It is anticipated that our proposed framework could assist clinical decision making.

Here we report alterations in the plasma metabolome reflecting the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients with mild (ambulatory) diseases, moderate disease (radiologically confirmed pneumonitis, hospitalization and oxygen therapy), and critical disease (in intensive care). This analysis revealed major disease- and stage-associated shifts in the metabolome, meaning that at least 77 metabolites including amino acids, lipids, polyamines and sugars, as well as their derivatives, were altered in critical COVID-19 patient's plasma as compared to mild COVID-19 patients. Among a uniformly moderate cohort of patients who received tocilizumab, only 10 metabolites were different among individuals with a favorable evolution as compared to those who required transfer into the intensive care unit. The elevation of one single metabolite, anthranilic acid, had a poor prognostic value, correlating with the maintenance of high interleukin-10 and -18 levels. Given that products of the kynurenine pathway including anthranilic acid have immunosuppressive properties, we speculate on the therapeutic utility to inhibit the rate-limiting enzymes of this pathway including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase.","Danlos, François-Xavier; Grajeda-Iglesias, Claudia; Durand, Sylvère; Sauvat, Allan; Roumier, Mathilde; Cantin, Delphine; Colomba, Emeline; Rohmer, Julien; Pommeret, Fanny; Baciarello, Giulia; Willekens, Christophe; Vasse, Marc; Griscelli, Frank; Fahrner, Jean-Eudes; Goubet, Anne-Gaëlle; Dubuisson, Agathe; Derosa, Lisa; Nirmalathasan, Nitharsshini; Bredel, Delphine; Mouraud, Séverine; Pradon, Caroline; Stoclin, Annabelle; Rozenberg, Flore; Duchemin, Jérôme; Jourdi, Georges; Ellouze, Syrine; Levavasseur, Françoise; Albigès, Laurence; Soria, Jean-Charles; Barlesi, Fabrice; Solary, Eric; André, Fabrice; Pène, Frédéric; Ackerman, Félix; Mouthon, Luc; Zitvogel, Laurence; Marabelle, Aurélien; Michot, Jean-Marie; Fontenay, Michaela; Kroemer, Guido",Cell Death Dis,,298

We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after CS exposure with a lack of ABSC proliferation. Single-cell profiling of the cultures showed that the normal interferon response was reduced after CS exposure with infection. Treatment of CS-exposed ALI cultures with interferon ß-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting one potential mechanism for more severe viral infection.

In 2020, the devastating influences generated by the COVID-19 global pandemic had established high uncertainty in the manufacturers' capacity, which can hinder the fulfillment of such goals. To address such a problem, in this research, we analyze a two-echelon RSC, including a re-manufacturer who, despite facing the remanufacturing capacity uncertainty, remanufactures eligible obsolete products, then re-enters the marketplace, and a collector who accumulates eligible obsolete products from consumers. We survey centralized and decentralized decisions, and also a condition where the collector, as a Stackelberg game leader, offers a put option contract as a risk-sharing approach and decides on both option and exercise prices; in return, the re-manufacturer determines the order quantity. Contrary to previous studies in which the value of option contracts has been analyzed under demand disruptions, this paper aims to address the performance of a put option contract to mitigate the remanufacturing capacity uncertainty in an RSC. Our results demonstrate that by offering the put option contract and determining the option price as nearly low as the marginal refund cost, not only can the collector motivate the re-manufacturer to augment its order quantity but both parties also attain a win-win profit-sharing outcome. Besides, the customized put option contract can achieve Pareto-improving channel coordination in the condition of remanufacturing capacity uncertainty.","Bakhshi, Alireza; Heydari, Jafar",Ann Oper Res,,298
224388,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 among vaccinated health care workers,2021,"Background: The transition period from hospital to home is a highly vulnerable time for patients after stroke. COVID-19 restrictions have exacerbated safety concerns, stressed the health care system, and put patients at high risk after discharge. Here we describe pilot results from the Joint Stroke Transitional Technology-Enhanced Program (JSTTEP) designed to reduce post-stroke complications, avoid hospital readmission, and enhance recovery. Methods: JSTTEP is a novel, interprofessional program for patients discharged from the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Stroke Center. In the first weeks after hospital discharge, stroke patients complete a series of multidisciplinary telemedicine visits to (1) reduce the risks of adverse events in the transition from hospital to home, and (2) develop a plan to facilitate a full recovery. The first joint visit is with stroke neurology and physical therapy for risk mitigation, and the second is with physiatry and occupational therapy for a recovery plan. Patients and caregivers participate in an interactive, online group education session covering topics about vascular risk factor modification, nutrition, exercise, fall prevention, and self-management skills. Results: In the first 4 months of the program, 50 patients were enrolled. Average age was 61 years;26/50 (52%) were women, 23/50 (46%) were African American, and mean baseline NIHSS was 5.4. Of those 45/50 (90%) completed their visit, with 4/50 (8%) requiring conversion from video to phone visit. Unexpected 30-day hospital readmission rate was 3/50 (6%), one of whom was readmitted due to neurological issues identified during the JSTTEP appointment. Interpreter services were utilized for 5 completed video visits (Arabic, Mandarin, Spanish, Twi, Urdu). Patients reported the ability to include family members remotely in the visit as an advantage. Conclusions: The data demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefit of an interprofessionalstroke telemedicine program designed to enhance post-stroke recovery. JSTTEP increased accessto post-hospital care and reduced risks for adverse outcomes. The ongoing benefits and scaling ofsuch a clinic will rely on permanent legislative and insurance changes to support such a care model.","Bahouth, M.

226612,"Correlation Between 3790 Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-Positives Samples and Positive Cell Cultures, Including 1941 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Isolates",2021,"BACKGROUND: As one of the most essential technical components of the intensive care unit (ICU), continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters has significantly improved patient safety by alerting staff through an alarm when a parameter deviates from the normal range. However, the vast number of alarms regularly overwhelms staff and may induce alarm fatigue, a condition recently exacerbated by COVID-19 and potentially endangering patients. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on providing a complete and repeatable analysis of the alarm data of an ICU's patient monitoring system. We aimed to develop do-it-yourself (DIY) instructions for technically versed ICU staff to analyze their monitoring data themselves, which is an essential element for developing efficient and effective alarm optimization strategies. METHODS: This observational study was conducted using alarm log data extracted from the patient monitoring system of a 21-bed surgical ICU in 2019. DIY instructions were iteratively developed in informal interdisciplinary team meetings. The data analysis was grounded in a framework consisting of 5 dimensions, each with specific metrics: alarm load (eg, alarms per bed per day, alarm flood conditions, alarm per device and per criticality), avoidable alarms, (eg, the number of technical alarms), responsiveness and alarm handling (eg alarm duration), sensing (eg, usage of the alarm pause function), and exposure (eg, alarms per room type). Results were visualized using the R package ggplot2 to provide detailed insights into the ICU's alarm situation. RESULTS: We developed 6 DIY instructions that should be followed iteratively step by step. Alarm load metrics should be (re)defined before alarm log data are collected and analyzed. Intuitive visualizations of the alarm metrics should be created next and presented to staff in order to help identify patterns in the alarm data for designing and implementing effective alarm management interventions. We provide the script we used for the data preparation and an R-Markdown file to create comprehensive alarm reports. The alarm load in the respective ICU was quantified by 152.5 (SD 42.2) alarms per bed per day on average and alarm flood conditions with, on average, 69.55 (SD 31.12) per day that both occurred mostly in the morning shifts. Most alarms were issued by the ventilator, invasive blood pressure device, and electrocardiogram (ie, high and low blood pressure, high respiratory rate, low heart rate). The exposure to alarms per bed per day was higher in single rooms (26%, mean 172.9/137.2 alarms per day per bed). CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing ICU alarm log data provides valuable insights into the current alarm situation. Our results call for alarm management interventions that effectively reduce the number of alarms in order to ensure patient safety and ICU staff's work satisfaction. We hope our DIY instructions encourage others to follow suit in analyzing and publishing their ICU alarm data.","Poncette, Akira-Sebastian; Wunderlich, Maximilian Markus; Spies, Claudia; Heeren, Patrick; Vorderwülbecke, Gerald; Salgado, Eduardo; Kastrup, Marc; Feufel, Markus A; Balzer, Felix",J Med Internet Res,,298

We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 requires the lysosomal protein TMEM106B to infect human cell lines and primary lung cells. TMEM106B overexpression enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as pseudovirus infection, suggesting a role in viral entry. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-sequencing of airway cells from patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that TMEM106B expression correlates with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Compliance with the COVID-19 behavioral recommendations was measured through a 10-item survey measure. Results showed that immature DMs and internalizing personality traits (i.e., detachment, negative affect, psychoticism) were risk factors of DASSs. Furthermore, subjects with higher levels of DASSs appeared less compliant with the health measures recommended by the Italian government. Experts may use these results to identify and subsequently support (via the Internet) young subjects at greater risk of mental health problems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Biondi, S.; Casale, S.; Burrai, J.; Mazza, C.; Cavaggioni, G.; Ferracuti, S.; Giannini, A.

The development of this science depends on whether the public accept its application; therefore, predicting their intention to adopt it is important for its successful implementation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyse Malaysian stakeholders' intentions to adopt nutrigenomics, and determines the factors that influence their intentions. METHODS: A survey was conducted based on the responses of 421 adults (aged 18 years and older) and comprising two stakeholder groups: healthcare providers (n = 221) and patients (n = 200) who were located in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The SPSS software was used to analyse the descriptive statistics of intention to adopt nutrigenomics and the SmartPLS software was used to determine the predicting factors affecting their decisions to adopt nutrigenomics. RESULTS: The results show that the stakeholders perceived the benefits of nutrigenomics as outweighing its risks, suggesting that the perceived benefits represent the most important direct predictor of the intention to adopt nutrigenomics. The perceived risks of nutrigenomics, trust in key players, engagement with medical genetics and religiosity also predict the intention to adopt nutrigenomics. Additionally, the perceived benefits of nutrigenomics served as a mediator for four factors: perceived risks of nutrigenomics, engagement with medical genetics, trust in key players and religiosity, whilst the perceived risks were a mediator for engagement with medical genetics. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the intentions of Malaysian stakeholders to adopt nutrigenomics are a complex decision-making process where all the previously mentioned factors interact. Although the results showed that the stakeholders in Malaysia were highly positive towards nutrigenomics, they were also cautious about adopting it.","Mustapa, Muhammad Adzran Che; Amin, Latifah; Frewer, Lynn J",Genes Nutr,,298

Studies in the initial phase of the pandemic demonstrated that these patients tended to have a worse prognosis than patients without myocardial injury. We sought to evaluate the clinical impact of significant troponin elevation in COVID-19-positive patients, along with predictors of poor outcomes, over the span of the pandemic to date. METHODS: We analyzed COVID-19-positive patients who presented to the MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, DC, and Maryland) during the pandemic (March 1-June 30, 2020). We compared clinical course and outcomes based on the presence of troponin elevation and identified predictors of mortality. RESULTS: The cohort included 2716 COVID-19-positive admitted patients for whom troponin was drawn. Of these patients, 250 had troponin elevation (&#8805;1.0 ng/mL). In the troponin-elevation arm, the minimum troponin level was 1.9 ± 8.82 ng/mL; maximum elevation was 10.23 ± 31.07 ng/mL. The cohort's mean age was 68.0 ± 15.0 years; 52.8% were men. Most (68.5%) COVID-19-positive patients with troponin elevation were African American. Patients with troponin elevation tended to be older, with more co-morbidities, and most required mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (48.4%) in COVID-19-positive patients with concomitant troponin elevation than without troponin elevation (12.2%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with troponin elevation are at higher risk for mechanical ventilation and mortality. Efforts should focus on early recognition, evaluation, and intensifying care of these patients.","Case, Brian C; Yerasi, Charan; Forrestal, Brian J; Shea, Corey; Rappaport, Hank; Medranda, Giorgio A; Zhang, Cheng; Abramowitz, Jonathan; Satler, Lowell F; Ben-Dor, Itsik; Hashim, Hayder; Rogers, Toby; Waksman, Ron",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,298

Despite its close phylogenetic relationship to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits increased human-to-human transmission dynamics, likely due to efficient early replication in the upper respiratory epithelium of infected individuals. Since different temperatures encountered in the human upper and lower respiratory tract (33°C and 37°C, respectively) have been shown to affect the replication kinetics of several respiratory viruses, as well as host innate immune response dynamics, we investigated the impact of temperature on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection using the primary human airway epithelial cell culture model. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated to higher titers when infections were performed at 33°C rather than 37°C. Although both viruses were highly sensitive to type I and type III interferon pretreatment, a detailed time-resolved transcriptome analysis revealed temperature-dependent interferon and pro-inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 that were inversely proportional to its replication efficiency at 33°C or 37°C. These data provide crucial insight on pivotal virus-host interaction dynamics and are in line with characteristic clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, as well as their respective transmission efficiencies.","V039,; kovski, Philip; Gultom, Mitra; Kelly, Jenna N; Steiner, Silvio; Russeil, Julie; Mangeat, Bastien; Cora, Elisa; Pezoldt, Joern; Holwerda, Melle; Kratzel, Annika; Laloli, Laura; Wider, Manon; Portmann, Jasmine; Tran, Thao; Ebert, Nadine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Hartmann, Rune; Gardeux, Vincent; Alpern, Daniel; Deplancke, Bart; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald",PLoS Biol,,298

The enforcement of isolation has consequences that may affect the lifestyle-related behavior of the general population. Quarantine encompasses a range of strategies that can be used to detain, isolate, or conditionally release individuals or populations infected or exposed to contagious diseases and should be tailored to circumstances. Interestingly, medical students may represent an example of how the COVID-19 pandemic can form new habits and change lifestyle behaviors. We conducted a web-based survey to assess changes in lifestyle-related behavior of self-isolated medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then we analyzed the sanitary-hygienic regulations of the Russian Federation to determine the requirements for healthy buildings. Results showed that during the pandemic, the enforcement of isolation affects medical students' lifestyle-related behavior and accompanies an increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and healthy buildings are cutting-edge factors in preventing COVID-19 and NCDs. The Russian sanitary-hygienic regulations support improving this factor with suitable requirements for ventilation, sewage, waste management, and disinfection.

However, the relative efficiency of social distancing against COVID-19 remains controversial, since social distancing and isolation/quarantine were implemented almost at the same time in China. METHODS: In this study, surveillance data of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in the year 2018-2020 were used to quantify the relative efficiency of NPIs against COVID-19 in China, since isolation/quarantine was not used for the influenza epidemics. Given that the relative age-dependent susceptibility to influenza and COVID-19 may vary, an age-structured Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model was built to explore the efficiency of social distancing against COVID-19 under different population susceptibility scenarios. RESULTS: The mean effective reproductive number, Rt, of COVID-19 before NPIs was 2.12 (95% confidential interval (CI): 2.02-2.21). By March 11, 2020, the overall reduction in Rt of COVID-19 was 66.1% (95% CI: 60.1%-71.2%). In the epidemiological year 2019/20, influenza transmissibility reduced by 34.6% (95% CI: 31.3%-38.2%) compared with that in the epidemiological year 2018/19. Under the observed contact patterns changes in China, social distancing had similar efficiency against COVID-19 in three different scenarios. By assuming same efficiency of social distancing against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 transmission, isolation/quarantine and social distancing could lead to a 48.1% (95% CI: 35.4%-58.1%) and 34.6% (95% CI: 31.3%-38.2%) reduction of the transmissibility of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Though isolation/quarantine is more effective than social distancing, given that typical basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is 2-3, isolation/quarantine alone could not contain the COVID-19 pandemic effectively in China.","Lei, Hao; Wu, Xifeng; Wang, Xiao; Xu, Modi; Xie, Yu; Du, Xiangjun; Cowling, Benjamin J; Li, Yuguo; Shu, Yuelong",Clin. infect. dis,,298

Emerging adults with pre-existing mood or anxiety disorders were of concern for worsening symptoms. We sought to demonstrate a method for monitoring mental health status of a group of patients with reduced access to their usual mental health services during quarantine. METHODS: A total of 326 patients enrolled in the First-Episode Mood and Anxiety Program in London, Ontario, Canada were invited to participate in online questionnaires regularly. Patients were flagged for high level of risk based on depression scores, suicidal ideation and worsening in anxiety, depression or quality of health. All patients were also asked if they wanted contact with a clinician. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen (35%) patients completed at least one questionnaire. Thirty were flagged based on scores; 37 (32.5%) participating patients requested help. Participants who were flagged for concerning scores were younger, more likely to be on the wait list for treatment, to have been laid off from work and have more functional impairment. Participants requesting support had higher symptom scores for depression and lower scores on quality of health. CONCLUSIONS: The process utilized here identified patients at risk and in need of clinical support in the context of pandemic quarantine. It provided an accessible avenue for invited patients to communicate both symptom status and need for contact. Such a process can provide valuable monitoring during times when the usual communications between patients and health care providers is compromised and clinician time is limited.

We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under ""mitigation"" to modelled events under ""no mitigation"" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at £20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses. RESULTS: The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, £33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and £1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at £20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to £1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total £3075 GDP loss.Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory analysis indicates the benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.","Thom, Howard; Walker, Josephine; Vickerman, Peter; Hollingworth, Will",Eur. j. public health,,298

This lesser reduction was probably due to local factors, but also to a conscious decision to avoid total collapse of our surgical services.","Waters, R; Dey, R; Laubscher, M; Dunn, R; Maqungo, S; McCollum, G; Nortje, M; Roche, S; Hilton, T; Held, M",S Afr Med J,,298

Using survey data on 882 Montreal residents, we find that those who practice urban agriculture are more educated, and more likely to be homeowners and to report an income in the highest income bracket. This is consistent with urban agriculture being a luxury good.","Bellemare, M. F.; Dusoruth, V.",Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,,298

Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing solutions are important to contain the spreads of COVID-19-like infectious diseases. However, current contact tracing solutions are fragmented with limited use of sensing technologies and centered on monitoring the interactions between individuals without an analytical framework for evaluating effectiveness. Therefore, we need to first explore generic architecture for contact tracing in the context of today's Internet of Things (IoT) technologies based on a broad range of applicable sensors. A new architecture for IoT based solutions to contact tracing is proposed and its overall effectiveness for disease containment is analyzed based on the traditional epidemiological models with the simulation results. The proposed work aims to provide a framework for assisting future designs and evaluation of IoT-based contact tracing solutions and to enable data-driven collective efforts on combating current and future infectious diseases.","Hu, Peng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01902v1.pdf,298

287364,Logistic advantage of two-step screening strategy for SARS-CoV-2 at airport quarantine,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Online open book assessment has been a common alternative to a traditional invigilated test or examination during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its unsupervised nature increases ease of cheating, which is an academic integrity concern. This study's purpose was to evaluate the integrity of two online open book assessments with different formats (1. Tightly time restricted - 50 min for mid-semester and 2. Take home - any 4 h within a 24-h window for end of semester) implemented in a radiologic pathology unit of a Bachelor of Science (Medical Radiation Science) course during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving a review and analysis of existing information related to the integrity of the two radiologic pathology assessments. Three integrity evaluation approaches were employed. The first approach was to review all the Turnitin plagiarism detection software reports with use of 'seven-words-in-a-row' criterion to identify any potential collusion. The second approach was to search for highly irrelevant assessment answers during marking for detection of other cheating types. Examples of highly irrelevant answers included those not addressing question requirements and stating patients' clinical information not from given patient histories. The third approach was an assessment score statistical analysis through descriptive and inferential statistics to identify any abnormal patterns that might suggest cheating occurred. An abnormal pattern example was high assessment scores. The descriptive statistics used were minimum, maximum, range, first quartile, median, third quartile, interquartile range, mean, standard deviation, fail and full mark rates. T-test was employed to compare mean scores between the two assessments in this year (2020), between the two assessments in the last year (2019), between the two mid-semester assessments in 2019 and 2020, and between this and last years' end of semester assessments. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: No cheating evidence was found in all Turnitin reports and assessment answers. The mean scores of the end of semester assessments in 2019 (88.2%) and 2020 (90.9%) were similar (p = 0.098). However, the mean score of the online open book mid-semester assessment in 2020 (62.8%) was statistically significantly lower than that of the traditional invigilated mid-semester assessment in 2019 (71.8%) with p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: This study shows the use of the online open book assessments with tight time restrictions and the take home formats in the radiologic pathology unit did not have any academic integrity issues. Apparently, the strict assessment time limit played an important role in maintaining their integrity.","Ng, Curtise Kin Cheung",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,,298
287915,Evaluating use cases for human challenge trials in accelerating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development,2020,"BACKGROUND: Care homes are vulnerable to widespread transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with poor outcomes for staff and residents. Infection control interventions in care homes need to not only be effective in containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but also feasible to implement in this special setting which is both a healthcare institution and a home. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 via contacts between individuals, including residents, staff members, and visitors in a care home setting. We explored a representative care home in Scotland in our base case and explore other care home setups in an uncertainty analysis. We evaluated the effectiveness of a range of intervention strategies in controlling the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the presence of the reference interventions that have been implemented in many care homes, including testing of new admissions, isolation of symptomatic residents, and restricted public visiting, routine testing of staff appears to be the most effective and practical approach. Routine testing of residents is no more effective as a reference strategy while routine testing of both staff and residents only shows a negligible additive effect. Modeling results are very sensitive to transmission probability per contact, but the qualitative finding is robust to varying parameter values in our uncertainty analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predictions suggest that routine testing should target staff in care homes in conjunction with adherence to strict hand hygiene and using personal protective equipment to reduce risk of transmission per contact.","Nguyen, Le L K; Howick, Susan; McLafferty, Dennis; Anderson, Gillian H; Pravinkumar, Sahaya J; Van Der Meer, Robert; Megiddo, Itamar",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,298

OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown in Israel between March 15, 2020, and April 30, 2020, on the incidence of home epinephrine-treated reactions. METHODS: All patients who were in the up-dosing phase of OIT for greater than or equal to 1 month during the lockdown, or a respective period in years 2015 to 2019, were studied. The incidence of home-epinephrine treated reactions during the 2020 lockdown was compared with that in the respective period in 2015 to 2019 and to periods before and after the lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 1163 OIT treatments were analyzed. Two epinephrine injections occurred during 2020 (0.7%) compared with 29 injections (3.28%) during 2015 to 2019 (P = .03). Patients treated in 2020 were older (8.1 vs 7 years, P < .01) and had a significantly lower single highest tolerated dose (12 vs 20 mg protein, P < .01). The rate of milk-OIT was lower (P = .01), but the total number of milk treatments was higher (99 vs 71 to 82) in 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019. On multivariate analysis, treatments during the 2020 lockdown were performed in older patients (P = .001), primarily for nonmilk (P = .03), began with a lower single highest tolerated dose (P = .006), and were associated with significantly less home epinephrine-treated reactions (P = .05) compared with those in 2015 to 2019. Patients treated in 2020 experienced more epinephrine-treated reactions in adjacent periods before (n = 8) and after (n = 6) the lockdown. CONCLUSION: The lower rate of home epinephrine-treated reactions during the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown in Israel suggests that potentially avoidable triggers contribute significantly to the rate of adverse reactions during OIT.","Nachshon, Liat; Goldberg, Michael R; Levy, Michael B; Epstein-Rigbi, Naama; Koren, Yael; Elizur, Arnon",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,,298
291265,Infectious chicken bronchitis: the cause of respiratory syndrome in broiler chickens,2020,"The 2019 emergence of, SARS-CoV-2 has tragically taken an immense toll on human life and far reaching impacts on society. There is a need to identify effective antivirals with diverse mechanisms of action in order to accelerate preclinical development. This study focused on five of the most established drug target proteins for direct acting small molecule antivirals: Nsp5 Main Protease, Nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Nsp13 Helicase, Nsp16 2'-O methyltransferase and the S2 subunit of the Spike protein. A workflow of solvent mapping and free energy calculations was used to identify and characterize favorable small-molecule binding sites for an aromatic pharmacophore (benzene). After identifying the most favorable sites, calculated ligand efficiencies were compared utilizing computational fragment screening. The most favorable sites overall were located on Nsp12 and Nsp16, whereas the most favorable sites for Nsp13 and S2 Spike had comparatively lower ligand efficiencies relative to Nsp12 and Nsp16. Utilizing fragment screening on numerous possible sites on Nsp13 helicase, we identified a favorable allosteric site on the N-terminal zinc binding domain (ZBD) that may be amenable to virtual or biophysical fragment screening efforts. Recent structural studies of the Nsp12:Nsp13 replication-transcription complex experimentally corroborates ligand binding at this site, which is revealed to be a functional Nsp8:Nsp13 protein-protein interaction site in the complex. Detailed structural analysis of Nsp13 ZBD conformations show the role of induced-fit flexibility in this ligand binding site and identify which conformational states are associated with efficient ligand binding. We hope that this map of over 200 possible small-molecule binding sites for these drug targets may be of use for ongoing discovery, design, and drug repurposing efforts. This information may be used to prioritize screening efforts or aid in the process of deciphering how a screening hit may bind to a specific target protein.","Freidel, Matthew R; Armen, Roger S",PLoS One,,298
292001,Group Testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 to Enable Rapid Scale-up of Testing and Real-Time Surveillance of Incidence,2020,"Respiratory failure in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection appears related to cytokine release syndrome that often results in mechanical ventilation (MV). We investigated the role of tocilizumab (TCZ) on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trends and MV in patients with SARS-CoV-2. In this longitudinal observational study, 112 patients were evaluated from 1 February to 31 May 2020. TCZ was administered followed by methylprednisolone to patients with >3L oxygen requirement and pneumonia severity index score &#8804;130 with computed tomography scan changes. IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and procalcitonin were monitored on days 0, 3, and 6 of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed with significance &#8804;0.05. Eighty out of 112 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (45 males, 56.96%; 34 females, 43.04%) were included in this study. Seven patients expired (8.75%) and nine patients required MV (11.25%). Median IL-6 levels pre-administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25-666.25) pg/mL compared with post-administration on day 3 (563; 162-783) pg/mL (P < .00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50-678.50) pg/mL compared with day 3 (P = .709). CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels were reduced after TCZ therapy. Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels. The sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. IL-6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool.","Antony, Suresh J; Davis, Michelle A; Davis, Monique G; Almaghlouth, Nouf K; Guevara, Roberto; Omar, Fahad; Del Rey, Fernando; Hassan, Ali; Arian, Muhammad U; Antony, Nishaal; Prakash, Bharat V",J Med Virol,,298
293418,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vaginal swabs of women with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection: a prospective study,2021,"Emergency situations have been associated with negative psychological adjustment outcomes in healthcare professionals, although studies on the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic amongst Italian health workers are limited. The main aim of this study was to investigate the psychological adjustment of healthcare professionals during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating differences according to working or not with patients affected by COVID-19 and in areas with a more severe spread of this pandemic. Healthcare professionals' attitudes toward psychological support were analyzed. The levels of anxiety, depression, psychological stress, and professional quality of life (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and compassion fatigue) and attitudes toward psychological support were measured among 627 Italian healthcare workers (mean age = 40.55 years; SD = 11.49; range: 27-72). Significantly higher levels of stress, burnout, secondary trauma, anxiety, and depression were observed among professionals working with COVID-19 patients. Higher levels of stress and burnout and lower levels of compassion satisfaction were detected in professionals working in areas with higher rates of contagion. No interaction effects were found between working (or not) with patients affected by COVID-19 and working (or not) in areas with a more severe diffusion of this pandemic. Finally, in the group of professionals who worked with COVID-19 patients, the percentage of professionals who thought to ask for psychological support was twice that of the group that did not work with COVID-19 patients. The overall findings indicate that the mental health of frontline healthcare workers requires further consideration and that targeted prevention and intervention programs are necessary.","Trumello, Carmen; Bramanti, Sonia Monique; Ballarotto, Giulia; Candelori, Carla; Cerniglia, Luca; Cimino, Silvia; Crudele, Monia; Lombardi, Lucia; Pignataro, Silvia; Viceconti, Maria Luisa; Babore, Alessandra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,298

METHODS: This study used data from the Global COVID-19 Index provided by PEMANDU Associates. The sample, representing 161 countries, comprised the number of confirmed cases, deaths, stringency indices, population density and GNI per capita (USD). Correlation matrices were computed to reveal the association between the variables at three time points: day-30, day-60 and day-90. Three separate principal component analyses were computed for similar time points, and several standardized plots were produced. RESULTS: Confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 showed positive but weak correlation with stringency and GNI per capita. Through principal component analysis, the first two principal components captured close to 70% of the variance of the data. The first component can be viewed as the severity of the COVID-19 surge in countries, whereas the second component largely corresponded to population density, followed by GNI per capita of countries. Multivariate visualization of the two dominating principal components provided a standardized comparison of the situation in the161 countries, performed on day-30, day-60 and day-90 since the first confirmed cases in countries worldwide. CONCLUSION: Visualization of the global spread of COVID-19 showed the unequal severity of the pandemic across continents and over time. Distinct patterns in clusters of countries, which separated many European countries from those in Africa, suggested a contrast in terms of stringency measures and wealth of a country. The African continent appeared to fare better in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the burden of mortality in the first 90 days. A noticeable worsening trend was observed in several countries in the same relative time frame of the disease's first 90 days, especially in the United States of America.","Teh, Jane K L; Bradley, David A; Chook, Jack Bee; Lai, Kee Huong; Ang, Woo Teck; Teo, Kok Lay; Peh, Suat-Cheng",PLoS One,,298
297900,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Pediatric Department in Milan: A Logistic Rather Than a Clinical Emergency,2020,"Telemedicine programs are particularly suited to evaluating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders, primarily because much of the physical exam findings are visual. Telemedicine uses information and communication technologist to overcome geographical barriers and increase access to healthcare services, and it is particularly beneficial for rural and underserved communities, groups that traditionally suffer from lack of access to healthcare. There is a growing evidence of the feasibility of telemedicine, cost and time savings, patients' and physicians' satisfaction, and its outcome and impact on patients' morbidity and quality of life. In addition, given the unusual current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has offered the opportunity to address the ongoing healthcare needs of patients with PD, to reduce in-person clinic visits, and human exposures (among healthcare workers and patients) to a range of infectious diseases including COVID-19. However, there are still several challenges to widespread implementation of telemedicine including the limited performance of parts of the neurological exam, limited technological savvy, fear of loss of a personal connection, or uneasiness about communicating sensitive information. On the other hand, while we are facing the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic, patients and clinicians are gaining increasing experience with telemedicine, facilitating equity of access to specialized multidisciplinary care for PD.

304096,Estimating asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in a geographic area of low disease incidence,2021,"INTRODUCTION: New Zealand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most restrictive lockdowns of any country, inevitably causing stress for many people. Because situations that increase stress and anxiety are associated with higher smoking prevalence, we examined self-reported smoking before and during the lockdown, and analyzed factors associated with reported changes in cigarette consumption. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown; the final, weighted sample included 261 daily smokers and 71 weekly smokers. We measured psychological distress and anxiety, as well as situational factors, tobacco consumption, and demographic attributes. RESULTS: Nearly half of daily smokers reported smoking more during than before the lockdown, on average, an increase of six cigarettes a day; increased daily cigarette consumption was associated with loneliness and isolation. Most weekly smokers reported either that their smoking during the lockdown had not changed or had slightly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation services need to anticipate that unexpected disruptions, such as pandemic lockdowns, may be associated with increased daily tobacco consumption, and that this increase may be sustained after lockdown. While public health responses to pandemics predictably focus on immediate and obvious consequences, interventions to support recent quitters and those making quit attempts should also form a key component of pandemic planning. IMPLICATIONS: As governments introduce unprecedented measures to manage COVID-19, they need also to consider other public health risks, such as increased smoking among current smokers or relapse among recent quitters. Evidence that loneliness was associated with increased smoking during a lockdown suggests a need for cessation out-reach strategies that promote and support smoke-free practices.","Gendall, Philip; Hoek, Janet; Stanley, James; Jenkins, Mathew; Every-Palmer, Susanna",Nicotine tob. res,,298

Engineered heteroplasmic mice with nonpathological mtDNA variants reveal a nonrandom tissue-specific mtDNA segregation pattern, with few tissues that do not show segregation. The driving force for this dynamic complex pattern has remained unexplained for decades, challenging our understanding of this fundamental biological problem and hindering clinical planning for inherited diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the nonrandom mtDNA segregation is an intracellular process based on organelle selection. This cell type-specific decision arises jointly from the impact of mtDNA haplotypes on the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and the cell metabolic requirements and is strongly sensitive to the nuclear context and to environmental cues.","Lechuga-Vieco, Ana Victoria; Latorre-Pellicer, Ana; Johnston, Iain G; Prota, Gennaro; Gileadi, Uzi; Justo-Méndez, Raquel; Acín-Pérez, Rebeca; Martínez-de-Mena, Raquel; Fernández-Toro, Jose María; Jimenez-Blasco, Daniel; Mora, Alfonso; Nicolás-Ávila, Jose A; Santiago, Demetrio J; Priori, Silvia G; Bolaños, Juan Pedro; Sabio, Guadalupe; Criado, Luis Miguel; Ruíz-Cabello, Jesús; Cerundolo, Vincenzo; Jones, Nick S; Enríquez, José Antonio",Sci.

We collected self-reported signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and compared this with serology results from two SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (Roche Elecsys® and EUROIMMUN). RESULTS: Between 01 and 26 June, we recruited 2847 individuals (Stream A: 1,247, Stream B: 1,546 and Stream C: 154). Amongst those without previous positive PCR tests, 687/2,579 (26%) reported belief they had COVID-19, having experienced compatible symptoms; however, only 208 (30.3%) of these were seropositive on both immunoassays. Both immunoassays had high sensitivities relative to previous PCR positivity (>93%); there was also limited decline in antibody titres up to 110 days post symptom onset. Symptomatic but seronegative individuals had differing symptom profiles and shorter illnesses than seropositive individuals.

320012,Systematic SARS-CoV-2 screening at hospital admission in children:a French prospective multicenter study,2020,"PURPOSEIn a prior study, we examined data from six US states during Summer 2020, and found that prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p<.00001) as was a prevalence-related measure: Number of cases observed / Number of cases expected (p<.005). We now extended our study to more states in Fall 2020 to confirm the prevalence relationships we found previously. Vaccines were still not available as of Fall 2020. Presumably, the SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating at the time was the wild-type lineage since no variants were reported in the US until the end of December 2020. METHODSWe examined data from 19 U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and a prevalence-related measure: [Number of cases observed in a given age group] / [Number of cases expected in the age group based on population demographics]. RESULTSIn 16 of the 19 states, we found that: (1) prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p-values ranged from p<0.00001 to p = 0.0175; (2) the ratio of cases observed to cases expected was significantly greater in adolescents and youth than in older adults (p-values ranging from p< 0.00001 to p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONSOur results are consistent with our previous study in Summer 2020. The finding of lower prevalence in older adults cannot be attributed to access to vaccination since our data are from Fall 2020 when vaccinations were not yet available. Our findings with the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain are consistent with the findings currently being reported in the UK for the delta variant. In both studies, prevalence in adolescents and youth exceeded that in older adults. The UK findings are more pronounced perhaps because that study transpired following months of vaccinations of older adults whereas ours occurred before vaccinations were available.","Rumain, Barbara T; Schneiderman, Moshe; Geliebter, Allan",,,298

Sera from acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients exhibited a 3-fold reduction in binding antibody titers to the B.1.351 variant receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and a 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant compared to the B.1 variant. Similar results were seen with sera from Moderna-vaccinated individuals. Despite reduced antibody titers against the B.1.351 variant, sera from infected and vaccinated individuals containing polyclonal antibodies to the spike protein could still neutralize SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, suggesting that protective humoral immunity may be retained against this variant.","Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Norwood, Carson; Floyd, Katharine; Lai, Lilin; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E; Hudson, William H; Mantus, Grace; Nyhoff, Lindsay E; Adelman, Max W; Fineman, Rebecca; Patel, Shivan; Byram, Rebecca; Gomes, Dumingu Nipuni; Michael, Garett; Abdullahi, Hayatu; Beydoun, Nour; Panganiban, Bernadine; McNair, Nina; Hellmeister, Kieffer; Pitts, Jamila; Winters, Joy; Kleinhenz, Jennifer; Usher, Jacob; O039,; Keefe, James B; Piantadosi, Anne; Waggoner, Jesse J; Babiker, Ahmed; Stephens, David S; Anderson, Evan J; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Rouphael, Nadine; Ahmed, Rafi; Wrammert, Jens; Suthar, Mehul S",Cell Host Microbe,,298

While the acceptance of e-learning tools was slightly declining before the Covid-19 outbreak, it is to be assumed that the demand for digital offers will rather increase. Despite some reluctant reactions, it can be assumed that the current situation will have a positive effect on digital innovations in university teaching in Germany due to the pressure of the crisis, the great commitment of many teachers, and raised expectations.","Zawacki-Richter, Olaf",,,298

327511,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in adults in Madrid, Spain",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogenic agent of COVID-19, which has evolved into a global pandemic. Compared with some other respiratory RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is a poor inducer of type I interferon (IFN). Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), suppresses host antiviral responses. SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 attenuated Sendai virus (SeV)- or poly(I:C)-induced IFN-ß promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited IFN promoter activation triggered by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, and IRF3 overexpression. Nsp12 did not impair IRF3 phosphorylation but suppressed the nuclear translocation of IRF3. Mutational analyses suggested that this suppression was not dependent on the polymerase activity of nsp12. Given these findings, our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can antagonize host antiviral innate immunity and thus provides insights into viral pathogenesis.","Wang, Wenjing; Zhou, Zhuo; Xiao, Xia; Tian, Zhongqin; Dong, Xiaojing; Wang, Conghui; Li, Li; Ren, Lili; Lei, Xiaobo; Xiang, Zichun; Wang, Jianwei",Cell Mol Immunol,,298
327512,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in adults in Madrid, Spain",2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted health care systems worldwide. This is due to both to the reallocation of resources toward COVID-19 patients as well as concern for the risk of nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. The interruption of routine care is especially problematic for patients with chronic conditions requiring regular follow-up, such as lung transplant (LTx) recipients. Introduction: New methods such as telemedicine are needed to bridge the gap in follow-up care caused by the pandemic. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of video consultations (VCs) in comparison with on-site visits (OSVs) was performed during a 6-week period in an LTx center in Germany. VC included a structured work-up questionnaire and vital sign documentation. Results: During the 6-week study period, 75 VCs were performed for 53 patients and 75 OSVs by 51 patients occurred. By the end of our study period, 77% of physician-patient contacts occurred through VC. Physician-patient consultations were reduced by 47% compared with the equivalent time frame in 2019. In 62% of cases, VC resulted in a concrete clinical decision. One COVID-19 patient in home quarantine was admitted due to respiratory failure detected by VC. Patient satisfaction with VC was high. Discussion: Implementation of VC helped to reduce the need for OSV and thus the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in our patient cohort. This technology can be adopted to provide care for a wide range of chronic illnesses. Conclusions: VC can preserve access to specialist care while reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure for patients with chronic illnesses during the pandemic.","Kayser, Moritz Z; Valtin, Christina; Greer, Mark; Karow, Bernd; Fuge, Jan; Gottlieb, Jens",Telemed. j. e. health,,298
328257,Assessment of risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 experimental human infection studies,2020,"Introduction: Pregnant patients with a severe form of COVID-19 are at increased risk of maternal and fetal complications. Nitric Oxide (NO) gas is a selective pulmonary vasodilator currently approved to treat newborns with pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled NO has been safely used in patients with severe pneumonia and for cases of pregnant patients with pulmonary hypertension. The antimicrobial effect of NO has been confirmed against bacteria and viruses. In vitro study demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of NO against SARS-CoV-1 and 2. We hypothesize that breathing NO at 160-200 ppm twice daily for 30 minutes in spontaneously breathing pregnant patients might provide a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 6 pregnant patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treated with inhaled NO. Nitric Oxide was delivered at 160- 200 ppm for 30 minutes twice daily until resolution of respiratory symptoms or negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV- 2. Demographic and clinical data were collected to assess cardiopulmonary function and safety during the treatment. For safety, we focused on the values of blood methemoglobin (MetHb) and inhaled Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Data regarding newborn delivery and health, and 28 days outcomes of mothers and babies were collected. Results: Six pregnant patients were admitted with a severe (2 patients) or critical (4 patients) form of COVID-19 and received inhaled NO therapy between April and June 2020. Two pregnant patients were in the second trimester, while 4 were in the third trimester. A total of 39 treatments were administered. No adverse events were reported relating to NO administration. MetHb peaked at 2.5% (1.95%-3%, safety limit =5%) and inhaled NO2 remained below the safety limit of 2ppm. The patients remained hemodynamically stable;cardiac ultrasound performed in three patients did not detect any rebound pulmonary hypertension after NO interruption. Oxygen saturation improved in hypoxemic patients after the initiation of NO (Figure-1). All patients experienced a reduction in respiratory rate (by a median 4.5breaths/min after NO initiation). Three patients delivered a total of 4 babies (negative for SARS-CoV-2) while the other 3 remained pregnant after hospitalization (gestational age 22-26-33weeks) with normal follow-ups. Five mothers out of 6 tested negative for COVID-19 28 days after hospitalization. Conclusion: Nitric oxide gas at 160-200 ppm was safely administered to pregnant patients with severe-critical COVID-19, improved oxygenation and reduced respiratory rate in all 6 patients. The clinical effectiveness shown suggests inhaled high dose NO as a therapeutic novel therapy for COVID-19 in pregnancy.","Safaee Fakhr, B.; Wiegand, S.; Pinciroli, R.; Gianni, S.; Morais, C.

332092,An ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR method using the PCR1100 to detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2,2020,"PURPOSE: Because of the anticipated surge in cases requiring intensive care unit admission, the high aerosol-generating risk of tracheal intubation, and the specific requirements in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients, a dedicated Mobile Endotracheal Rapid Intubation Team (MERIT) was formed to ensure that a highly skilled team would be deployed to manage the airways of this cohort of patients. Here, we report our intubation team experience and activity as well as patient outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The MERIT members followed a protocolized early tracheal intubation model. Over a seven-week period during the peak of the pandemic, prospective data were collected on MERIT activity, COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis in the team members, and demographic, procedural, and clinical outcomes of patients. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 150 primary tracheal intubation episodes, with 101 (67.3%) of those occurring in men, and with a mean (standard deviation) age of 55.7 (13.8) yr. Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups accounted for 55.7% of patients. 91.3% of tracheal intubations were performed with videolaryngoscopy, and the first pass success rate was 88.0%. The 30-day survival was 69.2%, and the median [interquartile range] length of critical care stay was 11 [6-20] days and of hospital stay was 12 [7-22] days. Seven (11.1%) MERIT healthcare professionals self-isolated because of COVID-19 symptoms, with a total 41 days of clinical work lost. There was one reported incident of a breach of personal protective equipment and multiple anecdotal reports of doffing breaches. CONCLUSION: We have shown that a highly skilled designated intubation team, following a protocolized, early tracheal intubation model may be beneficial in improving patient and staff safety, and could be considered by other institutions in future pandemic surges.","Ahmad, Imran; Jeyarajah, Jeyanjali; Nair, Ganeshkrishna; Ragbourne, Sophie C; Vowles, Benjamin; Wong, Danny J N; El-Boghdadly, Kariem",Can. j. anaesth,,298

Delayed presentations, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, coronary artery dilation/aneurysms, and late myocarditis, may occur in the weeks after the acute infection. These delayed presentations commonly test negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via polymerase chain reaction testing and are thought to be primarily postviral hyperinflammatory sequelae. The long-term consequences of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are unknown. Most recommendations for cardiac management are based on known conditions that are similar. For example, coronary aneurysms can be managed under Kawasaki disease guidelines. Similarly, for patients with COVID-19 myocarditis, they can be cleared for sports under protocols for other types of myocarditis. There is concern for cardiac involvement as a subclinical entity even in more minor presentations. Several expert algorithms have been developed for clearing competition athletes to return to exercise. Sports clearance should be individualized considering the severity of disease, age of patient, and performance level of the sport.

337940,Post-outbreak serological screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers at a Swedish University Hospital,2021,"BACKGROUND: From late February 2020, English care homes rapidly adapted their practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to accommodating new guidelines and policies, staff had to adjust to rapid reconfiguration of services external to the home that they would normally depend upon for support. This study examined the complex interdependencies of support as staff responded to COVID-19. The aim was to inform more effective responses to the ongoing pandemic, and to improve understanding of how to work with care home staff and organisations after the pandemic has passed. METHODS: Ten managers of registered care homes in the East Midlands of England were interviewed by videoconference or phone about their experiences of the crisis from a structured organisational perspective. Analysis used an adapted organisational framework analysis approach with a focus on social ties and interdependencies between organisations and individuals. RESULTS: Three key groups of interdependencies were identified: care processes and practice; resources; and governance. Care home staff had to deliver care in innovative ways, making high stakes decisions in circumstances defined by: fluid ties to organisations outside the care home; multiple, sometimes conflicting, sources of expertise and information; and a sense of deprioritisation by authorities. Organisational responses to the pandemic by central government resulted in resource constraints and additional work, and sometimes impaired the ability of staff and managers to make decisions. Local communities, including businesses, third-sector organisations and individuals, were key in helping care homes overcome challenges. Care homes, rather than competing, were found to work together to provide mutual support. Resilience in the system was a consequence of dedicated and resourceful staff using existing local networks, or forging new ones, to overcome barriers to care. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified how interdependency between care home organisations, the surrounding community, and key statutory and non-statutory organisations beyond their locality, shaped decision making and care delivery during the pandemic. Recognising these interdependencies, and the expertise shown by care home managers and staff as they navigate them, is key to providing effective healthcare in care homes as the pandemic progresses, and as the sector recovers afterwards.","Marshall, Fiona; Gordon, Adam; Gladman, John R F; Bishop, Simon",BMC Geriatr,,298

Participants included 27â¯700 University of Utah Health faculty, staff, and trainees who received a survey invitation. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included experiences of COVID-19 and their associations with career development, work culture, and childcare needs. Results: A total of 5030 participants completed the entire survey (mean [SD] age, 40 [12] years); 3738 (75%) were women; 4306 (86%) were White or European American; 561 (11%) were Latino or Latina (of any race), Black or African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and 301 (6%) were Asian or Asian American. Of the participants, 2545 (51%) reported having clinical responsibilities, 2412 (48%) had at least 1 child aged 18 years or younger, 3316 (66%) were staff, 791 (16%) were faculty, and 640 (13%) were trainees. Nearly one-half of parents reported that parenting (1148 participants [49%]) and managing virtual education for children (1171 participants [50%]) were stressors. Across all participants, 1061 (21%) considered leaving the workforce, and 1505 (30%) considered reducing hours. Four hundred forty-nine faculty (55%) and 397 trainees (60%) perceived decreased productivity, and 2334 participants (47%) were worried about COVID-19 impacting their career development, with 421 trainees (64%) being highly concerned. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of 5030 faculty, staff, and trainees of a US health system, many participants with caregiving responsibilities, particularly women, faculty, trainees, and (in a subset of cases) those from racial/ethnic groups that underrepresented in medicine, considered leaving the workforce or reducing hours and were worried about their career development related to the pandemic. It is imperative that medical centers support their employees and trainees during this challenging time.","Delaney, Rebecca K; Locke, Amy; Pershing, Mandy L; Geist, Claudia; Clouse, Erin; Precourt Debbink, Michelle; Haaland, Benjamin; Tanner, Amy J; Anzai, Yoshimi; Fagerlin, Angela",JAMA Netw Open,,298

More recently, Cuban health pro-fessionals tackled domestic outbreaks of H1N1 (2009) and Zika (2016), and worked alongside colleagues from around the world to stem Ebola in West Africa; all three were categorized by WHO as public health emergencies of international concern. In December 2019, China reported its fi rst cluster of pneumo-nia cases, later identifi ed as the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. In January 2020, Cuban authorities convened a multi-sector working group coordinated by the Ministry of Pub-lic Health (MINSAP) and Civil Defense to tailor its national epi-demic control plan to confront the rapidly-spreading disease. The plan features a national reporting system and database, with standard protocols including early case detection, contact tracing and regularly-scheduled public health messaging. In late January, no fewer than six ministries, plus the National Sports and Recreation Institute, Customs, Immigration and national media outlets, came together to adapt domestic proto-cols and design multi-phase control and response mechanisms to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Gorry, Conner",MEDICC Rev,,298

Methods: All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were discharged from 12 hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang from Jan 17, 2020 to Mar 20, 2020. Prospectively collected and analyzed data included demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidity, and chest CT imaging features at the first follow up, 1 month after discharge. All patients underwent the HRQoL evaluation with the Chinese version of Short-Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) as well as a general condition questionnaire. Factors associated with SF-36 were constructed using linear regression. Predictors of impaired physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS) were identified by logistic regression. Results: SF-36 demonstrated a significant difference in HRQoL in patients with COVID-19, except in physical function (PF), when compared to the general Chinese population (p&lt;0.05). The multiple linear regressions demonstrated that age was negatively associated with PF, role physical (RP), but positively associated with vitality (VT) (p&lt;0.05). PF, bodily pain (BP), and role-emotional (RE) were negatively associated with the female sex (p&lt;0.05). For mental health, the clinical subtypes were significant associated factors (p &lt; 0.05). Length of stay (LOS) was strongly negatively associated with RE and RP, and positively associated with VT (p&lt; 0.05). Logistical regression revealed that non-obese overweight (OR 3.71) and obesity (OR 3.94) were risk factors for a low PCS and female sex (OR 2.22) was a risk factor for a low MCS. Conclusions: Health-related quality of life was poor among COVID-19 patients at the 1 month follow-up. Patients suffered from significant physical and psychological impairment. Therefore, prospective monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is needed in order to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, as well as to inform prompt and efficient interventions to alleviate suffering.","Chen, Ke-Yang; Li, Ting; Gong, Fang-Hua; Zhang, Jin-San; Li, Xiao-Kun",Front.

At present, the world is relying mainly on containment and hygiene-related measures, as well as repurposed drugs to control the outbreak. The development of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial for the world to return to pre-pandemic normalcy, and a collective global effort has been invested into protection against SARS-CoV-2. As of March 2021, thirteen vaccines have been approved for application whilst over 90 vaccine candidates are under clinical trials. This review focuses on the development of COVID-19 vaccines and highlights the efficacy and vaccination reactions of the authorised vaccines. The mechanisms, storage, and dosage specification of vaccine candidates at the advanced stage of development are also critically reviewed together with considerations for potential challenges. Whilst the development of a vaccine is, in general, in its infancy, current progress is promising. However, the world population will have to continue to adapt to the ""new normal"" and practice social distancing and hygienic measures, at least until effective vaccines are available to the general public.","Yan, Y.; Pang, Y.; Lyu, Z.; Wang, R.; Wu, X.; You, C.; Zhao, H.; Manickam, S.; Lester, E.; Wu, T.; Pang, C.

Common side effects include nausea, diarrhoea, muscle spasms, hearing impairment, dysgeusia, headaches, dry skin, infusion reactions and hyperglycaemia. We report here a 76-year-old man with Graves-related thyroid eye disease who developed a rapidly progressive cognitive decline after receiving four out of eight doses of teprotumumab (cumulative dose 4620 mg). He was admitted for workup and teprotumumab infusions were discontinued. Intravenous glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin were given which showed no improvement in clinical symptoms. He subsequently underwent plasmapheresis with resolution of his symptoms, suggesting a teprotumumab-induced encephalopathy.

The framework is made up of two pairs of linked concepts: 1) Susceptibility or the chance of an individual becoming infected; 2) Resistance or the ability of an individual to avoid infection; 3) Vulnerability or the likelihood of significant impacts occurring at individual, household or community level; and 4) Resilience: the active responses that enable people to avoid the worst impacts of an epidemic at different levels or to recover faster to a level accepted as normal. This framework allows the clear formulation of key questions for COVID-19: factors in the labor process itself that make people more or less susceptible; broader socio-economic and biophysical determinants of susceptibility; factors that make farm households, food enterprises and value chains more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic; and aspects of COVID-19 responses by governments and the private sector that might increase vulnerability. Brief examples of susceptibility of value chain operations and of their vulnerability to COVID-19 lockdown measures are given. A focus on resistance and resilience encourages investigation of local-level responses by communities and NGOs, which with appropriate monitoring and learning could be scaled up.","Morton, John",World Dev,,298

They worked with a task on fractions in an online assessment system with questions with random parameters and infinite possible correct answers. This was followed by a discussion of the strategies and the justifications, arguments and validations of these strategies and other conjectures that emerged. This article analyzes this work from a qualitative approach using the Mathematical Working Space as a theoretical framework. The results show that the discussion work led the trainee teachers to find interpretations for the algorithms processed by the computer, enhancing epistemic discourse and argumentation in the context of the use of technological artifacts. In turn, the same discourses allowed the future teachers to instrumentalize the processes to be used in new tasks.","Gaona, Jorge; Menares, Romina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12496v1.pdf,298

At this point, psychodermatology forms a common field of study based on the relationship and interaction between psychiatry and dermatology. Cosmetology is a special group within dermatology, and the psychosocial needs of this group differ. In this study, it was aimed to examine the moods such as anxiety, fear and depression experienced by the patients during their application to the cosmetology unit during the COVID-19 pandemic process and to compare them with the control group. A total of 162 cases, 80 cases from the cosmetology unit meeting the specified conditions and 82 cases as the control group, were retrospectively evaluated. In all participants, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) scores decreased significantly compared to the beginning of the pandemic (p=0.001). In the study, while depression (HAM-D) and general anxiety (HAM-A) were higher in the cosmetology group compared to the control group (respectively p=0.049, p=0.001), there was no difference in coronavirus anxiety scores (CAS) (p=0.24). It should be known that patients who underwent cosmetological procedures during the pandemic period may have anxiety and depression. In this patient group, which requires a special psychodermatological approach, pandemic effects should also be considered. In patients who apply to cosmetology units during the pandemic period, attention should be paid to the relationship between surreal cosmetological process requests and their anxiety and depression state.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 13, 2020, to April 14, 2020, consecutive suspected COVID-19 adult patients who underwent both an RT-PCR test and chest CT from 15 hospitals were included in this prospective study. Chest CTs were immediately interpreted by the on-call teleradiologist and were systematically blind reviewed by a senior radiologist. Readings were categorised using a five-point scale: (1) normal; (2) non-infectious findings; (3) infectious findings but not consistent with COVID-19 infection; (4) consistent with COVID-19 infection; and (5) typical appearance of COVID-19 infection. The diagnostic accuracy of chest CT and inter-observer agreement using the kappa coefficient were evaluated over the study period. RESULTS: In total, 513 patients were enrolled, of whom 244/513 (47.6%) tested positive for RT-PCR. First readings were scored 4 or 5 in 225/244 (92%) RT-PCR+ patients, and between 1 and 3 in 201/269 (74.7%) RT-PCR- patients. The data were highly consistent (weighted kappa = 0.87) and correlated with RT-PCR (p < 0.001, AUC1st-reading = 0.89, AUC2nd-reading = 0.93). The negative predictive value for scores of 4 or 5 was 0.91-0.92, and the PPV for a score of 5 was 0.89-0.96 at the first and second readings, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was consistent over the study period, irrespective of a variable prevalence rate. CONCLUSION: Chest CT demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with strong inter-observer agreement between on-call teleradiologists with varying degrees of experience and senior radiologists over the study period. KEY POINTS: â¢ The accuracy of readings by on-call teleradiologists, relative to second readings by senior radiologists, demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.75-0.79, specificity of 0.92-0.97, NPV of 0.80-0.83, and PPV of 0.89-0.96, based on ""typical appearance,"" as predictive of RT-PCR+. â¢ Inter-observer agreement between the first reading in the emergency setting and the second reading by the senior emergency teleradiologist was excellent (weighted kappa = 0.87).","Nivet, Hubert; Crombé, Amandine; Schuster, Paul; Ayoub, Thomas; Pourriol, Laurent; Favard, Nicolas; Chazot, Alban; Alonzo-Lacroix, Florian; Youssof, Emile; Ben Cheikh, Alexandre; Balique, Julien; Porta, Basile; Petitpierre, François; Bouquet, Grégoire; Mastier, Charles; Bratan, Flavie; Bergerot, Jean-François; Thomson, Vivien; Banaste, Nathan; Gorincour, Guillaume",Eur. radiol,,298
403003,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and antibody kinetics among health care workers in a Spanish hospital after three months of follow-up,2020,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and clinical features of patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were well delineated. However, no researches described the patients complicated with pleural effusion (PE). In the present study, we aimed to clinically characterize the COVID-19 patients complicated with PE and to create a predictive model on the basis of PE and other clinical features to identify COVID-19 patients who may progress to critical condition. METHODS: This retrospective study examined 476 COVID-19 inpatients, involving 153 patients with PE and 323 without PE. The data on patients' past history, clinical features, physical checkup findings, laboratory results and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected and analyzed. LASSO regression analysis was employed to identify risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: Laboratory findings showed that patients with PE had higher levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, lactic dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer, and lower levels of lymphocytes, platelets, hemoglobin, partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation. Meanwhile, patients with PE had higher incidence of severe or critical illness and mortality rate, and longer hospital stay time compared to their counterparts without pleural effusion. Moreover, LASSO regression analysis exhibited that pleural effusion, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer and total bilirubin (TBIL) might be risk factors for critical COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Pleural effusion could serve as an indicator for severe inflammation and poor clinical outcomes, and might be a complementary risk factor for critical type of COVID-19.","Zhan, Na; Guo, Yingyun; Tian, Shan; Huang, Binglu; Tian, Xiaoli; Zou, Jinjing; Xiong, Qiutang; Tang, Dongling; Zhang, Liang; Dong, Weiguo",BMC Infect Dis,,298
409031,The assessment of transmission efficiency and latent infection period in asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Over a third of the world’s countries have launched contact-tracing apps in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, generating much hype about the prospect of automating contact-tracing to manage outbreaks and to alleviate costly and labour-intensive ‘manual’ contact tracing. Despite the stringent scientific criteria applied to the development of vaccines and other biomedical countermeasures in responding to the pandemic, digital contact tracing has been widely recommended despite being an unproven public health intervention. Evidence for its effectiveness is thin, based on theoretical mathematical modelling and unsystematic observations across diverse country contexts. Establishing evidence of effectiveness is complicated by the fact that two private corporations, Apple and Google, own the technology upon which most government contact-tracing apps are based and which, by design, restricts access to needed data on privacy grounds. In this policy insight, we make the case for why public health authorities urgently need to establish the effectiveness and societal implications of this big digital contact-tracing experiment. © 2021 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","de Bengy Puyvallée, A.; Storeng, K.

This paper investigates whether correlations between user-generated and user-shared content can be leveraged for detecting disinformation in online news articles. We develop a multimodal learning algorithm for disinformation detection. The latent representations of news articles and user-generated content allow that during training the model is guided by the profile of users who prefer content similar to the news article that is evaluated, and this effect is reinforced if that content is shared among different users. By only leveraging user information during model optimization, the model does not rely on user profiling when predicting an article's veracity. The algorithm is successfully applied to three widely used neural classifiers, and results are obtained on different datasets. Visualization techniques show that the proposed model learns feature representations of unseen news articles that better discriminate between fake and real news texts.","Allein, Liesbeth; Moens, Marie-Francine; Perrotta, Domenico",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13892v1.pdf,298
411492,Protection of healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a public health emergency. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and fatigue. While most patients with COVID-19 present with mild illness, some patients develop pneumonia, an important risk factor for mortality, at early stage of viral infection, putting these patients at increased risk of death. So far, little has been known about differences in the T cell repertoires between COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we aimed to investigate T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles and patient-specific SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters between COVID-19 patients with mild disease (no sign of pneumonia) and pneumonia. The TCR sequencing was conducted to characterize the peripheral TCR repertoire profile and diversity. The TCR clustering and CDR3 annotation were exploited to further discover groups of patient-specific TCR clonotypes with potential SARS-CoV-2 antigen specificities. Our study indicated a slight decrease in the TCR repertoire diversity and a skewed CDR3 length usage in patients with pneumonia compared to those with mild disease. The SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters enriched in patients with mild disease exhibited significantly higher TCR generation probabilities and most of which were highly shared among patients, compared with those from pneumonia patients. Importantly, using similarity network-based clustering followed by the sequence conservation analysis, we found different patterns of CDR3 sequence motifs between mild disease- and pneumonia-specific SARS-CoV-2-associated public TCR clusters. Our results showed that characteristics of overall TCR repertoire and SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters/clonotypes were divergent between COVID-19 patients with mild disease and patients with pneumonia. These findings provide important insights into the correlation between the TCR repertoire and disease severity in COVID-19 patients.","Chang, Che-Mai; Feng, Po-Hao; Wu, Tsung-Hsun; Alachkar, Houda; Lee, Kang-Yun; Chang, Wei-Chiao",J. clin. immunol,,298

One of the possible options for severe COVID-19 treatment may be the transfusion of hyperimmune SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma. A 9-month-old girl with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia received an HSCT from a haploidentical donor. On day +99, during routine virologic monitoring, SARS-CoV-2 was detected without any clinical symptoms. On day +144, the child developed a polysegmental bilateral viral pneumonia with 60 % damage to the lung tissue and confirm a positive SARS-Cov-2 results in throat swab. The patient was treated with tocilizumab and three doses of fresh frozen plasma obtained from a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient. Therapy with tocilizumab and three doses of fresh frozen plasma was well tolerated. In spite of full resolution of the lung lesions, complete elimination of SARS-CoV-2 has not been achieved 4 months after the first detection, which is due to persistence of secondary immunodeficiency after HSCT and the lack of reconstitution of the adaptive immune response. This case represents a demonstration of an atypical course of COVID-19 and the delayed development of lung lesions, which was most likely associated with the features of the patient's immune status after HSCT. SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in combination with other therapeutic approaches is one of the possible curative options for this clinical situation.","Balashov, Dmitry; Trakhtman, Pavel; Livshits, Anna; Kovalenko, Irina; Tereshenko, Galina; Solopova, Galina; Petraikina, Elena; Maschan, Alexei; Novichkova, Galina",Transfus Apher Sci,,298

420885,The complexity of respiratory disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: From immunopathogenesis to respiratory therapy,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic is a world-wide crisis without an effective therapy. While most approaches to therapy are using repurposed drugs that were developed for other diseases, it is thought that targeting the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can result in an effective therapeutic treatment. The coronavirus RNA cap structure is methylated by two viral methyltransferases that transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The proper methylation of the virus depends on the level of methionine in the host to form SAM. Herein, we propose to restrict methionine availability by treating the patient with oral recombinant methioninase, aiming to treat Covid-19. By restricting methionine we not only interdict viral replication, which depends on the viral RNA cap methyaltion, but also inhibit the proliferation of the infected cells, which have an increased requirement for methionine. Most importantly, the virally-induced T-cell- and macrophage-mediated cytokine storm, which seems to be a significant cause for Covid-19 deaths, can also be inhibited by restricting methionine, since T-cell and macrophrage activation greatly increases the methionine requirement for these cells. The evidence reviewed here suggests that oral recombinant methioninase could be a promising treatment for coronavirus patients.","Hoffman, Robert M; Han, Qinghong",In Vivo,,298

422111,"Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children and Adults in Marion County, Indiana",2020,"The current nCOVID-19 pandemic is raising several questions in the approximately 25% of patients who present with neurological symptoms. While secondary brain injury from the systemic manifestations of the disease account for the majority of non-specific neurological symptoms that include headache, nausea, and progressive confusion, the question that remains unanswered is does the nCOVID-19 virus use the olfactory mucosa as a portal to directly invade the brain? A second question is how common does direct CNS invasion complicate the classical cardiorespiratory severe form of the disease? We know from previous studies that almost all members of the Corona virus family have neurotropism. We also know from the current pandemic that deteriorating consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents are not uncommon. Several previous scattered case reports, and post-mortem examinations of brain tissue, demonstrated nCOVID-19 nucleic acid in the CSF, and brain tissue, of infected and deceased individuals. We performed a PubMed review of the literature to specifically assess the evidence for the direct CNS invasion by the nCOVID-19 virus. This phenomenon would explain the cerebral oedema and encephalitis, that does occur, and bring Neurosurgeons into the management of these patients by for example directed intra-cranial pressure management post insertion of an intra-cranial pressure monitor. Unfortunately, the answers to these questions were not definitively answered by the research reviewed. While suggestive that direct CNS invasion does occur, the exact scale and manifestations of the problem remains, to date, essentially unknown.","Lekgwara, Patrick; Kelly, Adrian",Interdiscip.

429078,Using serological data to understand unobserved SARS-CoV-2 risk in health-care settings,2020,"BACKGROUND: Laboratory-based methods for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection vary widely in performance. However, there are limited prospectively-collected data on assay performance, and minimal clinical information to guide interpretation of discrepant results. METHODS: Over a two-week period, 1080 consecutive plasma samples submitted for clinical SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing were tested in parallel for anti-nucleocapsid IgG (anti-N, Abbott) and anti-spike IgG (anti-S1, EUROIMMUN). Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. RESULTS: There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19. The anti-N assay was less sensitive (84.2% [95% CI 72.1-92.5%] versus 94.7% [95% CI 85.4-98.9%]) but more specific (99.2% [95% CI 95.5-100%] versus 86.9% [95% CI 79.6-92.3%]) than anti-S1. Abbott anti-N sensitivity could be improved to 96.5% with minimal effect on specificity if the index threshold was lowered from 1.4 to 0.6. CONCLUSION: Real-world concordance between different serologic assays may be lower than previously described in retrospective studies. These findings have implications for the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG results, especially with the advent of spike antigen-targeted vaccination, as a subset of patients with true infection are anti-N negative and anti-S1 positive.","Wang, Hannah; Wiredja, Danica; Yang, Lu; Bulterys, Philip L; Costales, Cristina; Röltgen, Katharina; Manalac, Justin; Yee, Jennifer; Zehnder, James; Shi, Run Zhang; Boyd, Scott D; Pinsky, Benjamin A",Clin. chem,,298

Infected Patients experienced mild to severe symptoms, resulting in several fatalities due to a weak understanding of its pathogenesis, which is the same even to date. This cross-sectional study has been designed on four hundred and fifty-two symptomatic, mild-to-moderate, and severe/critical patients to understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with their comorbidities and response to treatment. The mean age of studied patients was (58{+/-}14.42) years, and the overall male to female ratio was 61.7 to 38.2%, respectively. 27.3% of the patients had a history of exposure, 11.9% travel history, while for 60% of patients, the source of infection was unknown. The most prevalent signs and symptoms in ICU patients were dry coughs, myalgias, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal discomfort, and abnormal Chest X-ray (p<0.001), along with the high percentage of hypertension (p=0.007) and COPD (p=0.029) as leading comorbidities. Complete Blood Counts indicators were significantly increased in severe patients, while the Coagulation Profile and D-dimer values were significantly higher in mild-to-moderate (non-ICU) patients (p < 0.001). Serum Creatinine (1.22 umole L-1; p = 0.016) and LDH (619 umol L-1; p < 0.001) indicators were significantly high in non-ICU patients while, raised values of Total Bilirubin (0.91 umol L-1; p = 0.054), CRP (84.68 mg L-1; p = 0.001) and Ferritin (996.81 mg L-1; p < 0.001) were found in ICU patients. Drug Dexamethasone was the leading prescribed and administrated medicine to the COVID-19 patients, followed by Remdesivir, Meropenem, Heparin, and Tocilizumab, respectively.

445148,Evaluation of the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological tools and their positioning in COVID-19 diagnostic strategies,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic COVID-19. The virus infects human cells by binding of the virus spike to the cell receptor ACE2. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spikes in complex with human ACE2 has recently been solved, and the main amino acid residues involved in the virus-receptor complex have been detected. To investigate the affinity of ACE2 of lagomorphs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, ACE2 sequences from rabbits and American pikas were compared with human ACE2 and with ACE2 from mammals with different susceptibility to the virus. Models of the complex formed by SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2 from lagomorphs and from other mammals were created for comparative studies. ACE2 of lagomorphs showed fewer substitutions than human ACE2 in residues involved in the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike complex, similar to cats. Analysis of the binding interface of the simulated complexes ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike showed high affinity of the ACE2 of lagomorphs to the viral spike protein. These findings suggest that the spike of SARS-CoV-2 could bind the ACE2 receptor of lagomorphs, and future studies should investigate the role of lagomorphs in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. Furthermore, the risks to humans coming into close contacts with these animals should be evaluated.","Preziuso, Silvia",,,298

449299,"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Mitigation Efforts among Office Workers, Washington, DC, USA",2021,"With noisy environment caused by fluoresence and additive white noise as well as complicated spectrum fingerprints, the identification of complex mixture materials remains a major challenge in Raman spectroscopy application. In this paper, we propose a new scheme based on a constant wavelet transform (CWT) and a deep network for classifying complex mixture. The scheme first transforms the noisy Raman spectrum to a two-dimensional scale map using CWT. A multi-label deep neural network model (MDNN) is then applied for classifying material. The proposed model accelerates the feature extraction and expands the feature graph using the global averaging pooling layer. The Sigmoid function is implemented in the last layer of the model. The MDNN model was trained, validated and tested with data collected from the samples prepared from substances in palm oil. During training and validating process, data augmentation is applied to overcome the imbalance of data and enrich the diversity of Raman spectra. From the test results, it is found that the MDNN model outperforms previously proposed deep neural network models in terms of Hamming loss, one error, coverage, ranking loss, average precision, F1 macro averaging and F1 micro averaging, respectively. The average detection time obtained from our model is 5.31 s, which is much faster than the detection time of the previously proposed models.","Pan, Liangrui; Pipitsunthonsan, Pronthep; Daengngam, Chalongrat; Chongcheawchamnan, Mitchai",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15654v1.pdf,298

In addition, therapeutic agents that inhibit cytokine activity can limit the severity of irAEs, and their use is being tested in the clinical setting. This review provides an in-depth analysis of strategies to uncouple the cytokine response, that precipitates irAEs following cancer immunotherapies, from the benefit gained in promoting antitumor immunity.","Kang, Jee Hye; Bluestone, Jeffrey A; Young, Arabella",Trends Immunol,,298

This demand for food in turn puts pressure on agriculture in many countries. The impact of climate change on the environment has made it difficult to produce food that may be necessary to accommodate the growing population. Due to these concerns, the agriculture sector is forced to move towards more efficient and sustainable methods of farming to increase productivity. There is evidence that the use of technology in agriculture has the potential to improve food production and food sustainability; thereby addressing the concerns of food security. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been suggested as a potential tool for farmers to overcome the impact of climate change on food security. However, there is dearth of research on the readiness of implementing IoT in South Africa's agricultural sector. Therefore, this research aims to explore the readiness of the agricultural sector of South Africa for a wide implementation of IoT. This research conducts a desktop study through the lens of the PEST framework on the special case of South Africa. A thematic literature and documents review was deployed to examine the political, economic, societal and technological factors that may facilitate or impede the implementation of IoT in the agricultural sectors of South Africa. The findings suggest that the wide ranging political, economic, societal and technological constructs enable the implementation of IoT within South Africa's agricultural sector.

Earlier demand and access barriers have seemingly been addressed with more free and accessible vaccines now available for a wide variety of ages. While rates of COVID-19 have decreased overall, some geographic areas continue to experience rapid outbreaks. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between vaccination uptake and weekly COVID-19 cases throughout locations in the state of Missouri. MethodsAmong all Missouri counties and two cities (n=117), weekly COVID-19 incidence and cumulative proportion of residents fully vaccinated were abstracted from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services during a 25-week period from January 4 to Jun 26, 2021. Additional ecological variables known to be associated with COVID-19 incidence and prevalence were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and integrated into data: total population, proportion of nonwhite residents, annual median household income, proportion of residents working in public facing occupations. Descriptive and inferential statistics were completed which included the calculation of both linear and nonlinear models using repeated measure data to determine the quantitative association between vaccination uptake and reported COVID-19 cases in the presence of location characteristics. ResultsThroughout the 25 weeks of observations, the average weekly number of COVID-19 cases reported was 66.1 (SD=260.8) while the average cumulative proportion vaccinated individuals at the end of the 25 weeks was 25.8% (SD=6.8%) among study locations. While graphing seemed to suggest a more nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 incidence and proportion vaccinated, comparison of crude linear and nonlinear models pointed to the relationship likely being linear during study period. The final adjusted linear model exhibited a significant relationship between COVID-19 cases and proportion vaccinated, specifically every percent increase in population vaccinated resulted in 3 less weekly COVID-19 cases being reported ({beta} -3.74, p<0.001. Additionally, when controlling for other factors, the adjusted model revealed locations with higher proportions of nonwhite residents were likely to experience less weekly COVID-19 cases ({beta} -1.48, p=0.037). DiscussionOverall, this study determined that increasing the proportion of residents vaccinated decreases COIVD-19 cases by a substantial amount over time. These findings provide insights into possible messaging strategies that can be leveraged to develop more effective implementation and uptake. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists and vaccination numbers begin to plateau, diverse communication strategies become a critical necessity to reach a wider population.","Shacham, Enbal; Scroggins, Stephen; Garza, Alexander",,,298

To capture insights into the dynamics of the protein's backbone in solution and accelerate the identification and mapping of ligand-binding surfaces through chemical shift perturbation studies, the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR chemical shifts for Nsp9 have been extensively assigned. These assignments were assisted by the preparation of an ~ 70% deuterated sample and residue-specific, 15N-labelled samples (V, L, M, F, and K). A major feature of the assignments was the ""missing"" amide resonances for N96-L106 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, a region that comprises almost the complete C-terminal &#945;-helix that forms a major part of the homodimer interface in the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, suggesting this region either undergoes intermediate motion in the ms to µs timescale and/or is heterogenous. These ""missing"" amide resonances do not unambiguously appear in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 collected at a concentration of 0.0007 mM. At this concentration, at the detection limit, native mass spectrometry indicates the protein is exclusively in the monomeric state, suggesting the intermediate motion in the C-terminal of Nsp9 may be due to intramolecular dynamics. Perhaps this intermediate ms to µs timescale dynamics is the physical basis for a previously suggested ""fluidity"" of the C-terminal helix that may be responsible for homophilic (Nsp9-Nsp9) and postulated heterophilic (Nsp9-Unknown) protein-protein interactions.","Buchko, Garry W; Zhou, Mowei; Craig, Justin K; Van Voorhis, Wesley C; Myler, Peter J",Biomolecular NMR assignments,,298

Traditional evaluations for making an ALS diagnosis, measuring progression, and planning interventions rely on in-person visits that may now be unsafe or impossible. Evidence- and experience-based treatment options, such as multidisciplinary team care, feeding tubes, wheelchairs, home health, and hospice, have become more difficult to obtain and in some places are unavailable. In addition, the pandemic has impacted ALS clinical trials by impairing the ability to obtain measurements for trial eligibility, to monitor safety and efficacy outcomes, and to dispense study drug, as these also often rely on in-person visits. We review opportunities for overcoming some of these challenges through telemedicine and novel measurements. These can reoptimize ALS care and research in the current setting and during future events that may limit travel and face-to-face interactions.","Andrews, Jinsy A; Berry, James D; Baloh, Robert H; Carberry, Nathan; Cudkowicz, Merit E; Dedi, Brixhilda; Glass, Jonathan; Maragakis, Nicholas J; Miller, Timothy M; Paganoni, Sabrina; Rothstein, Jeffrey D; Shefner, Jeremy M; Simmons, Zachary; Weiss, Michael D; Bedlack, Richard S",Muscle Nerve,,298

Methods: This study integrates the available literature on internet of things (IoT) e-health ecosystem and informal care. Results: In the first part of this article, we describe the health consequences of quarantine and isolation and outline the potential role of informal care in containing the risk of spreading the infection and reducing the burden on the health care system. Then, we present an overview of the characteristics of emerging technological ecosystems in health care and how they can be adopted as a strategic option to achieve different goals: (1) support informal carers to help vulnerable populations during quarantine and isolation and facilitate the recovery process; (2) promote the adoption of e-health and telemedicine resources to reduce the well-documented burden experienced by caregivers; and (3) lessen the various forms of digital disadvantage among vulnerable individuals, who are at more risk to be digitally excluded. In the last part of this work, we introduce solutions to overcome potential challenges related to the development and adoption of advanced technological ecosystems and propose a reflection on the legacy of COVID-19 on telemedicine. Conclusions: Thanks to the disruptive potential of IoT for health and wellness promotion, technological ecosystems emerge as a valuable resource to support both informal carers and vulnerable populations. The main factors that represent a strategic advantage of a technological ecosystem are affordability, regulatory, and availability. A high degree of interconnection between all the stakeholders emerges as a key element for the provision of intergenerational care.

Our aim was to assess the prevalence of anal sphincter defects and the association with incontinence in women undergoing POP surgery. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 200 women scheduled for POP surgery. They answered yes/no and graded any symptoms of fecal and flatal incontinence on a visual analog scale (0-100). 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound was used to assess internal (IAS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) defects. A defect of &#8805;30° in &#8805;4 of 6 slices on tomographic imaging was regarded significant. The association between incontinence and sphincter defects was tested with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of any sphincter defect was 50/200 (25%). Combined IAS/EAS defect was found in 19/200 (9.5%) women, 8/200 (4.0%) had isolated IAS, and 23/200 (11.5%) had isolated EAS defects. In women with defect and intact IAS, 37% and 11% reported fecal incontinence, respectively, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-7.0), p = .147 and in women with defect versus intact EAS, 36% and 9% had fecal incontinence, aOR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.5-10.8), p = .005.

We contend that these claims are unprofessional and demonstrate a disturbing lack of insight into the doctrine of informed consent. As such it is timely to review how informed consent has evolved and continues to do so and also to discuss the attendant implications for contemporary health practitioner practice. We review the origins of informed consent and trace the duty of disclosure and materiality through landmark medical consent cases in four common law (case law) jurisdictions. The duty of disclosure has evolved from a patriarchal exercise to one in which patient autonomy in clinical decision making is paramount. Passing time has seen the duty of disclosure evolve to include non-medical aspects that may influence the delivery of care. We argue that a patient cannot provide valid informed consent for the removal of vertebral subluxation. Further, vertebral subluxation care cannot meet code of conduct standards because it lacks an evidence base and is practitioner-centered. The uptake of the expanded duty of disclosure has been slow and incomplete by practitioners and regulators. The expanded duty of disclosure has implications, both educative and punitive for regulators, chiropractic educators and professional associations. We discuss how practitioners and regulators can be informed by other sources such as consumer law. For regulators, reviewing and updating informed consent requirements is required. For practitioners it may necessitate disclosure of health status, conflict of interest when recommending ""inhouse"" products, recency of training after attending continuing professional development, practice patterns, personal interests and disciplinary findings. CONCLUSION: Ultimately such matters are informed by the deliberations of the courts. It is our opinion that the duty of a mature profession to critically self-evaluate and respond in the best interests of the patient before these matters arrive in court.","Simpson, J Keith; Innes, Stanley",Chiropr Man Therap,,298

Recently, break-through infections following vaccination against this virus have been reported. Here, we describe the humoral immune response of break-through infections in fully vaccinated individuals of old age from an outbreak in a nursery home. MethodsIn cooperation with the local health authority, blood samples from fully vaccinated and infected as well as fully vaccinated and uninfected residents of the nursery home were collected four weeks after the onset of the outbreak. The humoral immune response was determined in a neutralisation assay with replication-competent virus isolates and by a quantitative ELISA. ResultsIn this outbreak a total of 23 residents and four health care workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four residents were unvaccinated, including one with a severe course of disease who later deceased. Despite their old age, all vaccinated residents showed no or only mild disease. Comparison of the humoral immune response revealed significantly higher antibody levels in fully vaccinated infected individuals compared to fully vaccinated uninfected individuals (p<0.001). Notably, although only a minority of the vaccinated uninfected group showed neutralisation capacity against SARS-CoV-2, all vaccinated and infected individuals showed high-titer neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 including the alpha and beta variant. DiscussionLarge SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can occur in fully vaccinated populations, but seem to associate with mild disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated individuals is a strong booster of the humoral immune response providing enhanced neutralisation capacity against immune evasion variants.","Müller, Lisa; Andrée, Marcel; Ostermann, Philipp Niklas; Jazmati, Nathalie; Flüh, Greta; Fischer, Johannes C.; Bölke, Edwin; Wisplinghoff, Hilmar; Schaal, Heiner; Drexler, Ingo; Walker, Andreas; Adams, Ortwin; Timm, Jörg",,,298

Compared to bare surfaces, superhydrophobic (SHPB) surfaces exhibit a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 attachment of up to 99.99995%. We identify the vital importance of solid-liquid adhesion in dominating viral attachment, where the viral activity (N) is proportional to the cube of solid-liquid adhesion (A), N â A3.

506680,"Respiratory Viral Shedding in Healthcare Workers Reinfected with SARS-CoV-2, Brazil, 2020",2021,"The aim of this paper is to outline some considerations about the psychological distress in healthcare professional during the Covid-19 pandemic. We summarize available literature both on ‘protective’ and ‘predisposing’ factors potentially involved in the occurrence of psychological distress, including PTSD, in frontline healthcare operators. Valid social support, self-efficacy, internal locus of control (LOC) and sense of coherence (SOC) have been considered as resilience factors, in previous studies. Likewise, several observations pointed on the relevance of individual and environmental vulnerabilities. No real evidence is available about strategies to face the emotional burden for healthcare operators due to present COVID-19 scenario. However, we strongly believe that the containment of isolation anxiety with an appropriate emotional support should be the first instrument to minimise the psychological effect of pandemic on the more exposed healthcare professionals.","Conversano, Ciro; Marchi, Laura; Miniati, Mario",Clin.

520509,Biomimetic Virus-Like Particles as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Diagnostic Tools,2020,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anti-tumor modality which employs three individually non-toxic substances, including photosensitizer, light and oxygen, to produce a toxic effect. Besides causing damage to blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumor and killing the tumor by a direct cytotoxic effect, PDT has also been known to trigger an anti-tumor immune response. For instance, our previous study showed that PDT with BAM-SiPc, a silicon(IV) phthalocyanine based-photosensitizer, can not only eradicate the mouse CT26 tumor cells in a Balb/c mouse model, but also protect the mice against further re-challenge of the tumor cells through an immunomodulatory mechanism. To understand more about the immune effect, the biochemical actions of BAM-SiPc-PDT on CT26 cells were studied in the in vitro system. It was confirmed that the PDT treatment could induce immunogenic necroptosis in the tumor cells. Upon treatment, different damage-associated molecular patterns were exposed onto the cell surface or released from the cells. Among them, calreticulin was found to translocate to the cell membrane through a pathway similar to that in chemotherapy. The activation of immune response was also demonstrated by an increase in the expression of different chemokines.","Zhang, Ying; Cheung, Ying-Kit; Ng, Dennis K P; Fong, Wing-Ping",,,298

For this reason and others, there is a critical need to provide One Health (OH) training to medical professionals early in their careers. 133 U.S. medical schools were surveyed for the incorporation of OH learning activities. Results showed that 56% of surveyed programs included OH-related subject matter, primarily in the context of preclinical classroom learning. This supports previous findings that OH education efforts in medical schools lag behind veterinary schools, with many veterinary schools already including OH as a central part of their curricula. A two week OH elective course for third year medical students was developed and implemented at Georgetown University School of Medicine. Topics such as emerging infectious diseases, zoonoses, vector-borne diseases, epidemiology, emergency preparedness, the human-animal bond, and effects of climate change on public health were discussed. The 21 participants were surveyed before and after the course regarding their knowledge and understanding of OH. Participation in the course enhanced the students' knowledge of OH and furthermore, the students' perception of the importance of incorporating OH within the curriculum and in their future careers changed significantly. This study provides clear evidence that successful integration of OH material is achievable at low cost through interdepartmental and interdisciplinary collaboration. A more holistic approach to health care that takes into consideration environmental, wildlife, and domestic animal factors, and introduction of concepts such as OH into the medical school curriculum, can help close the educational gaps identified in the surveys.","Docherty, Lorraine; Foley, Patricia L.",One Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728370/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100231,298

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize the clinical characteristics and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population in a single center in Brazil. METHODS: Out of 497 dialysis patients evaluated between March 1(st), 2020 and February 1(st), 2021, those presenting symptoms or history of close contact with COVID-19 patients were tested. Disease severity was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: Out of the 497 patients, 8.8% tested positive for COVID-19. These patients were predominantly male (59%), mean age 57.5±17. Hospitalization was required for 45.4% of patients and 15.9% received mechanical ventilation. Symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea and asthenia were more frequent in the severe group. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C- reactive protein, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase were significantly higher in the severe group, while hemoglobin and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower.

Methods: The results of an observational study comparing Tenofovir-DF (TDF) with Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with evidence of pulmonary compromise and the vast majority with supplemental oxygen requirement are presented. Patients received HCQ consecutively at the dose of 400 mg. 12 hourly for 01 day and then 200 mg. every 8 to 12 hours PO for 5 to10 days; or TDF 300 mg. per day PO for 7 to 10 days. The primary outcomes of the study were the differences between the two groups regarding: hospital stay, the need for intensive care or mechanical ventilation (ICU / MV) and mortality. Results: 104 patients were included: 36 in the HCQ group and 68 in the TDF group. The unadjusted primary outcomes were: LOS (length of stay) 16.6 for HCQ versus 12.2 days for TDF (p = o.o102); need for admission to ICU / mechanical ventilation (MV): 61.1% for HCQ versus 11.8% for TDF (p = o.ooo); and mortality: 50.0% for HCQ and 8.8% for TDF (p = o.ooo). The patients in the HCQ group had significant differences at admission compared to those in the TDF group regarding: male sex, cardiovascular risk factor, greater respiratory involvement and higher glucose and creatinine levels, lower albumin levels and higher. Inflammatory markers. When the outcomes were adjusted for these baseline differences, in the multiple regression model for LOS, it was found that TDF decreased the hospital stay by 6.10 days (C.I.: -11.97 to -2.40, p = o.o42); In the logistic regression model for the need for ICU / MV, it was found that the use of TDF had an O.R. of 0.15 (C.I.: 0.03-0.76, p = o.o22); and for the Cox proportional hazards model for mortality, the H.R. was 0.16 for TDF (C.I.: 0.03-0.96, p = o.o41). In the estimation model of the treatment effects by regression adjustment, it was found that TDF decreased the stay by -6.38 days (C.I.: -12.34 to -0.42, p = o.o36); the need for ICU / MV at -41.74% (C.I.: -63.72 to -19.7, p = o.ooo); and mortality by -35.22% (C.I.: -56.47 to -13.96, p = o.oo1).

Seven research databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science: Core Collection, National Library of Medicine PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar) were searched for keywords returning 3412 preliminary results published since 2008 in Organisation for Economic Coordination and Development (OECD)nations. These were screened by both authors for inclusion/exclusion criteria resulting in 127 included articles. Articles included were quantitative studies in OECD countries assessing select mental disorders (depression, anxiety, and trauma-/stress-related disorders) and illness outcomes (self-harm and suicide) during periods of economic recession. Articles were limited to publication from 2008 to 2020, available online in English, and utilizing outcome measures specific to the disorders and outcomes specified above. A significant relationship was found between periods of economic recession and increased depressive symptoms, self-harming behaviour, and suicide during and following periods of recession. Results suggest that existing models for mental health support and strategies for suicide prevention may be less effective than they are in non-recession times. It may be prudent to focus public education and medical treatments on raising awareness and access to supports for populations at higher risk, including those vulnerable to the impacts of job or income loss due to low socioeconomic status preceding the recession or high levels of financial strain, those supporting others financially, approaching retirement, and those in countries with limited social safety nets. Policy makers should be aware of the potential protective nature of unemployment safeguards and labour program investment in mitigating these negative impacts.

597416,CT screening for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Malaria prevalence in Cameroon is a major public health problem both at the regional and urban-rural geographic scale. In 2016, an estimated 1.6 million confirmed cases, and 18,738 cases were reported in health facilities and communities respectively, with about 8000 estimated deaths. Several studies have estimated malaria prevalence in Cameroon using the analytical techniques at the regional scale. We aimed at identifying malaria clusters and hotspots at the urban-rural geographic scale from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for households between 2000 and 2015 using ArcGIS for intervention programs. METHODS: To identify malaria hotspots and analyze the pattern of distribution, we used the optimized hotspots toolset and spatial autocorrelation respectively in ArcGIS 10.3 for desktop. We also used Pearson’s Correlation analysis to identify associative environmental factors using the R-software 3.4.1. RESULTS: The spatial distribution of malaria showed statistically significant clustered pattern for the year 2000 and 2015 with Moran’s indexes 0.126 (P < 0.001) and 0.187 (P < 0.001) respectively. Meanwhile, the years 2005 and 2010 with Moran’s indexes 0.001 (P = 0.488) and 0.002 (P = 0.318) respectively, had a random malaria distribution pattern. There exist varying degrees of malaria clusters and statistically significant hotspots in the urban-rural areas of the 12 administrative regions. Malaria cases were associated with population density and some environmental covariates; rainfall, enhanced vegetation index and composite lights (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study identified urban-rural areas with high and low malaria clusters and hotspots. Our maps can be used as supportive tools for effective malaria control and elimination, and investments in malaria programs and research, malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment, surveillance, should pay more attention to urban-rural geographic scale.","Tewara, Marlvin Anemey; Mbah-Fongkimeh, Prisca Ngetemalah; Dayimu, Alimu; Kang, Fengling; Xue, Fuzhong",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3534-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526507/,298

To address these challenges, the following recommended actions should be considered: (1) promote the adaptation of sexual and reproductive health and rights service packages at primary healthcare level to integrate self-care interventions (2) govern innovative people-centered care channels including self-care interventions; and (3) engage in a dialogue with civil society and communities to meet needs, raise public awareness and generate demand.","Abou-Taleb, Hala; Mohamed, Nada; Gholbzouri, Karima; Scolaro, Elisa; Ezzeddine, Inaya; Alouini, Souhail; Hagrass, Heba; Morshed, Magdy; Datta, Neil",Health Research Policy and Systems,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00689-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882960/; https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12961-021-00689-y,298

601292,Patient Contact Recall after SARS Exposure,2005-04-11,"A novel titanium dioxide-coated cordierite foam (TiO(2)/cordierite foam) was developed for use in air cleaners. By a simple impregnation procedure, TiO(2) nanoparticles were immobilized firmly onto the surface of a cordierite foam substrate through high-temperature (500 °C) calcination. The strong bactericidal performance of the fabricated foam was evaluated by a newly developed test method for complex three-dimensional through-pore structures. This method could trace 5–6 log units of decrease in bacterial cell numbers in an air environment, thus meeting the criteria of both the JIS and ISO standard test methods. With 0.25 mW cm(−2) of UV-A irradiation for 24 h, the bactericidal rate of the TiO(2)/cordierite foam exceeded 99.9% for five types of airborne or droplet-based infectious pathogens: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The results of repeat testing, where the same sample was used three times, revealed that the bactericidal rate for E. coli was maintained at 99.9% in the second and third use, indicating that the TiO(2)/cordierite foam possesses a long-term bactericidal action. The TiO(2)/cordierite foam also exhibited a high photocatalytic degradation capability on gaseous acetaldehyde, which is associated with sick building syndrome, and volatile organic compounds to generate CO(2) and H(2)O. The results demonstrated that TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam has great potential for use in air-cleaning filters with not only high bactericidal performance to remove pathogens in the air and in droplets, but also strong decontaminating and deodorizing functionality.","Yao, Yanyan; Ochiai, Tsuyoshi; Ishiguro, Hitoshi; Nakano, Ryuichi; Kubota, Yoshinobu",Appl Catal B,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337311002967; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926337311002967; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288263/,298

Accordingly, this study presents an empirical learning package to support teachers, who perform frontline work in schools, in coping with stress, preventing burnout, improving their information and communications technology (ICT) competency, and introducing the principles of emotional intelligence (EI) in the classroom. The participants included 141 primary school teachers (M = 38.4 years, SD = 6.84; 54.6% women). They were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group participated in the 14-week teacher training program, whereas the control group did not participate in the program or receive any other training during the intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (time x group) was performed to identify the effects of the teacher training program. Teachers who participated in the training program evaluated it positively and showed significant differences compared to the control group in their abilities to cope with stress and avoid burnout, their ICT competency, and their introduction of EI in the classroom.

Algorithmic conversion of DNA sequence data to sound—sonification—represents an alternative means of representation that uses a different range of human sensory perception. We propose that sonification has value for public engagement with DNA sequence information because it has potential to be entertaining as well as informative. We conduct preliminary work to explore the potential of DNA sequence sonification in public engagement with bioinformatics. We apply a simple sonification technique for DNA, in which each DNA base is represented by a specific note. Additionally, a beat may be added to indicate codon boundaries or for musical effect. We report a brief analysis from public engagement events we conducted that featured this method of sonification. RESULTS: We report on use of DNA sequence sonification at two public events. Sonification has potential in public engagement with bioinformatics, both as a means of data representation and as a means to attract audience to a drop-in stand. We also discuss further directions for research on integration of sonification into bioinformatics public engagement and education.","Plaisier, Heleen; Meagher, Thomas R.; Barker, Daniel",BMC Res Notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-021-05685-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266480/,298

Twelve virus-specific oligonucleotide probes for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were divided into a high GC content group (≥ 50%) and a low GC content group (< 50%), and spotted onto four different chemically-modified glass surfaces: a poly-amine coating activated by 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (Poly-Amine surface), an acrylic acid-co-acrylamide copolymer coating activated by 1-(3-dimethylamino propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide (AACA-Copolymer surface), a commercial Corning CMT-GAPS amino surface, and a Telechem SuperAmine amino surface. RNA samples from cultured SARS-CoV strain were labelled using direct cDNA labelling with restriction display in a single colour format. The background-subtracted signal intensities were analysed using two-way analysis of variance. The effects of glass surfaces on background-subtracted signal intensities were significant (p=0.003). Multiple comparisons showed that differences existed mainly between the AACA-Copolymer surface and the other glass surfaces, and that the AACA-Copolymer surface had the highest background-subtracted signal intensity. The probe GC content had no significant effect on signal intensities in the narrow range of GC content represented (p=0.07). The results suggested that the AACA-Copolymer surface may be a novel choice of microorganism survey based on long oligonucleotide microarray.","Mo, Xiaoyang; Wu, Qinghua; Hu, Junjian; Ma, Wenli; Wei, Min; Yuan, Wuzhou; Wang, Yuequn; Li, Yongqin; Deng, Yun; Wu, Xiushan",Ann Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226355/; https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03175336,298

Confusion over differences between federal and total spending and effects of lower patient cost sharing gets in the way of “apples-to-apples” comparisons. Key areas with potential to lower costs are lower administrative costs and lower provider prices. But cost reduction would likely be smaller than some envision, especially in the price area because of the need for a long process to gradually allow providers to adjust to lower prices and Americans' unique attitudes toward regulation.","Ginsburg, Paul B.",J Ambul Care Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467433/; https://doi.org/10.1097/jac.0000000000000338,298

Evolutionary analysis of data such as DNA sequences is highly important in biological studies. As alignment methods are ineffective for analyzing large-scale data due to their inherently high costs, alignment-free methods have recently attracted attention in the field of bioinformatics. In this paper, we introduce a new positional correlation natural vector (PCNV) method that involves converting a DNA sequence into an 18-dimensional numerical feature vector. Using frequency and position correlation to represent the nucleotide distribution, it is possible to obtain a PCNV for a DNA sequence. This new numerical vector design uses six suitable features to characterize the correlation among nucleotide positions in sequences. PCNV is also very easy to compute and can be used for rapid genome comparison. To test our novel method, we performed phylogenetic analysis with several viral and bacterial genome datasets with PCNV. For comparison, an alignment-based method, Bayesian inference, and two alignment-free methods, feature frequency profile and natural vector, were performed using the same datasets. We found that the PCNV technique is fast and accurate when used for phylogenetic analysis and classification of viruses and bacteria.","He, Lily; Dong, Rui; He, Rong Lucy; Yau, Stephen S.-T.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21113859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32485813/,298
606531,Macrolides May Prevent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Entry into Cells: A Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship Study and Experimental Validation,2021-03-18,"In around 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) symptoms are complicated with a severe lung damage called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is often lethal. ARDS is mainly associated with an uncontrolled overproduction of immune cells and cytokines, called “cytokine storm syndrome”; it appears 7–15 days following the onset of symptoms, leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure. Because they are well-known metabolic precursors of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LC-PUFAs) could help improve the resolution of the inflammatory balance, limiting therefore the level and duration of the critical inflammatory period. Omega-3 LC-PUFAs may also interact at different stages of the viral infection, notably on the virus entry and replication. In the absence of demonstrated treatment and while waiting for vaccine possibility, the use of omega-3 LC-PUFAs deserve therefore to be considered, based on previous clinical studies suggesting that omega-3 supplementation could improve clinical outcomes of critically ill patients at the acute phase of ARDS. In this context, it is crucial to remind that the omega-3 PUFA dietary intake levels in Western countries remains largely below the current recommendations, considering both the omega-3 precursor α-linolenic acid (ALA) and long chain derivatives such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). An optimized omega-3 PUFAs status could be helpful to prevent infectious diseases, including Covid-19.","Weill, Pierre; Plissonneau, Claire; Legrand, Philippe; Rioux, Vincent; Thibault, Ronan",Biochimie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920170/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908420302091?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908420302091,298

Sunlight is known to be the natural energy source that degrades plastic waste at a very slow rate. Mimicking the role of sunlight, the photocatalytic degradation process could significantly accelerate the degradation rate thanks to the photocatalyst that drastically facilitates the photochemical reactions involved in the degradation process. This mini review begins with an introduction to the chemical compositions of the common plastic waste. The mechanisms of photodegradation of polymers in general were then revisited. Afterwards, a few photocatalysts were introduced with an emphasis on titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), which is the most frequently used photocatalyst. The roles of TiO(2) photocatalyst in the photodegradation process were then elaborated, followed by the recent advances of photocatalytic degradation of various plastic waste. Lastly, our perspectives on the future research directions of photocatalytic plastic degradation are present. Herein, the importance of catalytic photodegradation is emphasized to inspire research on developing new photocatalysts and new processes for decomposition of plastic waste, and then to increase its recycling rate particularly in the current pandemic with the ever-increasing generation of plastic waste.","Lee, Qian Ying; Li, Hong",Micromachines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/mi12080907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442528/,298

In this study, a single olecranon honey peach with a round-type fruit was observed in our fruit orchard. To explore the genetic mechanism of olecranon formation, we performed full-length transcriptome sequencing analysis of olecranon and round peaches as well as a genome-wide association study of the association of olecranon-type trait loci. RESULTS: The gene locus was 26,924,482 base pairs in NC_034014.1. Transcriptome sequencing showed that the clean sequencing data of each sample reached 7.10GB, with 14,360 genes and 23,167 transcripts expressed in both the olecranon honey peach and round peach. Among the 11 differentially expressed genes selected as candidate genes, six were highly expressed in olecranon peach and named as LOC18775282, LOC18772209, LOC18773929, LOC18772013, LOC18773401, and ONT.13798.5.

Whereas “downstream” KPIs are essential to evaluate and adapt hospital organization, “upstream” KPIs are the most appropriate to decide on the strength of restrictions such as lockdown set up and evaluate their effectiveness. Here, we suggested tools derived from pharmacokinetic calculations to improve understanding the epidemic progression. From the time course of the number of new cases of SARS-coV-2 infection in the population, it is possible to calculate the infection rate constant using a simple linear regression and determine its corresponding half-life. This epidemic regression half-life is helpful to measure the potential benefits of restriction measures and to estimate the adequate duration of lockdown if implemented by policymakers in relation to the decided public health objectives. In France, during the first lockdown, we reported an epidemic half-life of 10 days. Our tools allow clearly acknowledging that the zero-COVID target is difficult to reach after a period of lockdown as seven half-lives are required to clear 99.2% of the epidemic and more than 10 half-lives to almost reach the objective of eliminating 100% of the contaminations.","Mégarbane, Bruno; Bourasset, Fanchon; Scherrmann, Jean-Michel",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s44197-021-00007-3,298

The results showed that all eight strains were genetically and serotypically different from the strain ck/CH/LDL/140520. Furthermore, neither the vaccine strains nor the attenuated viruses could provide complete respiratory protection of chickens against a challenge with the ck/CH/LDL/140520 strain, indicating that it is necessary to develop new live vaccines or to evaluate the use of established vaccines in combination to control naturally recombinant TW I-type IBV strains in the future.

Refugees are, in general, at greater risk of poor health outcomes when contracting Covid-19, exacerbated by poor living conditions and difficulties in accessing healthcare. The longer-term social consequences of the pandemic also disproportionately impact refugees, including social isolation, unemployment, and difficulties to obtain correct health information. The aim of this paper is to review the social and health consequences that Covid-19 has brought to the refugees residing in Sweden. This needs to be emphasized in order to mitigate against these likely consequences and improve the overall well-being among such a highly vulnerable group in society. As Covid-19 demonstrates, human health needs to be understood holistically, meaning that the vulnerability of any individuals, or even nations, is a vulnerability for the whole population requiring urgent action.","Elisabeth, Mangrio; Maneesh, Paul-Satyaseela; Michael, Strange",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.574334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194974/,298
618523,Evolution of SARS-CoV-2: A prediction on the lineages and vaccine effectiveness,2021-02-04,"PURPOSE: Psychological distress is common in patients with cancer and is associated with lower quality-of-life (QOL). Although distress among oncology outpatients undergoing standard therapy has been widely studied, few studies have evaluated distress among patients enrolling on Phase I therapeutic clinical trials. Thus, we aimed to characterize levels of distress and types of stressors in patients enrolling on Phase I clinical trials. METHODS: Participants completed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT) and Problem list and measures of anxiety and depression at the time of Phase I clinical trial initiation. RESULTS: We enrolled 87 patients (95% with metastatic/incurable disease) who were initiating a Phase I clinical trial. Analyses revealed a high prevalence of distress (51%) and anxiety (28%). There were significant correlations between overall distress and practical problems (r = 0.31, p = 0.016), family problems (r = 0.35, p = 0.006), and emotional problems (r = 0.64, p < 0.001), but not physical problems (r = 0.17, p = 0.206). CONCLUSIONS: Patients may be better prepared to manage physical stressors but not practical, emotional, or family stressors at the time of Phase I trial enrollment. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Phase I trial patients experience high levels of distress which may be due to the rigors of previous therapies therapy and related emotional and social stressors related to the poor prognosis of their advanced cancer diagnosis. Distress may go unidentified without screening which is not standard practice at the time of Phase I trial consideration. Future studies should evaluate strategies to routinely identify and intervene upon addressable stressors in patients participating in Phase I clinical trials.","Hunt, Alexandra; Handorf, Elizabeth; Blau, Matthew; Chertock, Yana; Fang, Carolyn; Hall, Michael J; Jain, Rishi",J Cancer Surviv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33713303/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-021-01014-w,298

We conduct a rapid virtual audit of pandemic related press briefings and press conferences issued by governments and international organizations in order to assess if responses have been inclusive to the hearing-impaired communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We analyze COVID-19 press conferences and press briefings issued during Feb-May 2020, for over 123 LMICs and for international organizations (e.g. the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization (WHO)). Our virtual audit shows that only 65% of countries have a sign language interpreter (SLI) present in COVID-19 press briefings and conferences. This number is smaller in low-income countries (41%) and Sub-Saharan African countries (54%). Surprisingly, none of the international organizations including the WHO has a SLI present during COVID-19 press briefings. We recommend all countries and international organizations to reconsider ways to make press conferences accessible to a wide audience in general, and to the hearing impaired communities in particular by including a SLI during their COVID-19 briefings, a primary step towards upholding the sustainable development pledge of “no one gets left behind.”","Yap, Jaclyn; Chaudhry, Vandana; Jha, Chandan; Mani, Subha; Mitra, Sophie",World Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834393/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20302497?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105122; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20302497,298
620003,Asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in a Rehabilitation Facility: Evolution of the Presence of Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 and Serological Antibody Responses,2020-10-16,"RATIONALE FOR THE REVIEW: Air travel may be associated with viruses spread via infected passengers and potentially through in-flight transmission. Given the novelty of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, transmission associated with air travel is based on transmission dynamics of other respiratory viruses. Our objective was to provide a rapid summary and evaluation of relevant data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft, report policy implications and to highlight research gaps requiring urgent attention. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases (1 February 2020–27 January 2021) and included studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft. We assessed study quality based on five criteria and reported important findings. KEY FINDINGS: We included 18 studies on in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission (130 unique flights) and 2 studies on wastewater from aircraft. The quality of evidence from most published studies was low. Two wastewater studies reported PCR-positive samples with high cycle threshold values (33–39). Index case definition was heterogeneous across studies. The proportion of contacts traced ranged from 0.68 to 100%. Authors traced 2800/19 729 passengers, 140/180 crew members and 8/8 medical staff. Altogether, 273 index cases were reported, with 64 secondary cases. Three studies, each investigating one flight, reported no secondary cases. Secondary attack rate among studies following up >80% of passengers and crew (including data on 10 flights) varied between 0 and 8.2%. The studies reported on the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Two studies performed viral cultures with 10 positive results. Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in individuals from four flights. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted during aircraft travel, but published data do not permit any conclusive assessment of likelihood and extent. The variation in design and methodology restricts the comparison of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting future studies of transmission on aircraft should be developed.","Rosca, Elena C; Heneghan, Carl; Spencer, Elizabeth A; Brassey, Jon; Plüddemann, Annette; Onakpoya, Igho J; Evans, David H; Conly, John M; Jefferson, Tom",J Travel Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taab133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480171/,298

Unfortunately, several of these high-profile publications were retracted because of concerns regarding the soundness and quality of the studies and the EHR data they purported to analyze. These retractions highlight that although a small community of EHR informatics experts can readily identify strengths and flaws in EHR-derived studies, many medical editorial teams and otherwise sophisticated medical readers lack the framework to fully critically appraise these studies. In addition, conventional statistical analyses cannot overcome the need for an understanding of the opportunities and limitations of EHR-derived studies. We distill here from the broader informatics literature six key considerations that are crucial for appraising studies utilizing EHR data: data completeness, data collection and handling (eg, transformation), data type (ie, codified, textual), robustness of methods against EHR variability (within and across institutions, countries, and time), transparency of data and analytic code, and the multidisciplinary approach. These considerations will inform researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders as to the recommended best practices in reviewing manuscripts, grants, and other outputs from EHR-data derived studies, and thereby promote and foster rigor, quality, and reliability of this rapidly growing field.","Kohane, Isaac S; Aronow, Bruce J; Avillach, Paul; Beaulieu-Jones, Brett K; Bellazzi, Riccardo; Bradford, Robert L; Brat, Gabriel A; Cannataro, Mario; Cimino, James J; García-Barrio, Noelia; Gehlenborg, Nils; Ghassemi, Marzyeh; Gutiérrez-Sacristán, Alba; Hanauer, David A; Holmes, John H; Hong, Chuan; Klann, Jeffrey G; Loh, Ne Hooi Will; Luo, Yuan; Mandl, Kenneth D; Daniar, Mohamad; Moore, Jason H; Murphy, Shawn N; Neuraz, Antoine; Ngiam, Kee Yuan; Omenn, Gilbert S; Palmer, Nathan; Patel, Lav P; Pedrera-Jiménez, Miguel; Sliz, Piotr; South, Andrew M; Tan, Amelia Li Min; Taylor, Deanne M; Taylor, Bradley W; Torti, Carlo; Vallejos, Andrew K; Wagholikar, Kavishwar B; Weber, Griffin M; Cai, Tianxi",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600347/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22219,298

With an estimated annual budget of €20 billion, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 has set an ambitious goal of classifying 30% of its land and sea territory as Protected Areas and ensuring no deterioration in conservation trends and the status of protected species. We analysed LIFE projects focused on animals from 1992 to 2018 and found that investment in vertebrates was six times higher than that for invertebrates (€970 versus €150 million), with birds and mammals alone accounting for 72% of species and 75% of the total budget. In relative terms, investment per species towards vertebrates has been 468 times higher than that for invertebrates. Using a trait-based approach, we show that conservation effort is primarily explained by species' popularity rather than extinction risk or body size. Therefore, we propose a roadmap to achieve unbiased conservation targets for 2030 and beyond.","Mammola, Stefano; Riccardi, Nicoletta; Prié, Vincent; Correia, Ricardo; Cardoso, Pedro; Lopes-Lima, Manuel; Sousa, Ronaldo",Proc Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.2166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290682/,298

Monitoring and control of abuse on social media, especially during pandemics such as COVID-19, can help in keeping the public sentiment and morale positive. Developing the fear and hate detection methods based on machine learning requires labelled data. However, obtaining the labelled data in suddenly changed circumstances as a pandemic is expensive and acquiring them in a short time is impractical. Related labelled hate data from other domains or previous incidents may be available. However, the predictive accuracy of these hate detection models decreases significantly if the data distribution of the target domain, where the prediction will be applied, is different. To address this problem, we propose a novel concept of unsupervised progressive domain adaptation based on a deep-learning language model generated through multiple text datasets. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed method in hate speech and fear detection on the tweets collection during COVID-19 where the labelled information is unavailable.","Bashar, Md Abul; Nayak, Richi; Luong, Khanh; Balasubramaniam, Thirunavukarasu",Soc Netw Anal Min,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341673/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-021-00780-w,298
628755,Control of Middle East respiratory syndrome,2017-08-01,"Coronaviruses (CoV) and picornaviruses are plus-strand RNA viruses that use 5′ cap-dependent and cap-independent strategies, respectively, for viral mRNA translation initiation. Here, we analyzed the effects of the plant compound silvestrol, a specific inhibitor of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, on viral translation using a dual luciferase assay and virus-infected primary cells. Silvestrol was recently shown to have potent antiviral activity in Ebola virus-infected human macrophages. We found that silvestrol is also a potent inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. EC(50) values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM silvestrol were determined for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, respectively. For the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells. Silvestrol strongly inhibits the expression of CoV structural and nonstructural proteins (N, nsp8) and the formation of viral replication/transcription complexes. Furthermore, potential antiviral effects against human rhinovirus (HRV) A1 and poliovirus type 1 (PV), representing different species in the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae), were investigated. The two viruses employ an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation initiation mechanism. For PV, which is known to require the activity of eIF4A, an EC(50) value of 20 nM silvestrol was determined in MRC-5 cells. The higher EC(50) value of 100 nM measured for HRV A1 indicates a less critical role of eIF4A activity in HRV A1 IRES-mediated translation initiation. Taken together, the data reveal a broad-spectrum antiviral activity of silvestrol in infected primary cells by inhibiting eIF4A-dependent viral mRNA translation.","Müller, Christin; Schulte, Falk W.; Lange-Grünweller, Kerstin; Obermann, Wiebke; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Pleschka, Stephan; Ziebuhr, John; Hartmann, Roland K.; Grünweller, Arnold",Antiviral Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.12.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217306381; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217306381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258862/,298
628881,"Secondary Household Transmission of SARS, Singapore",2004-02-11,"The coronavirus spike glycoprotein, located on the virion surface, is the key mediator of cell entry. As such, it is an attractive target for the development of protective antibodies and vaccines. Here we describe two human monoclonal antibodies, 1.6C7 and 28D9, that display a remarkable cross-reactivity against distinct species from three Betacoronavirus subgenera, capable of binding the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Both antibodies, derived from immunized transgenic mice carrying a human immunoglobulin repertoire, blocked MERS-CoV infection in cells, whereas 28D9 also showed weak cross-neutralizing potential against HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a neutralization-sensitive virus pseudotyping system, but not against authentic virus. Both cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies were found to target the stem helix in the spike protein S2 fusion subunit which, in the prefusion conformation of trimeric spike, forms a surface exposed membrane-proximal helical bundle, that is antibody-accessible. We demonstrate that administration of these antibodies in mice protects from a lethal MERS-CoV challenge in both prophylactic and/or therapeutic models. Collectively, these antibodies delineate a conserved, immunogenic and vulnerabe site on the spike protein which spurs the development of broad-range diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures against coronaviruses.","Wang, Chunyan; van Haperen, Rien; Gutiérrez-Álvarez, Javier; Li, Wentao; Okba, Nisreen M.A.; Albulescu, Irina; Widjaja, Ivy; van Dieren, Brenda; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Sola, Isabel; Hurdiss, Daniel L.; Daramola, Olalekan; Grosveld, Frank; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; Haagmans, Bart L.; Enjuanes, Luis; Drabek, Dubravka; Bosch, Berend-Jan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.20.346916,298

RESULTS: Beyond limitations intrinsic to study design, including time and budget constraints, the study sample underrepresents unpaid caregivers from minority ethnocultural backgrounds due to differences in conceptions of caregiving across minority cultures, the time-consuming nature of caregiving that disproportionately affects minority groups, and a propensity to avoid research which is rooted in tokenism.

631415,Analysis of codon usage of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its adaptability in dog,2020-08-07,"BACKGROUND: Survival rates for lymphoma are highest amongst hematological malignancies. In 2019, it was estimated that over 6400 Australians were diagnosed with lymphoma, a group of hematological malignancies with a high 5-year survival rate of ~ 76%. There is an increased focus on the promotion of wellness in survivorship and active approaches to reducing morbidity related to treatment; however, current models of follow-up care heavily rely on hospital-based specialist-led care. Maximizing the potential of general practitioners (GPs) in the ongoing management of cancer is consistent with the national health reform principles and the Cancer Council Australia’s Optimal Care Pathways. GPs are well positioned to provide guideline-based follow-up care and are more likely to address comorbidities and psychosocial issues and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors. This study aims to test the feasibility of the GOSPEL I intervention for implementing an integrated, shared care model in which cancer center specialists and community-based GPs collaborate to provide survivorship care for patients with lymphoma. METHODS: We describe a protocol for a phase II, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms and a 1:1 allocation. Sixty patients with Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma will be randomized to usual specialist-led follow-up care (as determined by the treating hematologists) or a shared follow-up care intervention (i.e., GOSPEL I). GOSPEL I is a nurse-enabled, pre-specified shared care pathway with follow-up responsibilities shared between cancer center specialists (i.e., hematologists and specialist cancer nurses) and GPs. Outcome measures assess feasibility as well as a range of patient-reported outcomes including health-related quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Lymphoma, patient experience of care, symptom distress, comorbidity burden, dietary intake, physical activity behaviors, financial distress/interference, and satisfaction of care. Safety indicators including hospital admission and unscheduled lymphoma clinic visits as well as process outcomes such as intervention fidelity and economic indicators will be analyzed. DISCUSSION: This trial is designed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a new model of shared care for lymphoma survivors. Patient-reported outcomes as well as potential barriers to implementation will be analyzed to inform a larger definitive clinical trial testing the effects and implementation of a shared care model on health-related quality of life of lymphoma survivors.

Supported by the conservation of resources theory, the current study extends the literature on problematic social media usage during COVID-19 by investigating its association with emotional and mental health outcomes. In a moderated mediation model, this study proposes that problematic social media use by workers during COVID-19 is linked to fear of COVID-19, which is further associated with depression. The current study tested trait mindfulness as an important personal resource that may be associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 despite problematic social media use. The study collected temporally separate data to avoid common method bias. Pakistani employees (N = 267) working in different organizations completed a series of survey questionnaires. The results supported the moderated mediation model, showing that problematic social media use during the current pandemic is linked to fear of COVID-19 and depression among employees. Furthermore, trait mindfulness was found to be an important buffer, reducing the negative indirect association between problematic social media use and depression through fear of COVID-19.

Modeling of such diseases can be extremely important in the prediction of their impact. While classic, statistical, modeling can provide satisfactory models, it can also fail to comprehend the intricacies contained within the data. In this paper, authors use a publicly available dataset, containing information on infected, recovered, and deceased patients in 406 locations over 51 days (22nd January 2020 to 12th March 2020). This dataset, intended to be a time-series dataset, is transformed into a regression dataset and used in training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN). The aim of training is to achieve a worldwide model of the maximal number of patients across all locations in each time unit. Hyperparameters of the MLP are varied using a grid search algorithm, with a total of 5376 hyperparameter combinations. Using those combinations, a total of 48384 ANNs are trained (16128 for each patient group—deceased, recovered, and infected), and each model is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2).

We used an ELISA method that measured IgG against anti-Spike 1, and a chemiluminescence immunoassay that measured IgG anti-RBD. In the patients, the antibodies concentrations tended to decline after a few months, with both the methods, but they persisted relatively high up to nearly a year after the symptoms. In the vaccinated subjects, the antibodies were already detectable after the first dose, but after the booster, they showed a significant increase. However, the decrease was rapid, given that 3 months after the second vaccination, they were reduced to less than a quarter. The conversion of the results into BAU units improves the relationship between the two methods. However, in the vaccinated subjects, there was no evidence of proportional error after the conversion, while in the patients, the difference between the two methods remained significant.","Dittadi, Ruggero; Seguso, Mara; Bertoli, Isabella; Afshar, Haleh; Carraro, Paolo",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574052/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11091709,298
633448,"SARS-CoV-2 Superspread in Fitness Center, Hong Kong, China, March 2021",2021-08-11,"Binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor triggers translocation of the virus into cells. Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds to a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.","Mehdipour, Ahmad Reza; Hummer, Gerhard",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100425118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903171/,298

Together with the global trend of an aging population, it has become highly important to propose value-creating, yet cost-efficient digital solutions for healthcare systems. These solutions should provide effective means of healthcare services in both the hospital and home care scenarios. In this paper, we focused on the latter case, where the goal was to provide easy-to-use, reliable, and secure remote monitoring and aid for elderly persons at their home. We proposed a framework to integrate the capabilities of edge computing and blockchain technology to address some of the key requirements of smart remote healthcare systems, such as long operating times, low cost, resilience to network problems, security, and trust in highly dynamic network conditions. In order to assess the feasibility of our approach, we evaluated the performance of our framework in terms of latency, power consumption, network utilization, and computational load, compared to a scenario where no blockchain was used.","Ejaz, Muneeb; Kumar, Tanesh; Kovacevic, Ivana; Ylianttila, Mika; Harjula, Erkki",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916700/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21072502,298

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen of swine with a worldwide distribution. Here, we implemented and described an approach to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV following its emergence in the pig population. We performed an integrated analysis of full genome sequence data from 21 newly sequenced viruses, along with comprehensive epidemiological surveillance data collected globally over the last 15 years. We found four distinct phylogenetic lineages of PDCoV, which differ in their geographic circulation patterns. Interestingly, we identified more frequent intra- and interlineage recombination and higher virus genetic diversity in the Chinese lineages compared with the USA lineage where pigs are raised in different farming systems and ecological environments. Most recombination breakpoints are located in the ORF1ab gene rather than in genes encoding structural proteins. We also identified five amino acids under positive selection in the spike protein suggesting a role for adaptive evolution. According to structural mapping, three positively selected sites are located in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, which is the most likely involved in binding to a carbohydrate receptor, whereas the other two are located in or near the fusion peptide of the S2 subunit and thus might affect membrane fusion. Finally, our phylogeographic investigations highlighted notable South-North transmission as well as frequent long-distance dispersal events in China that could implicate human-mediated transmission. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution and dispersal of PDCoV that contribute to our understanding of the critical factors involved in CoVs emergence.","He, Wan-Ting; Ji, Xiang; He, Wei; Dellicour, Simon; Wang, Shilei; Li, Gairu; Zhang, Letian; Gilbert, Marius; Zhu, Henan; Xing, Gang; Veit, Michael; Huang, Zhen; Han, Guan-Zhu; Huang, Yaowei; Suchard, Marc A; Baele, Guy; Lemey, Philippe; Su, Shuo",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407507/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa117,298

We present an unobtrusive sensor system based on light detection and ranging sensor technology for use in home-like environments. In our evaluation, we compared six different gait parameters, based on recordings from 25 different people performing eight different walks each, resulting in 200 unique measurements. We compared the proposed sensor system against two state-of-the art technologies, a pressure mat and a set of inertial measurement unit sensors. In addition to test usability and long-term measurement, multi-hour recordings were conducted. Our evaluation showed very high correlation (r>0.95) with the gold standards across all assessed gait parameters except for cycle time (r=0.91). Similarly, the coefficient of determination was high (R2>0.9) for all gait parameters except cycle time. The highest correlation was achieved for stride length and velocity (r≥0.98,R2≥0.95). Furthermore, the multi-hour recordings did not show the systematic drift of measurements over time.

640022,Crystal Structure of Non-Structural Protein 10 from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2,2020-10-06,"The changing nature of the corona virus of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to the world health systems. New and virulent emerging spike gene variants, such as the UK 20I/501Y.V1 and South African 20H/501Y.V2, could jeopardize global efforts to produce immunity and reduce mortality. These challenges require effective real-time genomic surveillance solutions that the medical community can quickly adopt. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host receptor recognition and entry into the cell and therefore, it is most susceptible to generation of variants with increased transmissibility and pathogenicity. The spike protein is also the primary target of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients and the most common antigen for induction of effective vaccine immunity. Therefore, tight monitoring of the spike protein gene variants is key to mitigating COVID-19 spread and vaccine escape mutants. Currently, the ARTIC method for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is applied worldwide. However, this method commonly requires more than 96 hours (4-5 days) from start to finish and at present high sample sequence demands, sequencing resources are quickly exhausted. In this work, we present HiSpike, a method for high-throughput targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of the spike gene. This simple three-step method can be completed in less than 30 hours and can sequence 10-fold more samples compared to the conventional ARTIC method and at a fraction of the cost. HiSpike was proven valid, and has identified, at high quality, multiple spike variants from real-time field samples, such as the UK and the South African variants. This method will certainly be effective in discovering future spike mutations. Therefore, running HiSpike for full sequencing of the spike gene of all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples could be considered for near real-time detection of known and emerging spike mutations as they evolve. HiSpike provides affordable sequencing options to help laboratories conserve resources, hence it provides a tool for widespread monitoring, that can support critical knowledge-based decisions.","Fass, E.; Zizelski Valenci, G.; Rubinstein, M.; Freidlin, P.

Approximately 15% of the patients will develop severe complications such as multiple organ disease syndrome related to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can remove inflammatory cytokines through filtration or adsorption. We evaluated the effectiveness of CRRT in COVID-19 patients with CRS. Methods: This retrospective, multicenter, descriptive study included 83 patients with CRS from three hospitals in Wuhan. Results: In COVID-19 patients with CRS, the fatality rate was even higher in CRRT group (P=0.005). However, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, neutrophil counts, and D-dimer decreased after CRRT (P<0.05). Results of Lasso model showed that tracheotomy (β -1.31) and convalescent plasma (β -1.41) were the protective factors. In contrast, CRRT (β 1.07), respiratory failure (β 1.61), consolidation on lung CT (β 0.48), acute kidney injury (AKI) (β 0.47), and elevated neutrophil count (β 0.02) were the risk factors for death. Conclusions: Our results showed that although CRRT significantly reduced the inflammation, it did not decrease the fatality rate of patients with CRS. Therefore, the choice of CRRT indication, dialysis time and dialysis mode should be more careful and accurate in COVID-19 patients with CRS.","Xiang, Huiling; Song, Bin; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Jianduan; Xiong, Jing",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811755/; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202838,298
642531,Biomimetic Virus-Like Particles as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Diagnostic Tools,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: The global health emergency generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented challenge to health care workers, who are facing heavy workloads under psychologically difficult situations. Mental mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are now being widely deployed due to their attractive implementation features, despite the lack of evidence about their efficacy in this specific population and context. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational, mindfulness-based mHealth intervention to reduce mental health problems in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, parallel-group, controlled trial in Spain. Health care workers providing face-to-face health care to patients with COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (an app targeting emotional skills, healthy lifestyle behavior, burnout, and social support) or a control app (general recommendations about mental health care) for 2 weeks. The participants were blinded to their group allocation. Data were collected telephonically at baseline and after 2 weeks by trained health psychologists. The primary outcome was a composite of depression, anxiety, and stress (overall score on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 [DASS-21]). Secondary outcomes were insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey), posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and DASS-21 individual scale scores. Differences between groups were analyzed using general linear modeling according to an intention-to-treat protocol. Additionally, we measured the usability of the PsyCovidApp (System Usability Scale). The outcome data collectors and trial statisticians were unaware of the treatment allocation. RESULTS: Between May 14 and July 25, 2020, 482 health care workers were recruited and randomly assigned to PsyCovidApp (n=248) or the control app (n=234). At 2 weeks, complete outcome data were available for 436/482 participants (90.5%). No significant differences were observed between the groups at 2 weeks in the primary outcome (standardized mean difference –0.04; 95% CI –0.11 to 0.04; P=.15) or in the other outcomes. In our prespecified subgroup analyses, we observed significant improvements among health care workers consuming psychotropic medications (n=79) in the primary outcome (–0.29; 95% CI –0.48 to –0.09; P=.004), and in posttraumatic stress, insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Similarly, among health care workers receiving psychotherapy (n=43), we observed improvements in the primary outcome (–0.25; 95% CI –0.49 to –0.02; P=.02), and in insomnia, anxiety, and stress. The mean usability score of PsyCovidApp was high (87.21/100, SD 12.65). After the trial, 208/221 participants in the intervention group (94.1%) asked to regain access to PsyCovidApp, indicating high acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: In health care workers assisting patients with COVID-19 in Spain, PsyCovidApp, compared with a control app, reduced mental health problems at 2 weeks only among health care workers receiving psychotherapy or psychotropic medications.

Therefore, a new assay combining four targets in the form of the new Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2/Flu/RSV assay was evaluated. The assay was compared to the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV, Seegene Flu/RSV, influenza A/B r‐gene® and RSV/hMPV r‐gene®. A total of 295 nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were tested at four institutes throughout Europe including 72 samples positive for SARS‐CoV‐2, 65 for influenza A, 47 for influenza B, and 77 for RSV. The sensitivity of the new assay was above 95% for all targets, with the highest for SARS‐CoV‐2 (97.2%). The overall correlation of SARS‐CoV‐2 Ct values between Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 assay and Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2/Flu/RSV assay was high. The agreement between Ct values above 30 showed the multiplex giving higher Ct values for SARS‐CoV‐2 on average than the singleplex assay. In conclusion, the new assay is a rapid and reliable alternative with less hands‐on time for the detection of not one, but four upper respiratory tract pathogens that may circulate at the same time.","Wolters, Femke; Grünberg, Maria; Huber, Michael; Kessler, Harald H.; Prüller, Florian; Saleh, Lanja; Fébreau, Christine; Rahamat‐Langendoen, Janette; Thibault, Vincent; Melchers, Willem J.

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56°C prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies is still unclear. METHODS: By comparing the levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay RESULTS: We showed that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID‐19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non–COVID‐19 disease group (n = 9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cutoff value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false‐negative results of these samples. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended, and the possibility of false‐negative results should be considered if the sample was pre‐inactivated by heating.","Hu, Xiumei; An, Taixue; Situ, Bo; Hu, Yuhai; Ou, Zihao; Li, Qiang; He, Xiaojing; Zhang, Ye; Tian, Peifu; Sun, Dehua; Rui, Yongyu; Wang, Qian; Ding, Dan; Zheng, Lei",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594577/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23411,298

Such oligonucleotides were subsequently eluted from the gels and their nucleotide sequences determined. When oligonucleotide probes of those sequences were synthesized and used in a dot-blot hybridization assay, the probes lacked IBV strain-specificity and reacted with the RNAs of homologous as well as heterologous IBV strains. Based on these results, the methods used in this study need to be applied to a large number of oligonucleotide probes, to find one or a few that might be suitable as IBV strain- or serotype-specific oligonucleotide probes.","Karaca, Kemal; Palukaitis, Peter; Naqi, Syed",Journal of Virological Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016609349390040X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016609349390040X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8390475/,298

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the presence of viruses associated with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with ILI in Kampala and Entebbe between 14 August 2008 – 15 December 2008. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for detecting 12 respiratory viruses was used. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients (52.3% females) was enrolled; the median age was 6 years (range 1–70). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 172 (46.6%) cases and their prevalence were influenza A virus (19.2%), adenovirus (8.7%), human rhinovirus A (7.9%), coronavirus OC43 (4.3%), parainfluenza virus 1 (2.7%), parainfluenza virus 3 (2.7%), influenza B virus (2.2%), respiratory syncytial virus B (2.2%), human metapneumovirus (1.4%), respiratory syncytial virus A (1.1%), parainfluenza virus 2 (0.5%) and coronavirus 229E (0.5%).

Patients with substance use disorders (SUD) have long and costly hospitalisations and higher readmission rates compared to those without SUD. Hospitalisation presents an opportunity to diagnose and treat individuals with SUD and connect them to ongoing care. However, SUD care often remains unaddressed by hospital providers due to lack of a systems approach and addiction medicine knowledge, and is compounded by stigma. We present a blueprint to launching an interprofessional inpatient addiction care team embedded in the hospital medicine division of an urban, safety-net integrated health system. We describe key factors for successful implementation including: (1) demonstrating the scope and impact of SUD in our health system via a needs assessment; (2) aligning improvement areas with health system leadership priorities; (3) involving executive leadership to create goal and initiative alignment; and (4) obtaining seed funding for a pilot programme from our Medicaid health plan partner.

However, so far, limited evidence exists regarding long-term physiological, immunological, and neurodevelopmental modifications produced by the SARS-CoV-2 in the human maternal-fetal binomial and, particularly, in the offspring. Relevant findings derived from epidemiological and preclinical models show that a MIA is indeed linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring. We hypothesize that a gestational infection triggered by SARS-CoV-2 increases the risks leading to neurodevelopmental disorders of the newborn, which can affect childhood and the long-term quality of life. In particular, disruption of either the maternal or the fetal cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) could cause or exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 in the maternal-fetal binomial. From a translational perspective, in this paper, we discuss the possible manifestation of a MIA by SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent neurodevelopmental disorders considering the role of the fetal-maternal cytokine cross-talk and the CAP. Specifically, we highlight the urgent need of preclinical studies as well as multicenter and international databanks of maternal-fetal psychophysiological data obtained pre-, during, and post-infection by SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women and their offspring.","Reyes-Lagos, José Javier; Abarca-Castro, Eric Alonso; Echeverría, Juan Carlos; Mendieta-Zerón, Hugo; Vargas-Caraveo, Alejandra; Pacheco-López, Gustavo",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.614451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868085/,298

The aim of this study was an exploration of dilemmas experienced by Elderly Care Physicians (ECPs) as a result of the COVID-19 driven restrictive visiting policy. Setting and Participants ECPs working in Dutch NHs. Methods A qualitative exploratory study was performed using an open-ended questionnaire. A thematic analysis was applied. Data was collected between April 17 and May 10, 2020. Results Seventy-six ECPs answered the questionnaire describing a total of 114 cases in which they experienced a dilemma. Thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) The need for balancing safety for all through infection prevention measures versus quality of life of the individual residents and their loved ones; (2) The challenge of assessing the dying phase and how the allowed exception to the strict visitor restriction in the dying phase could be implemented; (3) The profound emotional impact on ECPs; (4) Many alternatives for visits highlight the wish to compensate for the absence of face to face contact opportunities. However, given the diversity of NH residents, alternatives were often only suitable for some of them. Conclusions and Implications ECPs reported that the restrictive visitor policy deeply impacts NHs residents, their loved ones and care professionals. The dilemmas encountered as a result of the policy highlight the wish by ECPs to offer solutions tailored to the individual residents. We identified an overview of aspects to consider when drafting future visiting policies for NHs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sizoo, Eefje M.; Monnier, Annelie A.; Bloemen, Maryam; Hertogh, Cees M.P.M.; Smalbrugge, Martin",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197412/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861020308999; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861020308999?v=s5,298

Many pathogens have developed mechanisms to escape from host defense response using the host membrane microdomain machinery. Lipid rafts play an important role in a variety of cellular functions and the benefit provided by interaction with lipid rafts can vary from one pathogen to another. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the involvement of membrane microdomains during infection of human endothelial cell by S. agalactiae. METHODS: The effects of cholesterol depletion and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation during S. agalactiae-human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) interaction were analysed by pre-treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) or LY294002 inhibitors, immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. The involvement of lipid rafts was analysed by colocalisation of bacteria with flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 using fluorescence confocal microscopy. FINDINGS: In this work, we demonstrated the importance of the integrity of lipid rafts microdomains and activation of PI3K/Akt pathway during invasion of S. agalactiae strain to HUVEC cells. Our results suggest the involvement of flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 during the invasion of S. agalactiae strain in HUVEC cells. CONCLUSIONS: The collection of our results suggests that lipid microdomain affects the interaction of S. agalactiae type III belonging to the hypervirulent ST-17 with HUVEC cells through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.","Ferreira, Beatriz Jandre; Lannes-Costa, Pamella Silva; Santos, Gabriela da Silva; Mermelstein, Cláudia; Einicker-Lamas, Marcelo; Nagao, Prescilla Emy",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32187326/; https://doi.org/10.1590/0074-02760190398,298

Furthermore, the presence of plasma-cells producing coronavirus-specific antibodies was evaluated in situ. Macrophages and neutrophils were demonstrated by an antibody against calprotectin (leukocyte protein L1, myeloid/histiocyte antigen), neutrophils were recognized due to their chloroacetate esterase activity, and B- and T-lymphocytes were identified by antibodies against the CD3 antigen and the CD45R antigen, respectively. Expression of viral antigen was immunohistologically demonstrated by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against coronavirus while coronavirus-specific antibodies in situ were identified by the application of feline coronavirus prior to the coronavirus antibody. Lesions were classified as diffuse alterations at serosal surfaces, granulomas with areas of necrosis, granulomas without extended necrosis, focal and perivascular lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates, and granulomatous-necrotizing vasculitis. Diffuse alterations on serosal surfaces were represented either by activated mesothelial cells with single coronavirus antigen-bearing macrophages or by layers of precipitated exudate containing single to numerous granulomas with areas of necrosis. In liver and spleen, the exudate was often underlaid by a small band of subcapsular B-cells with an occasional plasma-cell producing coronavirus-specific antibodies. In other locations, a variably broad band of B-cells and plasma-cells, often infiltrating between underlying muscle fibers, separated the exudate from the unaltered tissue. Some of these plasma-cells were positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies. In granulomas with areas of necrosis, the central necrosis was surrounded by macrophages usually expressing considerable amounts of viral antigen. Few B-cells and plasma-cells were found in the periphery. In granulomas without extended necrosis, the number of macrophages were lower. Only few macrophages expressing low amounts of viral antigen were present. B-cells and plasma-cells formed a broad rim. Few plasma-cells stained positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies. In both types of granulomas, few neutrophils were found between macrophages. Few T-cells were seen scattered throughout the lesions. Focal and perivascular lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates were mainly seen in omentum and leptomeninx. B-cells were the predominant cells; some plasma-cells were positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies. Viral antigen was not readily detected in these alterations. Granulomatous-necrotizing vasculitis was occasionally found in kidneys and leptomeninx. It was dominated by macrophages which often stained strongly positive for coronavirus antigen. Different types of alteration were often seen in the same animal and even the same tissue. There was no obvious correlation between the cat's age, gross pathological changes, and the histological types of alteration. Single plasma-cells positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies were found around blood vessels distant from inflammatory alterations, within the lung parenchyma, as infiltrating cells in the mucosa of the small intestine, and in spleen and mesenteric lymph node. Results show that alterations in FIP are heterogeneous concerning cellular composition and expression of viral antigen. The dominance of B-cells in part of the lesions together with the presence of plasma-cells positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies indicate that these cells may play a role in the maintenance of inflammatory processes in FIP.","Kipar, A; Bellmann, S; Kremendahl, J; Köhler, K; Reinacher, M",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242798001585; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242798001585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9839877/,298

The prevalence and severity of many infectious diseases is higher in older adults, and in addition to the acute disease, long-term sequelae, such as exacerbation of underlying chronic disease, onset of frailty or increased long-term care dependency, are frequent. Prevention of infections e.g. by vaccination is therefore an important measure to ensure healthy aging and preserve quality of life. Several vaccines are specifically recommended for older adults in many countries, and in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic older adults were among the first target groups for vaccination due to their high risk for severe disease. This review highlights clinical data on the influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae and herpes zoster vaccines, summarizes recent developments to improve vaccine efficacy, such as the use of adjuvants or higher antigen dose for influenza, and gives an overview of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development for older adults. Substantial research is ongoing to further improve vaccines, e.g. by developing universal influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to overcome the limitations of the current strain-specific vaccines, and to develop novel vaccines against pathogens, which cause considerable morbidity and mortality in older adults, but for which no vaccines are currently available.

Until now, it has been assumed that patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop antibodies as has been the case with other coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In the present study, we analyzed the development of antibodies in 77 patients with an oncologic diagnosis 26 days after positive RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV2. RT-qPCR and anti-SARS-CoV2-antibody methods from BGI (MGIEasy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay) were used, respectively, according to the manufacturers’ specifications. Surprisingly, antibody development was detected in only 6 of 77 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19. Despite multiple testing, the remaining patients did not show measurable antibody concentrations in subsequent tests. These results undermine the previous hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 infections are regularly associated with antibody development and cast doubt on the provided immunity to COVID-19. Understanding the adaptive and humoral response to SARS-CoV2 will play a key role in vaccine development and gaining further knowledge on the pathogenesis.","Hempel, Louisa; Molnar, Jakob; Robert, Sebastian; Veloso, Julia; Trepotec, Zeljka; Englisch, Sofie; Weinzierl, Philip; Schick, Cordula; Milani, Valeria; Schweneker, Katrin; Fleischmann, Bastian; Scheiber, Josef; Gandorfer, Beate; Kleespies, Axel; Hempel, Dirk; Riedmann, Kristina; Piehler, Armin",Semin Oncol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009377542030124X; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2020.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500147/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009377542030124X,298

METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we enrolled consecutive 540 adult patients who had COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method. Patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity. Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics, mortality rates, and mortality-associated factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 4.3% (23/540). Disease severity was mild in 40.9% (n = 221), severe in 53.7% (n = 290), and critical in 5.4% (n = 29) of the patients. There were significant differences among groups in terms of median white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte counts, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, albumin, D-dimer, ferritin, troponin, and fibrinogen levels. Furthermore, there were significant differences between surviving and non-surviving patient groups in terms of median WBC, hemoglobin, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, as well as CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, creatinine, albumin, D-dimer, and ferritin levels. CRP level (odds ratio [OR]: 1.020, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.009–1.032; p < 0.001), and CURB-65 score (OR: 4.004, 95% CI: 1,288–12,447; p = 0.017) were independently associated with disease severity and mortality. CONCLUSION: On admission, WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts can be used to predict disease severity in patients with COVID-19. CRP, ferritin, LDH, creatinine, troponin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and albumin levels can also be used to predict disease severity in these patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, by using logistic regression analysis and AUC curves, explored the relationship between biochemical indicators and nucleic acid positive duration, the severity of COVID-19, and hospital stay respectively. RESULTS: A total of two hundred and thirty-three patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. We found patients whose nucleic acid turned negative within 14 days had lower LDH, CRP and higher ALB (P < 0.05). ROC curve results indicated that lower LDH, TP, CRP and higher ALB predicted the nucleic acid of patients turned negative within 14 days with statistical significance(P < 0.05), AST, LDH, CRP and PCT predicted the severe COVID-19 with statistical significance, and CRP predicted hospital stay >31days with statistical significance (P < 0.05). After verification, the probability of nucleic acid turning negative within 14 days in patients with low LDH (<256 U/L), CRP (<44.5 mg/L) and high ALB (>35.8 g/L) was about 4 times higher than that in patients with high LDH, CRP and low ALB (P < 0.05).

Respondents with hopelessness scored higher in the DAS and DTS than respondents without hopelessness. Furthermore, death anxiety was identified as a potential mediator of the significant association between hopelessness and post-traumatic symptomatology.

There are clinical differences and in mortality between the adult and paediatric population. Recently, the immune response through the development of antibodies has gained relevance due to the risk of reinfection and vaccines' development. Objective: Was to compare the association of clinical history and the clinical presentation of the disease with the development of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric and adult patients with a history of positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. Methods: Cross-sectional observational study carried out in a Paediatric Hospital in Mexico City included patients under 18 years of age and health personnel with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 comparing antibody expression. The development of specific IgG antibodies was measured, the presence of comorbidities, duration, and severity of symptoms was determined. Results: Sixty-one subjects (20 < 18 years and 41 > 18 years) were analysed. The median sample collection was 3 weeks. There were no differences in the expression of specific antibodies; no differences were shown according to the symptoms' severity. A positive correlation (r = 0.77) was demonstrated between the duration of symptoms and antibody levels. Conclusions: In conclusion, there is a clear association between the duration of the symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the IgG units generated in paediatric and adult patients convalescing from COVID-19.","Márquez-González, Horacio; López-Martínez, Briceida; Parra-Ortega, Israel; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela; Salazar-García, Marcela; Olivar-López, Victor; Klünder-Klünder, Miguel",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485190/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.671831,298

Catheter-based therapies are emerging as a new armamentarium for improving outcomes in these patients. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to familiarize the clinicians with (1) various types of catheter-based modalities available for patients with acute PE, (2) advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate patient selection for the use of these devices, and (3) evidence base and the relevance of such therapies in the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: There are four main types of catheter-based therapies in acute PE: (1) standard catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), (2) ultrasound-assisted CDT, (3) pharmacomechanical CDT, and (4) mechanical thrombectomy without thrombolysis. Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is the most widely studied modality in this group; however, evidence base for other catheter-based technologies is rapidly emerging. SUMMARY: Current use of catheter-based therapies is most suitable for patients with intermediate and high-risk acute PE. The adoption of a multidisciplinary approach like the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) is desirable for appropriate patient selection and possibly/potentially improving patient outcomes. We discuss the current status of these therapies.","Singh, Maninder; Shafi, Irfan; Rali, Parth; Panaro, Joseph; Lakhter, Vladimir; Bashir, Riyaz",Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994774/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-021-00920-7,298

Detailed scientific analysis of this event is currently underway to come. However, it is very important to have the right facts and figures to take all possible actions that are needed to avoid COVID-19. In the practice and application of big data sciences, it is always of interest to provide the best description of the data under consideration. The recent studies have shown the potential of statistical distributions in modeling data in applied sciences, especially in medical science. In this article, we continue to carry this area of research, and introduce a new statistical model called the arcsine modified Weibull distribution. The proposed model is introduced using the modified Weibull distribution with the arcsine-X approach which is based on the trigonometric strategy. The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the new model are obtained and the performance these estimators are assessed by conducting a Monte Carlo simulation study. Finally, the effectiveness and utility of the arcsine modified Weibull distribution are demonstrated by modeling COVID-19 patients data. The data set represents the survival times of fifty-three patients taken from a hospital in China. The practical application shows that the proposed model out-classed the competitive models and can be chosen as a good candidate distribution for modeling COVID-19, and other related data sets.","Liu, Xiaofeng; Ahmad, Zubair; Gemeay, Ahmed M.; Abdulrahman, Alanazi Talal; Hafez, E.

689770,Does spitting in public play a role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2?,2020-05-31,"Model-based epidemiological assessment is useful to support decision-making at the beginning of an emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreak. However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the first few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedes-transmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015-2017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (Chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.","Riou, Julien; Poletto, Chiara; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/300954,298

Viral vectors, however, have certain issues involving genome integration, the inability to be delivered repeatedly, and possible host rejection. Fortunately, development of non-viral DNA vectors has progressed steadily, especially in plasmid vector length reduction, now allowing these tools to fill in specifically where viral or other non-viral vectors may not be the best options. In this review, we examine the improvements made to non-viral DNA gene therapy vectors, highlight opportunities for their further development, address therapeutic needs for which their use is the logical choice, and discuss their future expansion into the clinic.","Hardee, Cinnamon L.; Arévalo-Soliz, Lirio Milenka; Hornstein, Benjamin D.; Zechiedrich, Lynn",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28208635/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes8020065,298
