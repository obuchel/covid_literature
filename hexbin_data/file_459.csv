Cytokines are used in medicine for the treatment of cancer, immune disorders, viral infections, and other socially significant diseases, but the extent of their use is limited by the high production cost of the active agent. The development of this area of pharmacology is associated with the success of genetic engineering, which allows the production of significant amounts of protein by transgenic organisms. The review discusses the latest advances in the production of various cytokines with the use of genetically modified plants.","Burlakovskiy, M. S.; Yemelyanov, V. V.; Lutova, L. A.",Appl,459,4

In the classification of these diseases, diffuse parenchymal lung diseases with known cause, granulomatous diseases, and other specific interstitial lung diseases are separated from the important group of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, which are classified according to the 2002 ATS/ERS consensus classification. Concerning the histological pattern, this classification differentiates between “usual interstitial pneumonia” (UIP), “nonspecific interstitial pneumonia” (NSIP), “organising pneumonia” (COP), “diffuse alveolar damage” (DAD), “respiratory bronchiolitis” (RB), “desquamative interstitial pneumonia” (DIP), “lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia” (LIP) and “unclassifiable interstitial pneumonias”. A key message of this classification is that the pathologist will give the diagnosis of a histological pattern, whereas the final clinicopathologic diagnosis can be made only by the clinical pulmonologist after careful correlation with the clinical and radiologic features, which is essential in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases.","Junker, K.; Brasch, F.",Pathologe,459,4

Cough frequency and handkerchief use by persons suffering from virus-induced rhinorrhea are more prominent during the daytime, especially during the initial hours after awakening from nocturnal sleep. The elevation in sublingual temperature as well as the decrement in mental alertness associated with influenza in particular are more profound at this time. Sneezing, blocked nose, and runny nose secondary to allergic rhinitis are also greater in intensity during the morning in approximately 70% of sufferers. The day-night variation in symptom intensity amounts to approximately 20% of the 24-hour mean level. The treatment of these diseases and their symptoms has traditionally involved equal-interval, equal-dose (homeostatic) medication schedules. The effects of antihistamine and antiinflammatory medicines may be enhanced by timing them to the day-night temporal pattern in symptom manifestation and intensity to achieve an optimization of their beneficial effects with control of toxicity, that is, as a chronotherapy.

Since the information about the evolution of these viruses in Saudi is deficient so we investigated the genetic diversity of circulating H1N1 viruses. Nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs collected from 149 patients hospitalized with flu‐like symptoms during 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. Viral RNA extraction was followed by a reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. We analyzed complete gene sequences of HA and NA from 80 positive isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes of 80 isolates showed similar topologies and co‐circulation of clades 6b. Genetic diversity was observed among circulating viruses belonging to clade 6B.1A. The amino acid residues in the HA epitope domain were under purifying selection. Amino acid changes at key antigenic sites, such as position S101N, S179N (antigenic site‐Sa), I233T (antigenic site‐Sb) in the head domain might have resulted in antigenic drift and emergence of variant viruses. For NA protein, 36% isolates showed the presence of amino acid changes such as V13I (n = 29), I314M (n = 29) and 12% had I34V (n = 10). However, H257Y mutation responsible for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors was missing. The presence of amino acid changes at key antigenic sites and their topologies with structural mapping of residues under purifying selection highlights the importance of antigenic drift and warrants further characterization of recently circulating viruses in view of vaccine effectiveness. The co‐circulation of several clades and the predominance of clade 6B.1 suggest multiple introductions in Saudi.","Naeem, Asif; Elbakkouri, Karim; Alfaiz, Ali; Hamed, Maaweya E.; Alsaran, Hadel; AlOtaiby, Shahad; Enani, Mushira; Alosaimi, Bandar",J Med Virol,459,4

From one sediment sample S16, 36 AOA OTUs (3% cutoff) were obtained from three clone libraries constructed using three primer sets for amoA gene. Among the 36 OTUs, six were shared by all three clone libraries, two appeared in two clone libraries, and the other 28 were only recovered in one of the libraries. For AOB, only seven OTUs (based on 16S rRNA gene) and eight OTUs (based on amoA gene) were obtained, showing lower diversity than AOA. The qPCR results revealed that AOA amoA gene copy numbers ranged from 9.6 × 10(6) to 5.1 × 10(7) copies per gram of sediment and AOB amoA gene ranged from 9.5 × 10(4) to 6.2 × 10(5) copies per gram of sediment, indicating that the dominant ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in the sediment of the Pearl River Estuary were AOA. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism results showed that the relative abundance of AOB species in the sediment samples of different salinity were significantly different, indicating that salinity might be a key factor shaping the AOB community composition.

METHODS: This was an open labeled randomized controlled trial comprising 60 children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis which was randomly assigned to 2 groups. Intervention group received nebulization with 3 mL of 3.2% magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) (iso-osmolar) every 4 hourly for 24 h in addition to standard care and the control group received standard care alone. The primary outcome measure was to compare the improvement of bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) and length of hospitalization. The secondary outcome was to measure the need for noninvasive ventilation, need for admission to intensive care unit (ICU) in the initial visit, to evaluate the safety of magnesium sulphate and need for clinic revisit, hospital readmission and ICU readmission within 2 wk after discharge in both the groups. RESULTS: The mean age of children allocated in the control group was 7.4 ± 5.1 mo and 7.7 ± 4.5 mo in the intervention group. There was no significant difference with respect to improvement of BSS or reduced length of hospitalization in both the groups (p > 0.05). BSS monitored sequentially after enrollment at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h did not show statistically significant differences between the groups.

METHODS: We monetized the changes in mortality risk for communicable and non-communicable diseases (CD and NCD, respectively) between 2017 and 2030 for low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income countries (LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively). We modeled three mortality trajectories (“base-case”, “high-performance”, and “low-performance”) using Global Burden of Disease study forecasts and estimated disease-specific mortality risk changes relative to the base-case. We assigned monetary values to changes in mortality risk using value of a statistical life (VSL) methods and conducted multiple sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In terms of NCDs, the absolute monetary value associated with changing mortality risk was highest for cardiovascular diseases in older age groups. For example, being on the low-performance trajectory relative to the base-case in 2030 was valued at $9100 (95% uncertainty range $6800; $11,400), $28,300 ($24,200; $32,400), and $30,300 ($27,200; $33,300) for females aged 70–74 years in LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively. Changing the mortality rate from the base-case to the high-performance trajectory was associated with high monetary value for CDs as well, especially among younger age groups. Estimates were sensitive to assumptions made in calculating VSL.

The H(3) receptor has a regulatory role in the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine; the H(4) receptor exerts a chemotactic effect on several cell types associated with allergy and asthma.

This is so today at a time when other aspects of Western sciences have been fruitfully explored in critical and illuminating ways (see Christensen and Hansen, Chap. 13; and Skovsmose, Chap. 15). In particular, the exceptionalism and triumphalism characteristic of Western attitudes toward our sciences have been explicitly criticized and purportedly abandoned by many of the scholars working in science studies fields. By exceptionalism is meant the belief that Western sciences alone among all human knowledge systems are capable of grasping reality in its own terms—that these alone have the resources to escape the human tendency to project onto nature cultural assumptions, fears, and desires. By triumphalism is meant the assumption that the history of science consists of a history of achievements — that this history has no significant downsides. According to this view, Hiroshima, environmental destruction, the alienation of labour, escalating global militarism, the increasing gap between the “haves” and the ”have nots,” gender, race, and class inequalities — these and other undesirable social situations are all entirely consequences of social and political projects, to which the history of Western sciences makes no contribution. Such conventional Euro centric assumptions can no longer gather the support either in the West or elsewhere that they could once claim In recent decades a huge amount of literature on modernity has emerged from the social sciences and humanities. Stimulated by the massive shifts in local and global social formations during the last half of the Twentieth Century, and by the post-modern response to such changes, social theorists, literary and other cultural critics, and, especially, historians have debated the uneven and complex origins, nature, and desirable futures of modernity, modernization, and modernism. Such controversies about modernity are first and foremost about a culture's relation to its past and its possible futures. They arise as ways of asking what went wrong, and what needs to be corrected. The last half a century has witnessed the global decline and fall of belief in the unquestionably legitimate authority of the white, bourgeois, male. Contributing to the epistemological, economic, political, and cultural rubble left by his demise — or, at least, deflation — have been compelling and influential counter-histories of social relations between the races, classes, genders, and within colonial and imperial eras","Harding, Sandra",University Science and Mathematics Education in Transition,459,4

It is then proved that this phenomenon vanishes either when the vaccine is assumed to be 100% potent and perfect or the Standard Incidence is replaced with a Mass Action Incidence in the model development. Furthermore, the model has a unique endemic and disease-free equilibria. Using a suitable Lyapunov function, the endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium are proved to be globally-asymptotically stable depending on whether the control reproduction number is less or greater than unity.

Therefore, we should pay more attention to the incompatibilities between the genes and the living environments and, more importantly, to the impact of changes in the living environment. However, specific chronic disease is not caused by a specific environmental factor but occurs when the systems of the human body are affected by exposure to specific environmental factors and work beyond their normal ranges. Therefore, the concept of treating a patient with a chronic disease by simply eliminating the cause of the disease has some fundamental limitations.

Recently, trained immunity is reported to be a novel strategy for the innate immune system to fight infection. However, it has not been clarified whether β-glucan-induced trained immunity causes different responses to early sepsis between male and female mice. In this study, sepsis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli (E. coli). The changes of inflammatory cytokines expression, and macrophage polarization in male, female, and ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice in sepsis model were investigated. For in vitro studies, different macrophages were treated with LPS. The function of estradiol (E2) on macrophage cell lines was verified and the mechanism of E2 affecting trained immunity was explored. We demonstrated that β-glucan-induced trained immunity was more resistant to sepsis in female than male mice. Macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype, which exhibited enhanced trained immunity, was related to the difference in sepsis resistance between female and male mice. Moreover, ovariectomized (OVX) mice manifested serious sepsis consequences with a weaker trained immunity effect than female mice. Female bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were also apt to be polarized to the M1 phenotype in response to trained immunity in vitro. Furthermore, E2 promoted trained immunity in macrophage cell lines J774 and RAW264.7. E2 was also verified to facilitate trained immunity in primary BMDMs from female and male mice. Mechanistically, we found that E2 inhibited the nuclear translocation of RelB, which is a member of non-canonical pathway of NFκB and contributes to macrophage polarization to change the intensity of trained immunity. This study is the first to indicate the role of E2 in the trained immunity induced by β-glucan to protect against E. coli-induced sepsis via the non-canonical NFκB pathway. These results improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing trained immunity in gender differences.","Sun, Zhiheng; Pan, Yuchen; Qu, Junxing; Xu, Yujun; Dou, Huan; Hou, Yayi",Front Immunol,459,4

With this purpose in view, the first section of this paper will attempt to give an anti-foundational reading of Caturvarṇa—where varṇa is seen to be based neither on the different proportions of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas and tamas), nor on a system of hereditary professions, but as abstract dimensions that are not mutually exclusive—and at best serves to give an orientation to our cognition and actions. This reading, while borrowing heavily from Shri Aurobindo’s reading of Caturvarṇa, will seek to give it a more neutral and expansive direction, shorn of all associated suggestions of intransigence and empirical contingencies, in order to effect the best possible synthesis with Gandhi. The second section of this paper will concentrate on appropriate portions of Gandhi’s commentary on Gῑtā, trying to track down Gandhi’s reservations against any psychological determinism with respect to varṇa. His direct but scattered observations on varṇa and caste will be addressed in the last section—to see how far our neutral reading of Caturvarṇa can be responsibly reconciled with his distinction between varṇa and caste—indicating a way to dissolve the Gandhi-Ambedkar debate on varṇabheda and jātibheda. Overall, this paper attempts a paradigmatic reconstruction of Gandhian Caturvarṇa in the light of his approach to the notion of niṣkāma karma.","Ray Mitra, Enakshi",J,459,4

The disease may continue to persist more extensively due to the increasing number of new cases daily, the rapid spread of the virus, and delay in the PCR analysis results. Therefore, it is necessary to consider developing assistive methods for detecting and diagnosing the COVID-19 to eradicate the spread of the novel coronavirus among people. Based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), automated detection systems have shown promising results of diagnosing patients with the COVID-19 through radiography; thus, they are introduced as a workable solution to the COVID-19 diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the enhancement of the classical visual geometry group (VGG) network with the convolutional COVID block (CCBlock), an efficient screening model was proposed in this study to diagnose and distinguish patients with the COVID-19 from those with pneumonia and the healthy people through radiography. The model testing dataset included 1828 X-ray images available on public platforms. Three hundred and ten images were showing confirmed COVID-19 cases, 864 images indicating pneumonia cases, and 654 images showing healthy people. RESULTS: According to the test results, enhancing the classical VGG network with radiography provided the highest diagnosis performance and overall accuracy of 98.52% for two classes as well as accuracy of 95.34% for three classes. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, using the enhanced VGG deep neural network can help radiologists automatically diagnose the COVID-19 through radiography.","Al-Bawi, Ali; Al-Kaabi, Karrar; Jeryo, Mohammed; Al-Fatlawi, Ahmad",Res,459,1

Halting these steps can cure COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at sub-nM concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion. Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no obvious adverse events when administrated with 10-fold of effective dose of HB27. Cryo-EM studies on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal that three Fab fragments work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding to ACE2 receptor. Binding of the antibody also restrains any further conformational changes of the RBD, possibly interfering with progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. These results suggest that HB27 is a promising candidate for immuno-therapies against COVID-19.","Zhu, Ling; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Zhang, Rong-Rong; Cui, Zhen; Sun, Chun-Yun; Fan, Chang-Fa; Xing, Xiaorui; Huang, Weijin; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Na-Na; Ye, Qing; Cao, Tian-Shu; Wang, Nan; Wang, Lei; Cao, Lei; Wang, Huiyu; Kong, Desheng; Ma, Juan; Luo, Chunxia; Zhang, Yanjing; Nie, Jianhui; Sun, Yao; Lv, Zhe; Shaw, Neil; Li, Qianqian; Li, Xiao-Feng; Hu, Junjie; Xie, Liangzhi; Rao, Zihe; Wang, Youchun; Wang, Xiangxi; Qin, Cheng-Feng",Natl Sci Rev,459,21

METHODS: A survey on breast imaging facilities’ operations and strategies for recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic was distributed to the membership of the Society of Breast Imaging and National Consortium of Breast Centers from June 4, 2020, to July 14, 2020. A descriptive summary of responses was performed. Comparisons were made between demographic variables of respondents and questions of interest using a Pearson chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 473 survey respondents (response rate of 13%). The majority of respondents (70%; 332/473) reported 80%–100% breast imaging volume reduction, with 94% (447/473) reporting postponement of screening mammography. The majority of respondents (97%; 457/473) continued to perform biopsies. There were regional differences in safety measures taken for staff (P = 0.004), with practices in the West more likely reporting no changes in the work environment compared to other regions. The most common changes to patients’ experience included spacing out of furniture in waiting rooms (94%; 445/473), limiting visitors (91%; 430/473), and spacing out appointments (83%). A significantly higher proportion of practices in the Northeast (95%; 104/109) initiated patient scheduling changes compared to other regions (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had an acute impact on breast imaging facilities. Although common national operational patterns emerged, geographic variability was notable in particular in recovery efforts. These findings may inform future best practices for delivering breast imaging care amid the ongoing and geographically shifting COVID-19 pandemic.","Dodelzon, Katerina; Grimm, Lars J; Tran, Khai; Dontchos, Brian N; Destounis, Stamatia; Dialani, Vandana; Dogan, Basak; Sonnenblick, Emily; Zuley, Margarita; Milch, Hannah S",J Breast Imaging,459,3

To date, there has been no thorough examination of the loneliness measures for this age group. We examine how each of the three measures was developed, and assess the psychometric properties of those measures, gaining insight into whether they are valid and reliable assessments of loneliness. Results suggest that the UCLA Loneliness Scale is the most popular measure of loneliness for use with adolescents, but it does not have robust psychometric properties for that group. For children, the CLS appears most suitable. Results of the review identify gaps in aspects of measure development, with no measure having been developed with children or adolescents.

Among these are thromboembolic complications. The theories that explain the mechanism of thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 are accumulating rapidly, and in addition to the role of imaging for assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia, CT may be useful for identification of these complications, such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke, mesenteric ischaemia, and acro-ischaemia. RESULTS: Thromboembolic manifestations were diagnosed in 10% of our patients (124 patients out of the total 1245 COVID-19 patients); 56 patients (45.2%) presented with pulmonary embolism, 32 patients (25.8%) presented with cerebrovascular manifestations, 17 patients (13.7%) presented with limb affection, and 19 patients (15.3%) presented with gastrointestinal thromboembolic complications. Most of our patients had significant comorbidities; diabetes was found in 72 patients (58%), dyslipidemia in 72 patients (58%), smoking in 71 patients (57.3%), hypertension in 63 patients (50.8%), and morbid obesity in 40 patients (32.2%). Thromboembolic events were diagnosed on admission in 41 patients (33.1%), during the first week in 61 patients (49.2%), and after the first week in 22 patients (17.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients is relatively high resulting in a multisystem thrombotic disease. In addition to the crucial role of imaging for assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia, CT is important for assessment of the thromboembolic complications, such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke, mesenteric ischaemia, and peripheral ischaemia, especially in patients with elevated d-dimer levels and those with sudden clinical deterioration.","Omar, Suzan Fouad; Habib, Rehab Mohammed; Motawea, Abdelghany Mohammed",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,459,1

Type I interferons (IFN)-α/β are highly potent cytokines that are initially identified for their essential roles in antiviral defense. It was reported that HuNoV infection did not induce IFN-β expression but was controlled in the presence of IFN-β in human intestinal enteroids and a gnotobiotic pig model, suggesting that HuNoV has likely developed evasion countermeasures. In this study, we found that a cDNA clone of GII.4 HuNoV, the predominantly circulating genotype worldwide, inhibits the production of IFN-β and identified the viral NTPase as a key component responsible for such inhibition. HuNoV NTPase not only inhibits the activity of IFN-β promoter but also the mRNA and protein production of IFN-β. Additional studies indicate that NTPase inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), leading to the suppression of IFN-β promoter activation. Mechanistically, NTPase interacts with IkB kinase ε (IKKε), an important factor for IRF-3 phosphorylation, and such interaction blocks the association of IKKε with unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, resulting in the inhibition of IKKε phosphorylation. Further studies demonstrated that the 1-179 aa domain of NTPase which interacts with IKKε is critical for the suppression of IFN-β production. Our findings highlight the role of HuNoV NTPase in the inhibition of IFN-β production, providing insights into a novel mechanism underlying how HuNoV evades the host innate immunity.","Zheng, Zifeng; Li, Yuncheng; Zhang, Mudan; Liu, Yalan; Fu, Ming; Gong, Sitang; Hu, Qinxue",Front Microbiol,459,22

Our previous research has confirmed that poly(D, L-lactic acid)/β-tricalcium phosphate/hyaluronic acid/chitosan/nerve growth factor (PDLLA/β-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF) NGCs have excellent physical and chemical properties, which can slowly release NGF and support cell adhesion and proliferation. In this study, PDLLA/β-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF NGCs were prepared and used to bridge a 10 mm sciatic nerve defect in 200–250 g Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat to verify the performance of the NGCs in vivo. Substantial improvements in nerve regeneration were observed after using the PDLLA/β-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF NGCs based on gross post-operation observation, triceps wet weight analysis and nerve histological assessment. In vivo studies illustrate that the PDLLA/β-TCP/HA/CHS/NGF sustained-release NGCs can effectively promote peripheral nerve regeneration, and the effect is similar to that of autograft.","Yan, Xiumei; Wang, Jing; He, Qundi; Xu, Haixing; Tao, Junyan; Koral, Kelly; Li, Kebi; Xu, Jingyi; Wen, Jing; Huang, Zhijun; Xu, Peihu",J Wuhan Univ Technol Mater Sci Ed,459,1

In 2015, in a sample of UK hospital patients, 14% were treated with oxygen, of which only 42% had a prescription. Health care workers are often uncertain about the relevance of hypoxemia, and there is limited awareness of the risks of hyperoxemia. Numerous randomized controlled trials on oxygen therapy have recently been published. METHODS: As part of the guideline program of the Working Group of Scientific Medical Societies e. V. (AWMF), this S3 guideline was developed with the participation of 10 medical societies on the basis of a literature search up to 02/01/2021. The system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) (The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence) was used to evaluate the literature. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), and a formal consensus process of recommendations was performed. RESULTS: The guideline contains 34 evidence-based recommendations on the indication, prescription, monitoring, and discontinuation of oxygen therapy in acute care. The indication for oxygen is mainly hypoxemia. Hypoxemia and hyperoxemia should be avoided, since both increase mortality. The guideline recommends target ranges of oxygen saturation for acute oxygen therapy without differentiating between different diagnoses. Target areas depend on the risk for hypercapnia and ventilation status. The guideline provides an overview of available oxygen delivery systems and contains recommendations for their selection based on patient safety and comfort. CONCLUSION: This is the first German guideline on the use of oxygen in acute care. It is aimed at medical professionals who use oxygen in and outside hospitals and is valid until June 30th, 2024.","Gottlieb, Jens; Capetian, Philipp; Hamsen, Uwe; Janssens, Uwe; Karagiannidis, Christian; Kluge, Stefan; König, Marco; Markewitz, Andreas; Nothacker, Monika; Roiter, Sabrina; Unverzagt, Susanne; Veit, Wolfgang; Volk, Thomas; Witt, Christian; Wildenauer, René; Worth, Heinrich; Fühner, Thomas",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,459,28

ALVC was not included in the 2010 International Task Force Criteria (ITFC) for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy diagnosis and data regarding this phenotype are scarce. Methods - clinical characteristics were reported from all consecutive patients diagnosed with ALVC, defined as a LV isolated late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and fibro-fatty replacement (FFR) at cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) plus genetic variants associated with ARVC and/or of an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) showing FFR complying with the 2010 ITFC in the LV. Results - twenty-five ALVC patients (53 [48-59] years, 60% male) were enrolled. T-wave inversion in infero-lateral and left precordial leads were the most common ECG abnormalities. Overall arrhythmic burden at study inclusion was 56%. CMR showed LV LGE in the LV lateral and/or posterior basal segments in all patients. In 72% of the patients an invasive evaluation was performed, in which electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) and EVM-guided EMB showed low endocardial voltages and FFR in areas of LGE presence. Genetic variants in desmosomal genes (desmoplakin and desmoglein-2) were identified in 12/25 of the cohort presenting pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants. A definite/borderline 2010 ITFC ARVC diagnosis was reached only in 11/25 patients. Conclusions - ALVC presents with a preferential involvement of the lateral and/or postero-lateral basal LV and is associated mostly with variants in desmoplakin and desmoglein-2 genes. An amendment to the current ITFC is reasonable to better diagnose ALVC patients.","Casella, Michela; Gasperetti, Alessio; Sicuso, Rita; Conte, Edoardo; Catto, Valentina; Sommariva, Elena; Bergonti, Marco; Vettor, Giulia; Rizzo, Stefania; Pompilio, Giulio; Andreini, Daniele; Saguner, Ardan Muammer; Duru, Firat; Natale, Andrea; Thiene, Gaetano; Basso, Cristina; Dello Russo, Antonio; Tondo, Claudio",Circulation.

Methods From March 2019 to October 2019, 40 patients were randomly divided into two groups: dexmedetomidine group (group D) and control group (group C). Except recording the general condition of the patients in both groups preoperatively and intraoperatively, the oxygenation index (OI) and alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference (A-aDO2) were monitored at admission (T0), immediately after one-lung ventilation (T1), 0.5 h after one-lung ventilation (T2), and 15 minutes after inhaling air before leaving the room (T3). The content of IL-8 in arterial blood was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at T0 and T2, and the expression of AQP1 protein in isolated lung tissue was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) was used as the index of lung injury. Results There was no significant difference in the general condition before and during operation between the two groups. There was no significant difference in arterial blood IL-8 content between the two groups at the T0 time point, but the arterial blood IL-8 content at the T2 time point was significantly higher than that at the T0 time point, especially in group C. The results of immunohistochemistry and Western blot showed that the expression level of AQP1 protein in the isolated lung tissue of group D was significantly higher than that of group C (P < 0 05). At T3, the OI of group D was significantly higher than that of group C, and the A-aDO2 of group D was significantly lower than that of group C (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative PPCs between the two groups. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine can reduce the level of plasma IL-8 and upregulate the expression of AQP1 in the lung tissue of patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery under one-lung ventilation, but it has no significant effect on the incidence of postoperative PPCs. Dexmedetomidine can be safely used in thoracoscopic surgery and has a certain protective effect on lung injury.","Meng, Jun; Lv, Qin; Yao, Jiaxiang; Wang, Siyu; Yang, Kun",BioMed research international,459,31

It has been suggested that the laparoscopic technique should reduce the risk for adhesion formation and thus for postoperative bowel obstruction. This study was designed to compare the incidence of bowel obstruction in a randomized trial where laparoscopic and open resection for colon cancer was compared. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed, collecting data of episodes of bowel obstruction with or without surgery. Only episodes treated in the hospital where the index surgery took place were included. Data for 786 patients were collected for the 5-year period after cancer surgery. RESULTS Baseline characteristics for the evaluated laparoscopic (n = 383) and open (n = 403) groups were comparable. The cumulative obstruction percentages at 5 years for the open and laparoscopic groups were 6.5 and 5.1% respectively and did not significantly differ from each other. Tumor stage seemed to influence the risk for bowel obstruction: 2.8% in stage I, 6.6% in stage II, and 7% in stage III, but the differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS This analysis does not support the hypothesis that laparoscopy leads to fewer episodes of bowel obstruction compared with open surgery.","Schölin, Johnna; Buunen, Mark; Hop, Wim; Bonjer, Jaap; Anderberg, Bo; Cuesta, Miguel; Delgado, Salvadora; Ibarzabal, Ainitze; Ivarsson, Marie-Louise; Janson, Martin; Lacy, Antonio; Lange, Johan; Påhlman, Lars; Skullman, Stefan; Haglind, Eva",Surgical endoscopy,459,1

Previously, we demonstrated that asymmetric, phosphorothioate (PS)-modified, chemically stabilized, cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs, called hsiRNAs, support rapid cellular uptake and efficient mRNA silencing both in cultured cells and in vivo. Here, we systematically evaluated the impact of number, structure, and sequence context of PS-modified backbones on cellular uptake and RNAi-mediated silencing efficacy. We find that PS enhances cellular internalization in a sequence-dependent manner but only when present in a single-stranded but not double-stranded region. Furthermore, the observed increase in cellular internalization did not correlate with functional silencing improvement, indicating that PS-mediated uptake may drive compounds to non-productive sinks. Thus, the primary contributing factor of PS modifications to functional efficacy is likely stabilization rather than enhanced cellular uptake. A better understanding of the relative impact of different chemistries on productive versus non-productive uptake will assist in improved design of therapeutic RNAs.","Ly, Socheata; Echeverria, Dimas; Sousa, Jacquelyn; Khvorova, Anastasia",Molecular therapy.

This article discusses the extent of aerosolisation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as a result of oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. METHODS PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant publications, using the terms COVID-19 aerosolisation, COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 transmission, COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and endoscopy, Endoscopy for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS A total of 3745 articles were identified, 26 of which were selected to answer the question of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation during upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. All studies suggested high infectivity from contact and droplet spread. No clinical study has yet reported the viral load in the aerosol and therefore the infective dose has not been accurately determined. However, aerosol-generating procedures are potentially risky and full personal protective equipment should be used. CONCLUSIONS As it is a highly infectious disease, clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 require effective personal protective equipment. The main routes of infection are direct contact and droplets in the air and on surfaces. Aerosolisation carries a substantial risk of infection, so any aerosol-producing procedure, such as endoscopy, should be performed wearing personal protective equipment and with extra caution to protect the endoscopist, staff and patients from cross-infection via the respiratory system.","Hussain, Abdulzahra; Singhal, Tarun; El-Hasani, Shamsi",British journal of hospital medicine,459,1

The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate a potential influence of FIRS on cerebral oxygen saturation (crSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) during immediate postnatal transition in preterm neonates. The secondary aim was to analyze the potential influence of FIRS on cerebral injury and mortality. Methods: Secondary outcome parameters of prospective observational studies were analyzed. Preterm neonates with measured IL-6 values from umbilical cord blood and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements during immediate transition after birth were included. Preterm neonates with FIRS (FIRS group) were matched 1:1 for gestational age (± 1 week) to preterm neonates without FIRS (non-FIRS group). crSO2, cFTOE, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were compared between both groups. In addition, cerebral injury and mortality were compared between both groups. Results: A total of 46 preterm neonates were included. Twenty-three neonates in the FIRS group [median gestational age 32.1 (IQR 30.3-33.0) weeks; median IL-6 19.7 (IQR 12.2-37.0) pg/ml] were compared to 23 neonates in the non-FIRS group [gestational age: 32.0 (30.4-33.1) weeks; IL-6: 5.4 (3.0-6.7) pg/ml]. cFTOE showed significantly lower values within the first 4 min and a trend toward lower values in minute 5 after birth in the FIRS group. There were no significant differences in crSO2 within the first 15 min after birth between the two groups. SpO2 was significantly lower in minutes 5 and 6 and HR was significantly lower in minutes 2 and 4 after birth in the FIRS group compared to the non-FIRS group. Survival without cerebral injury was similar in both groups. Conclusion: In preterm neonates with FIRS the crSO2 was similar despite significantly lower cFTOE values during the first minutes after birth. This observation may be a result of compromised oxygen consumption and delivery in the first minutes after birth in neonates with FIRS.","Wolfsberger, Christina Helene; Bruckner, Marlies; Baik-Schneditz, Nariae; Schwaberger, Bernhard; Mileder, Lukas Peter; Avian, Alexander; Urlesberger, Berndt; Pichler, Gerhard",Frontiers in pediatrics,459,1

However, to our knowledge, there has not yet been a systematic assessment of whether and to what extent depression is associated with impairments on behavioral reward-processing tasks. Objective To determine whether depression is associated with impairments in reward-processing behavior. Data Sources The MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo databases were searched for studies that investigated reward processing using performance on behavioral tasks by individuals with depression and nondepressed control groups, published between January 1, 1946, and August 16, 2019. Study Selection Studies that contained data regarding performance by depressed and healthy control groups on reward-processing tasks were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis Summary statistics comparing performance between depressed and healthy groups on reward-processing tasks were converted to standardized mean difference (SMD) scores, from which summary effect sizes for overall impairment in reward processing and 4 subcomponent categories were calculated. Study quality, heterogeneity, replicability-index, and publication bias were also assessed. Main Outcome and Measures Performance on reward-processing tasks. Results The final data set comprised 48 case-control studies (1387 healthy control individuals and 1767 individuals with major depressive disorder). The mean age was 37.85 years and 58% of the participants were women. These studies used tasks assessing option valuation (n = 9), reward bias (n = 6), reward response vigor (n = 12), reinforcement learning (n = 20), and grip force (n = 1). Across all tasks, depression was associated with small to medium impairments in reward-processing behavior (SMD = 0.345; 95% CI, 0.209-0.480). When examining reward-processing subcomponent categories, impairment was associated with tasks assessing option valuation (SMD = 0.309; 95% CI, 0.147-0.471), reward bias (SMD = 0.644; 95% CI, 0.270-1.017), and reinforcement learning (SMD = 0.352; 95% CI, 0.115-0.588) but not reward response vigor (SMD = 0.083; 95% CI, -0.144 to 0.309). The medication status of the major depressive disorder sample did not explain any of the variance in the overall effect size. There was significant between-study heterogeneity overall and in all subcomponent categories other than option valuation. Significant publication bias was identified overall and in the reinforcement learning category. Conclusions and Relevance Relative to healthy control individuals, individuals with depression exhibit reward-processing impairments, particularly for tests of reward bias, option valuation, and reinforcement learning. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these associations may assist in designing novel interventions.","Halahakoon, D Chamith; Kieslich, Karel; O'Driscoll, Ciarán; Nair, Akshay; Lewis, Glyn; Roiser, Jonathan P",JAMA psychiatry,459,11

METHODS 148 malignant and 75 benign breast lesions were included. All patients underwent bilateral MR imaging. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients before MRI. The local ethics committee granted approval for this study. Semi-automatic breast vascular map and predominant vessel detection was performed on MRI, for each patient. Semi-automatic detection (depending on grey levels threshold manually chosen by radiologist) was compared with results of two expert radiologists; inter-observer variability and reliability of semi-automatic approach were assessed. RESULTS Anatomic analysis of breast lesions revealed that 20% of patients had masses in internal half, 50% in external half and the 30% in subareolar/central area. As regards the 44 tumors in internal half, based on radiologic consensus, 40 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (61% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 14% by lateral thoracic vessels, 16% by both thoracic vessels and 9% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01), based on semi-automatic detection, 38 tumors demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (66% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 11% by lateral thoracic vessels, 9% by both thoracic vessels and 14% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01). As regards the 111 tumors in external half, based on radiologic consensus, 91 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (25% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 39% by lateral thoracic vessels, 18% by both thoracic vessels and 18% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01), based on semi-automatic detection, 94 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (27% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 45% by lateral thoracic vessels, 4% by both thoracic vessels and 24% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01). An excellent agreement between two radiologic assessments (k = 0.81) and between radiologic consensus and semi-automatic assessment (k = 0.80) was found to identify origin of predominant feeding vessel. An excellent reliability for semi-automatic assessment (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96) was reported. CONCLUSIONS Predominant feeding vessel location was correlated with breast lesion location: internal thoracic artery supplied the highest proportion of breasts with tumor in internal half and lateral thoracic artery supplied the highest proportion of breasts with lateral tumor.","Petrillo, Antonella; Fusco, Roberta; Filice, Salvatore; Granata, Vincenza; Catalano, Orlando; Vallone, Paolo; Di Bonito, Maurizio; D'Aiuto, Massimiliano; Rinaldo, Massimo; Capasso, Immacolata; Sansone, Mario",PloS one,459,24

Most of existing methods can be summarized as anomaly object detection-based and reconstruction error-based techniques. However, due to the bottleneck of defining encompasses of real-world high-diversity outliers and inaccessible inference process, individually, most of them have not derived groundbreaking progress. To deal with those imperfectness, and motivated by memory-based decision-making and visual attention mechanism as a filter to select environmental information in human vision perceptual system, in this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Memory with hash addressing Autoencoder network (MAMA Net) for anomaly detection. First, to overcome a battery of problems result from the restricted stationary receptive field of convolution operator, we coin the multi-scale global spatial attention block which can be straightforwardly plugged into any networks as sampling, upsampling and downsampling function. On account of its efficient features representation ability, networks can achieve competitive results with only several level blocks. Second, it's observed that traditional autoencoder can only learn an ambiguous model that also reconstructs anomalies ""well"" due to lack of constraints in training and inference process. To mitigate this challenge, we design a hash addressing memory module that proves abnormalities to produce higher reconstruction error for classification. In addition, we couple the mean square error (MSE) with Wasserstein loss to improve the encoding data distribution. Experiments on various datasets, including two different COVID-19 datasets and one brain MRI (RIDER) dataset prove the robustness and excellent generalization of the proposed MAMA Net.","Chen, Yurong; Zhang, Hui; Wang, Yaonan; Yang, Yimin; Zhou, Xianen; Jonathan Wu, Q M",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,459,1

The CA-TAMIS-GP group had a shorter operation time, less hemorrhage, and a lower average consumable cost than the ESD group (P < 0.05); moreover, the CA-TAMIS-GP group had no recurrence or long-term complications during a follow-up of 10-32 months, whereas3 patients in the ESD group developed local recurrence during a follow-up of 24-36 months. CONCLUSIONS The CA-TAMIS-GP is a new method that is safe and effective in patients with early rectal tumor and appears to have a shorter operation time and less blood loss as compared with ESD.","Mao, Weiming; Liao, Xiujun; Shao, Shuxian; Wu, Wenjing; Yu, Yanyan; Yang, Guangen",International journal of surgery,459,14

Fractal analysis of medical imaging has a potential to quantify this structural heterogeneity in the tumor AIMS: The purpose of this study is to quantify this structural abnormality in the tumor applying fractal analysis to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) image and to evaluate its biomarker value for predicting survival of surgically treated gastric cancer patients. METHODS A total of 108 gastric cancer patients (77 men and 31 women; mean age: 69.1 years), who received curative surgery without any neoadjuvant therapy, were retrospectively investigated. Portal-phase CE-CT images were analyzed with use of a plug-in tool for ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, USA), and the fractal dimension (FD) in the tumor was calculated using a differential box-counting method to quantify structural heterogeneity in the tumor. Tumor FD was compared with clinicopathologic features and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS High FD value of the tumor significantly associated with high T stage and high pathological stage (P = 0.009, 0.007, respectively). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with higher FD tumors (FD > 0.9746) showed a significantly worse DSS (P = 0.009, log rank). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor FD, T stage, and N stage were independent prognostic factors for DSS. In subset analysis of lymph-node positive gastric cancers, only tumor FD was an independent prognostic factor for DSS. CONCLUSION CT fractal analysis can be a useful biomarker for gastric cancer patients, reflecting survival and clinicopathologic features.","Watanabe, Hiroki; Hayano, Koichi; Ohira, Gaku; Imanishi, Shunsuke; Hanaoka, Toshiharu; Hirata, Atsushi; Kano, Masayuki; Matsubara, Hisahiro",Digestive diseases and sciences,459,16

We aimed to compare the clinical presentation and outcome of ARDS patients with or without risk factors, the impact on hospital mortality, and to assess the diagnostic work-up performed. The current study is an ancillary analysis of an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study (the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure, LUNG SAFE). Patients meeting ARDS criteria within 2 days of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure onset were included in the study and categorized as having risk factors or not. Outcomes were compared using propensity score matching. RESULTS Among 2813 patients, 234 (8.3% [7.3-9.3]) had no ARDS risk factor identified. These were older, had more frequent chronic diseases and presented with less severe SOFA and non-pulmonary SOFA scores (p < 0.001). Compared to other ARDS, CT scan (32.1 vs 23.9%, p < 0.001) and open lung biopsy (2.6 vs 0.2%, p < 0.001) were slightly more frequent but left heart filling pressures assessment was not (69.4 vs 68.4%, p > 0.99). Among ARDS with no risk factor, 45 patients (19.2%) had a specific diagnosis made. As compared to others, patients having ARDS with no risk factor had a lower ICU but not hospital mortality (34.6 vs 40.0%; p = 0.12). A matched cohort analysis confirmed the lack of significant difference in mortality. CONCLUSION Eight percent of ARDS patients have no identified risk factor, 80% of whom have no etiological diagnosis made. The outcome of ARDS with no risk factor was comparable to other ARDS but few had a comprehensive diagnostic work-up, potentially leading to missed curable diseases.

Robotic surgery is considered more expensive than open or laparoscopic approaches, but in certain situations has been demonstrated to be cost-effective. We examined the cost-effectiveness of open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches to proctectomy from societal and healthcare system perspectives. METHODS We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate one-year costs and outcomes of robotic, laparoscopic, and open proctectomy based on data from the available literature. The robustness of our results was tested with one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Open proctectomy had increased cost and lower quality of life (QOL) compared with laparoscopy and robotic approaches. In the societal perspective, robotic proctectomy costs $497/case more than laparoscopy, with minimal QOL improvements, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $751,056 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the healthcare sector perspective, robotic proctectomy resulted in $983/case more and an ICER of $1,485,139/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated factors influencing cost-effectiveness primarily pertained to the operative cost and the postoperative length of stay (LOS). In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost-effective approach to proctectomy was laparoscopic in 42% of cases, robotic in 39%, and open in 19% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic and robotic proctectomy cost less and have higher QALY than the open approach. Based on current data, laparoscopy is the most cost-effective approach. Robotic proctectomy can be cost-effective if modest differences in costs or postoperative LOS can be achieved.","Simianu, Vlad V; Curran, Thomas; Gaertner, Wolfgang B; Sklow, Bradford; Kuntz, Karen M; Kwaan, Mary R; Madoff, Robert D; Jensen, Christine C",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,459,19

However, chest tubes can induce pain and immobilization, increase risk of infection, deteriorate the ventilation capacity, and increase difficulty of postoperative management, particularly in children. This study aimed to investigate the safety and effect of excluding chest tubes after performing thoracoscopic lobectomy in selected children.A retrospective review of medical records was performed in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 2014 to June 2018. Patients who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy without chest tubes were recorded. Patients with accompanying severe pulmonary infection, extensive thoracic adhesions, or undeveloped interlobar fissure were excluded.In total, 246 patients underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy without a chest tube, and none required chest drain insertion or reintervention during hospitalization and follow-up at 90 days postoperatively. Among them, 2 (0.81%) patients developed a delayed pneumothorax which was found after being discharged, and resolved spontaneously in 2 weeks. No hemothorax, atelectasis, and bronchial fistula were found. Furthermore, 202 (82.1%) patients developed subcutaneous emphysema, which was asymptomatic and spontaneously resolved within 3 to 7 days. The length of postoperative hospital stay was 2 days; patients were discharged in the 3rd day postoperatively. Patients could recover to free mobilization and resume regular diet at 6 hours postoperatively. All patients were followed up for at least 3 months; no other complications were found, and all patients recovered well.This study showed that chest tube placement in selected patients may be unnecessary in children undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy. The minimally invasive procedure and meticulous resection have been the preconditions of this procedure, which may contribute to a rapid recovery and can avoid the chest tube-related complications effectively.","Cheng, Kaisheng; Yuan, Miao; Xu, Chang; Yang, Gang; Liu, Min",Medicine,459,16

However, persistent macrophage accumulation leads to chronic inflammation. Platelets are emerging as key modulators of the inflammatory response. Here, we identify that platelet C-type-lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2) is a crucial immunomodulatory receptor through the interaction with podoplanin, upregulated on inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, platelet CLEC-2 upregulates the expression of podoplanin and its co-ligands CD44 and ERM proteins, leading to actin rearrangement and promotion of cell migration; this is mimicked by recombinant CLEC-2-Fc (rCLEC-2-Fc). Treatment of LPS-challenged mice with rCLEC-2-Fc induces a rapid emigration of peritoneal macrophages to mesenteric lymph nodes, through a gradient generated by the podoplanin ligand, CCL21, to prime T cells. We propose that crosslinking podoplanin using rCLEC-2-Fc is a novel, cell-specific strategy to accelerate macrophage removal from the site of inflammation, and hence promote the resolution of the inflammatory response.

According to NIST2020 [1] report, face recognition accuracy of existing face recognition methods has a 20-50% of error rate due to the face covered by face mask, therefore, video surveillance systems and other face authentication systems are now not working efficiently. Recently many researchers have tried to solve this problem using mainly deep learning methods (CNN, FaceNet). Some researchers have used features from occluded (area covered by face mask) part and non-occluded part of the face while some researchers discard the occluded part and only used the non-occluded part of the face to recognize. For both of these two cases, the facial features of the occluded part of the face cannot be analyzed or cannot be used to recognize the face, as a result, these methods have high error rate. This paper proposed a reconstructive method to get partially reconstructed features of the occluded part of the face, then existing deep learning method has used to recognize the face. First the occluded part of a face is discarded and Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the remaining part of the face. Next, the principal components or the most significant Eigenvector and its corresponding weights are calculated to reconstruct the occluded part. Proposed method cannot reconstruct the occluded part completely but it can provide enough features of the occluded part which improves the recognition accuracy up to 15%. © 2021 IEEE.","Malakar, S.; Chiracharit, W.; Chamnongthai, K.; Charoenpong, T.","18th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2021",459,11

Methods The qualitative and cost analyses were conducted in Canada from July to October 2020. Using a list of reports, inquiries and commission from The Royal Society of Canada Working Group on Long-Term Care, we coded recurrent recommendations in LTC reports. We contacted the sponsoring organizations for a cost estimate, including direct and indirect costs. All costs were adjusted to 2020 Canadian dollar values. Results Of the 80 Canadian LTC reports spanning the years of 1998 to 2020, twenty-four (30%) were based on a national level and 56 (70%) were focused on provinces or municipalities. Report length ranged from 4 to 1491 pages and the median number of contributors was 14 (interquartile range, IQR, 5-26) per report. The most common recommendation was to increase funding to LTC to improve staffing, direct care and capacity (67% of reports). A median of 8 (IQR 3.25-18) recommendations were made per report. The total cost for all 80 reports was estimated to be $23,626,442.78. Interpretation Problems in Canadian LTC homes and their solutions have been known for decades.

However, some studies show that this is not always the case. A demand shock theory can explain the decrease in firm’s capital expenditures and net debt issuance during crisis period, but there should be no causal link between the two. This is because firms naturally do not invest during crisis period because of a decrease in investment wealth during crisis period. This paper aims to examine these theories with respect to the Covid-19 crisis in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: The change in firms’ capital expenditure and net debt issuance is analyzed using a non-parametric difference-in-difference and matching estimator across four firm-dimensions to see whether the implications of the supply shock theory apply to the current crisis or if that firms naturally do not invest during the crisis. In addition, this paper provides the result of panel regression to confirm the causal link between firms’ investment funds and capital expenditure, with an addition of consumer confidence index to accommodate the implications of the demand shock theory. Findings: The results of this paper show that the implications of the supply shock theory cannot explain the economic fluctuation during the Covid-19 crisis. Rather, the results suggest that firms naturally do not want to invest during the crisis and that the demand shock can better explain the economic fluctuation during the Covid-19 crisis. This is confirmed by the result of panel regression which shows that only consumer confidence index has a significant positive relationship with firms’ capital expenditure.

A possible involvement of pathogenetically relevant autoantibodies has been discussed. Recently neutralizing autoantibodies against anti-inflammatory receptor antagonists progranulin (PGRN) and IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1-Ra) were discovered in adult patients with critical COVID-19. Plasma of an index case with severe PIMS/MIS-C was analyzed for autoantibodies against IL-1-Ra and PGRN. The study was extended by a case series of 12 additional patients. In addition to ELISA for of antibodies, IL-1-Ra plasma levels were determined and IL-1-Ra was analyzed by Western-blot and isoelectric focusing. Functional activity of the autoantibodies was examined in vitro with IL-1beta reporter assays. Antibodies against IL-1-Ra could be detected in 10 of 13 (76.9%) patients with PIMS/MIS-C, but not in controls. In contrast to critical COVID-19 in adults, no IL-1-Ra antibodies of the IgM class were detected in PIMS/MIS-C. IL-1-Ra-antibodies exclusively belonged to IgG1. No antibodies directed against PGRN were detected. Western blots and ELISA showed a concomitant reduction of free IL-1-Ra plasma levels in the presence of IL-1-Ra-antibodies. The antibodies inhibited IL-1-Ra function in IL-1beta reporter cell assays. Notably, an additional, hyperphosphorylated, transiently occurring atypical isoform of IL-1-Ra was observed in all IL-1-Ra autoantibody-positive patients. To conclude, IL-1-Ra autoantibodies were observed in high frequency in children with PIMS/MIS-C. They may represent a diagnostic and pathophysiologically relevant marker for PIMS/MIS-C. Their generation is likely to be triggered by an atypical, hyperphosphorylated isoform of IL-1-Ra.","Pfeifer, J.; Thurner, B.; Kessel, C.; Fadle, N.; Regitz, E.; Hoffmann, M.-C.; Kos, I.; Preuss, K.-D.; Fischer, Y.; Roemer, K.; Lohse, S.; Heyne, K.; Detemple, M.-C.; Fedlmeier, M.; Juenger, H.; Sauer, H.; Meyer, S.; Rohrer, T.; Wittkowski, H.; Masjosthusmann, K.; Becker, S.

This study illustrates how the initial outbreak of the pandemic changed the supply of formal and informal care to older adults in European countries and Israel and assesses the resilience of these countries in providing support to their older populations by means of a mix of both types of care. We subjected data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe COVID-19 period (SHARE-COVID-19) across 23 European countries (including Israel) to descriptive and cluster analyses. In the first wave of the outbreak, a significant proportion of older adults in European countries received informal help, with an increase in the frequency of informal help received from children, neighbors, friends, or colleagues and a decrease in that received from other relatives. In most countries, difficulties in receiving home care services from professional providers were reported. Seven clusters were identified, reflecting different combinations of changes in the formal/informal care provision. In most countries, informal care is more resilient than home care services that formal providers deliver. Since they are an essential source for sustainable care, their challenges related to care should be addressed.

Entrevista a José Ruiz,16.828491,-1.2067771,2021,"Previous work in several laboratories has demonstrated that the epitranscriptomic addition of m6A to viral transcripts promotes the replication and pathogenicity of a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses, yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for this positive effect have remained unclear. It is known that m6A function is largely mediated by cellular m6A binding proteins or readers, yet how m6A readers regulate viral gene expression in general, and HIV-1 gene expression in particular, has been controversial. Here, we confirm that m6A addition indeed regulates HIV-1 RNA expression and demonstrate that this effect is in large part mediated by the the nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1 and the cytoplasmic m6A reader YTHDF2. Both YTHDC1 and YTHDF2 bind to multiple distinct and overlapping sites on the HIV-1 RNA genome, with YTHDC1 recruitment serving to regulate the alternative splicing of HIV-1 RNAs while YTHDF2 binding correlates with increased HIV-1 transcript stability. Author Summary This manuscript reports that the expression of mRNAs encoded by the pathogenic human retrovirus HIV-1 is regulated by the methylation of a small number of specific adenosine residues. These in turn recruit a nuclear RNA binding protein, called YTHDC1, which modulates the alternative splicing of HIV-1 transcripts, as well as a cytoplasmic RNA binding protein, called YTHDF2, which stabilizes viral mRNAs. The regulation of HIV-1 gene expression by adenosine methylation is therefore critical for the effective and ordered expression of HIV-1 mRNAs and could represent a novel target for antiviral development.","Tsai, Kevin; Bogerd, Hal P.; Kennedy, Edward M.; Emery, Ann; Swanstrom, Ronald; Cullen, Bryan R.",bioRxiv,459,25

Thus, the IoB can enable a myriad of services and applications for a wide range of sectors, including medicine, safety, security, wellness, entertainment, to name but a few. Especially considering the recent health and economic crisis caused by novel coronavirus pandemic, a.k.a. COVID-19, the IoB can revolutionize today’s public health and safety infrastructure. Nonetheless, reaping the full benefit of IoB is still subject to addressing related risks, concerns, and challenges. Hence, this survey first outlines the IoB requirements and related communication and networking standards. Considering the lossy and heterogeneous dielectric properties of the human body, one of the major technical challenges is characterizing the behavior of the communication links in-on-and-around the human body. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic survey of channel modeling issues for various link types of human body communication (HBC) channels below 100 MHz, the narrowband (NB) channels between 400 MHz and 2.5 GHz, and ultra-wideband (UWB) channels from 3 to 10 GHz. After explaining bio-electromagnetics attributes of the human body, physical and numerical body phantoms are presented along with electromagnetic propagation tool models. Then, the first-order and the second-order channel statistics for NB and UWB channels are covered with a special emphasis on body posture, mobility, and antenna effects. For capacitively, galvanically, and magnetically coupled HBC channels, four different channel modeling methods (i.e., analytical, numerical, circuit, and empirical) are investigated, and electrode effects are discussed. Lastly, interested readers are provided with open research challenges and potential future research directions. IEEE","Celik, A.; Salama, K. N.; Eltawil, A. M.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,459,10

Hacia un Estado más allá de la nación,16.568155,-1.2478101,2021,"Background: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis affecting large to medium-sized vessels. Cranial nerve lesions are frequently documented secondary to GCA, however peripheral nerves are rarely involved. Objectives: We present an unusual case of a GCA-associated isolated high median nerve palsy. Methods: Case report. Results: A 76 year old white British female presented in Spain with three weeks of frontotemporal headaches, mandibular claudication, photopsia and constitutional symptoms, followed by acute-onset right hand paresis and dysaesthesia. Acute-phase reactants were elevated. COVID-19 PCR was negative. Shortly after admission she developed acute bilateral anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and tongue necrosis with autoamputation. Temporal artery ultrasound and biopsy confirmed GCA. PET-CT showed no evidence of a diffuse large-vessel vasculitis. She was repatriated to the UK for ongoing inpatient care. Upper limb neurophysiology two months later demonstrated an isolated right high median nerve lesion, with reduced median motor responses and absent sensory responses with denervation in extensor carpi radialis. Imaging excluded a central lesion. The timing of her symptoms suggested the lesion was secondary to GCA. Treatment was with tocilizumab, methotrexate and tapering corticosteroids, alongside PEG feeding and careful multi-disciplinary rehabilitation. Conclusion: We suggest there are two important learning points from this complex case. Firstly, peripheral nerve lesions can occur in GCA, although they are rare. A literature search identified a modest number of case reports of brachial plexus or lower cervical nerve lesions1,2. Neurologic manifestations in GCA are attributed to vasculitis of the vasa nervorum, or extension of inflammation from arteries to contiguous nerves1,2. The restriction of clinical involvement to the median nerve alone would appear to favour the former mechanism. Functional recovery of neurological deficits is typically partial at best. Secondly, this case highlights the difficulty faced by clinicians in recognising GCA and the importance of urgent treatment with glucocorticoids. The patient developed GCA during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when Spain was the second-worst affected European country (5% seroprevalence;95% CI 4.7-5.4)3. The partial overlap in symptoms between GCA and COVID-19 (e.g. headache, pyrexia, malaise, elevated acute-phase reactants) can cause diagnostic confusion and treatment delay4. GCA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of older patients with suspected COVID-19, or the non-specifically unwell elderly patient.","Iqbal, K.; Miller, J.; Lai, M.; Charnley, M.; Meraj, M.; Thompson, B.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,459,32

Una experiencia docente de la asignatura de Derecho Procesal Penal,16.78976,-1.417585,2021,"Background : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated public health responses on an unprecedented scale. Controlling infectious diseases requires understanding of the conditions that increase spread. Prior studies have identified sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic associations. Ireland offers an unusual opportunity to quantify how high infection rates in one country impacted cases in a neighbouring country. Methods : We analysed official statistics on confirmed COVID-19 cases on the island of Ireland for 52 weeks from March 2020. Our main research question was: Did higher cases in Northern Ireland (NI) impact the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland (ROI)? We used least squares regression to compare confirmed cases in ROI counties that border NI with the rest of the state. We included in our model sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic factors. We employed the latitude of each county town as an instrumental variable to isolate a quasi-experimental estimate of the cross-border spread. Results : In the quasi-experimental framework, and controlling for population density, age distribution and circulatory disease prevalence, border counties had an extra 21.0 (95%CI: 8.4-33.6) confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1000 people. This equates to an estimated 9,611 additional cases in ROI, or 4% of the national total in the first year of the pandemic. Our results were substantively similar in non-experimental frameworks, with alternative additional predictors, and in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, population density in ROI counties was positively associated with confirmed cases and higher proportions of residents in the professional classes was negatively associated. Conclusion : On the island of Ireland during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, high infection rates in NI increased cases in the neighbouring ROI. Maximising co-ordination of pandemic responses among neighbouring countries is essential to minimising disease spread, and its associated disruptions to society and the economy. Socioeconomic disadvantage appeared to confer significant additional risk of spread.","Ahmed, R.; May, P.",Hrb Open Research,459,16

The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Total serum immunoglobulin E was determined for the wheezy group and a 4-year follow-up study was carried out to observe wheezing relapse. Significant differences were found between patients and controls in allele frequency and genotype distribution. The DD genotype was more frequent in patients in the wheezing and asthma groups than in the control subjects. Patients with the DD genotype had a higher frequency of relapse than patients expressing the ID or II genotypes.

However, viruses can still replicate and cause disease in vivo, because they have some strategy for at least partially circumventing the IFN response. We reviewed this topic in 2000 [Goodbourn, S., Didcock, L. & Randall, R. E. (2000). J Gen Virol 81, 2341-2364] but, since then, a great deal has been discovered about the molecular mechanisms of the IFN response and how different viruses circumvent it. This information is of fundamental interest, but may also have practical application in the design and manufacture of attenuated virus vaccines and the development of novel antiviral drugs. In the first part of this review, we describe how viruses activate the IFN system, how IFNs induce transcription of their target genes and the mechanism of action of IFN-induced proteins with antiviral action. In the second part, we describe how viruses circumvent the IFN response. Here, we reflect upon possible consequences for both the virus and host of the different strategies that viruses have evolved and discuss whether certain viruses have exploited the IFN response to modulate their life cycle (e.g. to establish and maintain persistent/latent infections), whether perturbation of the IFN response by persistent infections can lead to chronic disease, and the importance of the IFN system as a species barrier to virus infections. Lastly, we briefly describe applied aspects that arise from an increase in our knowledge in this area, including vaccine design and manufacture, the development of novel antiviral drugs and the use of IFN-sensitive oncolytic viruses in the treatment of cancer.","Randall, Richard E; Goodbourn, Stephen",The Journal of general virology,459,1

En nuestro país incluso se ha visto afectada la relación entre los profesionales de las ciencias de la salud, los pacientes y sus familias, en parte inducida por un estado desorganizado, que al seguir lineamientos de otras realidades sobre el manejo de pacientes bajo ciertos estándares del estado de salud, se han estipulado normativas que influyen en el tratamiento y pronóstico de la vida de la persona afectada, observándose atentados contra la dignidad del ser persona, de igual forma el desabastecimiento de los recursos, la corrupción y la pobre capacidad resolutiva del diagnóstico viral, no solo han permitido que se desconozca en tiempo real la enfermedad en nuestro país, sino que ha conllevado al desánimo de los profesionales como médicos y enfermeras, quienes al brindar atención y cuidado, a la variedad de estos pacientes también experimentan incapacidad, y vulnerabilidad ante la pandemia. En este sentido creemos necesario repensar sobre el impacto de la pandemia en nuestra población, así como en nuestro sistema de salud, para lo cual es importante volver al estudio de la atención sanitaria, el cuidado humano integral, modelos o corrientes en bioética vigentes, principios éticos personalistas para su abordaje; con la finalidad de brindar unos lineamientos y recomendaciones a tener en cuenta en la gestión y practica biomédica ante la crisis causada por el SARS-CoV-2.","Ñique Carbajal, Cesar; Cervera Vallejos, Mirtha; Díaz Manchay, Rosa; Domínguez Barrera, Constantino",Rev. méd. hered,459,15

The role of opportunistic fungal infections in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients remains less defined. Based on our multicenter experiences, we categorized the risks of opportunistic fungal infections in COVID-19 patients in Iran. The COVID-19 patients at high risk included those with acute respiratory distress syndrome, in intensive care units, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, immunosuppressants or corticosteroid, and supported by invasive or noninvasive ventilation. The patients were most likely to develop pulmonary aspergillosis, oral candidiasis, or pneumocystis pneumonia. Most diagnoses were probable as the accurate diagnosis of opportunistic fungal infections remains challenging in resource-poor settings. We summarize the clinical signs and laboratory tests needed to confirm candidiasis, aspergillosis, or pneumocystosis in our COVID-19 patients.","Salehi, Mohammadreza; Ahmadikia, Kazem; Badali, Hamid; Khodavaisy, Sadegh",Mycopathologia,459,16

When projections extrapolate from recent histories and adopt a 'business as usual' approach they risk failing to take account of shocks or unpredictable events that can have dramatic consequences for the status quo as seen with the global Covid-19 pandemic. This study used an explorative stakeholder process and shock centred narratives to discuss the potential impact of a diversity of shocks, examining system characteristics and trends that may amplify their impact. Through the development of scenarios, stakeholders revealed concerns about the stability of the food system and the social, economic and environmental consequence of food related shocks. Increasing connectivity served as a mechanism to heighten volatility and vulnerability within all scenarios, with reliance on singular crops and technologies (i.e. low diversity) throughout systems highlighted as another potential source of vulnerability. The growing role of social media in shaping attitudes and behaviours towards food, and the increasing role of automation emerged as contemporary areas of concern, which have thus far been little explored within the literature.","Hamilton, Hannah; Henry, Roslyn; Rounsevell, Mark; Moran, Dominic; Cossar, Frances; Allen, Kathleen; Boden, Lisa; Alexander, Peter",Futures,459,16

There is limited evidence about the effect of this change in behavior on women's health. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis, treatment and complications of women presenting with a tubal Ectopic Pregnancy (EP). STUDY DESIGN: This is a single centre retrospective cohort study. We compared the clinical presentation, treatment modalities and complications of all women presenting in our institution with a tubal EP during the COVID-19 pandemic between 15 March and 15 June 2020, with women who were treated in our institution with the same diagnosis in the corresponding period for the years 2018-2019. RESULTS: The study group included 19 cases of EP (N = 19) that were treated between the 15 March 2020 and 15 June 2020. The control group included 30 cases of EP (N = 30) that were admitted to in the corresponding period during 2018 and 2019. Maternal age, parity, gravity and mode of conception (natural vs. assisted) were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in the mean gestational age (GA) according to the last menstrual period. In the study group more women presented with sonographic evaluation of high fluid volume in the abdomen than in the control group (53 % vs 17 %, P value 0.01). This finding is correlated with a more advanced disease status. In the study group there was a highly statistically significant 3-fold increase in rupture among cases (P < 0.005) and a 4-fold larger volume of blood in the entrance to the abdomen (P < 0.002). We found that there were no cases of ruptured EP in the group of women who were pregnant after assisted reproduction. CONCLUSION: We found a higher rate of ruptured ectopic pregnancies in our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care providers should be alerted to this collateral damage in the non-infected population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dvash, Shira; Cuckle, Howard; Smorgick, Noam; Vaknin, Zvi; Padoa, Anna; Maymon, Ron",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,459,21

Some evidence suggests that high IQ is associated with later sleep patterns. However, it is unclear whether the relationship between IQ and later sleep is due to biological or social effects, such as the timing of working hours. We investigated the association between habitual sleep timing during work days and work-free days, working time and membership in Mensa, an organization of highly intelligent individuals (IQ &#8805;130) using a sample of 1,172 adults split between Mensa members and age- and sex-matched volunteers from a large web-based database. We found no difference in chronotype, and the later sleep timing of Mensa members on work days was fully accounted for by later work start times. Our results indicate that later sleep timing in those with higher IQs is not due to physiological differences, but rather due to later work schedules. Later working times and the resulting lower social jetlag may be one of the reasons why higher IQ is associated with lower prospective morbidity and mortality.","Ujma, Péter P; Baudson, Tanja G; Bódizs, Róbert; Dresler, Martin",Sci Rep,459,15

We aimed to study the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within families with children in Greece. We studied 23 family clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in respiratory specimens. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. There were 109 household members (66 adults and 43 children). The median attack rate per cluster was 60% (range: 33.4%-100%). An adult member with COVID-19 was the first case in 21 (91.3%) clusters. Transmission of infection occurred from an adult to a child in 19 clusters and/or from an adult to another adult in 12 clusters. There was no evidence of child-to-adult or child-to-child transmission. In total 68 household members (62.4%) tested positive. Children were more likely to have an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults (40% vs 10.5%; P = .021). In contrast, adults were more likely to develop a severe clinical course compared with children (8.8% vs 0%; P = .021).

This study aimed to (a) understand the satisfaction level of the online information related to COVID-19 in people with and without chronic diseases; (b) explore information-searching behavior and digital health literacy in PWCD; and (3) identify the possible predictors of information satisfaction among PWCD. METHODS: This was a multicity, cross-sectional study using an online survey with a convenience sample of people who (a) were 15 years of age or older and (b) had access to the Internet in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. FINDINGS: Four thousand four hundred and seventy-two subjects completed the survey, of whom less than 50% felt satisfied with the online information. About 20% of respondents (n = 882) were diagnosed with at least one chronic disease and reported a lower level of information satisfaction (p = .003) than the people without chronic diseases. The majority of the PWCD obtained their online health information from social media. Higher digital health literacy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.07), higher frequency of searches regarding symptoms of COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 2.07), higher perceived importance of quickly learning from the information searched (adjusted OR = 1.63), and lower frequency of searches on the topic of dealing with psychological stress (adjusted OR = 0.54) were found to be predictors of information satisfaction among PWCD. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of PWCD sought online information related to COVID-19 from social media, and their level of information satisfaction was significantly lower than among people without chronic diseases. Digital health literacy is a strong and significant predictor of information satisfaction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To support PWCD, we not only have to provide them with clear and accurate information, but also promote their digital health literacy so that they may seek, understand, and appraise health information from the Internet to make appropriate health-related judgments and decisions.","Kor, Patrick Pui Kin; Leung, Angela Yee Man; Parial, Laurence Lloyd; Wong, Eliza Mi Ling; Dadaczynski, Kevin; Okan, Orkan; Amoah, Padmore Adusei; Wang, Shan Shan; Deng, Renli; Cheung, Teris Cheuk Chi; Molassiotis, Alex",J Nurs Scholarsh,459,24

Furthermore, ""super antibacterial systems"" through pre-treatment defense and targeted bactericidal system, are proposed with increasing evidence of clinical potential. Finally, the advantages and future challenges of surface strategies to resist healthcare-associated infections are discussed, with promising prospects of developing novel antimicrobial materials.","Li, Wenlong; Thian, Eng San; Wang, Miao; Wang, Zuyong; Ren, Lei",Adv Sci (Weinh),459,4

Methods: As part of the experimental paradigm, participants were randomly assigned to read a fictitious news article about the utility of PPE (i.e., pro-PPE, anti-PPE, or neutral), and then rate images of a police officer using different items of PPE (i.e., masks, goggles, face shields, and/or medical gloves) along eight dimensions. Results: The analyses reveal that participants overwhelmingly perceived the use of PPE as both important and beneficial, regardless of condition. The analyses also reveal that the use of PPE impacted perceptions of the pictured officer, but that the specific perceptual effects of such PPE varied by the item used. Conclusions: Police worldwide have attempted to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19 by using PPE. In addition to functional benefits, many items of PPE also present perceptual benefits.","Simpson, Rylan; Sandrin, Ryan",J Exp Criminol,459,24

In this work, we developed a synthetic microbial consortium composed of two genetically engineered microbes, a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942) and a heterotrophic bacterium (Pseudomonas putida EM173). These microbial species specialize in the co-culture: cyanobacteria fix CO2 through photosynthetic metabolism and secrete sufficient carbohydrates to support the growth and active metabolism of P. putida, which has been engineered to consume sucrose and to degrade the environmental pollutant 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT). By encapsulating S. elongatus within a barium-alginate hydrogel, cyanobacterial cells were protected from the toxic effects of 2,4-DNT, enhancing the performance of the co-culture. The synthetic consortium was able to convert 2,4-DNT with light and CO2 as key inputs, and its catalytic performance was stable over time. Furthermore, cycling this synthetic consortium through low nitrogen medium promoted the sucrose-dependent accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate, an added-value biopolymer, in the engineered P. putida strain. Altogether, the synthetic consortium displayed the capacity to remediate the industrial pollutant 2,4-DNT while simultaneously synthesizing biopolymers using light and CO2 as the primary inputs.","Fedeson, Derek T; Saake, Pia; Calero, Patricia; Nikel, Pablo Iván; Ducat, Daniel C",Microb Biotechnol,459,13

In the period thereafter, provision of palliative care was regionally expanded. This upgrade included the establishment of palliative medicine consultation services (PMCS), combining general and specialized palliative care on an outpatient basis. A follow-up place of death survey took place in 2017. The aim was to depict the trends in place of death between 2001 and 2017. A second goal was to determine how often outpatient PMCS were used by persons who died in 2017. METHODS: Descriptive analysis of place of death as specified in all death certificates (2001, 2011, 2017) issued in the cities of Bochum and Münster and the districts of Borken and Coesfeld. Comparison of pseudonymized data on deceased patients (2017) treated by the PMCS of Münster and Coesfeld with the place of death database to ascertain the rate of PMCS care at the end of life. RESULTS: A total of 38 954 death certificates were analyzed, and 5887 deaths were compared with PCMS data. The distribution of place of death was as follows: (2001, 2011, 2017; age standardized; %): own residence 27.8; 23.3; 21.3; hospital: 55.8; 51.8; 51.8; palliative care unit: 0.0; 1.0; 6.2; hospice: 1.9; 4.5; 4.8; nursing home: 13.1; 18.6; 20.4; other: 1.2; 1.2; 1.5. The rate of PMCS use was 28.8% (1694/5887). CONCLUSION: Over the period 2001-2017, the proportion of people who died at home or in the hospital went down, while the number who died in a palliative care unit, hospice, or nursing home increased. In the city of Münster and the district of Coesfeld, one fourth of the people who died in 2017 received PMCS care at the end of life.","Dasch, Burkhard; Zahn, Peter K",Dtsch Arztebl Int,459,21

Here we studied the medium term effects of COVID-19 on survivors of severe disease. METHODS: This is a retrospective, case series of 200 patients hospitalised across three large Birmingham hospitals with severe-to-critical COVID-19 infection 4-7 months from disease-onset. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical, laboratory, imaging, lung function test, quality of life and cognitive assessments. RESULTS: At 4-7 months from disease-onset, 63.2% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness, 53.5% complained of significant fatigue, 37.5% reduced mobility and 36.8% pain. Serum markers of inflammation and organ injuries that persisted at hospital discharge had normalised on follow-up indicating no sustained immune response causing chronic maladaptive inflammation. Chest radiographs showed a complete resolution in 82.8%; and significantly improved or no change in 17.2%. Lung function test (LFT) revealed gas transfer abnormalities in 80.0% and spirometry in 37.6% patients. Patients with breathlessness had significantly high incidence of comorbidities, abnormal residual chest X-ray and LFT (p<0.01 to all). In all parameters assessed and persisting symptoms there was no statically significant difference between patients managed on hospital wards and on ITU groups.

The unprecedented pandemic, entangled with the already elevated complexities in the nation's internal environment and external surroundings, aggravated its economic outlook. Internal factors including severe education mismatch in China's labor force, its vanishing demographic dividend, the declined purchasing power of its middle-income groups, risen leverage ratio of households and enterprises, and soared local government debt reinforced to weaken China's domestic demand. External factors, especially uncertainty in the China-US relation in the face of the re-shaping global value chain, dragged world economic recovery and thus China's exports and imports. This summary report highlights some major challenges and opportunities faced by the nation under its new development strategy that stresses internal circulation of domestic economy aided by its interaction with the globe. Our analyses based on IAR-CMM model provide a unified framework for addressing China's short-, medium-, and long-term issues in an internally coherent manner. Looking into year 2021, our benchmark projection reports an 8.4% annual real GDP growth rate. Alternative scenario analyses and policy simulations are conducted to assess the impacts of potential downside risks and the corresponding policy options for ensuring implicit targets. Through the lens of these analyses, we conclude that a refocus on effective management of internal demand, while deepening structural reforms on supply side and advancing orderly opening up, can help smooth the internal and external circulations of the Chinese economy to achieve high-quality development.","Huang, K.

Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4-8 h to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ~100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.","Kashir, Junaid; Yaqinuddin, Ahmed",Med Hypotheses,459,23

This study examines whether a similar model applies to the motion pathway in human participants by varying the orientation and direction of motion of the surround relative to the centre. Four experienced observers completed a two-interval forced-choice contrast matching task. The stimuli were drifting sinusoidal grating patterns with high contrast surrounds (95%) differing in direction of motion and orientation relative to the centre grating. All surround conditions produced suppression but a common orientation and direction of motion produced significantly more suppression than either opposite direction of motion conditions or orthogonal direction conditions. The tuning for motion direction differences was assessed for same and opposite directions of motion. These findings support the extension of the two-mechanism model of contrast suppression to motion direction.","Phillips, Daisy J; McDougall, Thomas J; Dickinson, J Edwin; Badcock, David R",Vision Res,459,14

Part 2 discusses current treatment options of COVID-19, and part 3 refers to this treatment application in patients after solid organ transplant. RESULTS: We have summarized 45 studies from China, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mortality rates from published studies were variable. Based on early data from Spain, 42% of patients who developed COVID-19 within 60 days of transplant died. According to results of the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database collaboration group, the 28-day COVID-19-related mortality is 21.3% for kidney transplant recipients, which is still markedly higher than what is observed in other populations. Acute kidney injury was common, and mycophenolate mofetil and mammalian target of rapamycin were discontinued in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Effective therapy has been sought since the outbreak of the pandemic, and at the same time intensive work has been done to produce a vaccine that could effectively protect against the disease. Summing up the efforts of numerous groups of researchers from around the world that have been continued since the beginning of 2020, we may assume the following: (1) we still do not have causal drugs that would reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and allow its complete elimination, but antispike monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 seem to be very promising, and (2) the withdrawal of antiproliferative and antimetabolic drugs and the continuation of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors is now a commonly accepted approach in patients after organ transplant.","Kedzierska-Kapuza, Karolina; Zielinska, Dorota; Matejak-Górska, Marta; Durlik, Marek",Transplant Proc,459,21

Well-mixed room models significantly underestimate the risk of infection for short and direct exposure. To this end, we estimate the upper bound for infection risk with the susceptible in the infectious exhalation cloud or wearing masks by having the masked susceptible inhale the entire exhalation of a masked infectious. Social distances without a mask, even at 3m between speaking individuals results in an upper bound of 90\% for risk of infection after a few minutes. If both wear a surgical mask, the risk of infection for the person speaking remains below 26\% even after 60 minutes. When both the infectious and susceptible wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, the upper bound for risk is reduced by a factor of 60 compared to surgical masks. In both cases, face leakage is very important. For FFP2 masks, leakage is low in the nasal region and directed upward, which can be further reduced significantly by applying double-sided medical tape there. Considering that the calculated upper bound greatly overestimates the risk of infection, and the fact that with a poorly worn mask even the upper bound we calculated is very low, we conclude that wearing a mask, even with some leakage, provides excellent third party and self-protection.","Bagheri, Gholamhossein; Thiede, Birte; Hejazi, Bardia; Schlenczek, Oliver; Bodenschatz, Eberhard",,459,15

In this work, we develop a tensor method to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discrete-time difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using both county- and state-level COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction.","Kargas, Nikos; Qian, Cheng; Sidiropoulos, Nicholas D.; Xiao, Cao; Glass, Lucas M.; Sun, Jimeng",,459,16

To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical decision is the extent to which policy makers rely on voluntary as opposed to enforced compliance, and nations vary along this dimension. While enforcement may secure higher compliance, there is experimental and other evidence that it may also crowd out voluntary motivation. How does enforcement affect citizens' support for anti-COVID-19 policies? A survey conducted with 4,799 respondents toward the end of the first lockdown in Germany suggests that a substantial share of the population will support measures more under voluntary than under enforced implementation. Negative responses to enforcement-termed control aversion-vary across the nature of the policy intervention (e.g., they are rare for masks and frequent for vaccination and a cell-phone tracing app). Control aversion is less common among those with greater trust in the government and the information it provides, and among those who were brought up under the coercive regime of East Germany. Taking account of the likely effectiveness of enforcement and the extent to which near-universal compliance is crucial, the differing degrees of opposition to enforcement across policies suggest that for some anti-COVID-19 policies an enforced mandate would be unwise, while for others it would be essential. Similar reasoning may also be relevant for policies to address future pandemics and other societal challenges like climate change.","Schmelz, Katrin",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A,459,24

Recently, taste disturbance is also considered as one of the predominant symptoms of COVID-19 although its pathogenesis requires further research. Localized taste disorders may be overlooked considering that whole-mouth taste perception is insured through several mechanisms. Individuals often fail to discern taste from flavor, and interviews/surveys are insufficient to properly assess taste function. Hence, various taste assessment methods have been developed. Among them, psychophysical methods are most widely applied in a clinical context. Less-biased electrophysiological, imaging, or morphological methods are used to a much lesser degree. Overall, more research is needed in the field of taste.","Zhu, Y; Hummel, T",,459,33

METHODS: Hospitalised patients aged &#8805; 70 were included, comparing COVID-19 cases with non-COVID-19 controls admitted over the same period. Frailty was prospectively measured and mortality ascertained through linkage with national and local statutory reports. RESULTS: In 217 COVID-19 cases and 160 controls, older age and South Asian ethnicity, though not socioeconomic position, were associated with higher mortality. For frailty, differences in effect size were evident between cases (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.12) and controls (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.46-2.72), with an interaction term (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.71) in multivariable models.

The present study aimed to investigate the predictors of disease severity and thus determine the trends for disease progression early. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from Fuyang Second People's Hospital from January to February 2020. Patients' demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected, and the relationships between these variables and disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 158 cases were included according to COVID-19 diagnosis, and the treatment schemes were analyzed for identification of early indicators affecting COVID-19 progression. Severe cases accounted for 18.99% of the diagnosed cases. Analysis showed that patients' age (&#967;²=10.640,=0.041); the time interval between onset and diagnosis (&#967;²=7.278, P=0.026); the source of cases (&#967;²=5.557, P=0.018); fever (&#967;²=5.676, P=0.014); dyspnea (&#967;²=113.085, P<0.001); muscle or joint pain (&#967;²=3.900, P=0.048); chest pain (&#967;²=13.446, P=0.006); the levels of lymphocytes (t=2.917, P=0.014), C-reactive protein (U=730.00, P<0.001), and aspartate aminotransferase (U=1235.00, P=0.002); damage in both lungs within 3 days of admission (&#967;²=7.632, P=0.003); and diabetes (&#967;²=6.675, P=0.010) were significantly correlated with the trend of intensification. CONCLUSIONS Older age, a long time interval from onset to diagnosis, imported cases from an affected area, dyspnea, muscle or joint pain, chest pain during the course of the disease, reduced lymphocytes, elevated C-reactive protein, computed tomography scan showing damage to both lungs within 3 days of admission, and diabetes mellitus are predictors for severe COVID-19.","Li, Liang; Sun, Wei; Han, Mingfeng; Ying, Yunli; Wang, Quanzhi",Med Sci Monit,459,20

In this perspective, to test existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a good approach. Among natural phenolic compounds found in plants, fruit, and vegetables; flavonoids are the most abundant. Flavonoids, especially in their glycosylated forms, display a number of physiological activities, which makes them interesting to investigate as antiviral molecules. The flavonoids chemical structures were downloaded from PubChem and protease structure 6LU7 was from the Protein Data Bank site. Molecular docking study was performed using AutoDock Vina. Among the tested molecules Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed the highest binding affinity (-9,7 kcal/mol). Docking studies showed that glycosylated flavonoids are good inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease and could be further investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments for further validation. MD simulations were further performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior and stability of the protein in complex with the three best hits of docking experiments. Our results indicate that the rutin is a potential drug to inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro) of Coronavirus.","Cherrak, Sabri Ahmed; Merzouk, Hafida; Mokhtari-Soulimane, Nassima",PLoS One,459,15

We examine evidence of the effects of weight bias on well-being during the pandemic and highlight unanswered questions to be addressed in future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies that have investigated weight change during stay-at-home orders have yielded mixed findings and relied predominantly on self-reported retrospective recall, thus providing weak evidence of a widespread ""quarantine-15"" effect. No studies to date have evaluated the effects on weight stigma and health of obesity-focused COVID-19 media and public health messages. Individuals with a history of experiencing weight bias may be more vulnerable to binge eating and psychological distress during the pandemic.

Using autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach and causality tests, the study analyzed the relationship between real GDP, tourist arrivals, foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into the tourism sector and FDI in the others sectors. The results obtained indicate that there is a positive relationship between tourist arrivals and economic growth in the long-run. The results also show that non-tourism FDI has a positive and significant impact on economic growth, while tourism FDI has a negative effect on economic growth. In addition, long-run causality results show that the hypothesis of economic growth driven by tourist arrivals and foreign direct investment is significant at the 1% level. Similarly, our results show that in the long-run, the hypothesis of tourism demand driven by economic growth and FDI is significant at the 1% level. The Granger causality test reveals a one-way causal relationship from economic growth to tourist arrivals, FDI flows in the tourism sectors and FDI flows in the non-tourism sectors in Morocco. This study suggests that decisions-makers should align the tourism strategy with other sectoral plans in a global, coherent and integrated strategic vision to take full advantage of FDI and international tourism.

Among 457 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia between 3/31/2020-4/10/2020, we identified 42 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The median initial SOFA score was 2 (IQR 2-3). 20 out of 42 patients had a lower SOFA score on their subsequent tests. We identified a statistically significant inverse correlation between the change in SOFA score and change in the Ct value with a decrease in SOFA score by 0.05 (SE 0.02; p<0.05) for an increase in Ct values by 1. This correlation was independent of the duration of symptoms.

We compute the distribution of outbreak sizes including extreme events, and show that each outbreak entails a unique, depletion or boost in the pool of susceptibles and an increase or decrease in the effective recovery rate compared to the mean-field dynamics -- due to finite-size noise. Unlike extreme events occurring in long-lived metastable stochastic systems, the underlying outbreak distribution depends on a full continuum of optimal paths, each connecting two unique non-trivial fixed-points, and thus represents a novel class of extreme dynamics.","Hindes, Jason; Assaf, Michael; Schwartz, Ira B.",,459,24

Although their pathogenesis is unclear, evidences link them to viral neuroinvasive potential. This study aims at estimating the prevalence of OCMT in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and investigating its clinical correlates. METHODS: In a single-institution retrospective cross-sectional study, we included all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 undergoing head CT scan for any reason. Exclusion criteria were history of recent head trauma or chronic rhinosinusitis; opacification > 2 mm in any sinonasal space other than the olfactory cleft; CT performed during/after invasive ventilation or feeding via nasogastric tube. We recorded the prevalence of OCMT and related it to age, sex, need for invasive ventilation during hospital stay, outcome, length of hospital stay, diffusion of lung SARS-CoV-19 lesions and outcome. RESULTS: 63 eligible patients were identified (39 male, 24 female; median age 77.82 ± 17.77 years). OCMT was identified in 16 patients (25.4%; 95% CI 15.3-37.9%). Patients with OCMT had longer hospital stays (median 16 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 14.5 days, p = .009, Mann-Whitney U test) and required invasive ventilation more frequently than patients without mucosal thickening (OR 4.89, 95% CI 0.96-24.89, p = .063, Fisher's test). No other difference was observed. CONCLUSION: OCMT affects nearly one in four patients hospitalized for COVID-19. It is associated with a worse disease course irrespective of age, sex and diffusion of lung lesions, although with no direct effect on survival.","Spoldi, Chiara; Castellani, Luca; Pipolo, Carlotta; Maccari, Alberto; Lozza, Paolo; Scotti, Alberto; Pisani, Antonia; De Donato, Giuseppe; Portaleone, Sara; Cariati, Maurizio; Felisati, Giovanni; Saibene, Alberto Maria",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,459,1

Among them is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged as a deadly pandemic, calling for intense research efforts on its pathogenicity mechanism and development of therapeutic strategies. In the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm, systemic inflammation has been associated with severe illness and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated special pro-resolving lipids mediators (SPMs) lipoxins, resolvins, maresins, and protectins as potential therapeutic options for abnormal viral-triggered inflammation. Pro-resolving lipids mediators have shown great promise for the treatment of Herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus. Based on this, studies are being conducted on their therapeutic effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we discussed SPMs and reviewed evidence from recent studies on SPMs as therapeutic options for viral infections, including SARS-CoV2. Based on our analysis of the previous study, we argue that SPMs are a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viral infections.

The aim of the review is to discuss common features of these risk factors and the impact of vitamin D. RECENT FINDINGS: The recently discovered relationship between vitamin D and the infection pathway of the virus via the renin--angiotensin system (RAS) and the adipokines leptin and adiponectin play an important role. The frequency of studies showing a relationship between a low vitamin D status in comorbidities and severe COVID-19 courses makes an impact of vitamin D effects likely. SUMMARY: There is a direct relationship between vitamin D, body fat and age in COVID-19 courses. With age, the ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D decreases, and leads to vitamin D-deficits. If the skin is insufficiently exposed to sunlight, severe deficits can develop. As vitamin D plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in the RAS, and thus at the point where the virus attacks, a good vitamin D supply is an important basis for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 processes. Treatment with vitamin D supplements should be based on severity of the vitamin D deficiency.","Biesalski, Hans K",Curr. opin. clin. nutr. metab. care,459,24

Admittedly, telomeres progressively shorten with age that can also be significantly accelerated by pathological conditions, which are often considered as potential contributors for cellular senescence. It is commonly believed that constant accumulation of senescent cells may lead to dysfunctional tissues and organs, thereby accelerating aging process and subsequent occurrence of age-related diseases. In particular, epidemiological data has indicated a significant association between environmental pollutants exposure and a high incidence of age-related diseases. Moreover, there is growing evidence that environmental toxicity has a detrimental impact on telomere length. Overall, a consensus is emerging that environmental pollutants exposure could lead to accelerated telomere erosion and further induce premature senescence, which may be responsible for the acceleration of aging and the high morbidity and mortality rates of age-related diseases.","Liu, Yaru; Wang, Jiequan; Huang, Zhaogang; Liang, Jun; Xia, Qingrong; Xia, Quan; Liu, Xinhua",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,459,10

We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD. METHODS: Systematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate: (a) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (b) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (c) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. RESULTS: The consensus comprises 2 overarching principles and 7 recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommend that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference. CONCLUSION: These recommendations provide guidance for COVID-19 vaccination in PRD. Most recommendations in this consensus are conditional, reflecting a lack of evidence or low-level evidence.","Santosa, Amelia; Xu, Chuanhui; Arkachaisri, Thaschawee; Kong, Kok Ooi; Lateef, Aisha; Lee, Tau Hong; Leong, Keng Hong; Low, Andrea Hsiu Ling; Sriranganathan, Melonie K; Tan, Teck Choon; Teng, Gim Gee; Thong, Bernard Yu-Hor; Fong, Warren; Lahiri, Manjari",Int J Rheum Dis,459,3

The other 62 referenced papers were of different types (eg, reviews, WHO protocols, letter to editor etc).Study selection The study selected trials, reviews, and in-vitro research assessing the critical aspects of saliva as an easily accessible and early-stage diagnostic source, and also an entry route for 2019-nCoV. Most of the clinical studies were descriptive case series of patients who had contracted 2019-nCoV in China. These were mainly studies designed to compare saliva samples with throat swabs, with regard to the presence of 2019-nCoV RNA. Another aspect of the included studies was the susceptibility of oral tissues to 2019-nCoV due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor for the 2019-nCoV. Some review studies and clinical infection control protocols were also included to discuss the transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV from the oral cavity. Studies were not restricted to English language and they were not all full-text papers.Data extraction and synthesis A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted using distinct headings and subheadings, defined by the authors based on relevancy to the consensus about the importance of saliva with reference to 2019-nCoV.Results There was an inherent heterogeneity among the included clinical studies concerning their designs, sampling techniques, and the results about the diagnostic value of saliva. The percentage of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with positive 2019-nCoV RNA varied from 12.9% to 91.67% among these studies. Regarding the possibility of direct virus invasion into the oral tissues, the results suggested that ACE2+ cells in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-nCoV and theoretically could generate infectious saliva in a sustained way. Furin was suggested as another protein which makes the tongue more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV, especially in conditions inducing its upregulation (for example, squamous cell carcinoma). According to the comparisons between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, saliva could be considered of diagnostic value via the early detection of viral RNA for both of the viruses. Whilst the viral peak was shown to be at onset of symptoms for 2019-nCoV, it can linger up to the tenth day after the appearance of symptoms for SARS-CoV. Finally, this paper warns about airborne transmission, particularly for close contacts.Conclusions Saliva can be proposed as an easily accessible diagnostic source although further clinical studies are required. Given the presence of viral RNA in saliva in the early stages of COVID-19, the recommendations to wear masks to prevent the rapid transmission of infectious droplets into the air, and keep a safe distance from other people are clearly based in evidence.","Shamsoddin, Erfan",Evid Based Dent,459,28

This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) ""How is your child doing since the lockdown?"" 2) ""How is life at home since the lockdown?"" 3) ""If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us"" 4) ""Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation"". This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey. RESULTS: Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71 % (95 % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33 % (95 % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96 % (95 % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions. CONCLUSIONS: According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being. An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions.","Bobo, E; Lin, L; Acquaviva, E; Caci, H; Franc, N; Gamon, L; Picot, M-C; Pupier, F; Speranza, M; Falissard, B; Purper-Ouakil, D",Encephale,459,7

METHODS: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in April, June and August 2020 in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods. Participants were selected at random to provide blood for Elecsys immunoassay for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibodies. A Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district. RESULTS: In total, 3005 participants from 623 households were enrolled in this study. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-13.1] and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4-21.7) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0-1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3-17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively. The conditional risk of infection was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.28-0.52) in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods, respectively, in Phase 2. Similar trends were observed in Phase 3. Only 5.4% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were symptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 1.66%, 0.37% and 0.26% in Phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Continuing rounds of seroprevalence studies will help to improve understanding of secular trends and the extent of infection during the course of the pandemic.","Nisar, Muhammad Imran; Ansari, Nadia; Khalid, Farah; Amin, Mashal; Shahbaz, Hamna; Hotwani, Aneeta; Rehman, Najeeb; Pugh, Sierra; Mehmood, Usma; Rizvi, Arjumand; Memon, Arslan; Ahmed, Zahoor; Ahmed, Ashfaque; Iqbal, Junaid; Saleem, Ali Faisal; Aamir, Uzma Bashir; Larremore, Daniel B; Fosdick, Bailey; Jehan, Fyezah",Int J Infect Dis,459,16

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate COVID-19 impact on colorectal cancer services globally and identify predictors for behaviour change. DESIGN: An online survey of colorectal cancer service change globally in May and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Attending or consultant surgeons involved in the care of patients with colorectal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in the delivery of diagnostics (diagnostic endoscopy), imaging for staging, therapeutics and surgical technique in the management of colorectal cancer. Predictors of change included increased hospital bed stress, critical care bed stress, mortality and world region. RESULTS: 191 responses were included from surgeons in 159 centers across 46 countries, demonstrating widespread service reduction with global variation. Diagnostic endoscopy was reduced in 93% of responses, even with low hospital stress and mortality; whilst rising critical care bed stress triggered complete cessation (p = 0.02). Availability of CT and MRI fell by 40-41%, with MRI significantly reduced with high hospital stress. Neoadjuvant therapy use in rectal cancer changed in 48% of responses, where centers which had ceased surgery increased its use (62 vs 30%, p = 0.04) as did those with extended delays to surgery (p<0.001). High hospital and critical care bed stresses were associated with surgeons forming more stomas (p<0.04), using more experienced operators (p<0.003) and decreased laparoscopy use (critical care bed stress only, p<0.001). Patients were also more actively prioritized for resection, with increased importance of co-morbidities and ICU need. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with severe restrictions in the availability of colorectal cancer services on a global scale, with significant variation in behaviours which cannot be fully accounted for by hospital burden or mortality.","Mason, Sam E; Scott, Alasdair J; Markar, Sheraz R; Clarke, Jonathan M; Martin, Guy; Winter Beatty, Jasmine; Sounderajah, Viknesh; Yalamanchili, Seema; Denning, Max; Arulampalam, Thanjakumar; Kinross, James M",PLoS One,459,24

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12-29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. RESULTS: Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students' projections of trends in COVID-19.

In children, COVID-19 usually has a relatively mild course. However, in rare cases, severe disorders can be observed, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to analyse the frequency, clinical picture and outcome of COVID-19 in children based on the experience from the tertiary care centre and regional sanitary-epidemiological office. METHODS: We report a study regarding 106 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab (age range 1-month - 17-years). In all cases, history was taken. In children who required hospital admission, physical examination and laboratory test were performed according to clinical indications. RESULTS: Twelve of the patients required admission to the hospital. The most common symptoms were anosmia and dysgeusia (75%) and headaches (49%) in outpatients and fever in hospitalised children (75%). Three children from the hospitalised group developed a severe course with increased inflammatory indexes. The clinical picture was more severe in younger children from the hospitalised group. Treatment options were regarded individually in all cases. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first tour knowledge regarding the clinical course of COVID-19 in Polish children. In general, the clinical course of COVID-19 was mild with anosmia and dysgeusia as the most common symptoms. However, in hospitalised children, a severe progression of the disease and less typical signs as aplastic anaemia may be developed.","Mania, Anna; Mazur-Melewska, Katarzyna; Lubarski, Karol; Kuczma-Napierala, Jadwiga; Mazurek, Justyna; Jonczyk-Potoczna, Katarzyna; Sluzewski, Wojciech; Figlerowicz, Magdalena",J Infect Public Health,459,26

In this project, we use mean field control and mean field game models to analyze and inform the decisions of electricity producers on how much renewable sources of production ought to be used in the presence of a carbon tax. The trade-off between higher revenues from production and the negative externality of carbon emissions is quantified for each producer who needs to balance in real time reliance on reliable but polluting (fossil fuel) thermal power stations versus investing in and depending upon clean production from uncertain wind and solar technologies. We compare the impacts of these decisions in two different scenarios: 1) the producers are competitive and hopefully reach a Nash Equilibrium; 2) they cooperate and reach a Social Optimum. We first prove that both problems have a unique solution using forward-backward systems of stochastic differential equations. We then illustrate with numerical experiments the producers' behavior in each scenario. We further introduce and analyze the impact of a regulator in control of the carbon tax policy, and we study the resulting Stackelberg equilibrium with the field of producers.","Carmona, Rene; Dayanikli, Gokce; Lauriere, Mathieu",,459,13

The standard method used to pick up laboratory mice for general husbandry and experimental procedures is known as tail handling and involves the capture, elevation and restraint of mice via their tails. There is growing evidence that, compared to non-aversive handling methods (i.e. tunnel and cup), tail handling increases behavioural signs of anxiety and induces anhedonia. Hence tail handling has a negative impact on mouse welfare. Here, we investigated whether repeated scruff restraint, intraperitoneal (IP) injections and anaesthesia negated the reduction in anxiety-related behaviour in tunnel compared with tail handled BALB/c mice. We found that mice which experienced repeated restraint spent less time interacting with a handler compared to mice that were handled only. However, after repeated restraint, tunnel handled mice showed increased willingness to interact with a handler, and reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests compared with tail handled mice. The type of procedure experienced (IP injection or anaesthesia), and the duration after which behaviour was measured after a procedure affected the willingness of mice to interact with a handler. Despite this, compared with tail handling, tunnel handling reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests and increased willingness to interact with a handler within hours after procedures. This suggests that the welfare benefits of tunnel handling are widely applicable and not diminished by the use of other putatively more invasive procedures that are frequently used in the laboratory. Therefore, the simple refinement of replacing tail with tunnel handling for routine husbandry and procedures will deliver a substantial improvement for mouse welfare and has the potential for improving scientific outcomes.","Henderson, Lindsay J; Dani, Bridgette; Serrano, Esme M N; Smulders, Tom V; Roughan, Johnny V",Sci Rep,459,25

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the most important medical challenge in decades. Previous research mainly focused on the exploration of lung changes. However, with development of the disease and deepening research, more and more patients showed cardiovascular diseases, even in those without respiratory symptoms, and some researchers have found that underlying cardiovascular diseases increase the risk of infection. Although the related mechanism is not thoroughly studied, based on existing research, we speculate that the interaction between the virus and its receptor, inflammatory factors, various forms of the stress response, hypoxic environment, and drug administration could all induce the development of cardiac adverse events. Interventions to control these pathogenic factors may effectively reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular complications.

Our main results show that the willingness to use and adopt vaccination certificates is generally high. Overall, paper-based vaccination certificates were favored over app-based solutions. The willingness to use digital apps decreased significantly by a higher disposition to privacy, and increased by higher worries about the pandemic and acceptance of the coronavirus vaccination. Vaccination certificates resemble an interesting use case for studying privacy perceptions for health related data.

METHODS: Seventy-nine COVID-19 patients, 78 healthy controls (HCs) and 30 COVID-19-like patients were recruited in a prospective cohort study. Samples were collected from COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms on admission, patients who progressed from mild to severe symptoms, and patients who were followed from hospital admission to discharge. The metabolome was assayed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Serum butyric acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, l-glutamic acid, l-phenylalanine, l-serine, l-lactic acid, and cholesterol were enriched in COVID-19 and COVID-19-like patients versus HCs. Notably, d-fructose and succinic acid were enriched, and citric acid and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol were depleted in COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19-like patients and HCs, and these four metabolites were not differentially distributed in non-COVID-19 groups. COVID-19 patients had enriched 4-deoxythreonic acid and depleted 1,5-anhydroglucitol compared to HCs and enriched oxalic acid and depleted phosphoric acid compared to COVID-19-like patients. A combination of d-fructose, citric acid and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol distinguished COVID-19 patients from HCs and COVID-19-like patients, with an area under the curve (AUC)â¯>â¯0.92 after validation. The combination of 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, cholesterol, succinic acid, L-ornithine, oleic acid and palmitelaidic acid predicted patients who progressed from mild to severe COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.969. After discharge, nearly one-third of metabolites were recovered in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The serum metabolome of COVID-19 patients is distinctive and has important value in investigating pathogenesis, determining a diagnosis, predicting severe cases, and improving treatment.","Shi, Ding; Yan, Ren; Lv, Longxian; Jiang, Huiyong; Lu, Yingfeng; Sheng, Jifang; Xie, Jiaojiao; Wu, Wenrui; Xia, Jiafeng; Xu, Kaijin; Gu, Silan; Chen, Yanfei; Huang, Chenjie; Guo, Jing; Du, Yiling; Li, Lanjuan",Metabolism,459,22

For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing.","Cheng, Yafang; Ma, Nan; Witt, Christian; Rapp, Steffen; Wild, Philipp S; Andreae, Meinrat O; Pöschl, Ulrich; Su, Hang","Sci.

In addition, PF-07321332 is now emerging as a promising second-generation clinical candidate for oral delivery. A key challenge to the development of novel 3CLpro inhibitors is the poor understanding of the predictive value of in vitro potency toward clinical efficacy, an issue complicated by the involvement of host proteases in virus entry.

For the past several years students had been requesting that asynchronous upper-level science majors? courses be offered at our college. Many students work part-time jobs and offering asynchronous courses increases their access to higher education and aids in their successful degree completion. The previous course delivery mode was a traditional lecture style with a required textbook, weekly quizzes, and exams. The redesigned course eliminated the lectures and replaced the textbook with Lt Understanding Your Physiology (ADInstruments) online platform. Weekly modules in Canvas (Learning Management System) provided students with an introduction to the current topic via a short (5-8 minute) video created by the instructor. Students were then required to complete lessons in a weekly module in Lt Understanding Your Physiology (Lt UYP) software. These lessons included different types of low stakes activities, meaning the students could replace an incorrect answer with the correct answer without penalty. At the end of each Lt UYP module, they viewed a patient video case study and answered a series of questions in a Word document that was then submitted to Canvas. Upon completion of all these assignments, the students took a quiz in Canvas. For this course offering, the student enrollment was (n=24) 13 juniors and 11seniors among which 22 completed the surveys. Students (82%) stated what they liked most about the Lt UYP activities was that they could get the answer wrong with no penalty then learn from their mistakes. The type of activity they enjoyed the most was labeling anatomy (41%) followed by matching the statement to a description/definition (22%), labeling a diagram (18%), determining which statements are correct and incorrect (14%) and few (5%) enjoyed the open-ended questions at the end of each lesson. The activity that students felt was most effective in helping them learn and understand the content was determining which statements were correct and incorrect (32%), followed by labeling diagrams or images (27%), and matching the statement to a description/definition (22%). The least effective activities were open-ended questions (9%), labeling anatomy (5%), and arranging statements in chronological order (5%). Students felt the Lt UYP activities were relevant to the course content (41% strongly agree and 55% agree) and helped them prepare for the exams (41% strongly agree and 32% agree). Most of the students (68%) chose all of the above when asked why they liked the case studies where the choices were a) the case studies were related to course content, b) interesting, c) real patients telling their personal story, and d) they learned a lot about the different diseases/disorders.

Practice of adjunctive and supportive treatments remain uncertain and may vary widely between countries, within countries between hospitals, and possibly even within ICUs. We aim to investigate practice of adjunctive and supportive treatments, and their associations with outcome, in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: The 'PRactice of Adjunctive Treatments in Intensive Care Unit Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019' (PRoAcT-COVID) study is a national, observational study to be undertaken in a large set of ICUs in The Netherlands. The PRoAcT-COVID includes consecutive ICU patients, admitted because of COVID-19 to one of the participating ICUs during a 3-month period. Daily follow-up lasts 28 days. The primary endpoint is a combination of adjunctive treatments, including types of oxygen support, ventilation, rescue therapies for hypoxemia refractory to supplementary oxygen or during invasive ventilation, other adjunctive and supportive treatments, and experimental therapies. We will also collect tracheostomy rate, duration of invasive ventilation and ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 (VFD-28), ICU and hospital length of stay, and the mortality rates in the ICU, hospital and at day 90. Discussion: The PRoAcT-COVID study is an observational study combining high density treatment data with relevant clinical outcomes. Information on treatment practices, and their associations with outcomes in COVID-19 patients in highly and urgently needed. The results of the PRoAcT-COVID study will be rapidly available, and circulated through online presentations, such as webinars and electronic conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed journals-findings will also be presented at a dedicated website.

Functional study showed that bacterial sphingomyelinase suppressed influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication, but promoted rhinovirus replication. These findings suggest that sphingomyelin pathway can be a potential target for antiviral therapy, but should be carefully evaluated as it has opposite effects on different respiratory viruses.

Exposure to infectious droplets confers a high risk for infection transmission by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Aerosolizing procedures pose particular concern for increasing healthcare workers' (HCWs) risks of infection. Multiple creative personal protective equipment solutions have been utilized to minimize exposure to infectious particles; however, the overall benefit of many of these devices is limited by a number of factors. Methods. We designed an intubation tent consisting of a metal frame and a clear plastic sheet. The flexible walls of our tent offer increased maneuverability & access, although the efficacy in reducing risk of transmission to HCWs remained unclear. Using an atomizer, particle generator, and matchstick smoke, we simulated the generation of infectious respiratory droplets and aerosols and tested whether our device effectively decreased the concentration of these particles to which a provider might be exposed. Finally, we tested whether the addition of a vacuum fan fit with a high efficiency particulate air filter designed to evacuate contaminated air would influence particle concentrations inside and outside the tent. Results. Droplet dispersion tests with the tent in place showed that the simulated droplet distribution was limited to surfaces within the tent. Aerosol testing under a variety of circumstances consistently showed only a minor rise in particle concentration in the air outside the tent despite an initial peak of particle concentration during generation within. All testing demonstrated declining inside concentrations over time. Conclusions. Our simulations suggest our device has the potential to effectively decrease HCWs' exposure to infectious droplets and aerosolized viral particles.","Brant-Zawadzki, Graham M; Ockerse, Patrick; Brunson, Justin R; Smith, Jared L; McRae, Bryan R; Fonnesbeck, Annie; Ledyard, Holly; Ruechel, Adam; Fassl, Bernhard A",Surg Innov,459,11

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among adults in China and its variation among provinces and by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Between May 8 and June 8, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among adults in China who were registered with the private survey company KuRunData. We set a target sample size of 10,000 adults, aiming to sample 300-360 adults from each province in China. Participants were asked 25 questions that tested their knowledge about COVID-19, including measures to prevent infection, common symptoms, and recommended care-seeking behavior. We disaggregated responses by age; sex; education; province; household income; rural-urban residency; and whether or not a participant had a family member, friend, or acquaintance who they know to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. All analyses used survey sampling weights. RESULTS: There were 5079 men and 4921 women who completed the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Out of 25 knowledge questions, participants answered a mean and median of 21.4 (95% CI 21.3-21.4) and 22 (IQR 20-23) questions correctly, respectively. A total of 83.4% (95% CI 82.7%-84.1%) of participants answered four-fifths or more of the questions correctly. For at least one of four ineffective prevention measures (using a hand dryer, regular nasal irrigation, gargling mouthwash, and taking antibiotics), 68.9% (95% CI 68.0%-69.8%) of participants answered that it was an effective method to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although knowledge overall was similar across provinces, the percent of participants who answered the question on recommended care-seeking behavior correctly varied from 47.0% (95% CI 41.4%-52.7%) in Tibet to 87.5% (95% CI 84.1%-91.0%) in Beijing. Within provinces, participants who were male, were middle-aged, were residing in urban areas, and had higher household income tended to answer a higher proportion of the knowledge questions correctly. CONCLUSIONS: This online study of individuals across China suggests that the majority of the population has good knowledge of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion still holds misconceptions or incorrect beliefs about prevention methods and recommended health care-seeking behaviors, especially in rural areas and some less wealthy provinces in Western China. This study can inform the development of tailored public health policies and promotion campaigns by identifying knowledge areas for which misconceptions are comparatively common and provinces that have relatively low knowledge.","Yu, Fengyun; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Meierkord, Anne; Yang, Juntao; Chen, Qiushi; Jiao, Lirui; Abou-Arraj, Nadeem E; Pan, An; Wang, Chen; Bärnighausen, Till; Chen, Simiao",J Med Internet Res,459,33

Due to its high contagiousness, more than 74 million people have been infected worldwide. Automatic segmentation of the COVID-19 lesion area in CT images is an effective auxiliary medical technology which can quantitatively diagnose and judge the severity of the disease. In this paper, a multi-class COVID-19 CT image segmentation network is proposed, which includes a pyramid attention module to extract multi-scale contextual attention information, and a residual convolution module to improve the discriminative ability of the network. A wavelet edge loss function is also proposed to extract edge features of the lesion area to improve the segmentation accuracy. For the experiment, a dataset of 4369 CT slices is constructed, including three symptoms: ground glass opacities, interstitial infiltrates, and lung consolidation. The dice similarity coefficients of three symptoms of the model achieve 0.7704, 0.7900, 0.8241 respectively. The performance of the proposed network on public dataset COVID-SemiSeg is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that this model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and can be a powerful tool to assist in the diagnosis of positive infection cases, and promote the development of intelligent technology in the medical field.","Yu, Fuli; Zhu, Yu; Qin, Xiangxiang; Xin, Ying; Yang, Dawei; Xu, Tao",,459,16

Recent studies indicate that like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also hijacks or usurps various host cell machineries including autophagy for its replication and disease pathogenesis. Double membrane vesicles generated during initiation of autophagy cascade act as a scaffold for the assembly of viral replication complexes and facilitate RNA synthesis. The use of autophagy inhibitors - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine initially appeared to be as a potential treatment strategy of COVID-19 patients but later remained at the center of debate due to high cytotoxic effects. In the absence of a specific drug or vaccine, there is an urgent need for a safe, potent as well as affordable drug to control the disease spread. Given the intricate connection between autophagy machinery and viral pathogenesis, the question arises whether targeting autophagy pathway might show a path to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AIM: To collate a list of relevant symptoms, assessment items, demographics, and lifestyle and health conditions associated with COVID-19, and match these data items with corresponding SNOMED CT clinical terms to support the development and implementation of consultation templates. DESIGN & SETTING: Published and preprint literature for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical guidelines describing the symptoms, assessment items, demographics, and/or lifestyle and health conditions associated with COVID-19 and its complications were reviewed. Corresponding clinical concepts from SNOMED CT, a widely used structured clinical vocabulary for electronic primary care health records, were identified. METHOD: Guidelines and published and unpublished reviews (N = 61) were utilised to collate a list of relevant data items for COVID-19 consultations. The NHS Digital SNOMED CT Browser was used to identify concept and descriptive identifiers. Key implementation challenges were conceptualised through a Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) lens. RESULTS: In total, 32 symptoms, eight demographic and lifestyle features, 25 health conditions, and 20 assessment items relevant to COVID-19 were identified, with proposed corresponding SNOMED CT concepts. These data items can be adapted into a consultation template for COVID-19. Key implementation challenges include: 1) engaging with key stakeholders to achieve 'buy in'; and 2) ensuring any template is usable within practice settings. CONCLUSION: Consultation templates for COVID-19 are needed to standardise data collection, facilitate research and learning, and potentially improve quality of care for COVID-19.","Jani, Bhautesh Dinesh; Pell, Jill P; McGagh, Dylan; Liyanage, Harshana; Kelly, Dave; de Lusignan, Simon; Weatherburn, Christopher J; Burns, Ronnie; Sullivan, Frank M; Mair, Frances S",,459,1

As South Africa was already one of the most unevenly developed countries in the world, COVID-19 has widened the gap between places, which face very different levels of risk and resilience. Significance: • We present original evidence that COVID-19 has affected poor urban communities more than it has suburbs in South Africa. This is apparent in terms of employment and hunger.

Genomewide association analysis may allow for the identification of potential genetic factors involved in the development of Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. After quality control and the exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis. In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case-control panels. RESULTS: We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P<5×10-8) in the meta-analysis of the two case-control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P = 1.15×10-10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P = 4.95×10-8, respectively). At locus 3p21.31, the association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1. The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group-specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P = 1.48×10-4) and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P = 1.06×10-5). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system.

Believing that one is or has been infected with COVID-19 may act as a nocebo. However, not much is known about potential nocebo effects associated with the reporting of COVID-19 symptoms. AIM: An online survey investigated whether certainty of being infected with COVID-19, age, sex, cognitive, emotional and personality factors were associated with perceived severity of COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=375) filled out an online survey containing 57 questions asking about symptoms resembling COVID-19, certainty of being infected with COVID-19, anxiety, stress and personality dimensions. RESULTS: Certainty of being infected with COVID-19 and anxiety predicted 27% of the variance in reporting of COVID-like symptoms. The mediation analysis showed that both higher certainty of being infected and anxiety independently predicted increased reports of COVID-like symptom. Females had higher anxiety and stress levels, and reported more COVID-like symptoms than males did. Older age was not associated with reporting COVID-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Believing to be infected with COVID-19, along with anxiety, can enhance the severity of COVID-like symptoms. Thus, the nocebo effect was due to both cognitive and emotional factors and was higher in females.","Daniali, Hojjat; Flaten, Magne Arve",Scand J Public Health,459,21

Case 1 was a 73-year-old woman, and Case 2 was a 65-year-old-man. Neither of them had a history of autoimmune disease. Chest computed tomography scans before the antiviral therapy showed bilateral multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The GGO regressed over the course of the antiviral treatment; however, new non-segmental patchy consolidations emerged, which resembled those of interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically collagen vascular disease-associated ILD. We tested the patients' sera for autoantibodies and discovered that both patients had high anti-SSA/Ro antibody titers. In Case 1, the patient recovered with antiviral therapy alone. However, in Case 2, the patient did not improve with antiviral therapy alone but responded well to corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone) and made a full recovery. The relationship between some immunological responses and COVID-19 pneumonia exacerbation has been discussed previously; our discovery of the elevation of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies suggests a contribution from autoimmunity functions of the immune system. Although it is unclear whether the elevation of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies was a cause or an outcome of aggravated COVID-19 pneumonia, we hypothesize that both patients developed aggravated the COVID-19 pneumonia due to an autoimmune response. In COVID-19 lung injury, there may be a presence of autoimmunity factors in addition to the known effects of cytokine storms. In patients with COVID-19, a high level of anti-SSA/Ro52 antibodies may be a surrogate marker of pneumonia severity and poor prognosis.","Fujii, Hiroyuki; Tsuji, Taisuke; Yuba, Tatsuya; Tanaka, Shunya; Suga, Yoshifumi; Matsuyama, Aosa; Omura, Ayaka; Shiotsu, Shinsuke; Takumi, Chieko; Ono, Seiko; Horiguchi, Masahito; Hiraoka, Noriya",Clin Rheumatol,459,15

The aim of our study was to adopt an integrated approach based on clinical, laboratory and chest x-ray (CXR) findings collected at the patient's admission to Emergency Room (ER) to identify prognostic factors. Retrospective study on 346 consecutive patients admitted to the ER of two North-Western Italy hospitals between March 9 and April 10, 2020 with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase reaction chain test (RT-PCR), CXR performed within 24 h (analyzed with two different scores) and recorded prognosis. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Statistical analysis on the features of 83 in-hospital dead vs 263 recovered patients was performed with univariate (uBLR), multivariate binary logistic regression (mBLR) and ROC curve analysis. uBLR identified significant differences for several variables, most of them intertwined by multiple correlations. mBLR recognized as significant independent predictors for in-hospital mortality age > 75 years, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 60 mg/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) < 250 and CXR ""Brixia score"" > 7. Among the patients with at least two predictors, the in-hospital mortality rate was 58% against 6% for others [p < 0.0001; RR = 7.6 (4.4-13)]. Patients over 75 years had three other predictors in 35% cases against 10% for others [p < 0.0001, RR = 3.5 (1.9-6.4)]. The greatest risk of death from COVID-19 was age above 75 years, worsened by elevated CRP and CXR score and reduced P/F. Prompt determination of these data at admission to the emergency department could improve COVID-19 pretreatment risk stratification.","Gatti, Marco; Calandri, Marco; Biondo, Andrea; Geninatti, Carlotta; Piatti, Clara; Ruggirello, Irene; Santonocito, Ambra; Varello, Sara; Bergamasco, Laura; Bironzo, Paolo; Boccuzzi, Adriana; Brazzi, Luca; Caironi, Pietro; Cardinale, Luciano; Cavallo, Rossana; Riccardini, Franco; Limerutti, Giorgio; Veltri, Andrea; Fonio, Paolo; Faletti, Riccardo",Intern. emerg. med,459,26

Such remote care delivery methods include the use of telehealth technologies including clinical video telehealth or telephone visits. Prior to this, research on the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of telehealth applied to rheumatology, or telerheumatology, has been limited. RECENT FINDINGS: Telerheumatology visits were found to be noninferior to in-person visits and are often more time and cost effective for patients. Clinicians and patients both noted the lack of a physical exam in telehealth visits and patients missed the opportunity to have lab work done or other diagnostic tests they are afforded with in-person visits. Overall, patients and clinicians had positive attitudes toward the use of telerheumatology and agreed on its usefulness, even beyond the pandemic. SUMMARY: Although telerheumatology has the potential to expand the reach of rheumatology practice, some of the most vulnerable patients still lack the most basic resources required for a telehealth visit. As the literature on telerheumatology continues to expand, attention should be paid to health equity, the digital divide, as well as patient preferences in order to foster true shared decision-making over telehealth.","Matsumoto, Rachel A; Barton, Jennifer L",Curr Opin Rheumatol,459,16

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.","Liu, Kui; Fang, Yuan-Yuan; Deng, Yan; Liu, Wei; Wang, Mei-Fang; Ma, Jing-Ping; Xiao, Wei; Wang, Ying-Nan; Zhong, Min-Hua; Li, Cheng-Hong; Li, Guang-Cai; Liu, Hui-Guo",Chin Med J (Engl),459,10

DESIGN: Cross-sectional household surveys. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of the population in England from April to May 2020. The sample included 3179 adults aged &#8805; 18 years. MEASUREMENTS: Participants who reported that they definitely or thought they had coronavirus were classified as having self-reported COVID-19. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before preparing foods, before eating or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had (i) attempted to quit smoking, (ii) attempted to quit vaping and (iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. FINDINGS: Odds of self-reported COVID-19 were significantly greater among current smokers [20.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.73] and long-term (> 1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68) compared with never smokers (14.5%). Recent (< 1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of self-reported COVID-19 (22.2%, aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.85-2.53). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in self-reported COVID-19 by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand-washing before face-touching, engagement in hand-washing behaviours was high (> 85%), regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of quit attempts in the past 3 months were reportedly triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one in 10 current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In England, current smokers and long-term ex-smokers appear to have higher odds of self-reported COVID-19 compared with never smokers in adjusted analyses, but there were no large differences between people who used nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes. Engagement in hand-washing appears to be high, regardless of nicotine or tobacco use. A minority of past-year smokers and current e-cigarette users, respectively, report attempting to quit smoking/vaping due to COVID-19.","Tattan-Birch, Harry; Perski, Olga; Jackson, Sarah; Shahab, Lion; West, Robert; Brown, Jamie",Addiction,459,14

A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services. This requires using advanced intelligent computing such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive computing, cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: ""no actions,"" ""lockdown,"" and ""new medicines."" The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the ""no actions"" scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully.","Alanazi, Saad Awadh; Kamruzzaman, M M; Alruwaili, Madallah; Alshammari, Nasser; Alqahtani, Salman Ali; Karime, Ali",J Healthc Eng,459,16

Pooled proportions of EEG findings with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed using a random effects model. The quality of assessment for each study, heterogeneity between the studies, and publication bias were also evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 12 studies with 308 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Abnormal background activity and generalized slowing in the pooled proportions were common findings among the patients with COVID-19 (96.1% [95% CI: 89.4-99.9]; I2â¯=â¯60%; pâ¯<â¯0.01 and 92.3% [95% CI: 81.2-99.3]; I2â¯=â¯74%; pâ¯<â¯0.01, respectively). The proportion of patients with epileptiform discharges (EDs) was 20.3% ([95% CI: 9.85-32.9]; I2â¯=â¯78%; pâ¯<â¯0.01). The proportion of EDs varied between patients with a history of epilepsy or seizures (59.5% [95% CI: 33.9-83.2]; I2â¯=â¯0%; pâ¯=â¯0.49) and patients without them (22.4% [95% CI: 10.4-36.4]; I2â¯=â¯46%; pâ¯=â¯0.07). The findings of seizures and status epilepticus on EEG were observed in 2.05% ([95% CI: 0.02-6.04]; I2â¯=â¯39%; pâ¯=â¯0.08) and 0.80% ([95% CI: 0.00.-3.69]; I2â¯=â¯28%; pâ¯=â¯0.17) of the patients, respectively.

Recently, the detection of coronavirus (COVID-19) is a critical task for the medical practitioner. Unfortunately, COVID-19 spreads so quickly between people and approaches millions of people worldwide in few months. It is very much essential to quickly and accurately identify the infected people so that prevention of spread can be taken. Although several medical tests have been used to detect certain injuries, the hopefully detection efficiency has not been accomplished yet. In this paper, a new Hybrid Diagnose Strategy (HDS) has been introduced. HDS relies on a novel technique for ranking selected features by projecting them into a proposed Patient Space (PS). A Feature Connectivity Graph (FCG) is constructed which indicates both the weight of each feature as well as the binding degree to other features. The rank of a feature is determined based on two factors; the first is the feature weight, while the second is its binding degree to its neighbors in PS. Then, the ranked features are used to derive the classification model that can classify new persons to decide whether they are infected or not. The classification model is a hybrid model that consists of two classifiers; fuzzy inference engine and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The proposed HDS has been compared against recent techniques. Experimental results have shown that the proposed HDS outperforms the other competitors in terms of the average value of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure in which it provides about of 97.658%, 96.756%, 96.55%, and 96.615% respectively. Additionally, HDS provides the lowest error value of 2.342%.

It seems that the proper identification of all people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS­CoV­2) is the best strategy to limit the transmission. However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, and symptoms may be very mild or atypical. There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID­19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms. Moreover, SARS­CoV­2 particles were found in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and viral RNA was detected in the feces of patients with COVID­19. These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID­19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement. Patients with new­onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS­CoV­2 infection. Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.

However, insufficient data exist on the wider context of infectious diseases in people with NCDs. We aimed to investigate the association between NCDs and the risk of death from any infection before the COVID-19 pandemic (up to Dec 31, 2019). METHODS: For this observational study, we used data from the UK Biobank observational cohort study to explore factors associated with infection death. We excluded participants if data were missing for comorbidities, body-mass index, smoking status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation, and if they were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. Deaths were censored up to Dec 31, 2019. We used Poisson regression models including NCDs present at recruitment to the UK Biobank (obesity [defined by use of body-mass index] and self-reported hypertension, chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease), age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and socioeconomic deprivation. Separate models were constructed with individual NCDs replaced by the total number of prevalent NCDs to define associations with multimorbidity. All analyses were repeated with non-infection-related death as an alternate outcome measure to establish differential associations of infection death and non-infection death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) accompanied by 95% CIs. FINDINGS: After exclusion of 9210 (1·8%) of the 502â505 participants in the UK Biobank cohort, our study sample comprised 493â295 individuals. During 5â273â731 person-years of follow-up (median 10·9 years [IQR 10·1-11·6] per participant), 27â729 deaths occurred, of which 1385 (5%) were related to infection. Advancing age, male sex, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, and all studied NCDs were independently associated with the rate of both infection death and non-infection death. Compared with White ethnicity, a pooled Black, Asian, and minority ethnicity group was associated with a reduced risk of infection death (IRR 0·64, 95% CI 0·46-0·87) and non-infection death (0·80, 0·75-0·86). Stronger associations with infection death than with non-infection death were observed for advancing age (age 65 years vs 45 years: 7·59, 95% CI 5·92-9·73, for infection death vs 5·21, 4·97-5·48, for non-infection death), current smoking (vs never smoking: 3·69, 3·19-4·26, vs 2·52, 2·44-2·61), socioeconomic deprivation (most vs least deprived quintile: 2·13, 1·78-2·56, vs 1·38, 1·33-1·43), class 3 obesity (vs non-obese: 2·21, 1·74-2·82, vs 1·55, 1·44-1·66), hypertension (1·36, 1·22-1·53, vs 1·15, 1·12-1·18), respiratory disease (2·21, 1·96-2·50, vs 1·28, 1·24-1·32), chronic kidney disease (5·04, 4·28-7·31, vs 2·50, 2·20-2·84), psychiatric disease (1·56, 1·30-1·86, vs 1·23, 1·18-1·29), and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease (2·45, 1·99-3·02, vs 1·41, 1·32-1·51). Accrual of multimorbidity was also more strongly associated with risk of infection death (five or more comorbidities vs none: 9·53, 6·97-13·03) than of non-infection death (5·26, 4·84-5·72). INTERPRETATION: Several NCDs are associated with an increased risk of infection death, suggesting that some of the reported associations with COVID-19 mortality might be non-specific. Only a subset of NCDs, together with the accrual of multimorbidity, advancing age, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation, were associated with a greater IRR for infection death than for other causes of death. Further research is needed to define why these risk factors are more strongly associated with infection death, so that more effective preventive strategies can be targeted to high-risk groups.

In this method Cas effector proteins are used as highly specific sequence recognition elements that can be combined with many different read-out methods for on-site point-of-care testing. This review covers the technical aspects of integrating CRISPR/Cas technology in miniaturized sensors for analysis on-site.

During the period between April 1, 2020, and December 1, 2020, the patients who received bDMARDs were evaluated at the regular outpatient clinic follow-up or by telemedicine with a maximum of three-month intervals. Out of the 436 patients treated with bDMARDs, 39 children were infected with COVID-19. When the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, depending on the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms and the type of bDMARD being administered, the use of bDMARDs were ceased according to the ACR and PReS recommendations on a patient basis. There were COVID-19 positive patients in the families of our 30 patients. Looking at the distribution of underlying systemic disease and treatments in patients with MIS-C, one patient had CRMO with etanercept treatment, one had DADA-2 and was on infliximab, one had undefined SAID and was on tocilizumab, and two had system ic JIA and being treated with anakinra or canakinumab. There is a limited number of studies in the literature on the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in patients with paediatric rheumatic disease who re ceived bDMARDs. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest series of children with rheumatic disease in the literature who received bDMARDs and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 infection related symptoms were not observed in nearly half of the 39 patients who were under bDMARD treatment.

We applied evidence-based methods to investigate the role of preclinical studies in predicting human DILI using two anti-diabetic drugs from the same class, but with different toxicological profiles: troglitazone (withdrawn from US market due to DILI) and rosiglitazone (remains on US market). Evidence Stream 1: A systematic literature review of in vivo studies on rosiglitazone or troglitazone was conducted (PROSPERO registration CRD42018112353). Evidence Stream 2: in vitro data on troglitazone and rosiglitazone were retrieved from the US EPA ToxCast database. Evidence Stream 3: troglitazone- and rosiglitazone-related DILI cases were retrieved from WHO Vigibase. All three evidence stream analyses were conducted according to evidence-based methodologies and performed according to pre-registered protocols. Evidence Stream 1: 9288 references were identified, with 42 studies included in analysis. No reported biomarker for either drug indicated a strong hazard signal in either preclinical animal or human studies. All included studies had substantial limitations, resulting in ""low"" or ""very low"" certainty in findings. Evidence Stream 2: Troglitazone was active in twice as many in vitro assays (129) as rosiglitazone (60), indicating a strong signal for more off-target effects. Evidence Stream 3: We observed a fivefold difference in both all adverse events and liver-related adverse events reported, and an eightfold difference in fatalities for troglitazone, compared to rosiglitazone. In summary, published animal and human trials failed to predict troglitazone's potential to cause severe liver injury in a wider patient population, while in vitro data showed marked differences in the two drugs' off-target activities, offering a new paradigm for reducing drug attrition in late development and in the market. This investigation concludes that death and disability due to adverse drug reactions may be prevented if mechanistic information is deployed at early stages of drug development by pharmaceutical companies and is considered by regulators as a part of regulatory submissions.","Dirven, Hubert; Vist, Gunn E; Bandhakavi, Sricharan; Mehta, Jyotsna; Fitch, Seneca E; Pound, Pandora; Ram, Rebecca; Kincaid, Breanne; Leenaars, Cathalijn H C; Chen, Minjun; Wright, Robert A; Tsaioun, Katya",Sci Rep,459,1

There is uncertainty as to what the significance of this dual infection is, and whether people living with HIV (PLWH) have worse outcomes compared to HIV-negative patients with COVID-19. This study compared the outcomes of COVID-19 in a group of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients admitted to a tertiary referral centre in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: Data was collected on all adult patients with known HIV status and COVID-19, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), admitted to the medical wards and intensive care unit (ICU) between 6 March and 11 September 2020. The data included demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory results, severity of illness scores, complications and mortality, and comparisons were made between the HIV-positive and HIV negative groups. RESULTS: Three-hundred and eighty-four patients, 108 HIV-positive and 276 HIV-negative, were included in the study. Median 4C score was significantly higher in the HIV-positive patients compared to the HIV-negative patients, but there was no significant difference in mortality between the HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups (15% vs 20%, p = 0.31). In addition, HIV-positive patients who died were younger than their HIV-negative counterparts, but this was not statistically significant (47.5 vs 57 years, p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HIV is not a risk factor for moderate or severe COVID-19 disease neither is it a risk factor for mortality. However, HIV-positive patients with COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital are more likely to be younger than their HIV-negative counterparts. These findings need to be confirmed in future, prospective, studies.","Venturas, Jacqui; Zamparini, Jarrod; Shaddock, Erica; Stacey, Sarah; Murray, Lyle; Richards, Guy A; Kalla, Ismail; Mahomed, Adam; Mohamed, Farzahna; Mer, Mervyn; Maposa, Innocent; Feldman, Charles",J Infect,459,1

To address this question, we compare the actual data to a hypothetical case in which the mitigation measures are left intact using a projection of the data from before mitigation measures were eased. We find that different states have shown significant differences in the number of deaths, possibly due to their different policies and reopening schedules. Our study provides a gauge for the effectiveness of the approaches by different state governments and can serve as a guide for implementing best policies in the future.

Given the critical role of NFPs in the global surveillance and response system supported by the IHR, we sought to assess their experiences in carrying out their functions. METHODS: In collaboration with WHO officials, we administered a voluntary online survey to all 196 States Parties to the IHR (2005) in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South and North America, from October to November 2019. The survey was available in six languages via a secure internet-based system. RESULTS: In total, 121 NFP representatives answered the 56-question survey; 105 in full, and an additional 16 in part, resulting in a response rate of 62% (121 responses to 196 invitations to participate). The majority of NFPs knew how to notify the WHO of a potential PHEIC, and believed they have the content expertise to carry out their functions. Respondents found training workshops organized by WHO Regional Offices helpful on how to report PHEICs. NFPs experienced challenges in four critical areas: 1) insufficient intersectoral collaboration within their countries, including limited access to, or a lack of cooperation from, key relevant ministries; 2) inadequate communications, such as deficient information technology systems in place to carry out their functions in a timely fashion; 3) lack of authority to report potential PHEICs; and 4) inadequacies in some resources made available by the WHO, including a key tool - the NFP Guide. Finally, many NFP representatives expressed concern about how WHO uses the information they receive from NFPs. CONCLUSION: Our study, conducted just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrates key challenges experienced by NFPs that can affect States Parties and WHO performance when outbreaks occur. In order for NFPs to be able to rapidly and successfully communicate potential PHEICs such as COVID-19 in the future, continued measures need to be taken by both WHO and States Parties to ensure NFPs have the necessary authority, capacity, training, and resources to effectively carry out their functions as described in the IHR.","Packer, Corinne; Halabi, Sam F; Hollmeyer, Helge; Mithani, Salima S; Wilson, Lindsay; Ruckert, Arne; Labonté, Ronald; Fidler, David P; Gostin, Lawrence O; Wilson, Kumanan",Global Health,459,32

This survey over two timeframes aimed to explore the controversial issue of location and noninvasive oxygen therapy in non-intubated ICU patients using a clinical vignette. Materials and methods: An online survey was designed, piloted, and distributed electronically to Indian intensivists/anesthetists, from private hospitals, government hospitals, and medical college hospitals (the latter two referred to as first-responder hospitals), who are directly responsible for admitting/managing patients in ICU. Results: Of the 204 responses (125/481 in phase 1 and 79/320 in phase 2), 183 responses were included. Respondents from first-responder hospitals were more willing to manage non-intubated hypoxemic patients in neutral pressure rooms, while respondents from private hospitals preferred negative-pressure rooms (p < 0.001). In both the phases, private hospital doctors were less comfortable to use any form of noninvasive oxygen therapies in neutral-pressure rooms compared to first-responder hospitals (low-flow oxygen therapy: 72 vs 50%, p < 0.01; HFNO: 47 vs 24%, p < 0.01 and NPPV: 38 vs 28%, p = 0.20). Interpretation: Variations existed in practices among first-responder and private intensivists/anesthetists. The resource optimal private hospital intensivists/anesthetists were less comfortable using noninvasive oxygen therapies in managing COVID-19 patients. This may reflect differential resource availability necessitating resolution at national, state, and local levels. How to cite this article: Subramaniam A, Haji JY, Kumar P, Ramanathan K, Rajamani A.

El caso de Salamanca,16.75753,-1.5554538,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, many federal agencies relaxed policies regulating opioid use disorder treatment. The impact of these changes has been minimally documented. The abrupt nature of these shifts provides a naturalistic opportunity to examine adaptations for opioid use disorder treatment in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To examine change in medical and behavioral health appointment frequency, visit type, and management of patients with opioid use disorder in response to COVID-19. DESIGN: A 14-item survey queried primary care practices that were enrolled in a medications for opioid use disorder statewide expansion project. Survey content focused on changes in service delivery because of COVID-19. The survey was open for 18 days. PARTICIPANTS: We surveyed 338 clinicians from 57 primary care clinics located in California, including federally qualified health centers and look-alikes. A representative from all 57 clinics (100%) and 118 staff (34.8% of all staff clinicians) participated in the survey. MAIN MEASURES: The survey consisted of seven dimensions of practice: medical visits, behavioral health visits, medication management, urine drug screenings, workflow, perceived patient demand, and staff experience. KEY RESULTS: A total of 52 of 57 (91.2%) primary care clinics reported practice adaptations in response to COVID-19 regulatory changes. Many clinics indicated that both medical (40.4%) and behavioral health visits (53.8%) were now exclusively virtual. Two-thirds (65.4%) of clinics reported increased duration of buprenorphine prescriptions and reduced urine drug screenings (67.3%). The majority (56.1%) of clinics experienced an increase in patient demand for behavioral health services. Over half (56.2%) of clinics described having an easier or unchanged experience retaining patients in care. CONCLUSIONS: Many adaptations in the primary care approach to patients with opioid use disorder may be temporary reactions to COVID-19. Further evaluation of the impact of these adaptations on patient outcomes is needed to determine whether changes should be maintained post-COVID-19.","Caton, Lauren; Cheng, Hannah; Garneau, Hélène Chokron; Fisher, Tammy; Harris-Mills, Briana; Hurley, Brian; Newman, Sandra; McGovern, Mark P",J. gen. intern. med,459,17

The exudative phase would manifest as ground-glass opacities and consolidation, and the proliferative phase would manifest as a tendency toward a more linear morphology. Both CT and PET/CT findings support the inflammatory character of the lung lesions in the initial phase of the disease and in patients with mild-moderate disease. Severe cases have pulmonary hypoperfusion that is likely due to abnormal alveolar ventilation and perfusion.

While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems.

S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies depends upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer stabilized in the closed state to prevent full exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with receptor. We compared this with other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induced a T cell response and long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody responses against 2019 SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern B.1.248 and B.1.351. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralizing responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.ImportanceVaccines in use against SARS-CoV-2 induce immune responses against the spike protein. There is intense interest in whether the antibody response induced by vaccines will be robust against new variants, as well as in next-generation vaccines for use in previously infected or immunized individuals. We assessed the use as an immunogen of a spike protein engineered to be conformationally stabilized in the closed state where the receptor binding site is occluded.

Infection is a leading cause of mortality in DS, along with cardiac anomalies. Currently, it is unknown how the COVID-19 pandemic affects individuals with DS. Herein, we report an analysis of individuals with DS who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, New York, USA. METHODS: In this retrospective, dual-center study of 7246 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we analyzed all patients with DS admitted in the Mount Sinai Health System and Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We assessed hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 12 patients with DS. Hospitalized individuals with DS are on average ten years younger than patients without DS. Patients with DS have more severe disease than controls, particularly an increased incidence of sepsis and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that individuals with DS who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are younger than their non-DS counterparts, and that they have more severe disease than age-matched controls. We conclude that particular care should be considered for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in these patients.","Malle, Louise; Gao, Cynthia; Hur, Chin; Truong, Han Q; Bouvier, Nicole M; Percha, Bethany; Kong, Xiao-Fei; Bogunovic, Dusan",Genet. med,459,16

[2] In what way do third party sites boost the online reputation of junk news and disinformation on COVID-19 through backlinks? [3] How and to what extent do major advertising platforms monetize junk news & disinformation around COVID-19?

In addition to the person-to person transmission dynamic of the novel respiratory virus, it has been recently studied the role of environmental factors in accelerate SARS-CoV-2 spread and its lethality. The time being, air pollution has been identified as the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world. It affects body's immunity, making people more vulnerable to pathogens. The hypothesis that air pollution, resulting from a combination of factors such as meteorological data, level of industrialization as well as regional topography, can acts both as a carrier of the infection and as a worsening factor of the health impact of COVID-19 disease, has been raised recently. With this review, we want to provide an update state of art relating the role of air pollution, in particular PM2.5, PM10 and NO2, in COVID-19 spread and lethality. The Authors, who first investigated this association, often used different research methods or not all include confounding factors whenever possible. In addition, to date incidence data are underestimated in all countries and to a lesser extent also mortality data. For this reason, the cases included in the reviewed studies cannot be considered conclusive. Although it determines important limitations for direct comparison of results, and more studies are needed to strengthen scientific evidences and support firm conclusions, major findings are consistent, highlighting the important contribution of PM2.5 and NO2 as triggering of the COVID-19 spread and lethality, and with a less extent also PM10, although the potential effect of airborne virus exposure it has not been still demonstrated.","Copat, Chiara; Cristaldi, Antonio; Fiore, Maria; Grasso, Alfina; Zuccarello, Pietro; Signorelli, Salvatore Santo; Conti, Gea Oliveri; Ferrante, Margherita",Environ Res,459,16

In addition, no studies have examined whether national distributions of these factors are associated with epidemic experiences to date. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Drawing on surveys of older adults from 42 countries and estimated case fatality ratios by age and preexisting health conditions, we document and compare national profiles of COVID-19 mortality risks among older adults. We develop two measures of national risk profiles: one based on age structures and another based on distributions of preexisting health conditions. Our analysis compares these constructs and documents their associations with national COVID-19 mortality rates. RESULTS: National profiles of COVID-19 mortality risk based on age structure and preexisting health conditions are moderately uncorrelated, capturing different aspects of risk. Both types of national risk profiles correlate meaningfully with countries' COVID-19 mortality experiences to date. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Measures of population age structure are readily available for every country in the world, while cross-national measures of older adult population health are more limited. In the COVID-19 crisis, these factors give different pictures of the countries with high and low risks of COVID-19 mortality. Moreover, our results suggest that both types of national risk profiles based on population health reflect current COVID-19 mortality severity in several countries, highlighting the need for more cross-national comparative data on older adult population health.","Verdery, Ashton M; Newmyer, Lauren; Wagner, Brandon; Margolis, Rachel",GerontologistGerontologist,459,20

Wide range of cadmium concentrations, i.e., 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1µM, were chronically exposed to the human BPH cells for transformation into PCa and monitored using cell and molecular biology approaches. After eight weeks of exposure, the cells showed subtle morphological changes and shifts of cell cycle in the G2M phase. Significant increase in expression of prostatic genes AR, PSA, ER-ß, and 5&#945;R with increased nuclear localization of AR and pluripotency markers Cmyc, Klf4 indicated the carcinogenic effect of Cd. Further, the BPH cells exposed to Cd showed a substantial increase in the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9, influencing migratory potential of the cells along with decreased expression of the p63 protein which further strengthen the progression towards carcinogenesis and aggressive tumor studies. Data from the present study state that Cd exhibited marked invasiveness in BPH cells. These observations established a connecting link of BPH towards PCa pathogenesis.

In 2016 there were over 1 million deaths in >70 year olds due to lower respiratory tract infections; 13-31% of these have been reported to be caused by viruses. Since then, there has been a global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused over 2.3 million deaths so far; increased age has been shown to be the biggest risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Thus, the burden of respiratory viral infections in the elderly is becoming an increasing unmet clinical need. Particular challenges are faced due to the interplay of a variety of factors including complex multimorbidities, decreased physiological reserve and an aging immune system. Moreover, their atypical presentation of symptoms may lead to delayed necessary care, prescription of additional drugs and prolonged hospital stay. This leads to morbidity and mortality and further nosocomial spread. Clinicians currently have limited access to sensitive detection methods. Furthermore, a lack of effective antiviral treatments means there is little incentive to diagnose and record specific non-COVID-19 viral infections. To meet this unmet clinical need, it is first essential to fully understand the burden of respiratory viruses in the elderly. Doing this through prospective screening research studies for all respiratory viruses will help guide preventative policies and clinical trials for emerging therapeutics. The implementation of multiplex point-of-care diagnostics as a mainstay in all healthcare settings will be essential to understand the burden of respiratory viruses, diagnose patients and monitor outbreaks. The further development of novel targeted vaccinations as well as anti-viral therapeutics and new ways to augment the aging immune system is now also essential.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Watson, Alastair; Wilkinson, Tom M A",Ther Adv Respir Dis,459,16

In Germany, nationwide protective measures to halt the spread of the virus were implemented in mid-March for 6 weeks. METHODS: In May, the impact of the pandemic was assessed in the German National Cohort (NAKO). A total of 113 928 men and women aged 20 to 74 years at the time of the baseline examination conducted 1 to 5 years earlier (53%) answered, within a 30-day period, a follow-up questionnaire on SARS-CoV-2 test status, COVID-19- associated symptoms, and self-perceived health status. RESULTS: The self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test frequency among the probands was 4.6%, and 344 participants (0.3%) reported a positive test result. Depressive and anxiety-related symptoms increased relative to baseline only in participants under 60 years of age, particularly in young women. The rate of moderate to severe depressive symptoms increased from 6.4% to 8.8%. Perceived stress increased in all age groups and both sexes, especially in the young. The scores for mental state and self-rated health worsened in participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 compared with those who were not tested. In 32% of the participants, however, self-rated health improved. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and the protective measures during the first wave had effects on mental health and on self-rated general health.","Peters, Annette; Rospleszcz, Susanne; Greiser, Karin H; Dallavalle, Marco; Berger, Klaus",Dtsch Arztebl Int,459,31

It has allowed patients to save time and money on clinic visits, and physicians to communicate with patients who live remotely. Telemedicine has also been valuable in plastic surgery during initial consultations, transfers, and follow up visits. However, given the often-sensitive nature of plastic surgery, the professionalism and expectations of telemedicine have to be reviewed. A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through October 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine and its use in plastic surgery. Data on the effectiveness, challenges, and professionalism of telemedicine were collected. Our review suggests that telemedicine can be an effective mode of communication in many realms of plastic surgery, including cleft care and craniofacial deformities. However, many plastic surgeons are unfamiliar with the existing platforms, and there are no clear guidelines on the most optimal platforms. Physicians have to recognize that patients might have low digital health literacy or may not even possess digital device for telemedicine. There also needs to be an overall improvement in patient education. Given that telemedicine use will continue to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant platforms and specific guidelines on telemedicine visits, such as undressing, chaperones, privacy matters, need to be established while maintaining a professional relationship between the patient and the physician.","Tam, Anson K; Kim, Minji; Mathew, Prakash J; Thaller, Seth R",J. craniofac. surg,459,5

We adapted the COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) decision analytic model by adding a cardiac component to determine the impact of various policy decisions on the incremental waitlist growth and estimated waitlist mortality for 3 key groups of cardiovascular disease patients: coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias. We provided predictions based on COVID-19 epidemiology available in real-time, in 3 phases. First, in the initial crisis phase, in a worst case scenario, we showed that the potential number of waitlist related cardiac deaths would be orders of magnitude less than those who would die of COVID-19 if critical cardiac care resources were diverted to the care of COVID-19 patients. Second, with better local epidemiology data, we predicted that across 5 regions of Ontario, there may be insufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures. Finally in the recovery phase, we showed that the estimated incremental growth in waitlist for all cardiac procedures is likely substantial. These outputs informed timely data-driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the provision of cardiovascular care.","Tam, Derrick Y; Naimark, David; Natarajan, Madhu K; Woodward, Graham; Oakes, Garth; Rahal, Mirna; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Ximenes, Raphael; Mac, Stephen; Sander, Beate; Wijeysundera, Harindra C",Can J Cardiol,459,24

This is the first large-scale study that examines the unmet healthcare needs of migrants without healthcare coverage in Montreal. 806 participants were recruited: 436 in the community and 370 at the NGO clinic. Proportions of individuals reporting unmet healthcare needs were similar (68.4% vs. 69.8%). The main reason invoked for these unmet needs was lacking money (80.6%). Situations of not working or studying, not having had enough food in the past 12 months, not having a medical prescription to get medication and having had a workplace injury were all significantly associated with higher odds of having unmet healthcare needs. Unmet healthcare needs were more frequent among migrants without healthcare coverage than among recent immigrants or the citizens with health healthcare coverage (69%, 26%, 16%). Canada must take measures to enable these individuals to have access to healthcare according to their needs in order to reduce the risk of worsening their health status, something that may have an impact on the healthcare system and population health. The Government of Quebec announced that all individuals without any healthcare coverage will have access to COVID-19 related health care.

METHODS: This retrospective study included 84 patients diagnosed with posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy involving inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and lingual nerve (LN). Data on clinical characteristics, subjective symptoms including hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, and allodynia, and objective signs using thermal QST were collected and explored. RESULTS: Three heat (heat hypoalgesia, heat hyperalgesia, and within normal range) and cold pain phenotypes (cold hypoalgesia, cold hyperalgesia, and within normal ranges) were identified, respectively. Thermal hypoalgesia was more frequently observed than thermal hyperalgesia. Heat hypoalgesia regardless of cold pain abnormalities appears to be associated with subjective negative symptoms, while thermal hyperalgesia seems to have little relationship with negative and positive symptoms. Thermal pain phenotypes were associated with loss of innocuous thermal sensation. Unlike heat pain phenotypes, cold pain phenotypes differed between IAN injury and LN injury. CONCLUSION: The thermal pain phenotypes identified in this study seem to be related to clinical and psychophysical findings differently. These results would be a good starting point for assessing posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy and interpreting the thermal QST results.","Kim, Hye-Kyoung; Kim, Mee-Eun",Oral dis,459,1

B. rapa grown with industrial effluents exhibited the highest carcinogenic health risk, while the canal water posed the lowest risk. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that the wastewater samples containing heavy metals and contaminated soils were common sources of B. rapa contamination. Proper treatment of wastewater for removal of toxic elements before application in agricultural fields may safeguard the health of animals, public, and the ecosystem.","Iqbal, Zafar; Abbas, Farhat; Ibrahim, Muhammad; Qureshi, Tahir Imran; Gul, Matin; Mahmood, Abid",,459,16

Methods: A review of the evolving literature on the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Published articles addressing SARS-CoV2 transmission modes and risks, and infection control procedures required in the dental office to protect dental patients and health care providers were assessed. Also, clinical guidelines on the management of dental patients during the pandemic were reviewed. Results: The established modes of transmission of SARS-CoV2 appear to be through respiratory droplets and through close contact with either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. In addition to standard precautions of infection control widely followed in dental practices, extra precautionary measures are needed to control the spread of this highly infectious disease. Dental treatment during the pandemic is limited to emergent and urgent cases after a meticulous patient risk assessment and dental needs are triaged to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission and avoid cross-contamination. Conclusion: Dentists should be aware of the recently updated knowledge about COVID-19 modes of transmission and the recommended infection control measures in dental settings.

This phenomenon poses unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems. Aging is one of the most important risk factors for infections and a myriad of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. A common denominator that is implicated in these diseases is the immune system. The immune system consists of the innate and adaptive arms that complement each other to provide the host with a holistic defense system. While the diverse interactions between multiple arms of the immune system are necessary for its function, this complexity is amplified in the aging immune system as each immune cell type is affected differently-resulting in a conundrum that is especially difficult to target. Furthermore, certain cell types, such as Î³Î´ T cells, do not fit categorically into the arms of innate or adaptive immunity. In this review, we will first introduce the human Î³Î´ T cell family and its ligands before discussing parallels in mice. By covering the ontogeny and homeostasis of Î³Î´ T cells during their lifespan, we will better capture their evolution and responses to age-related stressors. Finally, we will identify knowledge gaps within these topics that can advance our understanding of the relationship between Î³Î´ T cells and aging, as well as age-related diseases such as cancer.","Xu, Weili; Lau, Zandrea Wan Xuan; Fulop, Tamas; Larbi, Anis",,459,15

We summarize here the results of studies, which used these technologies to investigate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in different organs. Studies with in vitro models of lung epithelia showed that alveolar epithelial type II cells, but not differentiated lung alveolar epithelial type I cells, are key targets of SARS-CoV-2, which triggers cell apoptosis and inflammation, while impairing surfactant production. Experiments with human small intestinal organoids and colonic organoids showed that the gastrointestinal tract is another relevant target for SARS-CoV-2. The virus can infect and replicate in enterocytes and cholangiocytes, inducing cell damage and inflammation. Direct viral damage was also demonstrated in in vitro models of human cardiomyocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells. At variance, endothelial cells and neurons are poorly susceptible to viral infection, thus supporting the hypothesis that neurological symptoms and vascular damage result from the indirect effects of systemic inflammatory and immunological hyper-responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Trevisan, Marta; Riccetti, Silvia; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Barzon, Luisa",Int. j. mol. sci.

Yet, workforce analysis elicited serious concerns with the distribution, practice environments and regulation of Lebanese pharmacists. Recent workforce data shows that the profession has been majorly destabilized with hundreds of pharmacists closing their pharmacies or losing their employment. Proper planning for the future of the pharmacy profession in Lebanon necessitates a deeper understanding of the current challenges and the necessary policy and practice recommendations. The aim of this study is to examine stakeholders' perspectives on the current pharmacist workforce challenges and the necessary measures to support the profession. METHODS: The research team carried out a series of semi-structured interviews with twenty-one key stakeholders within the pharmacy profession in Lebanon. We categorized stakeholders according to their experience as policy makers, practitioners, academicians, and media experts. The interview guide included questions about workforce trends, labor market challenges and recommendations for improvement. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged from this study: the oversupply of pharmacists in Lebanon, the demand supply imbalance, poor regulation of the pharmacy practice, and the difficult practice environment. There was a consensus among interviewees that the oversupply of pharmacists is due to the poor workforce planning and weak regulatory framework, combined with the easy integration of foreign-trained pharmacists into the labor market. The lack of coordination between the educational and practice sectors is further widening the demand-supply gap. Interviewees further revealed that the regulatory policies on pharmacy practice were outdated and/or weakly enforced which increases the risk of unethical practices and erodes the image of pharmacists in the society. With respect to the practice environment, there is an ongoing struggle by Lebanese pharmacists to maintain profitability and exercise their full scope of practice. CONCLUSION: The poor pharmacy workforce planning and regulation is significantly weakening the pharmacy profession in Lebanon. A concerted effort between the various stakeholders is necessary to enhance workforce planning, regulate supply, optimize the integration of pharmacists into work sectors of need, and improve the financial and professional wellbeing of pharmacists in Lebanon.","Alameddine, Mohamad; Bou-Karroum, Karen; Kassas, Sara; Hijazi, Mohamad Ali",PLoS One,459,22

COVID-19 has a 2% mortality rate, is known as the third extremely infective CoV infection, and has a mortality rate less than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The CoV family comprises a chief number of positive single-stranded ss (+) RNA viruses that are recognized in mammals. The 2019-nCoV patients showed that the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) was the same for SARS-CoV. Structural proteins have an essential role in virus released and budding to various host cells. Notably, evidence indicated human-to-human transmission, along with several exported patients of virus infection worldwide. Nowadays, no licensed antivirals drugs or vaccines for being utilized against these coronavirus infections are recognized. There is an urgent requirement for an extensive research of CoV infections to disclose the route of extension, pathogenesis, and diagnosis and then to recognize the therapeutic targets to facilitate disease control and surveillance.

This study aims to determine association between MetS and severe disease outcomes, that is, mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) requirement among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective multihospital cohort study on 1871 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Patient data including demographics, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), smoking, laboratory data, and the clinical course of hospitalization were collected. Multivariable regression was performed adjusting for age, sex, race, insurance, smoking, and comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (median age 66 [interquartile range, IQR 54-75]; 965 (51.6%) males; 1494 (80%) African Americans; median BMI 29.4 kg/m2 [IQR 25-35.8]; 573 (30.6%) patients with MetS) were included. Patients with MetS had increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.75; P = .004), higher ICU admission (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.36-2.08; P < .001), and increased need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52-2.37; P < .001). Among individual comorbidities, diabetes had significant association with mortality (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; P = 0.02), ICU admission (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.27-1.93; P < .001), and need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.03; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: MetS is a better prognostic indicator for severe disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19 than its individual components. Patients with MetS had significantly higher mortality, increased ICU admissions, and need for mechanical ventilation.","Lohia, Prateek; Kapur, Shweta; Benjaram, Sindhuri; Pandey, Abhilasha; Mir, Tanveer; Seyoum, Berhane",J. diabetes (Online),459,1

Although the essential factors known for AM development have been identified, currently an optimal in vitro culture system that can be used for studying the development and functions of AMs is still lacking. In this study, we report the development of an optimized culture system for generating AM-like cells from adult mouse bone marrow and fetal liver cells on in vitro culture in the presence of a combination of GM-CSF, TGF-ß, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPAR-Î³) agonist rosiglitazone. These AM-like cells expressed typical AM surface markers sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-F (Siglec-F), CD11c, and F4/80, and AM-specific genes, including carbonic anhydrase 4 (Car4), placenta-expressed transcript 1 (Plet1), eosinophil-associated RNase A family member 1 (Ear1), cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor A-like effector c (Cidec), and cytokeratin 19 (Krt19). Similar to primary AMs, the AM-like cells expressed alternative macrophage activation signature genes and self-renewal genes. Moreover, this culture system could be used for expansion of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived AMs in vitro. The AM-like cells generated from bone marrow resembled the expanded bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived AMs in inflammatory responses and phagocytic activity. More importantly, these AM-like cells could be obtained in sufficient numbers that allowed genetic manipulation and functional analysis in vitro. Taken together, we provide a powerful tool for studying the biology of AMs.","Luo, Maocai; Lai, Wenlong; He, Zhimin; Wu, Li",J. immunol,459,24

AIM: This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess if there were any changes in the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory diseases in Greece during the first CO-VID-19 wave. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated respiratory disease hospitalization rates across 9 tertiary hospitals in Greece during the study period (March-April 2020) and the corresponding period of the 2 previous years (2018-2019) that served as the control periods. Demographic data and discharge diagnosis were documented for every patient. RESULTS: Of the 1,307 patients who were hospitalized during the study period, 444 (35.5%) were males with a mean (±SD) age of 66.1 ± 16.6 years. There was a 47 and 46% reduction in all-cause respiratory morbidity compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The mean incidence rate for respiratory diseases during the study period was 21.4 admissions per day, and this rate was significantly lower than the rate during the same period in 2018 (40.8 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.491-0.562; p < 0.001) or the rate during 2019 (39.9 admissions per day; IRR, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.502-0.574; p < 0.001). The greatest reductions (%) in the number of daily admissions in 2020 were observed for sleep apnoea (87% vs. 2018 and 84% vs. 2019) followed by admissions for asthma (76% vs. 2018 and 79% vs. 2019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60% vs. 2018 and 51% vs. 2019), while the lowest reductions were detected in hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism (6% vs. 2018 and 23% vs. 2019) followed by tuberculosis (25% vs. both 2018 and 2019). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in respiratory admissions in 2020 raises the reasonable question of whether some patients may have avoided seeking medical attention during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests an urgent need for transformation of healthcare systems during the pandemic to offer appropriate management of respiratory diseases other than COVID-19.","Kyriakopoulos, Christos; Gogali, Athena; Exarchos, Konstantinos; Potonos, Dimitrios; Tatsis, Konstantinos; Apollonatou, Vasiliki; Loukides, Stelios; Papiris, Spyros; Sigala, Ioanna; Katsaounou, Paraskevi; Aggelidis, Maximos; Fouka, Evangelika; Porpodis, Konstantinos; Kontakiotis, Theodoros; Sampsonas, Fotis; Karampitsakos, Theodoros; Tzouvelekis, Argyris; Bibaki, Eleni; Karagiannis, Konstantinos; Antoniou, Katerina; Tzanakis, Nikolaos; Dimeas, Ilias; Daniil, Zoe; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos; Kouratzi, Maria; Steiropoulos, Paschalis; Antonakis, Emmanouil; Papanikolaou, Ilias C; Ntritsos, Georgios; Kostikas, Konstantinos",Respiration,459,33

Emergence of COVID-19 put added pressure on caregivers. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological health of Iranian caregivers of children with CP and associated risks during a lockdown period. METHODS: Using online snowball sampling, 160 caregivers of children with CP participated in this web-based cross-sectional study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Caregiver Difficulties Scale (CDS), and a demographic questionnaire were administered. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify risk factors related to caregiver psychological health. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Mental health problems were prevalent; (depression = 45.0% and anxiety = 40.6%). Significant correlations were found between CDS and HADS-Anxiety (r = 0.472, P < 0.001), HADS-depression (r = 0.513, P < 0.001), and perceived stress (PSS) related to COVID-19 (r = 0.425, P < 0.001). After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, burden (CDS) was found to significantly predict caregiver anxiety, depression and stress. Furthermore, several demographic characteristics (being married, low educational level and low income) were significantly related to high HADS Anxiety scores. For depression, only having a physical problem was significantly related to HADS among demographic variables. No significant correlations were found between PSS-4 and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: During COVID-19 outbreak, the mental health of caregivers of children with CP is affected by multiple factors such as burden of care and demographic characteristics. Due to the importance of well-being among caregivers of disabled children, a comprehensive plan including psychological consultation, remote education, or in-person handouts for the self-care or handling of the children and adequate distance support may enable better mental health for these caregivers.","Farajzadeh, Ata; Dehghanizadeh, Moslem; Maroufizadeh, Saman; Amini, Malek; Shamili, Aryan",Res Dev Disabil,459,8

Although in 2020, this PA faced a 75% decline in overall revenue compared to the year before, analysis suggests that, in the short term, conservation-related outputs are least affected. Visitor management and PA efforts to support the local community's sustainable development are the most severely impacted first-order outputs. Third-order nature-based tourism-related outputs face average to high risks. This study's risk-assessment framework provides a starting point for a post-pandemic reassessment of the delivery of PA management outputs and decision-making about output prioritisation and resource allocation. Results suggest several new avenues for research.","Mandić, Ante",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,459,9

The application of increasingly rigorous containment measures allowed to reduce the impact of the CoViD-2019 pandemic on the Italian National Health System but at the same time these restriction measures gave also the opportunity to assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on air pollutants in an unprecedented way. This paper aims to study the impact of the partial and total lockdown (PL and TL, respectively) on air quality in the Metropolitan City of Milan. As results, the severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL determined a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic (PM10, PM2.5, BC, benzene, CO, and NOx). The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the adjacent areas. Despite the significant decrease in NO2 in the TL, the O3 exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. In Milan and SaA the increase was more accentuated, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that might have promoted the formation of O3 in a more significant way.","Collivignarelli, Maria Cristina; Abbà, Alessandro; Bertanza, Giorgio; Pedrazzani, Roberta; Ricciardi, Paola; Carnevale Miino, Marco",Sci Total Environ,459,26

Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewaters sampled from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases in a community that are associated with a positive detection of the virus in wastewater. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank (n = 57) and biological activated sludge tank (n = 52) located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that depending on which nucleocapsid gene is targeted by means of RT-qPCR, a range of 253-409 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting RNA SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The frequency of detecting N1 and N2 gene in wastewater was also higher than that for N3 gene. Furthermore, nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2 were detected at lower frequency in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. In particular, N1 gene abundance was associated with water quality parameters such as total organic carbon and pH. In instances of positive detection, the average abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were reduced by 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting degradation of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments already occurring in the early stages of the wastewater treatment process.","Hong, Pei-Ying; Rachmadi, Andri Taruna; Mantilla-Calderon, David; Alkahtani, Mohsen; Bashawri, Yasir M; Al Qarni, Hamed; O039,; Reilly, Kathleen M; Zhou, Jianqiang",Environ Res,459,28

Faced with this imbalance, how, when, and who decides, there is the impact of the stressful systems of professionals who are at the front line of care and, in the background, issues inherent to human subjectivity. Along this path, the idea of using artificial intelligence algorithms to replace health professionals in the decision-making process also arises. In this context, there is the ethical question of how to manage the demands produced by the pandemic. The objective of this work is to reflect, from the point of view of medical ethics, on the basic principles of the choices made by the health teams, during the COVID-19 pandemic, whose resources are scarce and decisions cause anguish and restlessness. The ethical values for the rationing of health resources in an epidemic must converge to some proposals based on fundamental values such as maximizing the benefits produced by scarce resources, treating people equally, promoting and recommending instrumental values, giving priority to critical situations. Naturally, different judgments will occur in different circumstances, but transparency is essential to ensure public trust. In this way, it is possible to develop prioritization guidelines using well-defined values and ethical recommendations to achieve fair resource allocation.","Neves, Nedy M B C; Bitencourt, Flávia B C S N; Bitencourt, Almir G V",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),459,30

Anticipating the threat Press release of the French National Academy of Medicine and the National Academy of Surgery,16.437075,-1.4031731,2020,"BACKGROUND: Communicating scientific uncertainty about public health threats such as COVID-19 is an ethically desirable task endorsed by expert guidelines on crisis communication. However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an ""uncertainty-normalizing"" communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values. METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies. RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts. More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.","Han, Paul K J; Scharnetzki, Elizabeth; Scherer, Aaron M; Thorpe, Alistair; Lary, Christine; Waterston, Leo B; Fagerlin, Angela; Dieckmann, Nathan F",J Med Internet Res,459,29

There is no conclusive research into the risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, although evidence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak appears to suggest that there is no increased risk of transmission. However, close contact with a COVID-19 patient, especially those displaying respiratory symptoms, is likely to increase the risk of transmission. Nasogastric tube insertion requires increased time spent at a patient's bedside and can also cause pharyngeal irritation, resulting in coughing. In addition, the nasogastric tube can expose the healthcare worker to potentially infectious saliva. Therefore, there is a clear need for increased evidence regarding the risk of transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, to ensure that such risks can be mitigated.","Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Fanning, Sinead J; Khan, Mansoor; Sajid, Muhammad S",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),459,16

Key challenges in such studies include long reaction times, uncontrollable extent of reaction, and protein denaturation and aggregation. The living cell is inherently crowded molecularly with biomacromolecules, occupying 20-40% of the total volume. In this study, to mimic cellular crowding conditions, we have used polyethylene glycol as a chemical crowding agent. The degree of glycation and the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that a crowding environment triggers glycosylation and that the glycosylation degree gradually increases (pâ¯<â¯0.05) with increasing PEG concentration, which shortens the reaction time. The surface hydrophobicity of soybean protein isolate (SPI) significant decreased (pâ¯<â¯0.05), and the protein structure gradually unfolded from a helix to a random coil to prevent aggregation of SPI in the crowded environment. The solubility and the emulsifying and antioxidant properties improved upon adding the crowding reagent PEG. The chemical, freeze-thaw, and thermal stabilities of the nanoemulsion-stabilized SPI-dextran conjugate improved with increasing PEG concentration. However, the crowding environment had no effect on the salt stability of nanoemulsions.","Hu, Miao; Liu, Guannan; Du, Xiaoqian; Zhang, Xiaoying; Qi, Baokun; Li, Yang",Int. j. biol. macromol,459,20

In Brazil, one of the countries most severely impacted throughout the pandemic, a complex dynamics involving variants co-circulation and turnover events has been recorded with the emergence and spread of VOC Gamma in Manaus in late 2020. In this context, we present a genomic epidemiology investigation based on samples collected between December 2020 and May 2021 in the second major Brazilian metropolis, Rio de Janeiro. By sequencing 244 novel genomes through all epidemiological weeks in this period, we were able to document the introduction and rapid dissemination of VOC Gamma in the city, driving the rise of the third local epidemic wave. Molecular clock analysis indicates this variant has circulated locally since the first weeks of 2021 and only seven weeks were necessary for it to achieve a frequency above 70%, consistent with rates of growth observed in Manaus and other states. Moreover, a Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction indicates VOC Gamma spread throughout Brazil between December 2020 and January 2021, and that it was introduced in Rio de Janeiro through at least 13 events coming from nearly all regions of the country. Comparative analysis of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values provides further evidence that VOC Gamma induces higher viral loads (N1 target; mean reduction of Ct: 2.7, 95% CI = {+/-}0.7). This analysis corroborates the previously proposed mechanistic basis for this variant enhanced transmissibility and distinguished epidemiological behavior. Our results document the evolution of VOC Gamma and provide independent assessment of scenarios previously studied in Manaus, therefore contributing to the better understanding of the epidemiological dynamics currently being surveyed in other Brazilian regions.","Moreira, Filipe Romero Rebello; D039, Mirela; arc,; Mariani, Diana; Herlinger, Alice Laschuk; Schiffler, Francine Bittencourt; Rossi, Atila Duque; Leitao, Isabela de Carvalho; Miranda, Thamiris dos Santos; Cosentino, Matheus Augusto Calvano; Torres, Marcelo Calado de Paula; Costa, Raissa Mirella dos Santos Cunha da; Goncalves, Cassia Cristina Alves; Faffe, Debora Souza; Galiez, Rafael de Mello; Ferreira, Orlando Costa; Aguiar, Renato Santana; Santos, Andre Felipe Andrade dos; Voloch, Carolina Moreira; Castineiras, Terezinha Marta Pereira Pinto; Tanuri, Amilcar; Workgroup, - COVID-19-UFRJ",,459,24

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance characteristics of the LightMix® E-gene kit in comparison with well-validated in-house developed COVID-19 RT-PCR assays. STUDY DESIGN: Serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 culture isolate extracts were used for analytical sensitivity evaluation. A total of 289 clinical specimens from 186 patients with suspected COVID-19 and 8 proficiency testing (PT) samples were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the LightMix® E-gene kit against in-house developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: The LightMix® E-gene kit had a limit of detection of 1.8â¯×â¯10-1 TCID50/mL, which was one log10 lower than those of the two in-house RT-PCR assays. The LightMix® E-gene kit (149/289 [51.6%]) had similar sensitivity as the in-house assays (144/289 [49.8%] for RdRp/Hel and 146/289 [50.5%] for N). All three assays gave correct results for all the PT samples. Cycle threshold (Cp) values of the LightMix® E-gene kit and in-house assays showed excellent correlation. Reproducibility of the Cp values was satisfactory with intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation values <5%. Importantly, the LightMix® E-gene kit, when used as a stand-alone assay, was equally sensitive as testing algorithms using multiple COVID-19 RT-PCR assays.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation data collected from routine clinical care. SETTING: Forty-three hospitals contributing coronavirus disease 2019 patient data between March 14, and June 17, 2020, and 132 hospitals in the United States contributing data on viral pneumonia patients to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation database between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: One thousand four hundred ninety-one patients with diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and 4,200 patients with a primary (n = 2,544) or secondary (n = 1,656) admitting diagnosis of noncoronavirus disease viral pneumonia receiving ICU care. A subset of 202 viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome was examined separately. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Mean age was 63.4 for coronavirus disease (p = 0.064) versus 64.1 for viral pneumonia. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV scores were similar at 56.7 and 55.0, respectively (p = 0.060), but gender and ethnic distributions differed, as did PaO2 to FIO2 ratio and WBC count at admission. The hospital standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.35-1.68) for coronavirus disease patients and 0.82 (0.75-0.90) for viral pneumonia patients. In the coronavirus disease group, ICU and hospital length of stay were 3.1 and 3.0 days longer than in viral pneumonia patients. Standardized ICU and hospital length of stay ratios were 1.13 and 1.46 in the coronavirus disease group versus 0.95 and 0.94 in viral pneumonia patients. Forty-seven percent of coronavirus disease patients received invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support on their first ICU day versus 65% with viral pneumonia. Ventilator days in survivors were longer in coronavirus disease (10.4 d) than in viral pneumonia (4.3 d) patients, except in the viral pneumonia-acute respiratory distress syndrome subgroup (10.2 d) CONCLUSIONS:: Severity-adjusted mortality and length of stay are higher for coronavirus disease 2019 patients than for viral pneumonia patients admitted to ICU. Coronavirus disease patients also have longer time on ventilator and ICU length of stay, comparable with the subset of viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality and length of stay increase with age and higher scores in both populations, but observed to predicted mortality and length of stay are higher than expected with coronavirus disease patients across all severity of illness levels. These findings have implications for benchmarking ICU outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Higgins, Thomas L; Stark, Maureen M; Henson, Kathy N; Freeseman-Freeman, Laura",Crit. care med,459,5

The model contains three parameters, the initial reproduction number, the intervention strength, and the response delay. The response is modeled by assuming that the rate of change of the reproduction number is proportional to the negative deviation of the incidence rate from an intervention threshold. This delay dynamical system exhibits damped oscillations in one part of the parameter space, and growing oscillations in another, and these are separated by a surface where the solution is a strictly periodic nonlinear oscillation. For the COVID-19 pandemic, the tipping transition from damped to growing oscillations occurs for response delays of about one week, and suggests that, without vaccination, effective control and mitigation of successive epidemic waves cannot be achieved unless NPIs are implemented in a precautionary manner, rather as a response to the present incidence rate. Vaccination increases the quiet intervals between waves, but with delayed response, future flare-ups can only be prevented by establishing a post-pandemic normal with lower basic reproduction number.","Rypdal, Kristoffer",Int J Environ Res Public Health,459,20

Molnupiravir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the nucleoside analogue β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Molnupiravir or NHC can increase G to A and C to U transition mutations in replicating coronaviruses. These increases in mutation frequencies can be linked to increases in antiviral effects; however, biochemical data of molnupiravir-induced mutagenesis have not been reported. Here we studied the effects of the active compound NHC 5’-triphosphate (NHC-TP) against the purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex. The efficiency of incorporation of natural nucleotides over the efficiency of incorporation of NHC-TP into model RNA substrates followed the order GTP (12,841) > ATP (424) > UTP (171) > CTP (30), indicating that NHC-TP competes predominantly with CTP for incorporation. No significant inhibition of RNA synthesis was noted as a result of the incorporated monophosphate (NHC-MP) in the RNA primer strand. When embedded in the template strand, NHC-MP supported formation of both NHC:G and NHC:A base pairs with similar efficiencies. The extension of the NHC:G product was modestly inhibited, but higher nucleotide concentrations could overcome this blockage. In contrast, the NHC:A base pair led to the observed G to A (G:NHC:A) or C to U (C:G:NHC:A:U) mutations. Together, these biochemical data support a mechanism of action of molnupiravir that is primarily based on RNA mutagenesis mediated via the template strand.","Gordon, Calvin J.; Tchesnokov, Egor P.; Schinazi, Raymond F.; Götte, Matthias",J Biol Chem,459,10

This study therefore aimed to investigate the effects of a surgical, flannel or vertical-fold N95 masks on cardiorespiratory responses to incremental exercise. METHODS This investigation studied 11 adult males and females at rest and while performing progressive cycle exercise to exhaustion. We tested the hypotheses that wearing a surgical (S), flannel (F) or horizontal-fold N95 mask compared to no mask (control) would not promote arterial deoxygenation or exercise intolerance nor alter primary cardiovascular variables during submaximal or maximal exercise. RESULTS Despite the masks significantly increasing end-expired peri-oral %CO2 and reducing %O2, each ∼0.8-2% during exercise (P < 0.05), our results supported the hypotheses. Specifically, none of these masks reduced sub-maximal or maximal exercise arterial O2 saturation (P = 0.744), but ratings of dyspnea were significantly increased (P = 0.007). Moreover, maximal exercise capacity was not compromised nor were there any significant alterations of primary cardiovascular responses (mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output) found during sub-maximal exercise. CONCLUSION Whereas these results are for young healthy recreational male and female exercisers and cannot be applied directly to elite athletes, older or patient populations, they do support that arterial hypoxemia and exercise intolerance are not the obligatory consequences of COVID-19-indicated mask-wearing at least for cycling exercise.","Ade, Carl J; Turpin, Vanessa-Rose G; Parr, Shannon K; Hammond, Stephen T; White, Zachary; Weber, Ramona E; Schulze, Kiana M; Colburn, Trenton D; Poole, David C",Respiratory physiology & neurobiology,459,32

BACKGROUND: Being the first line of defense against COVID‐19 infection, health care workers are particularly at increased risk of getting infected. Compliance with infection prevention and control measures is essential for their safety and the safety of patients. METHODS: A web‐based national survey was conducted between November 2020 and January 2021 targeting all health care workers in governmental, semi‐governmental, and private health care sectors. RESULTS: Of 1757 health care workers, 49.9% were between 30‐39 years of age, majority (47.5%) were nurses. Participants reported a significant increase in the median self‐rated compliance scores during the pandemic compared to before it (p<0.001). During the pandemic, 49.7% of health care workers were fully compliant with personal protective equipment (PPE) use, 83.1% were fully compliant with hand hygiene. Overall, 44.1% were fully compliant with infection prevention and control measures (PPE and hand hygiene). Nationality, health sector, profession, and frequency of interactions with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 cases were significantly associated with compliance with overall infection prevention and control measures. The most reported barriers were work overload, and shortages of PPE and handwashing agents.

Qualitative studies examining clinician telemedicine perspectives during the pandemic identified challenges with physical examination, workflow concerns, burnout, and reduced personal connection with patients. However, these studies only included a relatively small number of physicians or were limited to a single specialty, and few assessed perspectives on integrating trainees into workflows, an important area to address to support the clinical learning environment. As telemedicine use continues, it is necessary to understand a range of clinician perspectives. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to survey pediatric and adult medicine clinicians at the University of Chicago Medical Center to understand their telemedicine benefits and barriers, workflow impacts, and training and support needs. METHODS: In July 2020, we conducted an observational cross-sectional study of University of Chicago Medical Center faculty and advanced practice providers in the Department of Medicine (DOM) and Department of Pediatrics (DOP). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 39% (200/517; DOM: 135/325, 42%; DOP: 65/192, 34%); most respondents were physicians (DOM: 100/135, 74%; DOP: 51/65, 79%). One-third took longer to prepare for (65/200, 33%) and conduct (62/200, 32%) video visits compared to in-person visits. Male clinicians reported conducting a higher percentage of telemedicine visits by video than their female counterparts (P=.02), with no differences in the number of half-days per week providing direct outpatient care or supervising trainees. Further, clinicians who conducted a higher percentage of their telemedicine by video were less likely to feel overwhelmed (P=.02), with no difference in reported burnout. Female clinicians were “more overwhelmed” with video visits compared to males (41/130, 32% vs 12/64, 19%; P=.05). Clinicians 50 years or older were “less overwhelmed” than those younger than 50 years (30/85, 35% vs 23/113, 20%; P=.02). Those who received more video visit training modalities (eg, a document and webinar on technical issues) were less likely to feel overwhelmed by the conversion to video visits (P=.007) or burnt out (P=.009). In addition, those reporting a higher ability to technically navigate a video visit were also less likely to feel overwhelmed by video visits (P=.02) or burnt out (P=.001). The top telemedicine barriers were patient-related: lack of technology access, lack of skill, and reluctance. Training needs to be focused on integrating learners into workflows. Open-ended responses highlighted a need for increased support staff. Overall, more than half “enjoyed conducting video visits” (119/200, 60%) and wanted to continue using video visits in the future (150/200, 75%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite positive telemedicine experiences, more support to facilitate video visits for patients and clinicians is needed.

The infection impairs several human organs and systems, however, it is not clear how it affects thyroid function. The study therefore aimed at measuring plasma levels of thyroid hormones and Hs-CRP in COVID-19 patients and apparently healthy uninfected controls to assess the possible effect of SAR-CoV-2 infection on thyroid function. METHODS: in this cross-sectional study carried out between May-August 2020, 90 consenting participants comprising 45 COVID-19 patients and 45 apparently healthy uninfected controls were recruited. Plasma FT3, FT4, TSH and Hs-CRP were measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20 and statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: the mean plasma FT3 and TSH concentrations were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively). Euthyroidism was observed in all uninfected controls, whereas 35 (77.8%) COVID-19 patients were euthyroid. Sick euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroidism was observed in 7 (15.6%) and 3 (6.7%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: though there was a preponderance of euthyroidism among COVID-19 patients, significantly higher mean plasma levels of TSH and FT3, sick euthyroid syndrome and subclinical hypothyroidism observed among some COVID-19 patients may be indicative of disease-related thyroid function changes. Hence, there is need to pay attention to thyroid function during and after treatment of COVID-19.","Okwor, Chika Juliet; Meka, Ijeoma Angela; Akinwande, Kazeem Sanjo; Edem, Victory Fabian; Okwor, Vitalis Chukwuemeka",Pan Afr Med J,459,16

Understanding its pathogenesis is crucial to guide prognostic and therapeutic implications. Viral infections are known to alter the lipid profile and metabolism of their host cells, similar to the case with MERS and SARS-CoV-2002. Since lipids play various metabolic roles, studying lipid profile alterations in COVID-19 is an inevitable step as an attempt to achieve better therapeutic strategies, as well as a potential prognostic factor in the course of this disease. Several studies have reported changes in lipid profile associated with COVID-19. The most frequently reported changes are a decline in serum cholesterol and ApoA1 levels and elevated triglycerides. The hyper-inflammatory state mediated by the Cytokine storm disturbs several fundamental lipid biosynthesis pathways. Virus replication is a process that drastically changes the host cell's lipid metabolism program and overuses cell lipid resources. Lower HDL-C and ApoA1 levels are associated with higher severity and mortality rates and with higher levels of inflammatory markers. Studies suggest that arachidonic acid omega-3 derivatives might help modulate hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm resulting from pulmonary involvement. Also, statins have been shown to be beneficial when administered after COVID-19 diagnosis via unclear mechanisms probably associated with anti-inflammatory effects and HDL-C rising effects.","Rezaei, Abbas; Neshat, Sina; Heshmat-Ghahdarijani, Kiyan",Curr Probl Cardiol,459,5

With limited data from the Eastern Mediterranean region, this study aims to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of OSCEs for final year pharmacy students in Kuwait. The study also aims to compare students' performance in two academic years (2015–2016 and 2016–2017). METHODS: The design, implementation, and evaluation of the competency-based OSCE followed a 3-phase systematic evidence-based approach. The development phase involved establishing an OSCE working group to develop a blueprint and scoring rubrics and to organise assessors and standardised patient/physician training. The implementation phase involved conducting formative and summative OSCEs. The evaluation phase involved undertaking student and staff perception surveys. RESULTS: The overall students' OSCE scores for the academic years 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 were (median (interquartile range)) (71.6%, 32.2) and (60.0% (30.7)) and respectively (p < 0.0001). The average students' performance score was high in stations covering 'patient consultation and diagnosis' competency (71.4% (95% CI: 66.7–73.3)) and lower in stations covering 'monitoring of medicine therapy' competency (50.0% (95% CI: 33.3–66.7)). Students perceived stations covering 'monitoring medicines therapy' and 'assessment of medicine' as difficult. However, staff perceived stations related to 'patient consultation and diagnosis' competency as the easiest. Students reported that the OSCE was a positive experience as it provided them an opportunity to practice real life scenarios in a safe learning environment. CONCLUSION: The OSCE helped to identify the level of competency of students prior to graduation and areas to improve in the curriculum.","Al-Haqan, Asmaa; Al-Taweel, Dalal; Koshy, Samuel; Alghanem, Sarah",Saudi Pharm J,459,16

DESIGN: Analysis of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 Twitter data in the Symplur Signals Database between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020. SETTING: Social media platform Twitter. PATIENTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: Promotion of the joint usage of #PedsICU and #COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected data on all tweets containing the hashtag #PedsICU in addition to those containing both #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. Tweets including #PedsICU were shared 49,865 times on six continents between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020; between February 1 and March 13, only 8% of #PedsICU tweets included a coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag. After a sharp rise during the week of March 14, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 content has dominated the #PedsICU conversation on Twitter, comprising 69% of both #PedsICU tweets and impressions (p < 0.001). The most commonly used coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag over the study period was #COVID19 (69%). Proportionately, a greater percentage of #PedsICU tweets including the coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag (vs not) had images or videos (45% vs 41%; p < 0.001). In addition, non–physician healthcare providers were the largest group of users (46%) of the combination of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. The most popular tweets shared on Twitter were open-access resources, including links for updated literature, narrative reviews, and educational videos relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 clinical care. Concurrent hashtags and words in tweets containing #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags spanned several different disciplines and topics in pediatric critical care. CONCLUSION: Twitter has been used widely for real-time information sharing and collaboration among the international pediatric critical care community during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Targeted use of #PedsICU and #COVID19 for engagement on Twitter is a conduit to combat misinformation and optimize reach to pediatric critical care stakeholders across the globe when rapid dissemination is needed.","Kudchadkar, Sapna R.; Carroll, Christopher L.",Pediatr Crit Care Med,459,23

METHODS: Cellular assays were used to investigate the antiviral activity of NICTABA and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies were performed to study the sugar specificity and the interactions of both lectins with the envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1. RESULTS: The N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc)-binding lectins exhibited broad-spectrum activity against several families of enveloped viruses including influenza A/B, Dengue virus type 2, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and HIV-1/2. The IC(50) of NICTABA for various HIV-1 strains, clinical isolates and HIV-2 assessed in PBMCs ranged from 5 to 30 nM. Furthermore, NICTABA inhibited syncytium formation between persistently HIV-1-infected T cells and uninfected CD4+ T lymphocytes and prevented DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 transmission to CD4+ target T lymphocytes. However, unlike many other antiviral carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) described so far, NICTABA did not block HIV-1 capture to DC-SIGN+ cells and it did not interfere with the binding of the human monoclonal antibody 2G12 to gp120. SPR studies with HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins showed that the affinity of NICTABA for gp120 and gp41 was in the low nanomolar range. The specific binding of NICTABA to gp120 could be prevented in the presence of a GlcNAc trimer, but not in the presence of mannose trimers. NICTABA displayed no antiviral activity against non-enveloped viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Since CBAs possess a high genetic barrier for the development of viral resistance and NICTABA shows a broad antiviral activity profile, this CBA may qualify as a potential antiviral candidate with a pleiotropic mode of action aimed at targeting the entry of enveloped viruses.","Gordts, Stephanie C.; Renders, Marleen; Férir, Geoffrey; Huskens, Dana; Van Damme, Els J.

FC, FIT, and CRP were measured, and their association with the four endoscopic scores was evaluated. Endoscopic scores of 78 complete colonoscopies (66 UC patients) were evaluated using the three biomarkers. FC and CRP tended to correlate more strongly with S-MES and UCCIS than with M-MES and UCEIS. In the M-MES 0, 1 group, compared to CRP, FC and FIT showed stronger correlations with S-MES and UCCIS. Conversely, in the M-MES 2, 3 group, only CRP was significantly correlated with each descriptor.

Here, we analyze patient variables associated with the acceptance of a telemedicine encounter by a pediatric neurosurgical population during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS All patients seen in a single institution's outpatient pediatric neurosurgery clinic between 4/1/20 and 7/31/20 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic variables were collected for each patient's first completed encounter. Patients participating in telemedicine were compared to those seen in-person. Univariate analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Fischer's exact test for categorical variables. A logistic regression multivariable analysis was then performed. RESULTS 682 patients were included (374 telemedicine and 308 in-person). Univariate analysis demonstrated telemedicine visits were more likely to occur at earlier study dates (p<0.001), be established rather than new patients (p<0.001), White or Caucasian (p<0.001), not Hispanic or Latino (p<0.001), English-speaking (p<0.001), non-Medicare/Medicaid recipients (p<0.001), have lower no show rates (p=0.006), and live further from the hospital (p=0.005). Multivariable analysis demonstrated older age (p=0.031), earlier appointment date (p<0.01), established patient status (p<0.001), English-speaking (p<0.02) and non-Medicare/Medicaid insurance (p<0.05) were significant predictors of telemedicine utilization. CONCLUSIONS Significant demographic differences exist among pediatric patients who participated in telemedicine vs. those who requested an in-person visit at our institution. Addressing barriers to access will be crucial for promoting health equity in continued utilization of telemedicine.","Lambert, William A; Leclair, Nathan K; Knopf, Joshua; Mosha, Maua H; Bookland, Markus J; Martin, Jonathan E; Hersh, David S",World neurosurgery,459,33

N-acetylcysteine, being a nutraceutical precursor of an important antioxidant glutathione, can perform several biological functions in mammals and microbes. It has consequently garnered a growing interest as a potential adjunctive therapy for coronavirus disease. Here, we review evidence concerning the effects of N-acetylcysteine in respiratory viral infections based on currently available in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical investigations. The repurposing of a known drug such as N-acetylcysteine may significantly hasten the deployment of a novel approach for COVID-19. Since the drug candidate has already been translated into the clinic for several decades, its established pharmacological properties and safety and side-effect profiles expedite preclinical and clinical assessment for the treatment of COVID-19. In vitro data have depicted that N-acetylcysteine increases antioxidant capacity, interferes with virus replication, and suppresses expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells infected with influenza viruses or respiratory syncytial virus. Furthermore, findings from in vivo studies have displayed that, by virtue of immune modulation and anti-inflammatory mechanism, N-acetylcysteine reduces the mortality rate in influenza-infected mice animal models. The promising in vitro and in vivo results have prompted the initiation of human subject research for the treatment of COVID-19, including severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Albeit some evidence of benefits has been observed in clinical outcomes of patients, precision nanoparticle design of N-acetylcysteine may allow for greater therapeutic efficacy.","Wong, Kon Ken; Lee, Shaun Wen Huey; Kua, Kok Pim",J Inflamm Res,459,10

The binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on the viral surface to host sialic acid (SA) receptors is a requisite step in the infection process. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N1 viruses can be divided into 10 clades based on their HA sequences, with most human IVs centered from clade 1 and clade 2.1 to clade 2.3. Protein sequence alignment in various clades indicates the high conservation in the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) is essential for binding with the SA receptor. Two glycosylation sites, 158N and 169N, also participate in receptor recognition. In the present work, we attempted to construct a serial H5N1 HA models including diverse glycosylated HAs to simulate the binding process with various SA receptors in silico. As the SA-α-2,3-Gal and SA-α-2,6-Gal receptor adopted two distinctive topologies, straight and fishhook-like, respectively, the presence of N-glycans at 158N would decrease the affinity of HA for all of the receptors, particularly SA-α-2,6-Gal analogs. The steric clashes of the huge glycans shown at another glycosylation site, 169N, located on an adjacent HA monomer, would be more effective in preventing the binding of SA-α-2,3-Gal analogs.","Chen, Wentian; Sun, Shisheng; Li, Zheng",PLoS One,459,1

Interestingly, two scFvs (B5 and B9) exhibited higher binding specificity to SARS-CoV with the OD(450) value 0.608 and 0.545, respectively, and their coding sequences shared the identical sequence composed of V(H) gene (351 bp) and V(L) gene (327 bp), so the two scFvs were uniformly named as SA59B and chosen for further analysis. SA59B scFv was expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli HB2151 and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The soluble 30 kDa SA59B scFv-antibody was verified in SDS–PAGE and Western-blot. The purified SA59B scFv-antibody was labeled with HRP by the glutaraldehyde method, and the concentration of HRP and SA59B scFv-antibody in the SA59B-HRP solution reached 2.4 and 2.28 mg/ml, respectively. Then, the binding ability of SA59B-HRP to SARS-CoV was evaluated by ELISA with S/N of 11.6, indicating higher binding specificity between them.

These antibodies may neutralize the biological effects of the protein drug, potentially decreasing its therapeutic effects. By high-resolution HLA class I and II typing we identified two HLA class II alleles associated with the development of antibodies to IFN-β. In two independent continuous and binary-trait association studies, HLA-DRB1(∗)0401 and HLA-DRB1(∗)0408 (odds ratio: 5.15)—but not other HLA alleles—were strongly associated with the development of binding and neutralizing antibodies to IFN-β. The associated HLA-DRB1(∗)04 alleles differ from nonassociated HLA-DRB1(∗)04 alleles by a glycine-to-valine substitution in position 86 of the epitope-binding alpha-helix of the HLA class II molecule. The peptide-binding motif of HLA-DRB1(∗)0401 and (∗)0408 might promote binding and presentation of an immunogenic peptide, which may eventually break T cell tolerance and facilitate antibody development to IFN-β.

PURPOSE: This study examined the relations of pseudoscientific and just world beliefs, generalized and institutional trust, and political party affiliation to adherence to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines over three months, as well as the explanatory role of COVID-19 risk perceptions in these relations. METHODS: A U.S. nationwide sample of 430 adults (49.8% women; mean age = 40.72) completed a prospective online study, including an initial assessment (between March 27 and April 5, 2020), a 1 month follow-up (between April 27 and May 21, 2020), and a 3 month follow-up (between June 26 and July 15, 2020). We hypothesized that greater pseudoscientific and just world beliefs, lower governmental, institutional, and dispositional trust, and Republican Party affiliation would be associated with lower initial adherence to social distancing and greater reductions in social distancing over time and that COVID-19 risk perceptions would account for significant variance in these relations. RESULTS: Results revealed unique associations of lower governmental trust, greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs, and greater trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to lower initial adherence to social distancing. Whereas greater COVID-19 risk perceptions and CDC trust were associated with less steep declines in social distancing over time, both Republican (vs. Democratic) Party affiliation and greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs were associated with steeper declines in social distancing over time (relations accounted for by lower COVID-19 risk perceptions).

After the state of emergency was lifted in Japan, schools have reopened, and teachers are conducting face-to-face classes while maintaining safety precautions. This study aimed to assess the factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety among teachers conducting face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic after schools reopened. METHODS: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 263 primary and middle school teachers in the Shinagawa area of Tokyo (October 10–30, 2020). The questionnaire assessed the type of school (primary or middle school), sex, age, and factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that arose from the pandemic. The levels of anxiety and the factors contributing to anxiety were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very anxious). RESULTS: In an analysis of the data of 237 participants excluding the missing data, many teachers reported feeling infection- and education-related anxiety. A majority of the participants were women (n = 152, 64.1%), and the mean age of the participants was 39.8 ± 11.3 years. A stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six factors for infection-related anxiety as significant (R(2) = 0.61, p < 0.001). Among these variables, the largest partial regression coefficient value was reported for the following reason: “I feel anxious because we cannot ensure the safety of teachers themselves or of their families” (β = 0.37, p < 0.001). For educational anxiety, four of six reasons were identified as significant (R(2) = 0.64, p < 0.001). Among these, “anxiety about the students’ home situations” (β = 0.41, p < 0.001) and “delay in education (students’ side)” (β = 0.27, p < 0.001) had stronger associations with anxiety compared to the others. CONCLUSION: In-person education during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused teachers to experience anxiety. This report provides useful information by highlighting the reasons for infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that teachers experience in face-to-face classes during a pandemic. Even if the coverage of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widespread worldwide, we will still be combating COVID-19 infections for at least a few years.

Clinical picture of COVID-19 suggests a role ACE2 blockade, rather than its overexpression, in causing the pathogenesis. ACE2 blockade results in increased Angiotensin II activity with simultaneous hampering of functions of Angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Acute respiratory distress due to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, cardiomyopathy and shock reported in COVID-19 patients can be explained by imbalanced Angiotensin II and Angiotensin-(1-7) activities. Failure of Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers to control severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections indicates importance of simultaneous induction of Angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis for correcting pathological conditions in COVID-19 through its anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory and cardioprotective roles. MasR agonists have also shown organ protective effects in a number of animal studies. Unfortunately, these agonists have not been tested in clinical studies.

In the past ten years, numerous studies had shown that infected subjects have a significantly higher incidence of mental and physical health problems and are more prone to exhibiting the adverse effects of various diseases. Methods A cross-sectional internet study was performed on a population of 4,499 Toxoplasma-free and 786 Toxoplasma-infected subjects and looked for factors which positively or negatively affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and likelihood of a severe course of Covid-19. Findings Logistic regression and partial Kendall correlation controlled for sex, age, and size of the place of residence showed that latent toxoplasmosis had the strongest effect on the risk of infection (OR = 1.50) before sport (OR = 1.30), and borreliosis (1.27). It also had the strongest effect on the risk of severe course of infection (Tau = 0.146), before autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, male sex, keeping a cat, being overweight, borreliosis, higher age, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Toxoplasmosis augmented the adverse effects of other risk factors but was not the proximal cause of the effect of cat keeping (in the form of higher likelihood of Covid infection and higher severity of the course of infection), which was observed especially in a subset of Toxoplasma-infected subjects (Tau = 0.153). Effects of keeping a cat were detected only in subjects from multi-member families, suggesting that a cat could a vector for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a family. Interpretations Toxoplasmosis is currently not considered a risk factor for Covid-19 and Toxoplasma-infected subjects are neither informed about their higher risks nor prioritised in vaccination programs. Because toxoplasmosis affects a large segment of the human population, its impact on Covid-19-associated effects on public health could be considerable.","Flegr, J.",,459,24

The functional unit of Mpro is a homodimer, and each subunit has a His-41⋯Cys-145 catalytic dyad. Current thinking in this area is that Mpro dimerization is essential for catalysis, although the influence of the substrate binding on the dimer formation has never been explored. Here, we delineate the contributions of the peptide substrate to Mpro dimerization. Enzyme kinetic assays indicate that the monomeric mutant R298A/L exhibits lower activity but in a cooperative manner. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that in the presence of substrates, the major species of R298A/L shows a significant size shift toward the dimeric form and the monomer-dimer dissociation constant of R298A/L decreases by 12- to 17-fold, approaching that for wild-type. Furthermore, this substrate-induced dimerization was found to be reversible after substrates were removed. Based on the crystal structures, a key residue, Glu-166, which is responsible for recognizing the Gln-P1 of the substrate and binding to Ser-1 of another protomer, will interact with Asn-142 and block the S1 subsite entrance in the monomer. Our studies indicate that mutation of Glu-166 in the R298A mutant indeed blocks the substrate-induced dimerization. This demonstrates that Glu-166 plays a pivotal role in connecting the substrate binding site with the dimer interface. We conclude that protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions are closely correlated in Mpro.","Cheng, Shu-Chun; Chang, Gu-Gang; Chou, Chi-Yuan",Biophysical Journal,459,21

How can we understand the reactions to SARS of some of the main actors and institutions? What aspects were they preoccupied with and did their definition of what SARS was all about change during the process? A selection of jurisdictions is chosen – China, the Hong Kong SAR, Canada and the World Health Organization – to explore these questions. The starting point is a view that the reactions cannot primarily be seen as an instrumental, based on rational, standard-operating-procedures (SOPs) and technical expertise, but may be better understood by a garbage can-perspective. From a review of the events as publicly reported, we find, as suggested by garbage can theory, that politicians’ and administrators’ responses to the SARS outbreak were a combination of competing rationalities and overlapping agendas. Critical decisions were triggered by extraneous factors and administrative actions were shaped by dramatic switches from one set of standard operating procedures to another, as events unfolded. The public health issues constantly vied with other agendas and only when compelling alignments among them occurred did professional or technical rationales for “solving the problem” become dominant.","Christensen, Tom; Painter, Martin",Policy and Society,459,1

Putting in order {varepsilon}' of influence, there were identified three main forms of SARS-COV-2 of transmission behavior: during epidemics growth, policies are the main stronger seasonality forcing behavior of the epidemics followed by secondary and weaker environmental and urban spaces driving patterns of transmission. At outbreaks and control phase, environmental and urban spaces are the main seasonality forcing behavior due to policies/ALE limitations to address heterogeneity and confounding scenario of infection. Finally regarding S and R compartments of SIR model equations, control phases are the most reliable phase to predictive analysis. These seasonality forcing behaviors cause environmental driven seasonality researches to face hidden or false observations due to policy/ALE interventions for each country and urban spaces characteristics.

Here, we report a genetic and functional analysis of 19 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of Murine hepatitis virus MHV-A59 that are unable to synthesize viral RNA when the infection is initiated and maintained at the non-permissive temperature. Both classical and biochemical complementation analysis leads us to predict that the majority of MHV-A59 ORF1a replicase gene products (non-structural proteins nsp1–nsp11) form a single complementation group (cistron1) while the replicase gene products encoded in ORF1b (non-structural proteins nsp12–nsp16) are able to function in trans and comprise at least three, and possibly five, further complementation groups (cistrons II–VI). Also, we have identified mutations in the non-structural proteins nsp 4, nsp5, nsp10, nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16 that are responsible for the ts phenotype of eight MHV-A59 mutants, which allows us to conclude that these proteins are essential for the assembly of a functional replicase-transcriptase complex. Finally, our analysis of viral RNA synthesis in ts mutant virus-infected cells allows us to discriminate three phenotypes with regard to the inability of specific mutants to synthesize viral RNA at the non-permissive temperature. Mutant LA ts6 appeared to be defective in continuing negative-strand synthesis, mutant Alb ts16 appeared to form negative strands but these were not utilized for positive-strand RNA synthesis, and mutant Alb ts22 was defective in the elongation of both positive- and negative-strand RNA. On the basis of these results, we propose a model that describes a pathway for viral RNA synthesis in MHV-A59-infected cells. Further biochemical analysis of these mutants should allow us to identify intermediates in this pathway and elucidate the precise function(s) of the viral replicase proteins involved.","Sawicki, Stanley G; Sawicki, Dorothea L; Younker, Diane; Meyer, Yvonne; Thiel, Volker; Stokes, Helen; Siddell, Stuart G",PLoS Pathog,459,18

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched till August 3, 2020 to identify studies reporting COVID-19 patients with DKA and combined DKA/HHS. A total of 19 articles reporting 110 patients met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 91 (83%) patients had isolated DKA while 19 (17%) had DKA/HHS. The majority of the patients were male (63%) and belonged to black ethnicity (36%). The median age at presentation ranged from 45.5 to 59.0 years. Most of the patients (77%) had pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Only 10% of the patients had newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. The median blood glucose at presentation ranged from 486.0 to 568.5 mg/dl, being higher in patients with DKA/HHS compared to isolated DKA. The volume of fluid replaced in the first 24 h was higher in patients with DKA/HHS in contrast to patients with DKA alone. The in-hospital mortality rate was 45%, with higher mortality in the DKA/HHS group than in the isolated DKA group (67% vs. 29%). pH was lower in patients who had died compared to those who were discharged. CONCLUSION: DKA in COVID-19 patients portends a poor prognosis with a mortality rate approaching 50%. Differentiating isolated DKA from combined DKA/HHS is essential as the latter represents around one-fifth of the DKA cases and tends to have higher mortality than DKA alone.","Pal, Rimesh; Banerjee, Mainak; Yadav, Urmila; Bhattacharjee, Sukrita",Diabetes Metab Syndr,459,26

However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication--including uncertainty--about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2,097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2,217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g. social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.","Kerr, J.

Both viruses were found among Australia children with upper or lower respiratory tract disease during the autumn and winter of 2004, contributing to 21.1% of all microbial diagnoses, with individual incidences of 3.1% (HCoV-HKU1) and 5.6% (HBoV) among 324 specimens. HBoV was found to coincide with another virus in more than half of all instances and displayed a single genetic lineage, whilst HCoV-HKU1 was more likely to occur in the absence of another microbe and strains could be divided into two genetic lineages which we propose be termed HCoV-HKU1 type A and type B. Children under the age of 2 years were most at risk of infection by these viruses which contribute significantly to the microbial burden among patients with respiratory tract disease during the colder months.","Sloots, Theo P.; McErlean, Peter; Speicher, David J.; Arden, Katherine E.; Nissen, Michael D.; Mackay, Ian M.",J Clin Virol,459,16

The real-time estimation involves a number of important statistical problems to consider, and this chapter comprehensively describes commonly used estimation methods and their pitfalls. When estimating the case fatality risk (CFR) during the course of an epidemic, the data are right-censored because of the time delay from illness onset to death. A conventional survival analysis technique is employed for addressing right censoring. Identification of risk factors of death also requires the care for censored nature of the data, and we have devised a method that combines the survival analysis and logistic regression. Ascertainment bias is always a practical issue in interpreting the absolute value of the CFR or comparing CFR between different groups, and recent studies have shown that observational effort including seroepidemiological survey has to be made to overcome this bias.","Nishiura, Hiroshi",Handbook of Statistics,459,9

Patients have been reticent to seek care for many diseases and injuries including concussion due to fears of potential exposure to COVID-19. Moreover, because of social distancing recommendations and stay-at-home orders, patient screening, evaluation, and delivery of care have become less efficient or impossible to perform via in-person clinic visits. Consequently, there was a sudden need to shift healthcare delivery from primarily in-person visits to telehealth. This sudden shift in healthcare delivery brings with it both challenges and opportunities for clinical concussion care. This article is designed to discuss these challenges and opportunities and provide an experiential-based framework for providing concussion care via telehealth. We first provide an overview of a clinical concussion model utilized at concussion specialty clinics from 3 geographically disparate healthcare systems for in-person service delivery prior to COVID-19. We then discuss the creation of new clinical workflows to facilitate the continued provision of concussion specialty care using telehealth. Finally, we examine lessons learned during this healthcare delivery shift including limitations and potential barriers for telehealth for concussion care, as well as opportunities for expansion of concussion care in rural and underserved areas. We also discuss the need to empirically evaluate the comparative efficacy of telehealth and in-person concussion care moving forward.","Womble, Melissa N; Reynolds, Erin; Kissinger-Knox, Alicia; Collins, Michael W; Kontos, Anthony P; West, Robin V; Eagle, Shawn; Elbin, R J",J. head trauma rahabil,459,28

Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and/or CCR5+ NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections. Author summary The composition of in particular CXCR3+ and/or CXCR6+ NK cells and T cells is altered in peripheral blood upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus in patients with moderate disease.

To date, little evidence is available about the effect of lockdown release in terms of adolescent health from the perspective of an emergency department (ED). METHODS: We reviewed data on ED arrivals of adolescents and young adults (aged 13–24 years) in the weeks immediately before and after the Italian lockdown release in 2020, and in the same periods in 2019, with a focus on cases of severe alcohol abuse, psychomotor agitation, and other mental issues. RESULTS: The relative frequency of severe alcohol intoxications increased from .88% during the last part of the lockdown to 11.3% after lockdown release. When comparing these data with the same period in 2019, a highly significant difference emerged, with severe alcohol intoxications accounting for 11.31% of ED visits versus 2.96%, respectively. The relative frequency of ED arrivals related to psychomotor agitation or other mental health issues was not significantly increased after lockdown release.

Hence, the measures of the Ministry of Health to correct the situation. The purpose of this study was to highlight the extent of vaccine release during COVID-19 pandemic and to make recommendations to restore vaccination programmes. METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional study of the effect of containment measures during this pandemic on the monitoring of children´s vaccinations. We conducted a national survey of pediatricians using an electronic questionnaire administered via Google Forms. We collected, analyzed and interpreted the results. RESULTS: one hundred and three Moroccan pediatricians answered the questionnaire. More than 2-thirds (78.6%) of pediatricians practiced in the private sector and delivered vaccines in the immunization schedule. The majority of pediatricians (95%) were asked about parental vaccine concerns. We noted that 82.5% of parents were reluctant to go to the local health department and 5.8% refused to take vaccination during COVID-19 pandemic. About 22% of pediatricians completely stopped immunization services and 72.8% delayed immunizations from 3 to 4 weeks. Vaccination stoppage involved older children in two thirds of cases.

SARS-CoV-2 develops many types of mutations (such as B.1.1.7), making diagnosis and treatment challenging. Although we now have a preliminary understanding of COVID-19, including pathological changes, clinical manifestations, and treatment measures, we also face new difficulties. The biggest problem is that most COVID-19 patients might face sequelae (e.g., fatigue, sleep disturbance, pulmonary fibrosis) during the recovery phase. We aimed to test six Chinese patent medicines to treat three major abnormal symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the recovery phase, including cardiopulmonary function, sleep disturbance, and digestive function. We launched the “three syndromes and six Chinese patent medicines” randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial on April 10, 2020. The results showed that Jinshuibao tablets and Shengmaiyin oral liquid significantly improved the cardiopulmonary function of recovering COVID-19 patients. Shumian capsules, but not Xiaoyao capsules, significantly improved patients’ sleep disorders.

However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce. METHODS: Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction conversion at the No.3 People's Hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18–32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.05, p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10–5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days versus 28.5 days, Log-rank p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.","Yan, Dan; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Zhu, Ya-nan; Huang, Li; Dan, Bi-tang; Zhang, Guo-jun; Gao, Yong-hua",Eur Respir J,459,16

Despite wide agreement from experts about the importance of developing classroom and behavior management skills, many teacher training programs do not require specified coursework or experiences to develop this skill set for teacher licensure or degree completion. In this article, we describe what we observe to be a disconnect between current requirements of teacher preparation programs, and the nature of adequate teacher training to appropriately manage and support student behavior. We argue that this disconnect currently contributes to a host of problematic outcomes observable in schools, including teacher attrition, racial disproportionality in discipline actions, and an overreliance on punitive and ineffective behavior support practices.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the Prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. STUDY DESIGN: The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen HCoV-HKU1 and other common respiratory viruses in 645 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from children with ARTI from November 2006 to October 2008. All PCR positive products were sequenced. And the demographic and clinical data were collected for all patients. RESULTS: Nineteen of 645 (2.95%) specimens tested positive for HCoV-HKU1, and all HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens were distributed in the winter and spring season. The HCoV-HKU1 co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 47.37% (9/19). There was no statistically significant difference in the detection rate between groups by age or gender, except between patients with and without underlying diseases. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating in the years 2007 and 2008 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. CONCLUSIONS: HCoV-HKU1 is an uncommon virus existing among Chinese children with ARTI. Children with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to viral infection. Only HCoV-HKU1 genotype B circulated locally.","Jin, Yu; Song, Jing-Rong; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Gao, Han-Chun; Yuan, Xin-Hui; Xu, Zi-Qian; Yan, Kun-Long; Zhao, Yang; Xiao, Ni-Guang; Hou, Yun-De; Duan, Zhao-Jun",J Clin Virol,459,6

Many reports have enough evidence for the use of FDA-approved drugs which have inhibitory potential against target proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we utilized a structure-based drug design approach to find possible drug candidates from the existing pool of FDA-approved drugs and checked their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. We performed virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs against the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2, an essential enzyme, and a potential drug target. Using well-defined computational methods, we identified Glecaprevir and Maraviroc (MVC) as the best inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Both drugs bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and form a significant number of non-covalent interactions. Glecaprevir and MVC bind to the conserved residues of substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). This work provides sufficient evidence for the use of Glecaprevir and MVC for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 after experimental validation and clinical manifestations.","Shamsi, Anas; Mohammad, Taj; Anwar, Saleha; AlAjmi, Mohamed F.; Hussain, Afzal; Rehman, Md.

All patients presented with severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation, and received full anticoagulation for treatment of hypercoagulable state suggested by elevated D-dimer. All but one patient received alteplase for thrombolytic therapy of suspected massive pulmonary embolism (PE). On the basis of this case series, hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is a late manifestation of the disease that persists despite anticoagulation, is cyclic in nature based on D-dimer despite thrombolysis, and is fatal if it rebounds. The use of anticoagulation and thrombolysis in these patients seemed harmful or non-beneficial.

The effect of IBD activity on COVID-19 is unclear. We examined the relationship between IBD activity and COVID-19 severity according to age. METHODS: We included IBD patients diagnosed with COVID-19, reported to SECURE-IBD between March 13, 2020-August 3, 2021. Clinical IBD activity was measured by Physician Global Assessment (PGA). COVID-19-related outcomes were 1) ICU, ventilation, or death, and 2) hospitalization. Using generalized estimating equations, we determined adjusted odds ratios (aOR, 95% CI) for moderate and severe PGA vs. clinical remission/mild PGA, controlling for demographics, medications, and COVID-19 diagnosis period. We performed stratified analyses by age (≤50 vs. >50 years. RESULTS: Among 6,078 patients, adverse COVID-19 outcomes were more common with active IBD: ICU/ventilation/death in 3.6% (175/4898) of remission/mild, 4.9% (45/920) of moderate, 8.8% (23/260) of severe (p<0.001); hospitalization in 13% (649/4898) of remission/mild, 19% (178/920) of moderate, 38% (100/260) of severe (p<0.001). Stratified by decade, effect sizes were larger for younger patients. In patients ≤50 years, severe PGA was independently associated with ICU/ventilation/death (aOR 3.27 [1.15-9.30]) and hospitalization (aOR 4.62 [2.83-7.55]). In contrast, severe PGA was not independently associated with COVID-19 outcomes in those older than 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically active IBD may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19, particularly in younger patients. IBD disease control, including through medication compliance, and strategies to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection amongst patients with active IBD (e.g., distancing, immunization) are key to limit adverse COVID-19 outcomes.","Ricciuto, Amanda; Lamb, Christopher A; Benchimol, Eric I; Walker, Gareth J; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Kappelman, Michael D; Ungaro, Ryan C; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Brenner, Erica J; Agrawal, Manasi; Reinisch, Walter; Griffiths, Anne M; Sebastian, Shaji",J. crohns. colitis,459,23

In this study, we hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines may elicit production of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the upper respiratory tract, such as in oral and nasal mucosal fluid. To test that hypothesis, we enrolled 114 participants within 3-7 days of receiving the first dose of the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and collected oral mucosal fluid samples on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 after each vaccine dose. Of participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 (n = 89), 79 (85.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by time point 2 (10 days +/-2 days after first vaccine dose), and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by time point 3 (15 days +/- 2 days after first vaccine dose). Additionally, we collected paired oral mucosal fluid and anterior nares samples from 10 participants who had received both vaccine doses. We found that participants had an average SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody concentration of 2496.0 +/- 2698.0ng/mL in nasal mucosal fluid versus 153.4 +/- 141.0ng/mL in oral mucosal fluid. Here, we demonstrate detection and longitudinal persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

Yet with students making remotely, how can a teacher monitor the students’ progress, offer timely feedback, or infer what the students understood? In short, how are teachers assessing this work? Working with a learning community of teachers who center hands-on making in their instruction regardless of academic discipline, this study was conducted to examine how teachers are supporting and assessing maker-based learning. Our study draws on observational field notes taken during the community’s meetings, interviews with four focal teachers, and artifacts from the teachers’ maker projects. Taking a values-based assessment approach, our findings reveal interesting shifts in teaching practice. Specifically, teachers incorporated social-emotional goals into the activities they design and monitor, students documented their artifacts and process, and teachers adapted to using low-tech materials to ensure accessibility while engaging remote students in their learning goals. These findings imply that not only can remote maker-based experiences can influence the role of students as assessors and the tools and materials they use for making but also how these practices revealed in remote settings could inform in-person settings.","Wardrip, Peter Samuelson; Saplan, Kailea; Evancho, Jeff",TechTrends,459,20

After chemo and targeted therapies, the patient showed continuous tumor progression and clinical deterioration. Fortunately, the patient had a high expression level of PD-L1 (80%) in the tumor tissues. Ultimately, the patient survived for additional 6 months with camrelizumab treatment. In summary, camrelizumab may be a good candidate for the treatment of PPSCC, especially in tumors with high PD-L1 expression.","Wang, Yao; Gao, Ying; Chen, Hai-Ruo; Liu, Hong; Fu, Xi; Yan, Ran; You, Feng-Ming; Li, Zhuo-Hong",Clin Med Insights Oncol,459,20

Stigma is a common phenomenon in the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases. In the crisis caused by the pandemic, widespread public stigma has influenced social groups. This study explores the negative emotions arousal effect from online public stigmatization during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on social cooperation. We constructed a model based on the literature and tested it on a sample of 313 participants from the group being stigmatized. The results demonstrate: (1) relevance and stigma perception promote negative emotions, including anxiety, anger, and grief; (2) the arousal of anger and grief leads to a rise in the altruistic tendency within the stigmatized group; and (3) stigmatization-induced negative emotions have a complete mediating effect between perceived relevance and altruistic tendency, as well as perceived stigma and altruistic tendency. For a country and nation, external stigma will promote the group becoming more united and mutual help. One wish to pass the buck but end up helping others unintentionally. We should not simply blame others, including countries, regions, and groups under the outbreak of COVID-19, and everyone should be cautious with the words and actions in the Internet public sphere.","Chen, Xi; Huang, Chenli; Wang, Hongyun; Wang, Weiming; Ni, Xiangli; Li, Yujie",Front Psychol,459,16

The continued wave of research in this field, which has come to be known as the new sociology of morality, is a lively research program that has several common grounds with scholarship in the field of business ethics. The aim of this thematic symposium is to open constructive dialogues between these two areas of study. In this introductory essay, we briefly present the project of the new sociology of morality and discuss its relevance for business ethics. We also review the contributions to this thematic symposium and identify four specific domains where future research can contribute to fruitful dialogues between the two fields.","Shadnam, Masoud; Bykov, Andrey; Prasad, Ajnesh",J Bus Ethics,459,1

As of May 2021, three sublineages labeled as B.1.617.1 (κ), B.1.617.2 (δ), and B.1.617.3 have been already identified, and their potential impact on the current pandemic is being studied. This variant has 13 amino acid changes, three in its spike protein, which are currently of particular concern: E484Q, L452R, and P681R. Here, we report a major effect of the mutations characterizing this lineage, represented by a marked alteration of the surface electrostatic potential (EP) of the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Enhanced RBD‐EP is particularly noticeable in the B.1.617.2 (δ) sublineage, which shows multiple replacements of neutral or negatively charged amino acids with positively charged amino acids. We here hypothesize that this EP change can favor the interaction between the B.1.617+ RBD and the negatively charged ACE2, thus conferring a potential increase in the virus transmission.","Pascarella, Stefano; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Zella, Davide; Bianchi, Martina; Benedetti, Francesca; Benvenuto, Domenico; Broccolo, Francesco; Cauda, Roberto; Caruso, Arnaldo; Angeletti, Silvia; Giovanetti, Marta; Cassone, Antonio",J Med Virol,459,30

Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was designed. Thirty-four women with FM were randomized into two groups: TP group and Control group. The intervention lasted 15 weeks, with 2 sessions per week. The TP based on aerobic exercise was guided by video and the intensity of each session was monitored using the Borg scale. Pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), mechanical pain sensitivity (algometer), number of tender points, FM impact (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), physiological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), upper (Arm Curl Test) and lower-limb physical function (6-min Walk Test) were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Results: The TP group improved pain intensity (p = 0.022), mechanical pain sensitivity (p < 0.05), and psychological distress (p = 0.005), compared to the Control group. The Control group showed no statistically significant changes in any variable (p > 0.05). Conclusions: A TP based on aerobic exercise achieved improvements on pain intensity, mechanical pain sensitivity, and psychological distress compared to a Control group during the lockdown declared in Spain due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Hernando-Garijo, Ignacio; Ceballos-Laita, Luis; Mingo-Gómez, María Teresa; Medrano-de-la-Fuente, Ricardo; Estébanez-de-Miguel, Elena; Martínez-Pérez, María Natividad; Jiménez-del-Barrio, Sandra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,459,16

The optimum extraction conditions are detailed as follows: liquid-solid ratio 42 mL/g, extraction temperature 80 °C, microwave power 570 W, extraction time 26 min. Under this conditions, the mean value of TKMSP yield 2.43 ± 0.45% (n = 3), which was consistent closely with the predicted value (2.44%). The five polysaccharides (TKMSP-1, TKMSP-2, TKMSP-3, TKMSP-4 and TKMSP-5) were isolated from TKMSP by DEAE-52. TKMSP-1, TKMSP-2 and TKMSP-4 were common in containing Man, Rib, Rha, GluA, GalA, Glu, Gal, Xyl, Arab and Fuc. However, there was no Fuc in TKMSP-3, while TKMSP-5 lacked GluA, GalA and Fuc. UV–vis and FT-IR analysis combined with molecular weight determination further indicated that the five fractions were polydisperse polysaccharides. A significant difference was achieved in the structural characterization of these five fractions. TKMSP exhibited immunosuppressive activity on RAW264.7 cells. It can be applied as a potential immunosuppressant agent in medicine.","Hu, Zhengyu; Zhou, Hongli; Zhao, JingLi; Sun, JiaQi; Li, Mei; Sun, Xinshun",Int J Biol Macromol,459,3

The pandemic has exposed the leadership capacities and health investments cum preparedness of countries across the globe. This paper studies the reactions and responses of nations in containing the deadly virus and observes that while Western nations react rapidly and more proactively, African nations seem to be caught in a web of religious prevarications and State fragility which has impugned on the efforts of States in containing the virus. The paper argues that the Nigerian government’s response so far in containing the virus is indicative of State fragility and that the prevailing perception of the virus as eschatological and nihilistic among the citizens, especially the very religious ones, may further obfuscate and mar government’s efforts in containing the virus. The paper will show how the government’s approach engenders a dire socioeconomic complication which may have more disastrous effects on the political economy of post Covid-19 Nigeria and suggested ways forward.","Chidume, C.

Therefore, the factors related to self-isolation (SI) should not be neglected, and it is important to investigate the factors leading the infected (or possibly infected) people to choose to self-isolate. In this paper, we tried to show that the theory of planned behavior provides a useful conceptual framework for SI when facing a pandemic risk, and a regression method with Chinese provincial (Guangdong Province) data was applied to investigate how attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) influence SI when facing a pandemic emergency. The results and the robustness tests confirm that ATT, SN, and PBC have a significant positive influence on SI when facing a pandemic emergency. ATT plays the most important role, followed by SN and then PBC. Based on the factors of SI, we found, through theoretical and empirical analyses, at least three important aspects that local governments need to consider to encourage citizens to self-isolate when facing a pandemic.","Zhang, Xiaojun; Wang, Fanfan; Zhu, Changwen; Wang, Zhiqiang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,459,16

However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in some patients. The cause of these complications is currently unknown. Here, we use human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We find expression of viral receptor ACE2 in mature choroid plexus cells expressing abundant lipoproteins, but not in neurons or other cell types. We challenge organoids with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells, but little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells are apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing cells of the choroid plexus epithelial barrier. Finally, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 damages the choroid plexus epithelium, leading to leakage across this important barrier that normally prevents entry of pathogens, immune cells and cytokines into cerebrospinal fluid and the brain.","Pellegrini, Laura; Albecka, Anna; Mallery, Donna L.; Kellner, Max J.; Paul, David; Carter, Andrew P.; James, Leo C.; Lancaster, Madeline A.",Cell Stem Cell,459,14
