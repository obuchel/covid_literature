Correct handwashing can prevent 50 to 70% of water-infections and foodborne-infections. We report the results of a fact-finding study on general handwashing attitude and practice in the Republic of Korea by analyzing habits and awareness among adults and students (grades 4 to 12) based on the 2006 to 2014 National Handwashing Surveys and observational surveys. METHODS: The awareness survey was performed by telephone interviews with adults and students in 16 municipalities and provinces sampled by quota for region, sex and age. The observational survey was performed in subway, railway, and other public restrooms in seven municipalities selected through systematic sampling. RESULTS: Adults and students washed their hands with soap/sanitizer an average of 6.6 and 5.2 times daily, respectively, in 2014, an increase and decrease compared to 2006 (4.8) and 2013 (6.8). Their average daily handwashing frequency in 2014, 9.8 and 8.3, was higher than in 2006 (7.6), but lower than in 2013 (10.3).The percentage of participants handwashing with soap after using the restroom (29.5%) has been increasing since 2009, but remain slower than in other countries (42% to 49%). The percentages of participants handwashing with water in 2014, 2013, and 2011 were 57.5%, 72.6%, and 71.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Handwashing with soap is an important national public health issue, and national projects promoting it should be given high priority. Research support is necessary to provide scientific evidence of the importance of handwashing with soap and to develop and implement evidence-based policies.","Lee, Moo-Sik; Hong, Su Jin; Kim, Young-Taek",Epidemiol Health,335,5

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in diagnosing skull fracture in children with closed head injury in comparison with computed tomography (CT) scan. The current prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on children (0–14 years old), who were referred to the emergency department of a general teaching hospital in Shiraz, southern Iran (January–March 2018), with close head injury and were suspected of bone fracture. The participants were selected using a convenience sampling. The results of POCUS performed by emergency medicine (EM) residents were compared with the results of CT scan, which was reported by radiologists and considered a gold standard. Then, diagnostic tests were calculated. A total of 168 children were enrolled, with the mean ± standard deviation age of 6.21 ± 3.99. The most affected areas in the skull were the frontal (34.5%) and occipital areas (33.3%). POCUS had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.8% (95%CI, 48.2–97.7%) and 100% (95%CI, 97.7–100%), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 98.7%, with an accuracy of 98.8% in comparison with CT scan in the diagnosis of skull fracture. Conclusion: The results showed that POCUS with a portable ultrasonography machine, performed by the EM’s physicians, have high diagnostic precision and can be considered a tool in the management of patients with closed head injury.","Dehbozorgi, Afsaneh; Mousavi-Roknabadi, Razieh Sadat; Hosseini-Marvast, Seyed Rouhollah; Sharifi, Mehrdad; Sadegh, Robab; Farahmand, Faramarz; Damghani, Fatemeh",Eur J Pediatr,335,16

Evidence has indicated that the presence of TIC produces a nonlinear response of electroosmotic flow to the applied voltage, resulting in complex fluid behavior. In this study, we theoretically investigate thermal effects due to Joule heating on TIC phenomena in an ultrathin nanopore by computational fluid dynamics simulation. Our modeling results show that the rise of local temperature inside the nanopore significantly enhances TIC effects and thus has a significant influence on electroosmotic behavior. A local maximum of the solution conductivity occurs near the entrance of the nanopore at the high salt concentration end, resulting in a reversal of TIC across the nanopore. The Joule heating effects increase the reversal of TIC with the synergy of the negatively charged nanopore, and they also enhance the electroosmotic flow regardless of whether the nanopore is charged. These theoretical observations will improve our knowledge of nonclassical electrokinetic phenomena for flow control in nanopore systems.","Wang, Zhixuan; Hsu, Wei-Lun; Tsuchiya, Shuntaro; Paul, Soumyadeep; Alizadeh, Amer; Daiguji, Hirofumi",Micromachines (Basel),335,1

By regulating the secretion of other hormones and neurotransmitters, it acts as a pleiotropic modulator that affects, for example, reproductive, immune, cardiovascular, sleep, and wake systems and mood. Thus, synthetic melatonin has become an essential component in the treatment of depressive disorders. Although we know the pathway of melatonin action in the brain, we lack comprehensive cross-sectional studies on the periphery of depressed patients. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the differences between healthy control subjects (n = 84) and unipolar and bipolar depression patients (n = 94), including an analysis of the melatonin pathway at the level of the genes and serum biomarkers. An innovative approach is a pilot study based on gene expression profiling carried out on clinical and cell culture models using agomelatine and melatonin. We confirmed the melatonin biosynthesis pathway's molecular regulation dysfunctions, with a specific pattern for unipolar and bipolar depression, at the AANAT gene, its polymorphisms (rs8150 and rs3760138), and examined the serum biomarkers (serotonin, AANAT, ASMT, and melatonin). The biological pathway analysis uncovered pathways and genes that were uniquely altered after agomelatine treatment in a clinical model and melatonin treatment in a cell culture model. In both models, we confirmed the immunomodulatory effect of melatonin agents in depression.","Dmitrzak-Weglarz, Monika; Banach, Ewa; Bilska, Karolina; Narozna, Beata; Szczepankiewicz, Aleksandra; Reszka, Edyta; Jablonska, Ewa; Kapelski, Paweł; Skibinska, Maria; Pawlak, Joanna",Front Pharmacol,335,16

METHODS: We searched for observational studies on two-dose varicella VE for children in China aged 1–12 years that were published from 1997 to 2019, and assessed the quality of each study using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). We used meta-analysis models to obtain the pooled two-dose VE, and the studies were divided into subgroups and analysed according to whether or not it was an outbreak investigation and its NOS score. The quality of evidence of VEs were rated by approach of the GRADE system. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies and 87,196 individuals were included. The pooled two-dose VE was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 69–97%). The VE of outbreak studies (87% [95% CI: 76–93%]) was lower than non-outbreak studies (99% [95% CI: 98–99%]). There was no significant difference in VEs by different NOS quality. The quality of the evidence assessment of pooled two-dose VE was “low”, which was rated down by one category in limitations and publication bias respectively and rated up by two category in large effect. The quality of evidence assessment in subgroup of NOS score ≥ 7 was “moderate”. CONCLUSIONS: The VE of two-dose varicella vaccine is relatively high in preventing varicella, and is recommended for countries which need further control for varicella. However, higher quality evidence is needed as a supplement for stronger recommendations. The approach of GRADE could be applied for rating the quality of evidence in observational study.

Data for the study were generated through the administration of an online survey among 117 members of Home Owner Associations (HOAs) in the Tucson WUI. The results showed that the overwhelming majority of respondents were aware of buffelgrass, but their knowledge about buffelgrass control mechanisms appeared to be limited. Respondents also more frequently expressed concern about the risks posed by buffelgrass invasion to general targets, such as the Sonoran Desert ecosystem, native plants and wildlife than risks to their private property and neighborhoods. The results also showed that the level of involvement in HOAs, and leadership in HOAs had significant positive effects on homeowners' participation in buffelgrass control efforts. Homeowners' duration of residence also had a significant negative effect on participation in buffelgrass control efforts, suggesting that newcomers may be more involved than long-term residents. Similarly, the number of months respondents spent in Tucson per year had a negative effect on the number of hours spent on buffelgrass control efforts. Respondents’ perceived risk about buffelgrass invasion also had a positive effect on the hours spent on buffelgrass control as well as their level of involvement in fire risk mitigation efforts. These results highlight the importance of local institutions and community heterogeneity in social responses to threats in WUI communities. Policies aimed at building the resilience of WUI communities need to account for their complexity as coupled social-ecological systems.","Plecki, Abigail F.; Akamani, Kofi; Groninger, John W.; Brenner, Jacob C.; Gage, Karla L.",Heliyon,335,1

The objectives of this review are to (1) synthesize barriers and facilitators to implementing evidence-based guidelines in long-term care, as defined as a home where residents require 24-h nursing care, and 50% of the population is over the age of 65 years; and (2) map barriers and facilitators to the Behaviour Change Wheel framework to inform theory-guided knowledge translation strategies. METHODS: Following the guidance of the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group Guidance Series and the ENTREQ reporting guidelines, we systematically reviewed the reported experiences of long-term care staff on implementing evidence-based guidelines into practice. MEDLINE Pubmed, EMBASE Ovid, and CINAHL were searched from the earliest date available until May 2021. Two independent reviewers selected primary studies for inclusion if they were conducted in long-term care and reported the perspective or experiences of long-term care staff with implementing an evidence-based practice guideline about health conditions. Appraisal of the included studies was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklist and confidence in the findings with the GRADE-CERQual approach. FINDINGS: After screening 2680 abstracts, we retrieved 115 full-text articles; 33 of these articles met the inclusion criteria. Barriers included time constraints and inadequate staffing, cost and lack of resources, and lack of teamwork and organizational support. Facilitators included leadership and champions, well-designed strategies, protocols, and resources, and adequate services, resources, and time. The most frequent Behaviour Change Wheel components were physical and social opportunity and psychological capability. We concluded moderate or high confidence in all but one of our review findings. CONCLUSIONS: Future knowledge translation strategies to implement guidelines in long-term care should target physical and social opportunity and psychological capability, and include interventions such as environmental restructuring, training, and education.

Moreover, whether this effect is moderated by older adults’ age, medical conditions, and attitudes toward their own aging has not been investigated. These associations were examined by two studies. Study 1 examined the relationship between ageist attitudes and will-to-live among individuals aged 48–97, and the moderating roles of age and medical conditions on this connection. Study 2 reassessed this connection in a new sample of older adults (people aged 60–94 years) and examined the moderating role of their attitudes toward aging in this regard. In line with the hypothesis of the first study, ageist attitudes and will-to-live were negatively associated among older adults with more medical conditions. In accordance with the hypotheses of study 2, the ageist attitudes and will-to-live connection was reconstructed, and when regressed on the ageist attitudes × attitudes toward aging interaction, it remained significant only among those with increased ageist attitudes. These findings demonstrate the negative effect that ageist attitudes may have on will-to-live, especially among the very old, and particularly when their health deteriorates, and support the utility of interventions aimed at increasing their will-to-live.","Gvili, Racheli-Lital; Bodner, Ehud",Int J Environ Res Public Health,335,22

AuNPs exerted a contractile effect only in the concentration of 100 ug/ml. This contractile effect was not modified by gender. The possible mediator (+)could be nitric oxide (NO), measured in a physiological solution containing the tracheal rings treated with different concentrations of AuNPs. The results obtained in this study show that the AuNPs are bio-inert in a concentration range of 0.1−10 μg/mL; however, 100 μg/mL could trigger airway hyperresponsiveness. Similar effects were obtained in isolated trachea rings treated with 100 μg/mL HAuCl4.

Therefore, they can be used by related parties for timely and efficient response. Although significant progress has been made on event detection from tweet streams, most existing methods have not considered the posted images in tweets, which provide richer information than the text, and potentially can be a reliable indicator of whether an event occurs or not. In this paper, we design an event detection algorithm that combines textual, statistical and image information, following an unsupervised machine learning approach. Specifically, the algorithm starts with semantic and statistical analyses to obtain a list of tweet clusters, each of which corresponds to an event candidate, and then performs image analysis to separate events from non-events—a convolutional autoencoder is trained for each cluster as an anomaly detector, where a part of the images are used as the training data and the remaining images are used as the test instances. Our experiments on multiple datasets verify that when an event occurs, the mean reconstruction errors of the training and test images are much closer, compared with the case where the candidate is a non-event cluster. Based on this finding, the algorithm rejects a candidate if the difference is larger than a threshold. Experimental results over millions of tweets demonstrate that this image analysis enhanced approach can significantly increase the precision with minimum impact on the recall.","Han, Yi; Karunasekera, Shanika; Leckie, Christopher",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,335,1

A proper model needs to be established, not only to simulate the epidemic, but also to evaluate the future epidemic situation and find a pilot indicator for the outbreak. METHODS: The original susceptible-infectious-recover model is modified into the susceptible-infectious-quarantine-confirm-recover combined with social factors (SIDCRL) model, which combines the natural transmission with social factors such as external interventions and isolation. The numerical simulation method is used to imitate the change curve of the cumulative number of the confirmed cases and the number of cured patients. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the suspected close contacts (SCC) and the final outcome of the growth trend of confirmed cases with a simulation approach. RESULTS: This article selects four representative countries, that is, China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States, and gives separate numerical simulations. The simulation results of the model fit the actual situation of the epidemic development and reasonable predictions are made. In addition, it is analyzed that the increasing number of SCC contributes to the epidemic outbreak and the prediction of the United States based on the population of the SCC highlights the importance of external intervention and active prevention measures. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation of the model verifies its reliability and stresses that observable variable SCC can be taken as a pilot indicator of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Huang, Sisi; Zhu, Anding; Wang, Yan; Xu, Yancong; Li, Lu; Kong, Dexing",,335,16

Super-optimization is a technique which attempts to find the best translation of a block of code by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. This paper presents a novel approach for super-optimization of smart contracts based on Max-SMT which is split into two main phases: (i) the extraction of a stack functional specification from the basic blocks of the smart contract, which is simplified using rules that capture the semantics of the arithmetic, bit-wise, relational operations, etc. (ii) the synthesis of optimized blocks which, by means of an efficient Max-SMT encoding, finds the bytecode blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one. Our experimental results are very promising: we are able to optimize 55.41 % of the blocks, and prove that 34.28 % were already optimal, for more than 61000 blocks from the most called 2500 Ethereum contracts.","Albert, Elvira; Gordillo, Pablo; Rubio, Albert; Schett, Maria A.",Computer Aided Verification,335,16

Three examples of “commoning”—acts of managing shared resources by a group of people—reveal the importance of care and collaboration in the time of uncertainty. First, when COVID-19 posed a threat to the food supply chain, community gardens and home gardening ensured food security and enhanced mutual support. Second, the emergence of online activities of teaching, learning, and collaborating presented an opportunity of having more collective, equitable, and diverse formats of virtual communities. Lastly, volunteering in the distribution of “Healthy Packs,” I witnessed the nurture of a sense of belonging and a connection with home in the student community. These examples suggest that facing the crisis, care-driven commoning activities at the individual, everyday level lay the foundation for large-scale collaborative systems.","Zheng, Chun",Socio Ecol Pract Res,335,16

As a federal law, it remains vague with regard to municipal structure. The municipalities, as those public health units that have direct access to the living environment, play a central role in the implementation of health promotion and prevention. The evaluation by the National Prevention Conference in 2019 showed that the involvement of the municipal public health services (ÖGD) has not yet been sufficiently achieved. A major problem is the heterogeneity of ÖGD units in Germany's federal structure, about which little information is available. METHODS: In order to fully capture this heterogeneity for the first time, a systematic online screening was carried out. For this purpose, the websites of all 358 ÖGD units were screened independently of two researchers according to structural conditions. RESULTS: 70% of all municipal ÖGD units are located at district level, 18% at city district level and 12% cumulatively. Population varies from 35,000 to about 1.5 million inhabitants. The allocation of the ÖGD units to youth service planning and social welfare varies in the federal states from 18.7% to 94.4%, within regulatory agency and veterinary office from 27.8% to 79.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity makes the establishment of municipal standards difficult. Due to the diverse administrative allocation, different levels of policy-making must be considered on the way to health in all policies. The political classification reflects in roughly equal parts an ÖGD orientation towards health protection or social determinants of health, as recommended for the PrävG. A one-sided orientation towards health protection was shown by the temporary suspension of the use of financial resources for prevention in the course of the 2nd pandemic law to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. For the announced reform of the German ÖGD it is necessary to homogenize essential structural characteristics and to prevent a one-sided orientation. KEY MESSAGES: The heterogeneity of municipal health services makes it difficult to implement the German Prevention Act. In the course of the upcoming ÖGD reform, essential structural characteristics should be homogenized and a one-sided orientation of the municipal ÖGD units towards health protection should be avoided.","Arnold, L; Starke, D; Szagun, B",Eur J Public Health,335,1

Previous systematic reviews demonstrated excellent specificity of the cuff leak test but disagreed with respect to sensitivity. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff leak test for predicting post-extubation airway complications in intubated adult patients in critical care settings. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Library for eligible studies from inception to March 16, 2020, without language restrictions. We included studies that examined the diagnostic accuracy of cuff leak test if post-extubation airway obstruction after extubation or reintubation was explicitly reported as the reference standard. Two authors in duplicate and independently assessed the risk of bias using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We pooled sensitivities and specificities using generalized linear mixed model approach to bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. Our primary outcomes were post-extubation airway obstruction and reintubation. RESULTS: We included 28 studies involving 4493 extubations. Three studies were at low risk for all QUADAS-2 risk of bias domains. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of cuff leak test for post-extubation airway obstruction were 0.62 (95% CI 0.49–0.73; I(2) = 81.6%) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.82–0.90; I(2) = 97.8%), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the cuff leak test for reintubation were 0.66 (95% CI 0.46–0.81; I(2) = 48.9%) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.83–0.92; I(2) = 87.4%), respectively. Subgroup analyses suggested that the type of cuff leak test and length of intubation might be the cause of statistical heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for post-extubation airway obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: The cuff leak test has excellent specificity but moderate sensitivity for post-extubation airway obstruction. The high specificity suggests that clinicians should consider intervening in patients with a positive test, but the low sensitivity suggests that patients still need to be closely monitored post-extubation.","Kuriyama, Akira; Jackson, Jeffrey L.; Kamei, Jun",Crit Care,335,26

Our approach is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed in the COVID-19 epidemic, for the period from February 19 to April 16. Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of the epidemic. Thus, we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt or gradualexit, the latter having linear and stepwise profiles), but typically a gradual exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the gradual exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. Its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major part of the population (perhaps, minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously, but obeying rigorous distancing constraints.","Nakamura, Gilberto; Grammaticos, Basil; Badoual, Mathilde",Regul,335,1

Personal support workers (PSWs), known also as certified nursing assistants, provide the most direct formal care for persons living with dementia. However, little is known about the working conditions that enable person-centered care. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine the working conditions and the impact of those conditions on PSWs in LTC homes. PSWs (N=39) employed at one of five LTC homes in southwestern Ontario, Canada participated in a series of one-hour focus groups before, during, and after Be-EPIC, a person-centred communication training program for formal caregivers of persons living with dementia. Using an interpretive description investigative framework, textual data from focus group conversation transcripts were open-coded into categories. Overarching themes were interpreted inductively. Study credibility was enhanced through investigator triangulation. Three themes emerged related to working conditions of PSWs: dementia care is complex, lack of trained staff to provide person-centered dementia care, and residents’ families are not situated in the residents’ care circle. Four themes emerged related to the impact of current working conditions of PSWs: occupational burnout, poor resident care, frustrated and disengaged families, and PSWs leave their role. The findings offer opportunities for employers to ameliorate working conditions to support person-centered care. We conclude with specific workplace recommendations that respond to the complexity of dementia care and the associated occupational stresses PSWs experience in the current LTC environment.","Savundranayagam, Marie; Docherty-Skippen, Susan; Basque, Shalane",Innov Aging,335,1

Guidelines changed over time. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was unrestricted during phase 1, then restricted by pharmacy outside of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) during phase 2 (excepting those ineligible for RCTs). METHODS: This was a prospective study to assess system-wide adherence to COVID-19 treatment guidelines, and to evaluate patient outcomes. RESULTS: Of 261 patients, median age was 67 years (IQR 56–76); 49% (129/261) were male, and 45% (118/261) required ICU care. Overall, 47% (122/261) were in phase 1; HCQ was offered to 57% (69/122) during this phase. The rate of HCQ prescription in phase 2 decreased significantly to 10% (14/136), (p < 0.001). Adherence to COVID-19 treatment protocol was 97% (135/139) during phase 2. Mortality was similar in both phases (22% vs 28%, p=0.32), as was median length of stay (8 vs 7 days, p=0.3). Overall 66 patients (25%) died in the hospital; neither non-adherence (p=1) to system guidelines nor receipt of HCQ (p=0.17) were risk factors for death. Independent predictors of mortality included: new renal replacement therapy (OR 61, 95%CI 6.7–560, p < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (OR 4.9, 95%CI 2.0–11, p < 0.001), abnormal chest X-ray (OR 4.3, 95%CI 1.4–12.6, p =0.009), history of heart failure (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.5–11, p=0.006), lack of fever on admission (OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.7 -7.6, p =0.001), receipt of corticosteroids (OR 2.7 95%CI 1.1–6.6, p=0.026) and increased age (OR 1.07 per year, 95%CI 1.04–1.1, p < 0.001). Bacterial pneumonia occurred in 8% (21/261), more commonly in those who died (p=0.02). Black patients had a higher race-specific death rate (308 vs 197) per 1000 than white patients (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, our health system guidelines and pharmacy restrictions were successful in delivering consistent care across hospitals. Restriction of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment to RCTs reduced its use in phase two. Non-adherence to systemic guidelines was infrequent, and not associated with adverse outcomes. A COVID-19 treatment team of physicians and pharmacists can effectively coordinate therapy across hospitals in the setting of rapidly changing guidelines. DISCLOSURES: J.

Models to identify and describe biases have been proposed across various scientific fields, focusing mostly on English media. In this paper, we propose a method for analyzing media bias in German media. We test different natural language processing techniques and combinations thereof. Specifically, we combine an IDF-based component, a specially created bias lexicon, and a linguistic lexicon. We also flexibly extend our lexica by the usage of word embeddings. We evaluate the system and methods in a survey (N = 46), comparing the bias words our system detected to human annotations. So far, the best component combination results in an F[Formula: see text] score of 0.31 of words that were identified as biased by our system and our study participants. The low performance shows that the analysis of media bias is still a difficult task, but using fewer resources, we achieved the same performance on the same task than recent research on English. We summarize the next steps in improving the resources and the overall results.","Spinde, Timo; Hamborg, Felix; Gipp, Bela",ECML PKDD 2020 Workshops,335,7

The view I set out is in sharp contrast to any narrow assumption that education’s main task is the measurement of high performing individuals who will thus contribute to an economically viable society. Instead, I explore and argue for a conception of what constitutes a flourishing life that is embedded in a more pragmatist analysis of what education may be. The argument begins with developing the centrality of embodiment to aesthetic sensibility and goes on to suggest how collective understanding of this within a community could constitute a sense of performance and thus contribute to the educational aim of developing a full and flourishing life. The argument is that this way of seeing life could have implications for educational practice, the role of the teacher and could help to reconfigure how education is experienced by the young.","Doddington, Christine",Stud Philos Educ,335,1

We studied the seasonal dynamics of meroplankton in a sub-Antarctic proglacial basin (Gallegos Sound, Chile), by examining changes in the meroplankton community in relation to hydrographic variables along four sampling cruises between early winter 2010 and late winter 2011. The local meroplankton community was composed of 39 larval morphotypes distributed among 11 major taxa, being polychaetes the best represented (15 larvae morphotypes), and bivalve the most abundant. We found distinct seasonal differences in terms of meroplanktonic composition and abundance, with higher abundance and larval morphotype number during austral spring and late winter, and lower in summer and early winter. The pattern observed for meroplankton was directly related to seasonal variations of fluorescence of chlorophyll a and temperature. We found meroplankton abundances lower than those of other sub- and Polar environments. However, meroplanktonic temporal dynamics showed a common pattern for sub- and Polar fjords, suggesting a strong link between benthic spawning and the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted almost every aspect of the provision and management of cancer care worldwide. The time-critical nature of COVID-19 diagnosis and the large number of patients requiring hospitalisation necessitated the rerouting of already limited resources available for cancer services and programmes to the care of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the stringent social distancing, restricted in-hospital visits and lockdown measures instituted by various governments resulted in the disruption of the oncologic continuum including screening, diagnostic and prevention programmes, treatments and follow-up services as well as research and clinical trial programmes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched several databases from October 2020 to January 2021 for relevant studies published in English between 2020 and 2021 and reporting on the impact of COVID-19 on the cancer care continuum. This narrative review paper describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cancer patient care continuum from screening and prevention to treatments and ongoing management of patients.

Nevertheless, the oncology healthcare communities worldwide have done phenomenal work with joint and collaborative efforts, utilising best available evidence-based guidelines to continue to give safe and effective treatments for cancer patients while maintaining the safety of patients, healthcare professionals and the general population. Nevertheless, several healthcare centres are now faced with significant challenges with the management of the backlog of screening, diagnosis and treatment cases. It is imperative that governments, leaders of healthcare centres and healthcare professionals take all necessary actions and policies focused on minimising further system-level delays to cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation and clearing of all backlogs cases from the COVID-19 pandemic in order to mitigate the negative impact on cancer outcomes.","Osei, Ernest; Francis, Ruth; Mohamed, Ayan; Sheraz, Lyba; Soltani-Mayvan, Fariba",,335,24

Individual psychological pain is believed to be a contributing motivating factor. Therefore, establishing a psychometrically sound tool to adequately measure psychological pain is important. The Orbach and Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale (OMMP) has been proposed; however, previous psychometric analysis on the OMMP has not yielded a consistent scale structure, and the internal consistency of the subscales has not met recommended values. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the OMMP in a diverse sample. METHODS: A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the 9-factor, 44-item OMMP was conducted on the full sample (n = 1151). Because model fit indices were not met, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on a random subset of the data (n = 576) to identify a more parsimonious structure. The EFA structure was then tested in a covariance model in the remaining subset of participants (n = 575). Multigroup invariance testing was subsequently performed to examine psychometric properties of the refined scale. RESULTS: The CFA of the original 9-factor, 44-item OMMP did not meet recommended model fit recommendations. The EFA analysis results revealed a 3-factor, 9-item scale (i.e., OMMP-9). The covariance model of the OMMP-9 indicated further refinement was necessary. Multigroup invariance testing conducted on the final 3-factor, 8-item scale (i.e., OMMP-8) across mental health diagnoses, sex, injury status, age, activity level, and athlete classification met all criteria for invariance. CONCLUSIONS: The 9-factor, 44-item OMMP does not meet recommended measurement criteria and should not be recommended for use in research and clinical practice in its current form. The refined OMMP-8 may be a more viable option to use; however, more research should be completed prior to adoption.

The problem is to find an optimal sequence of nodes that have to be given information so that the network is covered in least number of steps. Graph burning problem is NP-Hard for which two approximation algorithms and a few heuristics have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we propose three heuristics, namely, Backbone Based Greedy Heuristic (BBGH), Improved Cutting Corners Heuristic (ICCH), and Component Based Recursive Heuristic (CBRH). These are mainly based on Eigenvector centrality measure. BBGH finds a backbone of the network and picks vertex to be burned greedily from the vertices of the backbone. ICCH is a shortest path based heuristic and picks vertex to burn greedily from best central nodes. The burning number problem on disconnected graphs is harder than on the connected graphs. For example, burning number problem is easy on a path where as it is NP-Hard on disjoint paths. In practice, large networks are generally disconnected and moreover even if the input graph is connected, during the burning process the graph among the unburned vertices may be disconnected. For disconnected graphs, ordering the components is crucial. Our CBRH works well on disconnected graphs as it prioritizes the components. All the heuristics have been implemented and tested on several bench-mark networks including large networks of size more than 50K nodes. The experimentation also includes comparison to the approximation algorithms. The advantages of our algorithms are that they are much simpler to implement and also several orders faster than the heuristics proposed in the literature.","Gautam, Rahul Kumar; Kare, Anjeneya Swami; S., Durga Bhavani",Appl Intell,335,10

We developed a new educational timetable to maintain an ethos of education safely; focusing on providing an opportunity to develop non-technical skills and maintain reflective practice. METHOD: Microsoft Teams was used in our department with two separate streams of weekly education; journal club with focus on developing critical evaluation skills, and a case based in depth discussion forum to develop presentation skills and evidence based management. A questionnaire was sent out after 10 weeks to evaluate the effectiveness and engagement. RESULTS: From 53 responses, 72% felt that their engagement in teaching increased with a virtual platform with an overall satisfaction of 88%. Reflective practice increased and 40% felt their non-technical skills improved. Overall, 68% preferred to continue learning virtually and 88% would recommend this to their peers. 92% felt that the platform played a pivotal role in helping maintain team morale during this period. CONCLUSIONS: There has been good engagement with positive reflection and learning at a time of great change in the NHS benefiting training and non-training doctors.

METHOD: 4 groups of patients were chosen based on type of surgery. A telephone survey was conducted, including questions on diagnosis, symptom duration, pain severity, co-morbidities, anxiety levels for COVID-19 and surgery. Patients were given the conditions for surgery and asked whether they would undergo surgery, have the operation carried out by another consultant and any factors that would increase their confidence. RESULTS: Of 200 patients, 156 participated (78%). 78.2% were willing to undergo surgery. There was a statistically significant difference in willingness between age groups 40-49 (100%) and 80 + (58.3%). Differences in willingness between surgery types, BOA risk class, sex, symptom duration and pain scores, were not statistically significant. Patients unwilling to undergo surgery reported statistically higher anxiety scores for health (4.39) and surgery (4.62) compared to the willing group (2.89 and 2.71 respectively). Patients’ main concern was contracting COVID (35.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the majority of patients were willing to undergo surgery. This can be used to inform strategies for resuming elective surgeries. It has also highlighted several areas in patient perception that warrant further investigation and the importance of enhanced consent on the specific risks.","Erotocritou, M; Prasad, A; Burns, S; Haddo, O; Bartlett, W; Mavroveli, S; Hanna, S; Berber, O",Br J Surg,335,1

However, there is a dearth of published information about its predictive effect for survival in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of serum hepcidin-25 with the risk of mortality in PD patients. Methods: Serum hepcidin-25 level was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a prospective cohort study of PD patients with stored serum samples at baseline. Multivariate linear regression model was used to determine clinical characteristics associated with serum hepcidin-25 concentration. We evaluated the relationship between serum hepcidin-25 and all-cause mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model and the relationship between hepcidin-25 and cardiovascular (CV) and infection-related deaths using competing-risks regression models. Results: In total, 513 PD patients were included in this study. The median serum hepcidin-25 level was 40.9 (17.9–85.9) ng/mL. Body mass index and serum ferritin were positively correlated with serum hepcidin-25 levels. During a median follow-up period of 64.1 months, 122 (24%) patients died, including 61 (50%) CV deaths and 32 (26%) infection-related deaths. In multivariable analysis, patients with the highest tertile of serum hepcidin-25 had a greater risk of all-cause [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 1.14 to 3.00, P = 0.013] and infection-related mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR], 2.61; 95%CI, 1.01 to 6.76, P = 0.049) when compared with those in the second tertile. However, no significant relationship was observed between serum hepcidin-25 and CV mortality. Conclusions: Higher baseline serum hepcidin-25 level was associated with increased risk for all-cause and infection-related mortality in PD patients.","Zhong, Zhong; Luo, Dan; Luo, Ning; Li, Bin; Fu, Dongying; Fan, Li; Li, Zhijian; Chen, Wei; Mao, Haiping",Front Med (Lausanne),335,33

Within centralised governments, climate action becomes challenging. Moreover, in developing countries, development needs are usually prioritised, while climate action is viewed as an unaffordable luxury. In a centralised, middle-income country like Egypt, climate action is a challenge for all government levels. This research investigates the current state and the prospect of urban climate change governance on the subnational level in Egypt. A twofold methodology is used. First, through desk research, a comprehensive list of urban climate governance enabling factors was extracted. The list was used to assess the practices of 3 international case studies (Delhi, Durban, and Amman) and then refined and used to assess the first subnational level climate change strategy in Egypt. Second, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a few selected experts working on climate change and urban policies in Egypt. Two sets of recommendations were formulated to expedite urban climate change governance in Egypt, especially on the subnational and local levels. While the research focuses on Egypt, the methodology and recommendations could be adopted and adapted by local governments functioning within centralised systems.","Eissa, Yara; Khalil, Heba Allah Essam E.",Urban Forum,335,16

AIM To assess risk factors for thiopurine-induced leukopenia in IBD. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Cochrane library were searched for studies reporting at least one risk factor for thiopurine-induced leukopenia. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated for each potential risk factor using a random effects model. Studies that were not eligible for meta-analysis were described qualitatively. RESULTS Seventy articles were included, 34 (11 229 patients) were included in meta-analyses. A significantly higher thiopurine-induced leukopenia risk was found for TPMT (OR 3.9, 95% [CI] 2.5-6.1) and for NUDT15 R139C (OR 6.9, 95% CI 5.2-9.1), G52A (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-7.9) and 36_37ins/delGGAGTC variant carriers (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.8-11.4). A potential association between high 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) or 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) levels and leukopenia was observed, since most studies reported higher metabolite levels in leukopenic patients (6-TGN: 204-308 (Lennard method) and 397 (Dervieux method), 6-MMP: 4020-10 450 pmol/8 x 108 RBC) compared to controls (6-TGN: 170-212 (Lennard method) and 269 (Dervieux method), 6-MMP: 1025-4550 pmol/8 x 108 RBC). CONCLUSIONS TPMT and NUDT15 variants predict thiopurine-induced leukopenia. High 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels might induce leukopenia, although exact cut-off values remain unclear. Potential preventive measures to reduce the risk of thiopurine-induced leukopenia include pre-treatment TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping. Routine thiopurine metabolite measurement might be efficient, yet cut-off levels must be validated in advance.","van Gennep, Sara; Konté, Kadère; Meijer, Berrie; Heymans, Martijn W; D'Haens, Geert R; Löwenberg, Mark; de Boer, Nanne K H",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,335,31

Currently, there are seven human coronaviruses have been identified and known to cause upper and lower respiratory infections as well as nosocomial viral infections in human. The bats, palm civets and camels are identified as the reservoir of human coronaviruses. In 2002-2003, the emergence of SARS-CoV resulted in an outbreak and led towards the more awareness and importance of scientific research and medical urgency. METHODS The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 was identified from the seafood market of the city Wuhan, China in December 2019 and caused a global pandemic. This virus has now spread to more than 213 countries. This is the third highly pathogenic human coronavirus after SARS and MERS-CoV. The coronaviruses have RNA as genetic material and known to have frequent recombination and mutations in their genome which led to the emergence and re-emergence of new virus strains and isolates with novel properties and their extended hosts.The genetic mutations and suitable environmental conditions result in emergence and re-emergence of a pathogenic coronaviruses and pose a serious issue for human health and economy globally. Lectins are the ubiquitous group of proteins which binds to glycosylated molecules. CONCLUSION The plant lectins are known to have significant antiviral activities against coronaviruses. Additionally, the plant lectins can be used as potential therapeutics against bacteria, fungus, yeast and protozoa.

Cardiovascular abnormalities reported after ICH include electrocardiographic abnormalities (56% to 81%) in form of prolonged QT interval (19% to 67%), and ST-T changes (19% to 41%), elevation in cardiac troponin (>0.04 ng/mL), and beta-natriuretic peptide (BNP) (>156.6 pg/mL, up to 78%), echocardiographic abnormalities in form of regional wall motion abnormalities (14%) and reduced ejection fraction. Location and volume of ICH affect the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities. Prolonged QT interval, elevated troponin-I, and BNP associated with increased in-hospital mortality after ICH. Blood pressure control after ICH aims to preserve cerebral perfusion pressure and maintain systolic blood pressure between 140 and 179 mm Hg, and avoid intensive blood pressure reduction (110 to 140 mm Hg). The recipients of ICH donor hearts especially those with reduced ejection fraction experience increased early mortality and graft rejection. CONCLUSIONS Various cardiovascular abnormalities are common after spontaneous ICH. The workup of patients with spontaneous ICH should involve 12-lead ECG, cardiac troponin-I, as well as BNP, and echocardiogram to evaluate for heart failure. Blood pressure control with preservation of cerebral perfusion pressure is a cornerstone of hemodynamic management after ICH. The perioperative implications of hemodynamic perturbations after ICH warrant urgent further examination.","Lele, Abhijit; Lakireddy, Viharika; Gorbachov, Sergii; Chaikittisilpa, Nophanan; Krishnamoorthy, Vijay; Vavilala, Monica S",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,335,26

Baseline parameters of potential subjects such as HbA1c, blood pressure, Advanced Glycation Endproduct (AGE), soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE), Nε-Carboxymethyllysine (Nε-CML), and Cystatin C were assessed for possible correlation with diabetic nephropathy. Only subjects with diabetic nephropathy or urine microalbuminuria-positive defined as Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (UACR) >10 mg/mmol were recruited into a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The intervention group (n = 22) received Tocovid 200 mg twice a day while the control group (n = 23) received placebo twice a day for 8 weeks. Changes in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, serum biomarkers and renal parameters such as UACR, serum creatinine, and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) were compared between the two groups. It was found that serum Nε-CML significantly correlated to the severity of microalbuminuria. For every 1 ng/mL increase in serum Nε-CML, the odds of diabetic nephropathy increased by 1.476 times. Tocovid, compared to placebo, significantly reduced serum creatinine but not eGFR, UACR, HbA1c, blood pressure, and serum biomarkers. In conclusion, serum Nε-CML is a potential biomarker for diabetic nephropathy. Treatment with Tocovid significantly reduced serum creatinine; therefore Tocovid may be a useful addition to the current treatment for diabetic nephropathy.","Tan, Suzanne May Quinn; Chiew, Yilynn; Ahmad, Badariah; Kadir, Khalid Abdul",Nutrients,335,20

Effective diagnosis of viral respiratory infections, as well as recognition and understanding of the benefits and limitations of diagnostic laboratory testing, is essential. Serology is not useful for diagnosing acute respiratory illness. Antigen-based assays are widely available, easy to use, provide rapid results, and are inexpensive; however, they are less sensitive than cell culture utilizing good specimen collection and processing techniques. Cell culture, which was previously considered the gold standard for identification of respiratory viruses, in many settings is being replaced by nucleic acid amplification assays that have even greater sensitivity and provide more rapid results. Although available chiefly at large hospitals and reference laboratories, molecular assays may fulfill the need for more sensitive and rapid diagnosis of illnesses caused by respiratory viruses. The seasonality of RSV as measured by nucleic acid amplification-based assays appears to be broader with better identification of patient populations that harbor RSV between yearly epidemic peaks compared with the seasonality of RSV as measured by the older techniques. As these new diagnostic methodologies emerge, guidelines will be needed to direct their appropriate use in the diagnostic laboratory.","Henrickson, Kelly J; Hall, Caroline Breese",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,335,1

It formed during the 900-500-Ma interval. The Saharides involved large subduction accretion complexes occupying almost the entire Arabian Shield and much of Egypt and parts of the small Precambrian inliers in the Sahara including the Ahaggar mountains. These complexes consist of, at least by half, juvenile material forming some 5 million km2 new continental crust. Contrary to conventional wisdom in the areas they occupy, evolution of the Saharides involved no continental collisions until the end of their development. They formed by subduction and strike-slip stacking of arc material mostly by precollisional coastwise transport of arc fragments rifted from the Congo/Tanzania cratonic nucleus in a manner very similar to the development of the Nipponides in east Asia, parts of the North American Cordillera and the Altaids. The Sahara appears to be underlain by a double orocline similar to the Hercynian double orocline in western Europe and northwestern Africa and not by an hypothetical ""Saharan Metacraton.""

Brucellosis is one of the world's most overlooked zoonotic diseases, and humans can easily acquire brucellosis from animals and their products. Reemerging brucellosis outbreaks are probably attributable to sociocultural factors and compounded by the lack of adequate control measures in sheep and goat rearing systems. What is added by this report? This is the first identified outbreak caused by Brucella melitensisbv.3 in Jingyang County, Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province. A total of 13 seropositve cases (7 acute patients and 6 asymptomatic persons) were identified from March to May, 2020, and the investigation indicated that sheep-to-canine-to-human was the likely transmission route. What are the implications for public health practice? Effective control of sheep brucellosis will significantly reduce the risk of human brucellosis. Priority should be given to building cooperation between all stakeholders, maintaining epidemiological surveillance to detect human brucellosis at medical centers, and making case reporting mandatory for both veterinary and public health services.","Chang, Wenhui; Sun, Yangxin; Fan, Suoping; An, Cuihong; Nie, Shoumin; Tian, Guozhong; Luo, Boyan; Yang, Hongxun; Zhai, Xiaohua; Tian, Haiying; Zhang, Jia; Jiang, Hai",China CDC weekly,335,29

Here, we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to systematically and comprehensively identify 6-month incident sequalae including diagnoses, medication use, and laboratory abnormalities in 30-day survivors of COVID-19. We show that beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with COVID-19 exhibit higher risk of death and health resource utilization. Our high dimensional approach identifies incident sequalae in the respiratory system and several others including nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia. We show increased incident use of several therapeutics including pain medications (opioids and non-opioids), antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihypertensives, and oral hypoglycemics and evidence of laboratory abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Analysis of an array of pre-specified outcomes reveals a risk gradient that increased across severity of the acute COVID-19 infection (non-hospitalized, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care). The findings show that beyond the acute illness, substantial burden of health loss - spanning pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organ systems - is experienced by COVID-19 survivors.

However, due to its hemorrhagic complications, it constitutes an important clinical problem. Treatment modalities available include endovascular, surgery and radiosurgery. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment of BAVM with Onyx® by reporting one-center experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2006 and 2013, 54 patients with BAVM were embolized with Onyx. The group consisted of 24 males and 30 females, aged 10 to 65 years (mean 42.6±15.4). Clinical manifestations of BAVMs were: hemorrhage in 27 (50.0%), headaches in 12 (22.2%), seizures in 7 (13.0%) and focal neurologic deficits in 2 (3.7%) patients. Six (11.1%) patients were asymptomatic. A majority of BAVMs were of II and III grade in Spetzler-Martin scale (19 and 22 cases respectively). RESULTS A total number of 108 endovascular procedures were performed (mean 2.00±0.98 sessions/patient). Complete obliteration of malformation was achieved in 25 (46.3%) patients, mostly with grade II and III BAVMs. In 29 (53.7%) patients, embolization led to a decrease in size of BAVM that made it feasible for other treatment modality. Morbidity and mortality rates were 5.6% and 1.8% respectively. The rate of hemorrhagic complications was 9.3%. CONCLUSION Embolization of BAVM with Onyx® is an effective and safe method of treatment.

These polymers offer the possibility to develop nanostructured antigen carriers that can be easily internalized by antigen presenting cells, due to their nanometric size. Besides, the incorporation of an adjuvant allows increasing and modulating the immune response for both, polymers with or without self-adjuvant properties. AREAS COVERED The historical background and the state-of-the-art in the use of polymers as antigen carriers are addressed in the first part of this review. Then, an overview of the immunology of vaccination is provided. Finally, the main advances in the field, based on the prototypes that are licensed or undergoing clinical trials, but also the challenges that limit the translation of many polymer-based nanostructure vaccines with promising preclinical results, are discussed. EXPERT OPINION Polymeric nanostructured-vaccines have a great potential in modern vaccinology. However, the translation into the market is hampered due to several limitations. Studies on correlates of protection to provide suitable biomarkers, new and better methods of synthesis to produce more reproducible nanovaccines, a deeper knowledge in the immune system and in the physiopathology of the infectious diseases will surely improve and boost the field in the next years.","Simón-Vázquez, Rosana; Peleteiro, Mercedes; González-Fernández, África",Expert opinion on drug delivery,335,1

Predominantly, student-led health interventions were free clinics servicing socially disadvantaged communities in the USA. A 2015 systematic review identified that students value these student-run clinics and reported skill and knowledge attainment from participating. Previous research has reported on patient satisfaction outcomes, but less frequently about the clinical outcomes patients accrue from these student-delivered services. As cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, this review aimed to explore the effectiveness of student-led health interventions through examining their impact on objective clinical outcomes, using the case of patients at risk of, or with, cardiovascular disease. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in eight electronic databases to identify student-led health interventions conducted on adults with a cardiovascular disease risk factor or established cardiovascular disease, and a clinical outcome of interest. Through double-blinded screening and data extraction, sixteen studies were identified for synthesis. RESULTS The majority of student-led health interventions for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease demonstrated a positive impact on patient health. Statistically significant changes amongst patients at risk of cardiovascular disease appeared to be associated with student-led individualised intervention or group-based interventions amongst patients with diabetes or those who are overweight or obese. The evidence was of moderate quality, as included studies lacked a control group for comparison and detail to enable the intervention to be replicated. CONCLUSIONS Future research applying a student-led health intervention through a randomised control trial, with rigorous reporting of both student and patient interventions and outcomes, are required to further understand the effectiveness of this alternative service delivery model.","Suen, Jenni; Attrill, Stacie; Thomas, Jolene M; Smale, Matilda; Delaney, Christopher L; Miller, Michelle D",BMC cardiovascular disorders,335,19

The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a management tool for continuous improvement of a business's products or processes. It can be applied to standardize nursing management and thus improve the nursing quality and increase the survival rate of patients. This study assessed the value of the PDCA cycle in standardizing nursing management in an intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The status quo of the ICU was analyzed, and the relevant issues and countermeasures were proposed. The PDCA cycle was applied to standardize the nursing management in the ICU. RESULTS Nine measures were proposed and applied to improve the management of the COVID-19 ICU: defining the clean or contaminated areas, use of self-designed shoe storage cabinets, defining staff roles and responsibilities, establishing the staffing structure, staff training, placing items at fixed locations, improving shift handover, use of bulletin boards for listing key points, and use of reserved drugs cabinets. The virus contamination awareness, professional skills, awareness of duties and responsibilities, and quality and performance of nursing were remarkably improved 2 weeks after the implementation of the above countermeasures. CONCLUSIONS The PDCA cycle helps to standardize nursing management in COVID-19 ICU by developing and applying effective nursing management approaches.","Chen, Yihong; Zheng, Jili; Wu, Dingyun; Zhang, Yuxia; Lin, Ying",Annals of palliative medicine,335,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective single centre study. All patients with advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer treated with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) or modified early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) were included in the study. RESULTS In the period 1995-2014, 116 patients were treated, 55 with primary EOC and 61 with recurrent EOC. The mean age was 59 years (26-74). Statistically, median survival time was significantly longer in the group with primary advanced cancer of the ovary (41.3 months) compared to relapsed ovarian cancer (27.3 months). Survival for the primary EOC was 65 and 24% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Survival for recurrent EOC was 33 and 16% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Mortality was 1/116 (0.8%). Morbidity was 11/116 (9.5%). Peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was ≤20 in 59 (51%) patients and statistically, their average survival was significantly longer than in the group of 57 (49%) patients with PCI >20 (p = 0.014).

This has been associated with an increased proportion of patients referred with functional cognitive disorder (FCD), that is, non-progressive cognitive complaints. These patients are likely to benefit from a range of interventions (eg, psychotherapy) distinct from the requirements of patients with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders. We have developed a fully automated system, 'CognoSpeak', which enables risk stratification at the primary-secondary care interface and ongoing monitoring of patients with memory concerns. METHODS We recruited 15 participants to each of four groups: Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), FCD and healthy controls. Participants responded to 12 questions posed by a computer-presented talking head. Automatic analysis of the audio and speech data involved speaker segmentation, automatic speech recognition and machine learning classification. RESULTS CognoSpeak could distinguish between participants in the AD or MCI groups and those in the FCD or healthy control groups with a sensitivity of 86.7%. Patients with MCI were identified with a sensitivity of 80%. DISCUSSION Our fully automated system achieved levels of accuracy comparable to currently available, manually administered assessments. Greater accuracy should be achievable through further system training with a greater number of users, the inclusion of verbal fluency tasks and repeat assessments. The current data supports CognoSpeak's promise as a screening and monitoring tool for patients with MCI. Pending confirmation of these findings, it may allow clinicians to offer patients at low risk of dementia earlier reassurance and relieve pressures on specialist memory services.","O'Malley, Ronan Peter Daniel; Mirheidari, Bahman; Harkness, Kirsty; Reuber, Markus; Venneri, Annalena; Walker, Traci; Christensen, Heidi; Blackburn, Dan","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",335,19

It analyzes perceptions and experiences central in vaccination decisions. METHODS The analysis is based on 38 in-depth interviews with Finnish parents who have refused all or several vaccines for their children. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS Three categories of reasons were identified in the analysis: 1) risks and effects of vaccination - concern about and/or experiences of possible side-effects was the most important reason for avoiding vaccines; 2) distrust - participants did not trust vaccination recommendations made by health officials and medical professionals due to perceived bias in medical research, ties between health officials and the pharmaceutical industry, and personal experiences of (suspected) adverse effects and the way these concerns were received in healthcare institutions; 3) health perceptions and practices - parents supported their vaccination choices with complementary and alternative medicine treatments and alternative health understandings. Many stated that contracting vaccine-preventable illnesses would provide longer lasting and more 'natural' immunity than vaccination, and possibly other health benefits. CONCLUSIONS A loss of trust in medical and public health actors was central to the process in which parents came to question, contest, and eventually refuse childhood vaccination. The adverse effects of the Pandemrix vaccine in 2009-2010 have been important in leading to distrust and contestation. Distrust may relate to personal experiences of (suspected) adverse effects or to broader concerns over the neutrality of health authorities and the trustworthiness of medical research.","Nurmi, Johanna; Harman, Bronwyn",Scandinavian journal of public health,335,1

(18)F-FDG PET has proven to be a sensitive technique in the imaging of sarcoidosis. The aim of this study was to determine sensitivity of (18)F-FDG PET, genotype-corrected ACE and sIL-2R in active sarcoidosis as well as their correlation. METHODS This retrospective study included 36 newly diagnosed, symptomatic sarcoidosis patients. ACE and sIL-2R levels were simultaneously obtained within 4 weeks of (18)F-FDG PET. ACE was corrected for genotype and expressed as Z-score. (18)F-FDG PET was visually evaluated and scored as positive or negative. Maximum and average standardized uptake values (SUV(max) and SUV(avg)) were compared with ACE and sIL-2R. RESULTS (18)F-FDG PET was found positive in 34 of 36 patients (94%). Thirteen patients (36%) showed an increased ACE with the highest sensitivity found in patients with the I/I genotype (67%). Seventeen patients (47%) showed an increased sIL-2R. No correlation was found between SUV and ACE or sIL-2R. Increased ACE and sIL-2R correlated with a positive (18)F-FDG PET in 12 patients (92%) and 16 patients (94%), respectively. CONCLUSION (18)F-FDG PET is a very sensitive technique to assess active sarcoidosis, in contrast with ACE and sIL-2R, suggesting a pivotal role for (18)F-FDG PET in future sarcoidosis assessment.","Keijsers, Ruth G; Verzijlbergen, Fred J; Oyen, Wim J; van den Bosch, Jules M; Ruven, Henk J; van Velzen-Blad, Heleen; Grutters, Jan C",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,335,23

We sought to compare conscious sedation and general anesthesia for flow diverter placement in a matched cohort study. METHODS Patients who underwent flow diverter placement under conscious sedation were matched on the basis of age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, aneurysm location, and aneurysm size to patients who received general anesthesia. RESULTS Seventy patients undergoing flow diverter placement under conscious sedation were matched to 70 patients using general anesthesia. There were no statistically significant differences in gender, age, pretreatment modified Rankin Scale scores, or American Society of Anesthesiologists class. Aneurysms were located primarily in the internal carotid artery (87.1%) and posterior circulation (11.4%). Maximal aneurysm diameter and history of aneurysm rupture did not differ between the 2 groups. Duration of flow diverter placement was significantly longer in the general anesthesia group. The number of flow diverters placed was also higher in the general anesthesia group. Complete occlusion was achieved in 75% of aneurysms treated under conscious sedation and 82.4% under general anesthesia. Good functional outcome at last follow-up was recorded in 97.1% of cases of conscious sedation and 96.8% of cases of general anesthesia. The rate of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic neurologic complications was comparable between both groups. CONCLUSIONS Placement of a flow diverter can be safely performed under conscious sedation and is associated with reduced procedure length. The ideal candidate is cooperative, requires an intervention that is not too complex, and has an experienced operator performing the intervention.","Griessenauer, Christoph J; Shallwani, Hussain; Adeeb, Nimer; Gupta, Raghav; Rangel-Castilla, Leonardo; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Boone, Myles D; Thomas, Ajith J; Ogilvy, Christopher S",World neurosurgery,335,19

Intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation in these patients may cause hemodilution and secondary hemorrhage. In addition, hypothermia may interfere with coagulation. The purposes of this study were to compare the effectiveness QuikClot Combat Gauze (QCG) to a control group on hemorrhage in a hemodiluted, hypothermic model, and to determine the effects of IV volume resuscitation on rebleeding. This was a prospective, between subjects, experimental design. Yorkshire swine were randomly assigned to two groups: QCG (n = 13) or control (n = 13). The subjects were anesthetized. Hypothermia (temperature of ≤34.0 °C) was induced; 30% of their blood volume was exsanguinated. A 3:1 replacement of Lactated Ringer's was administered to dilute the remaining blood. The femoral artery and vein were transected. After 1 min of uncontrolled hemorrhage, QCG was placed into the wound followed by standard wound packing. The control group underwent the same procedures without QCG. After 5 min of manual pressure, a pressure dressing was applied. Following 30 min, the dressings were removed, and blood loss was calculated. For subjects achieving hemostasis, up to 5 L of IV fluid was administered or until bleeding occurred, which was defined as >2% total blood volume.

In this study, bioassay-guided isolation of the endophytic fungus Acremonium vitellinum yielded four anthraquinone derivatives (compounds 1-4), including a previously undescribed dimethylated derivative of bipolarin, 6,8-di-O-methylbipolarin (1). Their structures were determined by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance analysis as well as high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry data, and the absolute configuration of 1 was established by comparing the calculated and experimental electronic circular dichroism spectra. The insecticidal activity of the isolated compounds against the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera was evaluated. The new compound 1 showed the strongest larvicidal activity against the 3rd instar larvae of H. armigera with an LC50 value of 0.72 mg/mL. In addition, transcriptome sequencing was performed to evaluate the molecular mechanism of the insecticidal activity. In total, 5732 differentially expressed genes were found, among which 2904 downregulated genes and 2828 upregulated genes were mainly involved in cell autophagy, apoptosis, and DNA mismatch repair and replication. The results presented in this study reveal how 1 exerts its insecticidal effects against H. armigera via genome-wide differential gene expression analyses. Our findings suggest that anthraquinone derivatives are potential biopesticides for cotton bollworm control.","Yuan, Xiao-Long; Wang, Xiu-Fang; Xu, Kuo; Li, Wei; Chen, Dan; Zhang, Peng",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,335,7

What has now become apparent is that a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 is abnormal thrombosis. This thrombosis occurs on a macro- and microvascular level and is unique to this disease. The virus has been demonstrated in the endothelium of the pulmonary alveoli and as such is thought to contribute to the devastating respiratory complications encountered. D-dimer concentrations are frequently raised in COVID to levels not frequently seen previously. The optimal anticoagulation treatment in COVID remains to be determined, and the myriad of pathophysiologic effects caused by this virus in the human host have also yet to be fully elucidated.","Louw, S; Jacobson, B F; Mayne, E S; Wiggill, T M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,335,30

One study concerned repetitions at one temperature, the other concerned isothermal experiments at various temperatures. Multilevel models characterize variation at various levels and handle dependencies in the data. The Weibull model was applied using Bayesian regression. The research question was how parameters varied with experimental conditions and how data can best be analyzed: no pooling (each experiment analyzed separately), complete pooling (all data analyzed together) or partial pooling (connecting the experiments while allowing for variation between experiments). In the first case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions. While variation in the initial number parameter was low (set by the researchers), the Weibull shape factor varied for each repetition from 0.58-1.44, and the rate parameter from 0.006-0.074 h. With partial pooling variation was much less, with complete pooling variation was strongly underestimated. In the second case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions per temperature experiment, level 3 of the cluster of various temperature experiments. The research question was how temperature affected the Weibull parameters. Variation in initial numbers was low (set by the researchers), the rate parameter was obviously affected by temperature, the estimate of the shape parameter depended on how the data were analyzed. With partial pooling, and one-step global modeling with a Bigelow-type model for the rate parameter, shape parameter variation was minimal. Model comparison based on prediction capacity of the various models was explored. The probability distribution of calculated decimal reduction times was much narrower using multilevel global modeling compared to the usual single level two-step approach. Multilevel modeling of microbial heat inactivation appears to be a suitable and powerful method to characterize and quantify variation at various levels. It handles possible dependencies in the data, and yields unbiased parameter estimates. The answer on the question ""to pool or not to pool"" depends on the goal of modeling, but if the goal is prediction, then partial pooling using multilevel modeling is the answer, provided that the experimental data allow that.","van Boekel, M A J S",International journal of food microbiology,335,1

Clearness index (K t) was used for characterizing the sky conditions and model development; it was discovered that daily PAR/G (F p) generally increased from 1.79 ± 0.016 mol MJ(-1) in November to 1.95 ± 0.004 mol MJ(-1) in July with annual average being about 1.89 mol MJ(-1); F p generally decreased with sky conditions changing from overcast skies to clear skies in each month. Meanwhile, an efficient all-sky PAR model under any sky conditions has been proposed by investigating the dependence of hourly PAR on K t and cosine of solar zenith angle μ. The model was assessed through the statistical indices: mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) whose values were only -0.34% (-1.75%), 3.62% (3.47%), and 5.52% (4.79 %), respectively, at hourly (daily) basis. The model has also been tested at three other four sites with distinctly different climates in China. Finally, PAR values during 1961-2012 in Northwest China were reconstructed and annual mean daily PAR was 29.25 mol m(-2) d(-1). PAR decreased at 0.18 mol m(-2) d(-1) per decade during 1961-2012, and the decreases were sharpest in spring (0.63 mol m(-2) d(-1) per decade).

Using the probabilistic tool, impact of individual ILs to a group of aquatic species is assessed by chemical toxicity distributions (CTDs). The impact of group of ILs to individual aquatic species is assessed by species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Acute toxicity data of imidazolium ILs with chloride (Cl-), bromide (Br-), tetrafluoroborate (BF4-), and hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) anions are used in CTD and SSD. Allowable concentrations for a group of Imidazolium ILs with the same mode of action (SMOA) to five aquatic species; Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri, Algae, Zebrafish, and Escherichia coli are estimated by CTDs.

Although effective in many cases, as high doses of CDDP cause cytotoxic effects that may worsen patients' condition, therefore, a marker of sensitivity to CDDP is necessary to enhance the safety and efficiency of CDDP administration. This study focused on adipose most abundant 2 (APM2) to examine its potential as a marker of CDDP sensitivity. The relationship of APM2 expression with the mechanisms of CDDP resistance was examined in vitro and in vivo using hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, tissues and serum of HCC patients (n = 71) treated initially with intrahepatic arterial infusion of CDDP followed by surgical resection. The predictability of serum APM2 for CDDP sensitivity was assessed in additional 54 HCC patients and 14 gastric cancer (GC) patients. APM2 expression in CDDP-resistant HCC was significantly higher both in serum and the tissue. Bioinformatic analyses and histological analyses demonstrated upregulation of ERCC6L (DNA excision repair protein ERCC6-like) by APM2, which accounts for the degree of APM2 expression. The serum APM2 level and chemosensitivity for CDDP were assessed and cut-off value of serum APM2 for predicting the sensitivity to CDDP was determined to be 18.7 µg/mL. The value was assessed in HCC (n = 54) and GC (n = 14) patients for its predictability of CDDP sensitivity, resulted in predictive value of 77.3% and 100%, respectively.

However, this disease is still orphaned in the country; large-scale control actions are rare, and little is known about its management. OBJECTIVE To assess current practices in the management of SCD in Kisangani, DRC. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in six health facilities in Kisangani. It involved 198 presumed sickle cell patients attending the above health facilities. The study focused on the sociodemographic and clinical data of the participants, obtained through a clinical examination and their medical records. Diagnostic confirmation of SCD was made by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0. RESULTS The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed in 194 (98.0%; 95% CI: 94.9-99.2) participants, while it was not confirmed in 4 (2.0%; 95% CI: 0.8-5.1) participants. The diagnosis was mainly made by the Emmel test (42.9%). 45.8% of participants had previously been transfused with the blood of their parents. Folic acid was taken by 48.5% of participants and the previous intake of hydroxyurea was reported in 5.1% of participants. The participants vaccinated against Pneumococcus were 13.6% and against Haemophilus influenzae type b 28.3%. Penicillin prophylaxis was received by only 1.5% and malaria prophylaxis by 11.6% of participants. CONCLUSION Standard-care practices for SCD patients in Kisangani are insufficient.

Increasing incidence of PML in patients receiving immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic agents creates a pressing clinical need to define biomarkers to stratify PML risk and develop anti-JCPyV interventions. Mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) CNS infection causes encephalopathology and may provide insight into JCPyV-PML pathogenesis. Type I, II, and III interferons (IFN), which all signal via the STAT1 transcription factor, mediate innate and adaptive immune defense against a variety of viral infections. We previously reported that type I and II IFNs control MuPyV infection in non-central nervous system (CNS) organs, but their relative contribution to MuPyV control in the brain remains unknown. To this end, mice deficient in type I, II, or III IFN receptors or STAT1 were infected intracerebrally with MuPyV. We found that STAT1, but not type I, II, or III IFNs, mediated viral control during acute and persistent MuPyV encephalitis. Mice deficient in STAT1 also developed severe hydrocephalus, blood-brain barrier permeability and increased brain-infiltration by myeloid cells. CD8 T cell-deficiency alone did not increase MuPyV infection and pathology in the brain. In the absence of STAT1 signaling, however, depletion of CD8 T cells resulted in lytic infection of the choroid plexus and ependymal lining, marked meningitis, and 100% mortality within two weeks post-infection. Collectively, these findings indicate that STAT1 signaling and CD8 T cells co-contribute to controlling MuPyV infection in the brain and CNS injury.IMPORTANCE A comprehensive understanding of JCPyV-induced PML pathogenesis is needed to define determinants that predispose patients to PML, a goal whose urgency is heightened by the lack of anti-JCPyV agents. A handicap to achieving this goal is the lack of a tractable animal model to study PML-pathogenesis. Using intracerebral inoculation with MuPyV, we found that MuPyV encephalitis in wild type mice causes an encephalopathy, which is markedly exacerbated in mice deficient in STAT1, a molecule involved in transducing signals from type I, II, and III IFN receptors. CD8 T cell deficiency compounded the severity of MuPyV neuropathology and resulted in dramatically elevated virus levels in the CNS. These findings demonstrate that STAT1 signaling and CD8 T cells concomitantly act to mitigate MuPyV-encephalopathy and control viral infection.","Mockus, Taryn E; Netherby-Winslow, Colleen S; Atkins, Hannah M; Lauver, Matthew D; Jin, Ge; Ren, Heather M; Lukacher, Aron E",Journal of virology,335,1

RESULTS A total of 501 tweets were reviewed. 48.5% of tweets came from private accounts, 23.1% from academic institutions, 14.4% from ASCRS accounts, 12.4% from industry and 1.6% from professional organizations. 29.1% of the tweets were shared before the conference (n=146), 60.5% during (n=303), and 10.4% after the conference (n=52). 62.9% (n=315) of tweets promoted conference events, 27.3% (n=137) were about research studies, 27.1% (n=136) were social posts, 23.0% (n=115) were from industry sponsors, 4.4% (n=22) of tweets were self-promotion, and 1.0% (n=5) were not categorized. Twitter impressions on the ASCRS account increased by 79% in 2020 compared to the 2019 annual meeting. CONCLUSIONS To the author's knowledge, this first study to describe how Twitter users engaged with a virtual ophthalmology meeting through social media during the coronavirus pandemic. Findings from this study offers insight on how the ophthalmology community can use social media during conferences and highlights opportunities for networking through social media for both virtual and in-person conferences in the future.","Fathy, Cherie; Cehelyk, Eli; Israilevich, Rachel; Deiner, Michael; Venkateswaran, Nandini; Kim, Terry",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,335,1

BACKGROUND Muscle fatigue is a known risk factor for musculoskeletal injury; however, it is unknown whether a submaximal contraction in the nondominant limb, such as for stabilizing a tool or load, affects the rate of development of fatigue, potentially increasing risk of injury. Current ergonomic assessments of injury risk do not involve consideration of submaximal contralateral demands. It was hypothesized that increased neuromuscular drive and active muscle mass during bilateral contractions would increase fatigability. METHOD Twelve males isometrically maintained a 30% unilateral contraction and a 30% dominant + 15% nondominant bilateral contraction until failure on two different collection days, separated by 7 days. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were found for time to task failure (p = .6204), decrease in maximal force (p = .1698), or alterations in electromyography amplitude (p = .7223) or frequency (p = .3292) between unilateral and bilateral conditions. CONCLUSION The hypothesis that the addition of a lesser submaximal isometric contraction would increase fatigability was rejected. APPLICATION These findings indicate that in ergonomic settings, muscle fatigability can be estimated by the more demanding task and do not need to be complicated by lesser submaximal contractions in the opposing limb.","Zwambag, Derek P; Brown, Stephen H M",Human factors,335,1

We have performed exploratory analyses to study the clinical effects of blood pressure and early blood pressure-lowering treatment in patients included in a randomized-controlled trial of thrombolytic treatment for acute ischemic stroke. METHODS The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) randomized 3035 patients with ischemic stroke to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator 0.9 mg/kg or open control within 6 hours of symptom onset. Blood pressure was measured at randomization, at start of treatment, and at 30 minutes and 1 and 24 hours after start of treatment, and the use of blood pressure-lowering treatment during the first 24 hours was recorded. We have characterized blood pressure by mean systolic blood pressure at baseline, by variability of systolic blood pressure (expressed by the standard deviation and the range between the lowest and the highest pressure), and by the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 24 hours. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the associations of blood pressure characteristics or blood pressure-lowering treatment with early adverse events, early death, and functional outcome at 6 months, after adjustment for key prognostic variables. RESULTS High baseline blood pressure and high blood pressure variability during the first 24 hours were associated with higher numbers of early adverse events and early deaths, and for several analyses, the differences were statistically significant. A larger decline in blood pressure and the use of blood pressure-lowering treatment during the first 24 hours were associated with a reduced risk of poor outcome at 6 months (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.97; P=0.001 and odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.93; P=0.007, respectively), irrespective of whether the patient was given recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (P values for interaction >0.05). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with ischemic stroke who are candidates for thrombolytic treatment, high baseline blood pressure and a large pressure variability during the first 24 hours may be associated with a poor prognosis, whereas a large reduction in blood pressure and the use of blood pressure-lowering treatment during the first 24 hours may be associated with a favorable prognosis. These data support the rationale for further trials of agents that lower blood pressure or reduce blood pressure variability in the acute phase of ischemic stroke.

Endovascular treatment has become an alternative to surgical clipping and the primary method of choice. Aim To assess the treatment results of ruptured and unruptured ACoA aneurysms and to assess the incidence of intraprocedural complications and various factors influencing these aspects. Material and methods One hundred and eleven embolizations of ACoA aneurysms (80.7% ruptured and 19.3% unruptured) were retrospectively analysed. The methods of embolization were: coiling, balloon-assisted coiling, stent-assisted coiling. Morphology and dimensions of aneurysms were assessed on 3D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. Medical records were analysed for patient's clinical status at admission, intraprocedural complications, follow-up examination and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 1 month after discharge. Results Immediately after the procedure 56.9% of patients had Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) class I, 37.6% class II and 5.5% class III. The overall intraprocedural complication rate was 6.6%. There were significantly more cases of bleeding (p = 0.012) and coil prolapse (p = 0.012) during the procedures ending with higher packing density. Twenty-eight (25.7%) patients died during hospital stay, 27 (96.4%) with ruptured aneurysm. In the follow-up of 41 patients, RROC was the same or improved in 73.2% of cases and recanalization occurred in 26.8%. Six patients with aneurysm recanalization underwent repeat embolization. Conclusions Endovascular embolization of ACoA aneurysms is an effective and safe treatment method. The most powerful factor influencing the incidence of complications is packing density. Superior orientation of the dome, initial incomplete embolization and poor outcome in mRS scale are factors predisposing to ACoA aneurysm recurrence.","Brzegowy, Paweł; Kucybała, Iwona; Krupa, Kamil; Łasocha, Bartłomiej; Wilk, Aleksander; Latacz, Paweł; Urbanik, Andrzej; Popiela, Tadeusz J",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,335,19

A bioprosthetic stented conduit made with a stented Edwards Perimount 21-mm bioprosthesis and a Vascutek Valsalva 28-mm Dacron graft was implanted along with a mitral annuloplasty. Five years later, due to early degeneration of the bioprosthesis and a progression of the mitral disease, he underwent a second surgical procedure where a Medtronic Mosaic 27-mm valve prosthesis was implanted in mitral position and a sutureless Livanova Perceval 23-mm valve in aortic position. Because of the difficulty in removing the previously implanted aortic prosthesis, the Perceval valve was inserted inside the frame of the PeriMount as an open ""valve-in-valve"" procedure. In October 2020, the patient underwent a ViV TAVI with a 23-mm Edwards Sapien 3 (Edwards Lifescience). After induction of general anesthesia and heparin administration, the procedure was performed via right femoral artery approach with preimplantation of two Proglides. After transfemoral insertion of a 14-French sheath, the aortic valve was crossed with a 0.035-in. straight guide-wire, taking care to avoid crossing the crowns of Perceval frame. After exchange of the standard wire with an extra-stiff 0.035-in. Safari wire, the Sapien-3 valve was advanced across the two previously implanted surgical valves and deployed at the level of the Perceval ring. After bioprosthesis deployment, peak-to-peak left ventricular aortic gradient was reduced from 51 to 16 mmHg.","Tomai, Fabrizio; Weltert, Luca; de Persio, Giovanni; Salatino, Tiziana; de Paulis, Ruggero",Journal of cardiac surgery,335,8

Interviews focused on literacy experiences and practices. Six themes were identified through inductive qualitative analysis: child reading skills were highly valued; parents were motivated to improve on their childhood reading experiences; bilingualism was a goal for all parents; parents noted challenges in building child reading skills; reading engagement was broadly defined; and impact of cleft diagnosis was wide-reaching. Implications for intervention include a bilingual strength-based approach incorporating cleft-specific speech concerns, play, parallel online programming, behavioral strategies, and social support options. Use of telephone and online intervention with mailed materials can also help address family resource and time limitations.","Johns, Alexis; Wallace, Erin; Thach, Jenny; Ola, Cindy; Gallagher, Emily; Gutierrez, Yvonne; Collett, Brent",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,335,1

A laparoscopic modified Sugarbaker technique (SB) may decrease the recurrence of PH compared with other methods. METHODS A retrospective review, approved by the institutional review board, of patients who underwent PH repair between 2004 and 2014 was performed. Demographics, factors for ostomy formation, hernia risk factors, intraoperative and postoperative information, and recurrence data were compared among SB and other techniques. Time to recurrence was compared between SB versus other techniques with the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS Sixty-two PH repairs were performed: 39 (61%) paraileostomy and 23 (39%) paracolostomy. Repairs included 25 laparoscopic modified SB and 37 from other techniques. There was no difference in demographics. Postoperative complication rate was lesser in SB versus all other groups (40% vs 76%, P = .02). Recurrence rates were lesser for SB versus all others (16% vs 60%, P < .001). Follow-up was similar among all groups. After adjustment, SB was found to be protective of recurrences (hazard ratio = .28, 95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.82). CONCLUSION A laparoscopic modified SB technique provides decreased rates of recurrence and postoperative complications compared with other approaches.","DeAsis, Francis J; Linn, John G; Lapin, Brittany; Denham, Woody; Carbray, JoAnn M; Ujiki, Michael B",Surgery,335,1

METHODS The technique begins with adhesiolysis during laparoscopy. An annular incision is made between the skin and stomal mucosa. Then, after all adhesions of the stomal bowel and its mesentery are separated from the hernial sac, the stomal bowel is delivered through the keyhole mesh. The mesh is then stitched to the stomal bowel and placed intraperitoneally. The hernial ring is narrowed, and the mesh is further stitched to the hernial ring and stomal tube. After the mesh is fixed, the redundant stomal bowel is shortened, and a new in situ stoma is matured in the conventional way. RESULTS Altogether, 65 consecutive patients underwent successful hernia repair via a modified laparoscopic keyhole with in situ re-ostomy. Two of the patients had recurrent parastomal hernias. No mortalities occurred during the perioperative period. Morbidities included two cases of seroma and three of ileus, all of which were cured with conservative treatment. In addition, one case of intestinal perforation was rescued by intestinal resection and enteroenterostomy. Median follow-up was 29 months (range 3-60 months). No complications of mesh-related infection or patch erosion were noted during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Modified laparoscopic keyhole parastomal hernia repair with in situ re-ostomy is a safe procedure with a low recurrence rate at the mid-term follow-up.","Yan, Zhibo; Zhang, Haifeng; Zhan, Hanxiang; Wu, Dong; Cheng, Yugang; Wu, Qunzheng; Zhang, Guangyong",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,335,1

Much remains unknown about the mechanisms and targets of DPP4. Here we discuss new studies exploring DPP4-mediated cellular regulation, provide an updated list of potential targets of DPP4, and discuss clinical implications of each. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have sought enhanced efficacy of targeting DPP4's role in regulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for improved clinical application. Further studies have identified DPP4 functions in different cellular compartments and have proposed ways to target this protein in malignancy. These findings, together with an expanded list of putative extracellular, cell surface, and intracellular DPP4 targets, provide insight into new DPP4-mediated cell regulation. SUMMARY DPP4 posttranslationally modifies proteins and peptides with essential roles in hematopoietic cell regulation, stem cell transplantation, and malignancy. Targets include secreted signaling factors and may include membrane proteins and transcription factors critical for different hematopoietic functions. Knowing these targets and functions can provide insight into new regulatory roles for DPP4 that may be targeted to enhance transplantation, treat disease, and better understand different regulatory pathways of hematopoiesis.","Ropa, James; Broxmeyer, Hal E",Current opinion in hematology,335,31

The objectives of this study were the following: 1) to assess the interobserver agreement of the Meyer and Raymond scales, and 2) to evaluate and compare their performance in predicting major recurrence at follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective series of 120 coiled aneurysms was included. Four investigators independently graded DSA images immediately posttreatment and at follow-up according to the Meyer and Raymond scales. On follow-up DSA, readers also evaluated recurrence outcome. Interobserver agreement was assessed via the intraclass correlation coefficient. The ability of posttreatment Meyer and Raymond scales to predict major recurrence was modeled by using logistic regression and assessed by using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS For the Meyer scale, interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.46-0.68) on posttreatment and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72-0.83) on follow-up evaluations. For the Raymond scale, interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.50 (95% CI, 0.39-0.61) and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.62-0.76), respectively, for posttreatment and follow-up. The areas under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic analyses regarding the performance to predict major recurrence at follow-up were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79) for the Meyer and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.61-0.78) for the Raymond scale. CONCLUSIONS The Meyer scale appears consistent and reliable with observer agreement as high or higher than that of the Raymond scale.

Preclinical and clinical trials have shown promise in utilizing degradable extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds in buttressing anastomoses. We describe our experience buttressing the EJ anastomosis after TG with a ECM scaffold. METHODS From February 2012 to January 2014, a total of 37 consecutive patients underwent TG buttressing of the EJ anastomosis with the degradable ECM scaffold composed of a porcine urinary bladder called MatriStem (ACell Inc.). The scaffold was circumferentially wrapped around the EJ anastomosis. The primary end point was the EJ leak rate, while the secondary end point was the EJ stricture rate. RESULTS The mean ± SD age and body mass index were 59 ± 16 years and 28.1 ± 4.9 kg/m(2), respectively. Most patients were male (51 %), white (78 %), and former smokers (51 %). Over half (59 %) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A minimally invasive TG was performed in 70 % of patients. Signet ring was the most common tumor type (48 %), and most patients had midstage disease (59 %). The mean number of lymph nodes procured was 36 ± 16. Eighteen patients (49 %) experienced a complication, mostly minor. One patient (2.7 %) developed an EJ leak, while three patients (8 %) developed an EJ stricture. Median follow-up was 7 months (range 2-12 months). There was no operative or in-hospital mortality. DISCUSSION The use of urinary bladder matrix scaffolds may be helpful in decreasing the incidence of EJ anastomotic leak and/or stricture. A prospective phase II trial at our institution is currently under way.","Afaneh, Cheguevara; Abelson, Jonathan; Schattner, Mark; Janjigian, Yelena Y; Ilson, David; Yoon, Sam S; Strong, Vivian E",Annals of surgical oncology,335,24

This article reports methodological improvements in primary HRSV isolation and the importance of syncytia formation and mRNA levels of F protein for the progeny yield, using clinical isolates of HRSV. METHODS The A and B strains of HRSV were isolated in HEp-2 cell cultures from fresh and frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates. The formation of syncytia was evaluated using 2 different assays. Levels of F protein mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR while HRSV progeny titration was done by plaque assay. RESULTS HRSV was primarily isolated from 238 of 312 (90.7%) samples, and 13 of these (12 HRSV-A and 1 HRSV-B) were continuously passaged in vitro. The quantity and size of syncytia formed by 6 pure HRSV-A clinical isolates were different, as were the levels of F protein mRNA. CONCLUSION There is a direct correlation of quantities of syncytia and inoculum size, but not with mRNA levels of HRSV-A F protein. Importantly, levels of F protein mRNA were directly related to progeny production.","Gagliardi, Talita Bianca; Criado, Miriã Ferreira; Proença-Módena, José Luiz; Saranzo, Ariane Mirela; Iwamoto, Marisa Akiko; de Paula, Flávia Escremim; Cardoso, Ricardo Souza; Delcaro, Luana Sela; Silva, Maria Lúcia; Câmara, Ataide Ademir; Arruda, Eurico",Intervirology,335,16

In vitro studies suggested that tert-butyl-(4-hydroxy-3-((3-(2-methylpiperidin-yl)propyl)carbamoyl)phenyl) carbamate named the M4 compound can act as both β-secretase and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, preventing the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) aggregation and the formation of fibrils (fAβ) from Aβ1-42. This work first aimed to assess in in vitro studies to see whether the death of astrocyte cells promoted by Aβ1-42 could be prevented. Second, our work investigated the ability of the M4 compound to inhibit amyloidogenesis using an in vivo model after scopolamine administration. The results showed that M4 possesses a moderate protective effect in astrocytes against Aβ1-42 due to a reduction in the TNF-α and free radicals observed in cell cultures. In the in vivo studies, however, no significant effect of M4 was observed in comparison with a galantamine model employed in rats, in which case this outcome was attributed to the bioavailability of M4 in the brain of the rats.","Camarillo-López, Raúl Horacio; Hernández Rodríguez, Maricarmen; Torres-Ramos, Mónica Adriana; Arciniega-Martínez, Ivonne Maciel; García-Marín, Iohanan Daniel; Correa Basurto, José; Méndez Méndez, Juan Vicente; Rosales-Hernández, Martha Cecilia",Molecules,335,1

Different definitions for “linkage to care” have challenged comparisons as a public health marker. Its meaning in the era of “universal test and treat” has transformed in all settings, but is most relevant in sub-Sahara Africa, where the burden of new HIV infection is still highest. METHODS For this narrative review on “linkage to care” definitions with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa, we searched PubMed/Medline between September and December 2020, restricted to the period 2000–2020 using Boolean operators: “HIV” AND (“linkage to care” OR “engagement in care”) and screened for institutional definitions of “linkage to care”. Additionally, as one example of a rural sub-Saharan African setting, we analysed linkage steps within the Chronic Diseases Clinic Ifakara (CDCI) and its associated Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) in rural Tanzania between 1 January 2017 and 31 March 2019. RESULTS We analysed 81 articles that included “linkage to care” within different study settings and HIV organisations. Major differences in defining “linkage to care” exist, according to setting and location, patient populations and the timing of steps within the linkage process. We identified 16 different numerators and 10 denominators used to define linkage with time periods ranging from “same day as diagnosis” up to 12 months after diagnosis among 34 original articles from sub-Saharan Africa. At the CDCI, 1149/1671 (69%) newly diagnosed individuals were enrolled into care after diagnosis. Three months after enrolment into care, 94%, 86%, 85% and 71% of enrolled patients had a laboratory evaluation, a clinical evaluation, were initiated on treatment and had a first clinical follow-up visit after initiation of treatment, respectively. DUSCUSSION To address the inconsistency in defining “linkage to care” and in order to guarantee the comparability of “linkage to care” in the sub-Saharan Africa region, we support the definition from the European region with some adaptions. We suggest a priority list of care indicators if more than one care indicator is available for successful “linkage to care” in the era of “universal test and treat” for sub-Sahara Africa.","Magnolini, Raphael; Senkoro, Elizabeth; Vanobberghen, Fiona; Weisser, Maja",Swiss medical weekly,335,20

This study also evaluates the impact of SPECT-CT hybrid imaging on somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) interpretation and clinical management of these tumors. METHODS Fourteen patients were included in the study. All patients underwent a whole body and SPECT-CT imaging with both (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate and (111)In-pentetrotide. Images were evaluated both visually and semiquantitatively. RESULTS On patient basis, the diagnostic results of both studies were similar. The number of lesions detected by (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNICOctreotate were higher than the number of lesions detected by (111)In-pentetrotide however the difference was not significant (40/43( 93%), 36/43 (83%) p=0.109). Semiquantitative analysis showed higher tumor/organ count ratios for both whole-body and SPECT (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-Octreotate scans. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggested that, (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-Octreotate may be a better alternative to (111)In- pentetrotide due to high image quality and lower radiation dose. SPECT/CT is a valuable tool for the assessment of neuroendocrine tumors by providing the precise anatomic localization of scintigraphic findings thus improving lesion detectability and characterization.

Methods A retrospective review of the patients who underwent SPA laparoscopy (SPA Group) or laparotomy (Laparotomy Group) for suspected BOT was performed. Surgical outcomes, including the rates of iatrogenic spillage of tumor contents, and oncological outcomes, such as recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), were compared between the two groups. Correlation between intraoperative frozen section analysis and permanent pathology results was also assessed. Results A total of 178 patients underwent surgical treatment for suspected large BOT. Among them, 105 patients with a mean tumor diameter of 20.9 ± 6.5 cm underwent SPA laparoscopy, and the other 73 patients, with a mean tumor diameter 20.2 ± 5.9 cm, underwent laparotomy. The mean operation time did not differ between the two groups (99.1 ± 41.9 min for SPA Group vs. 107.3 ± 35.7 min for Laparotomy Group, p = 0.085). There was no difference in the occurrence of iatrogenic spillage of tumor contents between the groups either (11.4% in the SPA Group vs. 6.8% in the Laparotomy Group, p = 0.381). However, the postoperative complication rates were significantly higher in the Laparotomy Group compared with SPA Group (16.4% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.025). The surgical approach was not associated with the misdiagnosis rates of frozen section analysis (19% in the SPA Group vs. 26% in the Laparotomy Group, p = 0.484). The most common histologic type of the tumors was mucinous in both groups. Conclusion SPA laparoscopy is feasible, safe, and not inferior to laparotomy for surgical treatment of large ovarian tumors that suspected to be BOT on preoperative imaging.","Kang, Jun-Hyeok; Noh, Joseph J; Jeong, Soo Young; Shim, Jung In; Lee, Yoo-Young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Kim, Byoung-Gie; Bae, Duk-Soo; Kim, Hyun-Soo; Kim, Tae-Joong",Frontiers in oncology,335,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, laboratory and CMR findings of 15 patients with COVID-19 between May 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated retrospectively. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging was evaluated for myocarditis. Cardiac functions were quantitatively evaluated and compared to the control patient group. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (Hs-cTnI), C-reactive protein (CRP) exchange, and LGE were compared. RESULTS Fifteen patients (7 women; mean age = 38 years) were evaluated. Six patients were treated at home, while nine patients were treated in the hospital. The patients were given remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine treatment. LGE was detected in 2 (33%) patients treated at home and 5 (55.5%) patients treated in the hospital. In hospitalized patients, levels of Hs-cTnI (mean = 7.8 pg/mL) and CRP (mean = 32.3 mg/L) were elevated. A high correlation was observed between the increase in Hs-cTnI value and LGE (r = 0.63; P < 0.001). A low correlation was observed between an increase in CRP and LGE (r = 033; P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in ventricular functions between the COVID-19 and control groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION CMR abnormalities were found in a high percentage (46%) of patients with COVID-19. Myocardial abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 can be detected by CMR.

However, little is known about the incidence of shoulder pain among aging adults. We conducted this review to estimate the incidence of shoulder pain in ageing adults and its associated factors. Databases And Data Treatment We conducted a systematic review of cohort studies in which the incidence of shoulder pain and associated factors were explored in adults aged 40 years and over. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were consulted. RESULTS We retrieved 3332 studies and included six, of which five were prospective cohort studies and one was retrospective. For adults aged 45-64 years, the annual cumulative incidence was 2.4%. The incidence density was estimated at 17.3 per 1,000 person-years for adults in the 45-64 years age group, at 12.8 per 1000 person-years for those in the 65-74 years group and at 6.7 per 1000 person-years among those aged 75 years and over. Occupational factors, notably physical demands of work, were associated with the incidence of shoulder pain. Non-occupational factors were also linked to the occurrence of shoulder pain. CONCLUSION Few studies have estimated the incidence of shoulder pain and associated factors among ageing adults. From this systematic review, we conclude that studies on the incidence of shoulder pain are scarce, and that both occupational and non-occupational factors could be associated with the onset of shoulder pain among adults 40 years and over. This very limited evidence calls for more studies on this topic.","Djade, C D; Porgo, T V; Vignon Zomahoun, H T; Perrault-Sullivan, G; Dionne, C E",European journal of pain,335,1

METHODS Clinical and angiographic follow-up results were recorded for patients from 5 participating institutions. Primary end points were stroke or death within 30 days of the stenting procedure or ipsilateral stroke after 30 days. RESULTS During a 21-month study period, 158 patients with 168 intracranial atherostenotic lesions (50% to 99%) were treated with the Gateway-Wingspan system. The average follow-up duration was 14.2 months with 143 patients having at least 3 months of clinical follow-up and 110 having at least 12 months. The cumulative rate of the primary end point was 15.7% for all patients and 13.9% for patients with high-grade (70% to 99%) stenosis. Of 13 ipsilateral strokes occurring after 30 days, 3 resulted in death.

We hypothesize that short term (daily) temperature fluctuation will alleviate nutrient limitation. We carried out experiments analysing growth rates, phosphorus and RNA content of D. commutate grown under four different temperature regimes and two P-limited conditions. Our experiments showed that individuals grown under fluctuating temperature grew more than at the mean temperature. We estimated the expected sizes for the 15 °C treatment based on the Q10 and for the fluctuating temperature treatment. These expected sizes for both treatments resulted well below the observed ones. The P and RNA content of individuals grown at 10 °C were significantly higher than those at 20 °C, and when individuals grown at 10 °C were translocated to 20 °C they exerted an increased growth rate. Our results suggest that, under a regime of diel vertical migration, the temperature alternation would allow migrating organisms to alleviate the effect of severe nutrient limitation maintaining population growth. Under a scenario of global warming, where epilimnetic temperatures will increase, lake temperature will interact with nutrient limitation for consumers, but, organisms may be able to face these changes if they can still regularly move from a cold hypolimnion to a warmer epilimnion.","Balseiro, Esteban; Laspoumaderes, Cecilia; Smufer, Facundo; Wolinski, Laura; Modenutti, Beatriz",Scientific reports,335,5

METHODS Six swine (42 ± 9 kg) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the MCP technique and the AHA method. In each swine, a dynamic acquisition, comprised of twenty consecutive whole heart volume scans, was acquired with a computed tomography scanner, following peripheral injection of contrast material. From this acquisition, MCP and AHA perfusion territories were determined, for the left (LCA) and right (RCA) coronary arteries. Each animal underwent additional dynamic acquisitions, consisting of twenty consecutive volume scans, following direct intracoronary contrast injection into the LCA or RCA. These images were used as the reference standard (REF) LCA and RCA perfusion territories. The MCP and AHA techniques' perfusion territories were then quantitatively compared with the REF perfusion territories. RESULTS The myocardial mass of MCP perfusion territories (MMCP) was related to the mass of reference standard perfusion territories (MREF) by MMCP = 0.99MREF + 0.39 g (r = 1.00; R2 = 1.00). The mass of AHA perfusion territories (MAHA) was related to MREF by MAHA = 0.81MREF + 5.03 g (r = 0.99; R2 = 0.98). CONCLUSION The vessel-specific MCP myocardial perfusion territory assignment technique more accurately quantifies LCA and RCA perfusion territories as compared with the current standard AHA 17-segment model. Therefore, it can potentially provide a more comprehensive and patient-specific evaluation of coronary artery disease. KEY POINTS • The minimum cost path (MCP) technique accurately determines left and right coronary artery perfusion territories, as compared with the American Heart Association 17-segment (AHA) model. • The minimum cost path (MCP) technique could be applied to cardiac computed-tomography angiography images to accurately determine patient-specific left and right coronary artery perfusion territories. • The American Heart Association 17-segment (AHA) model often fails to accurately determine left and right coronary artery perfusion territories, especially in the inferior and inferoseptal walls of the left ventricular myocardium.","Malkasian, Shant; Hubbard, Logan; Abbona, Pablo; Dertli, Brian; Kwon, Jungnam; Molloi, Sabee",European radiology,335,26

We examined whether candesartan treatment could slow the progression and, secondly, induce regression of retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in 309 centres worldwide. We recruited normoalbuminuric, normotensive, or treated hypertensive people with type 2 diabetes with mild to moderately severe retinopathy and assigned them to candesartan 16 mg once a day or placebo. After a month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg once per day. Investigators and patients were unaware of the treatment allocation status. Progression of retinopathy was the primary endpoint, and regression was a secondary endpoint. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00252694. FINDINGS 1905 participants (aged 37-75 years) were randomised to candesartan (n=951) or placebo (n=954). 161 (17%) patients in the candesartan group and 182 (19%) in the placebo group had progression of retinopathy by three steps or more on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale. The risk of progression of retinopathy was non-significantly reduced by 13% in patients on candesartan compared with those on placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.70-1.08, p=0.20). Regression on active treatment was increased by 34% (1.34, 1.08-1.68, p=0.009). HRs were not attenuated by adjustment for baseline risk factors or changes in blood pressure during the trial. An overall change towards less severe retinopathy by the end of the trial was observed in the candesartan group (odds 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30, p=0.003). Adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups. INTERPRETATION Treatment with candesartan in type 2 diabetic patients with mild to moderate retinopathy might induce improvement of retinopathy.","Sjølie, Anne Katrin; Klein, Ronald; Porta, Massimo; Orchard, Trevor; Fuller, John; Parving, Hans Henrik; Bilous, Rudy; Chaturvedi, Nish",Lancet,335,1

There is a lack of data to support this practice in the laparoscopic era. The objective of this study was to evaluate if risk-adjusted morbidity of perineal surgery for rectal prolapse is actually lower than laparoscopic surgery. DESIGN A retrospective review of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database as performed for patients undergoing surgical treatment of rectal prolapse between 2005 and 2011. Outcomes were analyzed according to procedure-type: laparoscopic rectopexy (LR), laparoscopic resection/rectopexy (LRR), open rectopexy (OR), open resection/rectopexy (ORR), and perineal resection (PR). A multivariate logistic regression was used to compare risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality between each procedure. Main outcome measures were 30-day morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Among 3,254 cases sampled, a laparoscopic approach was used in 22 %, an open abdominal approach in 30 %, and PR in 48 %. Patients undergoing PR were older (76) and had a higher ASA (3) compared to laparoscopic (58, 2) and open abdominal procedures (58, 2). Risk-adjusted mortality could not be assessed due to a low overall incidence of mortality (0.01 %). Overall morbidity was 9.3 %. ORR was associated with a higher risk-adjusted morbidity compared to PR (OR: 1.89 CI (1.19-2.99), p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in risk-adjusted morbidity found between LR and LRR compared to PR (OR 0.44 CI (0.19-1.03), p = 0.18; OR 1.55 CI (0.86-2.77), p = 0.18). Laparoscopic cases averaged 27 min longer than open cases (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic rectal prolapse surgery has comparable morbidity and mortality to perineal surgery. A randomized trial is indicated to validate these findings and to assess recurrence rates and functional outcomes.","Young, Monica T; Jafari, Mehraneh D; Phelan, Michael J; Stamos, Michael J; Mills, Steven; Pigazzi, Alessio; Carmichael, Joseph C",Surgical endoscopy,335,8

This function may be particularly important in the case of new and emerging infectious diseases, which are unfamiliar to both the public and health professionals. We conducted a content analysis of the coverage in six Canadian newspapers of two emerging infectious pathogens in British Columbia (BC), West Nile virus and Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii), between 2001 and 2006. C. gattii was first identified in the Canadian Pacific Northwest in 1999, having previously been restricted to tropical and subtropical areas. By summer 2006, C. gattii had killed at least eight people and was responsible for over 150 hospitalizations in the province of BC, as well as significant morbidity and mortality among companion animals. West Nile virus reached Canada in 2001 and has since caused significant morbidity and mortality. It has not, to date, reached BC. Despite the much higher incidence of disease and death caused by C. gattii in BC, West Nile virus received five times more news coverage in the British Columbian and national newspapers examined. Surprisingly, the local newspaper closest to the center of the British Columbia C. gattii outbreak had a much lower proportion of coverage of the disease than other papers in the province. The article discusses possible explanations for these findings, and the implications for public health communication.","Nicol, Anne-Marie; Hurrell, Christie; McDowall, Will; Bartlett, Karen; Elmieh, Negar",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,335,1

METHODS We enrolled consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Medical Departments (MD) or Intensive Care Units (ICU), and 54 healthy controls. RESULTS Eighty-nine patients were included (mean age 60.4±16.1 years, 68.5% male); 33.7% admitted to ICU. Twenty-four patients (26.9%) were enrolled before thromboprophylaxis administration; 45 patients (50.6%) received standard and 20 (22.5%) intermediate sub-therapeutic dose thromboprophylaxis. Overall, patients with COVID-19 showed a TG profile comparable to that of healthy subjects (i.e. comparable peak height, endogenous thrombin potential [ETP] with and without TM). The only exception was lag time and time to peak, prolonged in COVID-19 patients vs. controls. MD patients showed a similar TG profile to healthy controls, and ICU patients showed significantly decrease ETP (p=0.030) compared to MD. As for thromboprophylaxis, TG profile was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients without thromboprophylaxis vs. controls and vs. those with thromboprophylaxis. In this latter group, ETP inhibition was significantly decreased (p=0.0003) and positively correlated with anti-Xa activity (r=0.49, p=0.0017). However, patients with thromboprophylaxis had similar TG profile vs. controls. Intermediate dose thromboprophylaxis more effectively inhibited TG in severe COVID-19 patients by increasing ETP inhibition via ETP with TM reduction vs. standard dose. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients showed increased TG at diagnosis. Standard thromboprophylaxis reduced TG to levels of healthy controls. Intermediate sub-therapeutic thromboprophylaxis more effectively inhibited TG by decreasing ETP with TM.","Campello, Elena; Bulato, Cristiana; Spiezia, Luca; Boscolo, Annalisa; Poletto, Francesco; Cola, Marco; Gavasso, Sabrina; Simion, Chiara; Radu, Claudia Maria; Cattelan, Annamaria; Tiberio, Ivo; Vettor, Roberto; Navalesi, Paolo; Simioni, Paolo",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,335,23

A search was performed through July 2018 of the Cochrane and MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) databases, among other sources. Randomized controlled trials in adults with myocardial infarction, angina, revascularization, or heart failure were included. Interventions had to aim to increase utilization of comprehensive phase II CR. Two authors independently performed all stages of citation processing. Following the random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression was undertaken to explore the impact of pre-specified factors. Twenty-six trials with 5299 participants were included (35.8% women). Low-quality evidence showed an effect of interventions in increasing enrolment (risk ratio (RR) = 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13⁻1.42). Meta-regression analyses suggested that the intervention deliverer (nurse or allied healthcare provider, p = 0.02) and delivery format (face-to-face, p = 0.01) were influential in increasing enrolment. There was low-quality evidence that interventions to increase adherence were effective (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.20⁻0.55), particularly where remotely-offered (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.36⁻0.76). There was moderate-quality evidence that interventions to increase program completion were effective (RR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02⁻1.25).

American Academy of Ophthalmology and Center for Disease Control guidelines suggest mandatory masking of patients and physicians during outpatient visits. We have recently become aware of a mask-induced phenomenon, whereby the intraocular pressure (IOP) as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) is artificially elevated due to mechanical interference from the mask. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 37-year-old male with a history of primary open-angle glaucoma on triple therapy presented for a routine visit. CLINICAL FINDINGS When measuring IOP by GAT the right eye measured 16 mm Hg, but the left eye measured 20 mm Hg. The patient's mask was noted to be touching the base of the sensor rod on the tonometer. This patient's IOP was falsely elevated due to the lateral edge of his mask touching the base of the applanation tonometer, changing the relationship between the bi-prism tip and the weighted balance below, and eliminating the weighted balance from the pressure measuring mechanism. The patient's mask was adjusted to ensure there was no touch and repeat measurement showed an IOP of 16 mm Hg in the left eye. CONCLUSION Recognizing mask-induced alteration in IOP is essential as it could lead to unnecessary escalation of treatment. We recommend flattening the area of mask protrusion during applanation and ensuring that the sensor arm remains clear of the mask while the tonometer tip approaches the cornea, especially at the moment the mires become visible during corneal contact.","Davanian, Arash M; Donahue, Sean P; Mogil, Rachel S; Groth, Sylvia L",Journal of glaucoma,335,1

The purpose of this study was to determine whether early BBB disruption predicts intracranial hemorrhage and poor outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We analyzed patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy and identified BBB disruption on the noncontrast CT images immediately after endovascular treatment. Follow-up CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed at 24 hours to assess intracranial hemorrhage. We dichotomized patients into those with moderate BBB disruption versus those with minor BBB disruption and no BBB disruption. We evaluated the association of moderate BBB disruption after mechanical thrombectomy with intracranial hemorrhage and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Moderate BBB disruption after mechanical thrombectomy was found in 56 of 210 patients (26.7%). Moderate BBB disruption was independently associated with higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation (OR 25.33; 95% CI 9.93-64.65; P < .001), parenchymal hematoma (OR 20.57; 95% CI 5.64-74.99; P < .001), and poor outcome at discharge (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.09-5.07; P = .03). The association of BBB disruption with intracranial hemorrhage remained in patients with successful reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy. The location of BBB disruption was not associated with intracranial hemorrhage and poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS Moderate BBB disruption is common after mechanical thrombectomy in a quarter of patients with acute ischemic stroke and increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and poor outcome.","Shi, Zhong-Song; Duckwiler, Gary R; Jahan, Reza; Tateshima, Satoshi; Szeder, Viktor; Saver, Jeffrey L; Kim, Doojin; Sharma, Latisha K; Vespa, Paul M; Salamon, Noriko; Villablanca, J Pablo; Viñuela, Fernando; Feng, Lei; Loh, Yince; Liebeskind, David S",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,335,12

Q10 protein chips and PBSII-C protein chips reader (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc.) were used. The protein fingerprint expression of all the Serum samples and the resulting profiles between cancer and non-cancer groups were analyzed with Biomarker Wizard system. A group of proteomic peaks were detected. Three differently expressed potential biomarkers were identified with the relative molecular weights of 5,915, 6,440 and 9,190 Da. Among the three peaks, the one with m/z 6,440 was down-regulated, and the other two peaks with m/z 5,915 and 9,190 were up-regulated in LC. This diagnostic model could distinguish LC patients from controls with a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 91.9%. Moreover, blind test data showed a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 89.1%.

A current trend is to reinforce this primary repair with surgical grafts, meshes, or patches secured with perforating mechanical devices (i.e., sutures, staples, or tacks). These fixation methods frequently lead to chronic pain and mesh detachment. We developed a series of biodegradable adhesive polymers that are synthetic mimics of mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs), composed of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-derivatives, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and polycaprolactone (PCL). These polymers can be cast into films, and their mechanical properties, extent of swelling, and degradation rate can be tailored through the composition of the polymers as well as blending with additives. When coated onto a biologic mesh used for hernia repair, these adhesive constructs demonstrated adhesive strengths significantly higher than fibrin glue. With further development, a precoated bioadhesive mesh may represent a new surgical option for soft tissue repair.","Murphy, John L; Vollenweider, Laura; Xu, Fangmin; Lee, Bruce P",Biomacromolecules,335,13

A total of 2,125 porcine samples from 910 cases were collected during 2016-2018, and tested for presence of PCV3 and PCV2 by real-time PCR assays. Results showed high prevalence of PCV3 and PCV2: 28.4% samples from 41.2% cases were PCV3 positive and 16.4% samples from 16.7% cases were PCV2 positive. The overall coinfection rate was 5.4% and 8.4% at the sample and case level, respectively. Temporal analysis indicated that PCV3 positive case rate increased from 31.6% in 2016, 40.9% in 2017, to 55.6% in 2018. Although its prevalence was lower, PCV2 positive case rate in 2018 (28.8%) doubled that in 2017 (14.4%). The coinfection case rate also increased from 3.4% in 2016, 8.0% in 2017, to 16.1% in 2018. The high positive rate of PCV3 (56.9%) and PCV2 (33.8%) in oral fluids, PCV3 in fetuses (57.1%) and PCV2 in tonsils (54.8%) implied viral transmission route and tissue tropism. In phylogenetic analysis, two small PCV3 clusters (1 and 2) were separated but others were clustered with low bootstrapping values indicating overall low genetic diversity.

Preoperative embolization of these notoriously hypervascular tumors can be challenging as they often receive their dominant blood supply from pial feeders arising from the internal carotid artery (ICA) or vertebrobasilar (VB) circulation. This study reviews our historical experience with HPC embolization and introduces the transtumoral technique for backfilling pial tumor vasculature by delivering Onyx-18 through diminutive external carotid artery (ECA) feeders. METHODS A retrospective review of all preoperative HPC embolizations performed at Anonymous University #1 (September 2002-November 2014) and Anonymous University #2 (January 2014-November 2014) is presented. RESULTS Fifteen patients with pathologically confirmed HPC underwent 17 embolizations. More extensive devascularization percentages were achieved for HPCs with primarily ECA blood supply (76.4±10.7%; n=6) than with HPCs supplied via the ICA/VB circulation (57.9±26.9%; n=8; p=0.046). There was a trend towards greater devascularization of ICA/VB-dominant HPCs embolized with Onyx (70.0±34.6%; n=4) versus polyvinyl alcohol particles (33.3±15.3%; n=3). The extent of angiographic devascularization negatively correlated with intraoperative blood loss (rho=-0.71; p=0.005). There were no embolization-related complications. CONCLUSIONS The extent of preoperative embolization of HPCs correlates with decreased intraoperative blood loss. However, HPCs with an ICA/VB-dominant blood supply remain challenging embolization targets, demonstrating reduced devascularization percentages compared with ECA-dominant counterparts. The authors favor the use of Onyx for ICA/VB-dominant HPCs, noting a trend towards an improved devascularization rate.","Hanak, Brian W; Haussen, Diogo C; Ambekar, Sudheer; Ferreira, Manuel; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Peterson, Eric C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,335,24

Single agents tested were cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, epirubicin, fluorouracil, 4-hydroxy ifosfamide (active metabolite of ifosfamide), SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan), topotecan, and vinorelbine. Doublets tested were carboplatin/paclitaxel and cisplatin/topotecan. Tumor response was determined from dose-response curves. Results were scored as responsive, intermediate, or nonresponsive. Chemoresponse was reported as the combined responsive and intermediate results. RESULTS Three hundred fifty-three (63.4%) of 557 submitted specimens were successfully assayed. Confirmation of histology and tumor status (primary, metastatic, or recurrent) was available for 273 specimens. The chemoresponse of the most active agents in primary cancers (n = 151) was 75% for SN-38, 71% for 4-hydroxy ifosfamide, 62% for topotecan, and 73% for carboplatin/paclitaxel. The chemoresponse of metastatic cancers (n = 66) was 54% for SN-38, 51% for 4-hydroxy ifosfamide, 44% for epirubicin, and 53% for carboplatin/paclitaxel. The chemoresponse for recurrent cancers (n = 56) was 44% for epirubicin, 41% for 4-hydroxy ifosfamide, 39% for vinorelbine, 39% for paclitaxel, 36% for topotecan, 46% for carboplatin/paclitaxel, and 35% for cisplatin/topotecan. The overall chemoresponse was greater in primary cancers (58%) than in recurrent cancers (35%) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In vitro chemoresponse analysis of cervical cancer biospecimens is feasible. Chemoresponse results are variable depending on tumor status. Clinical studies of assay-directed therapy should be developed.","Grigsby, Perry W; Gan, Christine M; Tillmanns, Todd D; Del Priore, Giuseppe",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,335,31

The experience from a hospital on the frontline in Milan.,16.90017,5.7150598,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND Esophagojejunostomy after laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is the most technically difficult type of anastomosis; thus, anastomotic complications such as leakage and stenosis sometimes occur. Identification of the safest anastomotic procedure is important for successful LTG. We have performed LTG since 2004 either with a circular stapler using an OrVil™ anvil or via the overlap Orringer method with a linear stapler. This retrospective study aimed to determine which method results in a lower incidence of anastomotic complications in patients undergoing LTG. METHODS Data on 188 consecutive patients who underwent LTG between April 2004 and August 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into those who underwent esophagojejunostomy performed via a circular stapler using an OrVil™ anvil (group C, n = 49) or via the overlap method (group L, n = 139). RESULTS Anastomotic complications occurred in five of 188 esophagojejunostomies (2.7%). They comprised three cases of leakage (1.6%), and two of stenosis (1.1%). There was no significant difference in patient characteristics or hematological variables between groups C and L. There was no significant difference between groups in operation time, blood loss, lymph node dissection, and intraoperative anastomotic problems. The rate of anastomotic complications was significantly lower in group L (0.7%, 1/139) than in group C (8.2%, 4/49; p = 0.005). In particular, anastomotic leakage in group L tended to be lower (0.7% 1/139) than in group C (4.1% 2/49), although this difference was not significant. The rate of anastomotic stenosis in group L was significantly lower (0%, 0/139) than in group C (4.1%, 2/49; p = 0.017). Furthermore multivariate analysis showed anastomotic procedure was an independent factor for anastomotic complication. CONCLUSIONS There were fewer anastomotic complications after overlap esophagojejunostomy than after esophagojejunostomy via the OrVil™ procedure, especially regarding anastomotic stenosis. We therefore recommend the overlap technique when performing esophagojejunostomy.","Kawamura, Hideki; Ohno, Yosuke; Ichikawa, Nobuki; Yoshida, Tadashi; Homma, Shigenori; Takahashi, Masahiro; Taketomi, Akinobu",Surgical endoscopy,335,17

Methods Prior to RAPN, a 3D-square type kidney model was prepared and used for all RAPN procedures in patients with T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated at a single center between March 2016 and April 2019. All RAPN procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Results The study included 50 patients, of whom 22, 24, and 4 had low-, intermediate-, and high-risk R.E.N.A.L Nephrometry scores, respectively. The TRIFECTA achievement rate was 86.0%, and transfusion or conversion to radical nephrectomy was not required in any of the patients. Only one Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complication was reported-a pseudoaneurysm that required embolism. The TRIFECTA achievement rate was independent of the R.E.N.A.L Nephrometry scores and the surgeon's experience level (25 cases each of early and advanced experience). Conclusions The 3D model contributed to the achievement of TRIFECTA during RAPN performed by a less-experienced surgeon. These findings should be further evaluated in studies involving a larger number of cases and surgeons.","Fujisaki, Akira; Takayama, Tatsuya; Yamazaki, Masahiro; Kamimura, Tomoki; Katano, Saki; Komatsubara, Maiko; Kamei, Jun; Sugihara, Toru; Ando, Satoshi; Fujimura, Tetsuya",Translational andrology and urology,335,1

The secondary aims were to determine whether: 1) there were clinical predictors of COVID-19 status; and 2) whether social lockdown influenced the incidence and epidemiology of hip fractures. METHODS A national multicentre retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting to six trauma centres or units with a hip fracture over a 46-day period (23 days pre- and 23 days post-lockdown). Patient demographics, type of residence, place of injury, presentation blood tests, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, anaesthetic, length of stay, COVID-19 status, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS Of 317 patients with acute hip fracture, 27 (8.5%) had a positive COVID-19 test. Only seven (26%) had suggestive symptoms on admission. COVID-19-positive patients had a significantly lower 30-day survival compared to those without COVID-19 (64.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 45.7 to 83.3 vs 91.7%, 95% CI 88.2 to 94.8; p < 0.001). COVID-19 was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality risk adjusting for: 1) age, sex, type of residence (hazard ratio (HR) 2.93; p = 0.008); 2) Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (HR 3.52; p = 0.001); and 3) ASA (HR 3.45; p = 0.004). Presentation platelet count predicted subsequent COVID-19 status; a value of < 217 × 109/l was associated with 68% area under the curve (95% CI 58 to 77; p = 0.002) and a sensitivity and specificity of 63%. A similar number of patients presented with hip fracture in the 23 days pre-lockdown (n = 160) and 23 days post-lockdown (n = 157) with no significant (all p ≥ 0.130) difference in patient demographics, residence, place of injury, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, ASA, or management. CONCLUSION COVID-19 was independently associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate for patients with a hip fracture. Notably, most patients with hip fracture and COVID-19 lacked suggestive symptoms at presentation. Platelet count was an indicator of risk of COVID-19 infection. These findings have implications for the management of hip fractures, in particular the need for COVID-19 testing.","Hall, Andrew J; Clement, Nicholas D; Farrow, Luke; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; Dall, Graham F; Scott, Chloe E H; Jenkins, Paul J; White, Timothy O; Duckworth, Andrew D",The bone & joint journal,335,31

However, there are few published data on the use of a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach. The purpose of this study was to present our experience and evaluate early outcomes of TEP inguinal hernia repair with self-adhesive mesh. METHODS This cohort study was a retrospective review of patients who underwent laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernial repair from April 4, 2010, through July 22, 2014. Data assessed were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hernia repair indications, hernia type, pain, paresthesia, occurrence (bilateral or unilateral), recurrence, and patient satisfaction. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed. RESULTS Six hundred forty patients underwent laparoscopic preperitoneal hernia surgery with self-adhesive mesh. The average age was 56 years, nearly all were men (95.8%), and the mean BMI was 26.2 kg/m(2). Cases involved primary hernia more frequently than recurrent hernia (94% vs 6%; P < .05). After surgery, 92% of the patients reported no more than minimal pain, <1% reported paresthesia, and 0.2% had early recurrence. There were 7 conversions to an open procedure. The patients had no adverse reactions to anesthesia and no bladder injury. Postoperative acute pain or recurrence was not explained by demographics, BMI, or preoperative pain. There were significant associations of hernia side, recurrence, occurrence, and sex with composite end points. Nearly all patients (98%) were satisfied with the outcome. CONCLUSION The use of self-adhesive, Velcro-type mesh in laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair is associated with reduced pain; low rates of early recurrence, infection, and hematoma; and improved patient satisfaction.","Mangram, Alicia; Oguntodu, Olakunle F; Rodriguez, Francisco; Rassadi, Roozbeh; Haley, Michael; Shively, Cynthia J; Dzandu, James K",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,335,1

MSCs affect the functions of most immune effector cells via direct contact with immune cells and local microenvironmental factors. Previous studies have confirmed that the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are mainly communicated via MSC-secreted cytokines; however, apoptotic and metabolically inactivated MSCs have more recently been shown to possess immunomodulatory potential, in which regulatory T cells and monocytes play a key role.

Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A growing number of studies have used social network analysis to examine how social network characteristics influence adult alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network analysis to assess the influence of social network characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults. METHODS A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and a review of the reference lists of retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged eligible and included. RESULTS Most studies were conducted among young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The objectives and methods of the included studies were heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically significant association between a social network characteristic and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network members drinking behaviors were associated with participants' drinking behaviors in multiple ways. DISCUSSION In young adults, among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted, with whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be associated with alcohol consumption; this was observed across methodologies and settings. We still know very little about the relationship of social networks to drinking in older age groups, and in populations most impacted by alcohol. As social networks appear to play a role in the consumption of alcohol in young adulthood, interventions that utilize social networks to help reduce harmful alcohol consumption should be considered.","Knox, Justin; Schneider, John; Greene, Emily; Nicholson, Joey; Hasin, Deborah; Sandfort, Theo",PloS one,335,33

While intraoperative frozen section (IOFS) is not mandatory, it helps achieve negative distal resection margins (DRMs). Our aim was to audit the role of IOFS for DRM assessment while performing sphincter-saving rectal surgery and to identify those subgroups that would benefit the most from IOFS analysis. METHODS Patients who underwent rectal cancer surgery between 2009 and 2013 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients who intraoperatively underwent an IOFS for DRM assessment were included in the study. Factors associated with a positive margin on IOFS were analysed. The sensitivity and specificity of IOFS were also assessed. RESULTS Of 250 patients, who had an anterior resection with an IOFS, 12 had an involved DRM. Of these patients, eight were involved by adenocarcinoma, two by acellular mucin, one by moderate dysplasia and one by adenoma confirmed on paraffin section. Positive margins had a 100 % intervention rate. There were two false negative on IOFS. IOFS had a sensitivity of 85.17 % with a specificity of 100 % and a negative predictive value of 99.16 %. Specimens with a positive IOFS were lower rectal (P < 0.05), poorly differentiated and post LCRT locally advanced tumours. CONCLUSIONS IOFS to confirm negative DRM is recommended in lower rectal tumours irrespective of DSM. It can be considered for locally advanced post LCRT poorly differentiated mid rectal tumours and avoided for upper rectal tumours.","Gomes, Rachel M; Bhandare, Manish; Desouza, Ashwin; Bal, Munita; Saklani, Avanish P",International journal of colorectal disease,335,19

Thus, repair of a sliding inguinal hernia may have higher risk of complications and recurrence compared with non-sliding inguinal hernia. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and reoperation rates following sliding inguinal hernia repair. METHODS This study was based on data from the Danish Hernia Database covering the period between January 1, 1998 and February 22, 2012. Data were collected prospectively and nationwide. RESULTS In total, 70,091 primary hernia repairs were included for analysis. The occurrence of sliding inguinal hernias of the total group of included hernia repairs was 9.4 % among males and 2.9 % among females (p < 0.05). Among male patients, the sliding inguinal hernias had a higher cumulated reoperation rate compared with non-sliding inguinal hernias (6.0 versus 4.2 %, log-rank p = 0.001). A Cox regression model was fitted and showed that the type of repair affected the risk for reoperation for recurrence; hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval): open non-mesh: reference, Lichtenstein 0.43 (0.39-0.48), other open mesh 0.46 (0.39-0.54), laparoscopic 0.70 (0.60-0.84). CONCLUSION The incidence of sliding inguinal hernia is higher in males than in females, and sliding inguinal hernia is a risk factor for reoperation for recurrence. The Lichtenstein repair could be considered over the laparoscopic approach because of lower reoperation rates.","Andresen, Kristoffer; Bisgaard, Thue; Rosenberg, Jacob",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,335,17

MATERIAL AND METHODS In July 2020, a total of 267 students took a PAL-based exam on fictional patients with surgical issues, in which they had to evaluate two fellow students and were themselves evaluated by two fellow students. The students evaluated their experience with the PAL-based exam through a questionnaire which consisted of five given statements (answer possibilities: agree, disagree, neutral) and two questions (answer possibilities: better, equal, worse) to rate. RESULTS In the survey, 77.9% of the students rated PAL as a better learning method and 21% rated it as at least equally effective to the known multiple-choice (MC) test. A total of 74.9% of the students indicated that they learned more content with PAL and 20.2% said they learned the same amount; 83.7% said that their ""clinical thinking has improved"" through PAL. In the comments, 73% of the students noted that they think PAL is a good learning method, and at least 22% rated it as useful but in need of improvements. Only 5% did not see PAL as an acceptable learning method. In contrast to this, 1.3% saw PAL as a ""bad alternative to MC tests."" CONCLUSION PAL, especially peer assessment, might represent a better learning method as it might encourage students to deal more intensively with the learning content and to improve clinical thinking.","Holfert, Jonathan; Kesting, Marco R; Buchbender, Mayte",Journal of dental education,335,1

The implications of the Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly for primary care, remain unknown. This cross-sectional study examines new symptoms reported at primary care encounters during three post-acute follow-up intervals after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS Electronic health record data from the NYU Langone COVID Deidentified Dataset were queried for adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and then restricted to those with a new ICD-10-CM code documented at a post-acute COVID-related primary care follow-up >14 days after testing positive. New diagnoses and the corresponding Clinical Classifications Software Refined categories were assessed at the following intervals: 0.5-3 months (""subacute""), 3-6 months (""prolonged""), and 6-9 months (""persistent""). RESULTS Out of 3,154 patients, a new ICD-10-CM code was documented among 499 patients (∼16%). Respiratory complaints, including cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, were most common. Malaise and fatigue were reported consistently among 10-13% of patients at all three time-intervals. Musculoskeletal pain, circulatory symptoms, and sleep-wake disorders were also observed at primary care follow-up. CONCLUSION This cross-sectional study provides support of a post-acute COVID syndrome, demonstrating that patients continue to experience symptoms after the acute infection period. Extensive follow-up data allowed for examining new symptoms up to 9 months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding of the course of multi-organ post-acute sequelae is restricted by cross-sectional study design limitations. Standardized, sequelae-related ICD-10-CM codes to specify the type and duration of post-acute COVID-related symptoms would enable better monitoring of the growing number of SARS-CoV-2 infection survivors.","Terlizzi, Kelly; Kutscher, Eric; Yoncheva, Yuliya",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,335,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS 75 young patients (46 males and 29 females, mean age 23.95±2.9 years) were divided into three groups of 25 individuals. The first group was composed of non-smoking patients using toothpaste with NovaMin. The second group (reference group) comprised patients using placebo toothpaste. The third group was composed of smoking patients using toothpaste with NovaMin. The clinical trials of patients included assessment of functional activity of minor salivary glands, the sialometric analysis, the study on microcrystallization of mixed saliva. The non-specific resistance of oral cavity was studied based on the analysis of absorption reaction of microorganisms by epithelial cells. All patients were questioned about the organoleptic characteristics of the toothpaste. The abovementioned features were assessed before the study, after the first use of the toothpaste, after day 7 and day 14. RESULTS The course use of toothpaste with NovaMin resulted in the plaque inhibiting effect (p≤0.05), increased functional activity of minor salivary glands (p≤0.05) promoting increased salivation and oral cavity cleansing. The concept of local recovery of the receptor apparatus of epithelial cells is confirmed for the first group of patients; the non-specific resistance in tobacco users is low, prevalence of Type I epithelial cells is defined (p≤0.05). CONCLUSION The evaluated toothpaste affects metabolism in the oral cavity because it was diagnosed that the non-specific resistance of the oral cavity and absorption by epithelia improved in all patients after the course use.","Elovikova, T M; Sablina, S N; Ermishina, E Y; Koscheev, A S",Stomatologiia,335,27

Cells expressing CA mutants showed increased proteasome maturation protein (POMP) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) expression. This correlated with an increase in catalytically active proteasome subunit β (PSMB)-8, PSMB9, and PSMB10, which occurred in an ETS transcription factor-dependent manner. Proteasome chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like activities were increased, and this enhanced capacity reduced PI sensitivity, while DN-KRAS and DN-NRAS did the opposite. Pharmacologic RAF or MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors decreased proteasome activity, and sensitized myeloma cells to PIs. CA-KRAS, CA-NRAS, and CA-BRAF down-regulated expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins, and reduced unfolded protein response activation, while DN mutations increased both. Finally, a bortezomib (BTZ)/MEK inhibitor combination showed enhanced activity in vivo specifically in CA-NRAS models. Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that activating MAPK pathway mutations enhance PI resistance by increasing proteasome capacity, and provide a rationale for targeting such patients with PI/RAF or PI/MEK inhibitor combinations. Moreover, they argue these mutations promote myeloma survival by reducing cellular stress, thereby distancing plasma cells from the apoptotic threshold, potentially explaining their high frequency in myeloma.","Shirazi, Fazal; Jones, Richard J; Singh, Ram K; Zou, Jianxuan; Kuiatse, Isere; Berkova, Zuzana; Wang, Hua; Lee, Hans C; Hong, Samuel; Dick, Larry; Chattopadhyay, Nibedita; Orlowski, Robert Z",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,335,5

Potential long-term side effects of the vessel wall trauma caused by mechanical irritation of the endothelium are unknown up to now. METHODS From a retrospectively established database of 640 acute stroke treatments, we selected 261 patients with 265 embolic vessel occlusions treated successfully by mTE without permanent implantation of a stent. Analysis comprised the type of devices used and the number of passes performed. Digital subtraction angiography immediately after treatment was evaluated for vasospasm, dissection, and extravasation. Control angiographic images were evaluated for any morphological change compared to the immediate posttreatment angiographic run. RESULTS Recanalization was achieved with a median of one (range 1-10) mTE maneuvers. Vasospasm occurred in 69 territories (26.0 %) and was treated with glyceroltrinitrate in three. Dissection was observed in one vessel (0.4 %). Intraprocedural hemorrhage in two patients (0.8 %) was either wire or device induced. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography was available for 117 territories after a median of 107 days, revealing target vessel occlusion in one segment (0.9 %) and a de novo stenosis of four segments (3.4 %). All findings were clinically asymptomatic. Posttreatment vasospasm was more frequent in patients with de novo stenosis and occlusion (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION De novo stenoses and occlusions occur in a small proportion of patients after mTE. Because all lesions were clinically asymptomatic, this finding does not affect the overall benefit of the treatment. Vasospasm may predict late vessel wall changes.","Kurre, Wiebke; Pérez, Marta Aguilar; Horvath, Diana; Schmid, Elisabeth; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,335,1

CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 20 has been reported to be important in inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. We hypothesized that visfatin, an adipocytokine, could play a role in hepatic fibrosis via CCL20. We investigated the effect of visfatin on CCL20 in THP-1 human promonocytic cells and examined the molecular mechanisms involved. Following treatment of THP-1 cells with visfatin, CCL20 expression and secretion were assessed. We assessed the intracellular signaling molecules IKK/NF-κB, JAK2/STAT3, MAPKs, and MKK3/6 by western blotting. We treated THP-1 cells with visfatin and signaling inhibitors, and examined CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. To investigate the effect of visfatin-induced CCL20 expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), LX-2 cells were co-cultured with the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells with or without anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibodies, and fibrosis markers were examined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. In THP-1 cells, visfatin increased the CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. visfatin increased the activities of the NF-κB, p38, and MLK3/6 signaling pathways but not those of the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK pathways. Visfatin treatment together with an NF-κB, p38, or MLK3 inhibitor reduced the mRNA and protein levels of CCL20. The visfatin-induced CCL20 increased the expression of fibrosis markers and CCR6 in HSCs. Following neutralization of CCL20, the levels of fibrosis markers and CCR6 were decreased. Visfatin increases the expression of CCL20 via the NF-κB and MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathways in macrophages, and visfatin-induced CCL20 expression promotes the fibrosis markers in HSCs.","Heo, Yu Jung; Choi, Sung-E; Lee, Nami; Jeon, Ja Young; Han, Seung Jin; Kim, Dae Jung; Kang, Yup; Lee, Kwan Woo; Kim, Hae Jin",Molecular biology reports,335,1

Both silencing and upregulation of VDAC1 in various type of cancer cell lines can stimulate apoptosis. In contrast, in mouse embryonic stem (MES) cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the roles of VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1-/-) in apoptotic cell death are contradictory. The contribution and underlying mechanism of VDAC1-/- in oxidative stress-induced cell death in cardiac cells has not been established. We hypothesized that VDAC1 is an essential regulator of oxidative stress-induced cell death in H9c2 cells. METHODS We knocked out VDAC1 in this rat cardiomyoblast cell line with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique to produce VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells, and determined if VDAC1 is critical in promoting cell death via oxidative stress induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP), an organic peroxide, or rotenone (ROT), an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I by measuring cell viability with MTT assay, cell death with TUNEL stain and LDH release. The mitochondrial and glycolytic stress were examined by measuring O2 consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) with a Seahorse XFp analyzer. RESULTS We found that under control conditions, VDAC1-/- did not affect H9c2 cell proliferation or mitochondrial respiration. However, compared to the wildtype (WT) cells, exposure to either tBHP or ROT enhanced the production of ROS, ECAR, and the proton (H+) production rate (PPR) from glycolysis, as well as promoted apoptotic cell death in VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells. VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells also exhibited markedly reduced mitochondria-bound hexokinase II (HKII) and Bax. Restoration of VDAC1 in VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells reinstated mitochondria-bound HKII and concomitantly decreased tBHP and ROT-induced ROS production and cell death. Interestingly, mitochondrial respiration remained the same after tBHP treatment in VDAC1-/- and WT H9c2 cells. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that VDAC1-/- in H9c2 cells enhances oxidative stress-mediated cell apoptosis that is directly linked to the reduction of mitochondria-bound HKII and concomitantly associated with enhanced ROS production, ECAR, and PPR.","Yang, Meiying; Sun, Jie; Stowe, David F; Tajkhorshid, Emad; Kwok, Wai-Meng; Camara, Amadou K S","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",335,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2015 and December 2016, three consecutive oncologic patients (mean age 58 years; range 48-67 years) with acetabular bone metastasis underwent percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation procedures along with hip joint cartilage thermal monitoring. Due to the close proximity of the metastatic lesion to the acetabular articular cartilage, a thermosensor device was placed under CT and fluoroscopic guidance near the acetabular roof and next to the ablation zone in order to monitor the local temperature around the articular cartilage. Stand-alone thermal ablation (n = 1) and combined thermal ablation with cementoplasty (n = 2) were performed to optimize local palliation or disease control. Clinical and radiological outcomes at follow-up were assessed. RESULTS Three acetabular metastatic lesions were treated with thermal ablation, and temperature monitoring of the acetabular articular cartilage was conducted during the ablation procedure. Mean size of lesions was 1.6 cm (range 1.5-2 cm). Technical success was achieved in all cases (100%) without any immediate complications. No hip cartilage damage occurred clinically and radiologically. Good palliation and local disease control were achieved in two cases, and in the other case, there was local recurrence and distant progression of hip metastatic disease after 7 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION Temperature monitoring of the articular cartilage during percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation appears technically feasible with good short-term efficacy in a complex patient subset. Further studies are warranted to confirm these promising initial results.","Bauones, Salem; Garnon, Julien; Chari, Basavaraj; Cazzato, Roberto L; Tsoumakidou, Georgia; Caudrelier, Jean; Koch, Guillaume; Gangi, Afshin",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,335,19

Current studies have documented that SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, can damage the male reproductive system in large part by inflammatory damage caused by cytokine storm. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect the human testis directly and enter semen is controversial. Other adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproduction are also of concern and require comprehensive evaluation. Here, we analyze the invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 in the testis and examine reported mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with male reproduction. Long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male reproduction are also discussed. It should be emphasized that although COVID-19 may induce testicular damage, substantial decrease in male reproductive capacity awaits clinical evidence. We propose that there is an urgent need to track male COVID-19 patients during their recovery. Development of suitable experimental models, including human reproductive organoids, will be valuable to further investigate viral impact on reproduction for current and future pandemics.","Tian, Yu; Zhou, Li-Quan",Reproduction,335,1

The aim of the present follow-up was to investigate the asthma prevalence and risk factors for asthma in adulthood. METHODS We have prospectively studied asthma development in 101 children hospitalized due to severe wheezing before the age of 24 months. The cohort was re-investigated at a mean age of 27 years and tested for bronchial hyper-responsiveness and allergic sensitization. The response rate in adulthood was 81% (82/101). The results were compared with a population-based, age-matched control group (n = 1,210) recruited from the West Sweden Asthma Study. RESULTS Current doctor-diagnosed asthma was found in 37% (30/82) compared with 7% (82/1,210) in the control group. The risk of adult asthma in the cohort compared with the control group was increased 10-fold (adjusted OR 10.0, 95% CI 5.3-18.7), independently of allergic rhinitis, gender, smoking and heredity. Within the cohort, current allergy (aOR 9.6, 95% CI 3.0-31.2) and female gender (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.3) independently increased the risk of adult asthma. Females with current allergy had the highest risk of adult asthma (OR 29.4, 95% CI 5.0-173.3), compared with males without allergy. When separately adjusting for factors present at admission in early life within the cohort, a family history of asthma was a significant risk factor for asthma in adulthood (aOR 4.0, 95% CI 1.3-12.5). CONCLUSION Subjects with severe early wheezing have a 10-fold increase in the risk of adult asthma compared to an age-matched control group, adjusted for allergic rhinitis, gender, smoking and heredity.","Goksör, Emma; Åmark, Mainor; Alm, Bernt; Ekerljung, Linda; Lundbäck, Bo; Wennergren, Göran",Pediatric pulmonology,335,26

We report a fatal case of a COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE). CASE REPORT We report a 70-year-old man brought to the hospital after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. He was confused and disoriented. Nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. A head computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no signs of acute pathology. After recurrent seizures, he was sedated and intubated. Throughout the days that followed he remained in a therapeutic coma. After discontinuation of sedatives, he remained unconscious. A repeated head CT scan showed signs of pontine edema, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed inhomogeneous hyperintensities with microhemorrhages and small autonecrotic cavities in both thalami, brain stem, and cerebellar peduncles. With a high suspicion of a COVID-19-associated ANE, the patient was started on high-dose glucocorticoids; however, he died the next day. The CSF tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION A variety of COVID-19 neurological manifestations have been reported to date, including various forms of encephalitis and encephalopathy. In our patient, encephalopathy with seizures was the presenting symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The radiological findings on days 8 and 9 were consistent with an ANE. The precise pathogenesis of ANE remains unclear; however, an immune-mediated mechanism is suspected. Early diagnostics with prompt administration of immunomodulators may be lifesaving. Suspicion of a COVID-19-related encephalopathy/encephalitis should be raised in all patients with altered mental status, seizures, and/or coma.","Ziemele, Dace; Ķauķe, Gundega; Skrējāne, Krista; Jaunozoliņa, Līga; Karelis, Guntis",European journal of neurology,335,1

OBJECTIVES The authors sought to examine outcomes with TAVR versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with rheumatic AS, and versus TAVR in nonrheumatic AS. METHODS The authors identified Medicare beneficiaries who underwent TAVR or SAVR from October 2015 to December 2017, and then identified patients with rheumatic AS using prior validated International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 codes. Overlap propensity score weighting analysis was used to adjust for measured confounders. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality. Multiple secondary outcomes were also examined. RESULTS The final study cohort included 1,159 patients with rheumatic AS who underwent aortic valve replacement (SAVR, n = 554; TAVR, n = 605), and 88,554 patients with nonrheumatic AS who underwent TAVR. Patients in the SAVR group were younger and with lower prevalence of most comorbidities and frailty scores. After median follow-up of 19 months (interquartile range: 13 to 26 months), there was no difference in all-cause mortality with TAVR versus SAVR (11.2 vs. 7.0 per 100 person-year; adjusted hazard ratio: 1.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.84 to 2.79; p = 0.2). Compared with TAVR in nonrheumatic AS, TAVR for rheumatic AS was associated with similar mortality (15.2 vs. 17.7 deaths per 100 person-years (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.68 to 1.09; p = 0.2) after median follow-up of 17 months (interquartile range: 11 to 24 months). None of the rheumatic TAVR patients, <11 SAVR patients, and 242 nonrheumatic TAVR patients underwent repeat aortic valve replacement (124 redo-TAVR and 118 SAVR) at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Compared with SAVR, TAVR could represent a viable and possibly durable option for patients with rheumatic AS.","Mentias, Amgad; Saad, Marwan; Desai, Milind Y; Krishnaswamy, Amar; Menon, Venu; Horwitz, Phillip A; Kapadia, Samir; Sarrazin, Mary Vaughan",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,335,1

METHOD To audit this new way of working, feedback was collected from the doctors, interpreters, individuals being assessed, and senior medical and legal staff who reviewed the reports. This paper presents findings from the first 20 assessments. RESULTS Individuals assessed reported that the doctor developed good rapport, but in 35% of assessments reported that there were some experiences they felt unable to disclose. In 70% of assessments, doctors felt that rapport was not as good compared to face-to-face. In the majority of assessments, doctors were unable to gain a full account of the torture or its impact. They reported feeling cautious about pressing for more information on the telephone, mindful of individuals' vulnerability and the difficulty of providing support remotely. Nevertheless, in 85% of assessments doctors felt able to assess the consistency of the account of torture with the psychological findings, in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol (United Nations, 2004). Factors that hindered the assessment included the inability to observe body language, the person's ill health, and confidentiality concerns. CONCLUSION This research indicates that psychological medico-legal reports can safely be produced by telephone assessment, but are more likely to be incomplete in terms of both full disclosure of torture experiences and psychological assessment. The limitations underline the need for a follow-up face-to-face assessment to expand the psychological assessment as well as undertake a physical assessment.","Cohen, Juliet; Gregory, Bernadette; Newman, Kate; Rowe, Emily J; Thackray, Deborah",Torture : quarterly journal on rehabilitation of torture victims and prevention of torture,335,17

Important natural product depsipeptides include the piscicide antimycin, the K+ ionophores cereulide and valinomycin, the anticancer agent cryptophycin, and the antimicrobial kutzneride. Furthermore, database searches return hundreds of uncharacterized systems likely to produce novel depsipeptides. These compounds are made by specialised nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). NRPSs are biosynthetic megaenzymes that use a module architecture and multi-step catalytic cycle to assemble monomer substrates into peptides, or in the case of specialised depsipeptide synthetases, depsipeptides. Two NRPS domains, the condensation domain and the thioesterase domain, catalyze ester bond formation, and ester bonds are introduced into depsipeptides in several different ways. The two most common occur during cyclization, in a reaction between a hydroxy-containing side chain and the C-terminal amino acid residue in a peptide intermediate, and during incorporation into the growing peptide chain of an α-hydroxy acyl moiety, recruited either by direct selection of an α-hydroxy acid substrate or by selection of an α-keto acid substrate that is reduced in situ. In this article, we discuss how and when these esters are introduced during depsipeptide synthesis, survey notable depsipeptide synthetases and review insight into bacterial depsipeptide synthetases recently gained from structural studies.

Conservative treatment is insufficient for refractory seroma resolution. We report the results of surgical intervention for refractory donor-site seroma. Between January 2012 and April 2018, 319 patients undergoing breast reconstruction using an LD flap at our hospital were treated with conservative therapy if seroma was found. Refractory seroma of > 3 months' duration was observed in five patients (1.6%). Before surgery, the precise location and extent of the capsule were determined using chest computed tomography, and surgical intervention was planned. An en bloc capsulectomy was performed after confirming the internal capsule. Simultaneously, a quilting suture, bolster suture, and fibrin sealant were applied to prevent recurrence. The mean age of the patients with refractory seroma was 45.4 ( ± 7.3) years, and their mean body mass index was 31.0 ( ± 6.2) kg/m2. All patients underwent breast reconstruction with an extended LD flap or extended LD flap with a silicone implant after total mastectomy. During the follow-up period of ≥ 10.4 months, a mean of 34.4 ( ± 10.4) needle aspiration procedures were performed, and a mean of 12.8 ( ± 2.2) cc of seroma fluid was removed each time. Intraoperatively, the formation of a capsule with a well-defined border was confirmed; all patients showed complete resolution of donor-site seroma within 4 weeks after surgical intervention. Refractory donor-site seroma occurrence was rare in the cases assessed. Surgical intervention was successful in cases of refractory donor-site seroma unsuccessfully treated with conservative therapy and is thus one of the most effective methods for complete resolution of refractory seroma.Level of Evidence IV This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

In turn, an improved value of R_{skin}^{208} has been reported recently by the PREX collaboration. Exploiting the strong correlation between R_{skin}^{208} and the slope of the symmetry energy L within a specific class of relativistic energy density functionals, we report a value of L=(106±37) MeV-which systematically overestimates current limits based on both theoretical approaches and experimental measurements.

It is well-known that hospitals are environments with a high infectious risk. Environmental control of indoor air and surfaces becomes an important means of limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, to preserve an adequate indoor microbiological quality, an important non-pharmacological strategy is represented by Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and finishing materials. Starting from the SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes, the paper investigates the hospital risk analysis and management, the indoor air quality and determination of microbial load, surface management and strategies in cleaning activities, HVAC systems' management and filters' efficiency.

NORAD was highly expressed in A549/DDP cells compared with A549 cells. The MTT data showed that knockdown of NORAD enhanced the inhibition rate of cisplatin on the A549/DDP cells and decreased IC50 value. The colony formation and MTT assay suggested that cisplatin inhibited cell proliferation, and knockdown of NORAD enhanced the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on A549/DDP cells. Besides, we found that NORAD silence reduced the P-gp expression but not BCRP, LRP and MRP. Moreover, NORAD could directly bind to miR-202-5p, and ABCB1 was a target of miR-202-5p. The MTT assay found that miR-202-5p inhibitor reversed the effects of NORAD silence on cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP cells. Then, the Western blot data showed that knockdown of NORAD reduced P-gp expression, and miR-202-5p inhibitor enhanced P-gp expression. ABCB1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of NORAD knockdown on A549/DDP cells. Moreover, NORAD could directly bind to miR-202-5p, and ABCB1 was a target of miR-202-5p. Inhibition of miR-202-5p and overexpression of ABCB1 eliminated the effects of NORAD silence on cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP cells. Overexpression of miR-202-5p suppressed P-gp expression in A549/DDP cells.

Members of the archaeal family Methanoperedenaceae (formerly ANME-2d) have been demonstrated to couple AOM to the reduction of nitrate, iron, and manganese. Here, comparative genomic analysis of 16 Methanoperedenaceae metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), recovered from diverse environments, revealed novel respiratory strategies acquired through lateral gene transfer (LGT) events from diverse archaea and bacteria. Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses suggests that LGT has allowed members of the Methanoperedenaceae to acquire genes for the oxidation of hydrogen and formate and the reduction of arsenate, selenate, and elemental sulfur. Numerous membrane-bound multiheme c-type cytochrome complexes also appear to have been laterally acquired, which may be involved in the direct transfer of electrons to metal oxides, humic substances, and syntrophic partners.IMPORTANCE AOM by microorganisms limits the atmospheric release of the potent greenhouse gas methane and has consequent importance for the global carbon cycle and climate change modeling. While the oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea and bacteria is well documented, several other potential electron acceptors have also been reported to support AOM. In this study, we identify a number of novel respiratory strategies that appear to have been laterally acquired by members of the Methanoperedenaceae, as they are absent from related archaea and other ANME lineages. Expanding the known metabolic potential for members of the Methanoperedenaceae provides important insight into their ecology and suggests their role in linking methane oxidation to several global biogeochemical cycles.","Leu, Andy O; McIlroy, Simon J; Ye, Jun; Parks, Donovan H; Orphan, Victoria J; Tyson, Gene W",mBio,335,1

To this end, we augment the iso-flux tension propagation (IFTP) theory with electrostatics for a negatively charged biopolymer pulled through a nanopore embedded in a similarly charged anionic membrane. We show that in the realistic case of a single-stranded DNA molecule, dilute salt conditions characterized by weak charge screening, and a negatively charged membrane, the translocation dynamics is unexpectedly accelerated despite the presence of large repulsive electrostatic interactions between the polymer coil on the {\it cis} side and the charged membrane. This is due to the rapid release of the electrostatic potential energy of the coil during translocation, leading to an effectively attractive force that assists end-driven translocation. The speedup results in non-monotonic polymer length and membrane charge dependence of the exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the translocation time $\tau \propto N_0^\alpha$ of the polymer with length $N_0$. In the regime of long polymers $N_0\gtrsim500$, the translocation exponent exceeds its upper limit $\alpha=2$ previously observed for the same system without electrostatic interactions.","Sarabadani, Jalal; Buyukdagli, Sahin; Ala-Nissila, Tapio",Journal of physics.

We have aimed to determine (1) what is the methodological quality of recent SR/MA conducted to assess the efficacy of probiotics; (2) whether the results of SR/MA have a clinical application; and (3) what are factors associated with better quality and applicability of the SR/MA. We systematically searched 4 databases for SR/MA on the probiotics efficacy published in 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42020222716). The AMSTAR 2 tool and pre-defined authors' criteria were used to evaluate methodological quality and clinical applicability, respectively. A total of 114 SR/MA were appraised. In the case of 88 papers (77%), the overall confidence in the results was rated as ""critically low"". The most prevalent flaws were lack of list of excluded studies with justification (79.8%), lack of study protocol (60.5%), and problems with appropriate results combination(54.4%).

These functional properties of MSCs make them ideal candidates for the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a heterogenous disease that is typically characterized by inflammation, demyelination, gliosis and axonal loss. In the current study, an induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) murine model of MS was utilized. At peak disease onset, animals were treated with saline, placenta-derived MSCs (PMSCs), as well as low and high doses of PMSC-EVs. Animals treated with PMSCs and high-dose PMSC-EVs displayed improved motor function outcomes as compared to animals treated with saline. Symptom improvement by PMSCs and PMSC-EVs led to reduced DNA damage in oligodendroglia populations and increased myelination within the spinal cord of treated mice. In vitro data demonstrate that PMSC-EVs promote myelin regeneration by inducing endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells to differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. These findings support that PMSCs' mechanism of action is mediated by the secretion of EVs. Therefore, PMSC-derived EVs are a feasible alternative to cellular based therapies for MS, as demonstrated in an animal model of the disease.","Clark, Kaitlin; Zhang, Sheng; Barthe, Sylvain; Kumar, Priyadarsini; Pivetti, Christopher; Kreutzberg, Nicole; Reed, Camille; Wang, Yan; Paxton, Zachary; Farmer, Diana; Guo, Fuzheng; Wang, Aijun",Cells,335,12

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 among men and women with HIV in Miami FL, USA. We hypothesized that the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic will be higher for women , and psychological factors will increase COVID-19 burden among them. METHODS People with (n = 231) and without HIV (n = 42) residing in Miami, FL completed a survey assessing psychological outcomes such as loneliness, depression and stress, as well as the burden of COVID-19 on their daily lives. T-tests and Chi-square analyses were used to assess sex differences in study variables. Logistic regression was used to compare the interaction effects predicting stress and loneliness by COVID-19 burden and sex. RESULTS A total of 273 completed the survey; the outcomes of the study, loneliness and stress, did not differ by HIV status (p = .458 and p = 922). Overall, men and women reported similar prevalence of COVID-19 burden. However, a greater proportion of women reported losing childcare than men (18% vs 9%, p = 0.029, respectively), as well as losing mental health care (15% vs 7%, p = 0.049). There was a significant interaction between COVID-19 burden and sex for loneliness and stress such that the association between COVID-19 burden and loneliness was greater for women (p<0.001) than for men (p =0.353) and the association between COVID-19 burden and stress was greater for women (p = 0.013) than men (p = 0.628).

The double primer is composed of a 5'-modified fluorophore strand, which does not impact polymerase extension and a 3'-modified quencher strand, which cannot impact elongation. At the annealing temperature, the fluorophore strand combined with the template, extended and resulted in fluorescence signal release. Results showed that the double-strand primer relatively exhibits a wide annealing temperature range and good compatibility between three pairs of primers and probes. These merits allow the simple and multiplex real-time fluorescence quantification of nucleic acids. The detection limit was 400 copies/mL, and the detection time was approximately 2 h.

Higher levels of burnout are significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression symptoms. PURPOSE The current study was designed to estimate levels of burnout among Canadian nurses, examine the association between burnout and mental disorder symptoms, and identify characteristics that may increase the risk for reporting symptoms of burnout. METHOD Canadian nurses (n = 3257; 94.3% women) were surveyed online in both English and French. The survey assessed current symptoms of burnout and mental disorders (i.e., Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder). RESULTS Most nurses (63.2%) reported at least some symptoms of burnout and many (29.3%) reported clinically significant levels of burnout. Age and years of service were the only demographic variables that explained burnout rates. Participants reporting clinically significant levels of burnout were significantly more likely than participants with no burnout to screen positive for all mental disorders, but particularly for Major Depressive Disorder.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical impact of stent-dedicated flat panel volume CT angiography to evaluate intraoperatively the satisfactory deployment of flow-diverter stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2009 to April 2015, 83 consecutive patients (mean age, 51 years; 62 women) were treated in our institution with flow-diverter stents. Eighty-seven aneurysms (82 unruptured, 5 ruptured; 77 anterior, 10 posterior circulation) were treated in these 83 patients (4 patients had 2 aneurysms, both treated by means of flow-diverter stents). One patient was treated for a traumatic carotid cavernous fistula. In 80% of the cases (68/85) a flat panel volume CT angiography was performed in the angiographic suite just after the flow-diverter stent deployment. Stent visualization was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. The clinical impact of stent malapposition was evaluated. RESULTS Flow-diverter stent visualization was satisfactory in 73.5% of the cases. In 2 cases (2.9%) the flat panel volume CT angiography prompted the operator to perform an additional intrastent angioplasty for a condition that was previously underestimated. Four patients (4.7%) experienced acute thromboembolic complications; 3 others had delayed thromboembolic complications. Only 1 of these patients had thromboembolic complications (acute or delayed) related to stent misdeployment, which was easily managed intraoperatively with no clinical consequence. CONCLUSIONS Flat panel volume CT angiography is an interesting tool to depict flow-diverter stent misdeployment and may encourage the operator to perform intrastent angioplasty (2.9% of the cases in our experience) to reduce the risks of thromboembolic complications.","Clarençon, F; Di Maria, F; Gabrieli, J; Shotar, E; Degos, V; Nouet, A; Biondi, A; Sourour, N-A",AJNR.

However, the price to pay is a significant rate of both early and late colo-rectal toxicities, which may impact on survivors' quality of life. To reduce the incidence of such complications, we suggest a simple technique of pelvic radioprotection. MATERIALS AND METHODS An omental flap is created which is placed to fill the Douglas pouch to both increase the space between rectum and uterine cervix and prevent small bowel to fall in and to be exposed to radiation. In addition, a long sigmoid loop is retracted and fixed in the left paracolic gutter to prevent its irradiation as well. RESULTS From May 2011 to May 2012, 51 successive LACC patients were offered this procedure in addition of a laparoscopic staging. All but 2 with too small an omentum benefitted from omentoplasty, while sigmoidopexy was performed in all but one patient with a long and free sigmoid loop. No immediate adverse effect was observed. The volume of retro-uterine omental flap averaged 7.17 ± 3.79 cm(3). Sequential measurements of the utero-rectal space throughout CRT duration showed a real and durable increase in the distance between these organs, resulting in a drop in the dose of irradiation to recto-sigmoid. With 10 ± 4.5-month median follow-up, we did not observe any rectal or small bowel early or late adverse effects of CRT. CONCLUSIONS Although this series is preliminary, this simple procedure, feasible by laparoscopy (or laparotomy), seems effective to prevent recto-sigmoid as well as small bowel from radio-induced complications due to pelvic CRT.","Leblanc, E; Narducci, F; Bresson, L; Durand-Labrunie, J; Taieb, S; Vanlerenberghe, E; Farre, I; Nickers, P",Surgical endoscopy,335,1

Independent risk factors associated with the secondary outcome were age (OR 0.96, p = 0.073), BMI (OR 0.87, p = 0,13), P/F (OR 1.03, p < 0.001), and LUS score < 10 (OR 20.9, p = 0.006). ROC curve analysis was performed using an LUS score < 10 with an AUC 0.967. CONCLUSION The extent of lung abnormalities evaluated by LUS score is a predictor of a worse outcome, ETI, or death. Moreover, the LUS score could be an additional tool for the safe discharge of patient from the ER.","Tombini, Valeria; Di Capua, Mirko; Capsoni, Nicolò; Lazzati, Andrea; Bergamaschi, Marta; Gheda, Silvia; Ghezzi, Leonardo; Cassano, Giulio; Albertini, Valentina; Porta, Lorenzo; Zacchino, Massimo; Campanella, Carlo; Guarnieri, Linda; Cazzola, Katia Barbara; Velati, Marta; Di Domenico, Sandro Luigi; Tonani, Michela; Spina, Maria Teresa; Paglia, Stefano; Bellone, Andrea",Ultraschall in der Medizin,335,1

This study investigates the efficacy and safety of a virtual fracture clinic (VFC) as an alternative model of care for the management of acute injuries and musculoskeletal conditions in the Australian public hospital setting. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of consecutive emergency department (ED) referrals to the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery was conducted comparing outcomes prior to (November 2015-February 2017) and after (March 2017-June 2018) implementation of a VFC. The primary outcome measures assessed were the proportion of referrals virtually discharged and unplanned 30-day ED re-attendance rates. RESULTS A total of 737 (36.4%) referrals managed by the VFC were discharged without requiring orthopaedic outpatient clinic attendance. The rate of unplanned ED re-attendances was 5.2% post-VFC implementation compared to 6.5% at baseline (P = 0.01). VFC implementation was also associated with reductions in the average number of orthopaedic outpatient clinic attendances per referral (1.1 versus 1.7, P < 0.01) and the number of referrals lost to follow-up (7.2% versus 14.7%, P < 0.01). In addition, patient wait times for first contact by the orthopaedic team were significantly reduced from a median of 7 (IQR 5, 9) days to 2 (IQR 1, 3) days post-intervention (P < 0.01). No complications or adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that a VFC is applicable to the Australian healthcare system, and can lead to effective and safe provision of orthopaedic outpatient care.","Cavka, Bernarda; Cross, Emily; Montvida, Olga; Plunkett, George; Oppy, Andrew; Bucknill, Andrew; Treseder, Thomas",ANZ journal of surgery,335,1

Here, a dry ion-conducting elastomer with dynamic crosslinking structures is reported. The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C), self-healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self-healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion-conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.","Zhang, Panpan; Guo, Wenbin; Guo, Zi Hao; Ma, Yuan; Gao, Lei; Cong, Zifeng; Zhao, Xue Jiao; Qiao, Lijie; Pu, Xiong; Wang, Zhong Lin",Advanced materials,335,1

Delayed recognition and intervention may adversely affect outcome. For critically injured intubated patients, research shows that abnormally low end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) values correlate with need for blood transfusion, surgery, and mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate EtCO2 monitoring for patients triaged to lower-tier trauma activation. EtCO2 monitoring may aid in the recognition of patients who have greater needs than anticipated. This is a prospective observational study conducted at a Level I trauma center. Potential subjects presenting from the field were identified by lower-tier trauma activation for blunt mechanism. EtCO2 measurements acquired using nasal cannula sidestream technology were prospectively recorded in the trauma bay during the initial assessment. The medical record and trauma registry were queried for demographics, injury data, mortality, and critical resource data defined as intubation, blood transfusion, surgery, intensive care unit admission, and vasoactive medication infusion. EtCO2 data were obtained for 682 subjects during a 10.5-month period. Following exclusions, 262 patients were enrolled for data collection. EtCO2 values less than 30 mmHg were significantly associated with blood transfusion (p = .03) but not with other critical resources or mortality. Although capnography had limited utility for patients triaged to lower-tier trauma activation, EtCO2 values less than 30 mmHg correlated with blood transfusion, consistent with previous studies of critically injured intubated patients. EtCO2 monitoring is noninvasive and may serve as a simple prompt for earlier initiation of blood transfusion, a resource-intensive intervention.","Day, Darcy L; Terada, Kara E F; Vondrus, Philip; Watabayashi, Ruth; Severino, Richard; Inn, Holly; Ng, Karen",Journal of trauma nursing : the official journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses,335,16

A clearer understanding of which individuals are most at risk of over-eating during the lockdown period is needed to inform interventions that promote healthy diets and prevent weight gain during lockdowns. An online survey collected during the COVID-19 lockdown (total n=875; analysed n=588; 33.4±12.6 years; 82% UK-based; mostly white, educated, and not home schooling) investigated reported changes to the amount consumed and changes to intake of high energy dense (HED) sweet and savoury foods. The study also assessed which eating behaviour traits predicted a reported increase of HED sweet and savoury foods and tested whether coping responses moderated this relationship. Results showed that 48% of participants reported increased food intake in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. There was large individual variability in reported changes and lower craving control was the strongest predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake. Low cognitive restraint also predicted greater increases in HED sweet snacks and HED savoury meal foods. Food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional undereating, emotional overeating and satiety responsiveness were not significant predictors of changes to HED sweet and savoury food intake. High scores on acceptance coping responses attenuated the conditional effects of craving control on HED sweet snack intake. Consistent with previous findings, the current research suggests that low craving control is a risk factor for increased snack food intake during lockdown and may therefore represent a target for intervention.","Buckland, Nicola J; Swinnerton, Lucy F; Ng, Kwok; Price, Menna; Wilkinson, Laura L; Myers, Anna; Dalton, Michelle",Appetite,335,26

All healthy nonsyndromic patients with Class 3 deformity who were eligible for bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, were included in this before and after quasi-experimental study. This experiment's main intervention was mandibular setback surgery by bilateral sagittal split osteotomy plus maxillary advancement using LeFort 1 osteotomy. Age, sex, and intraoperative jaw movements were recorded. Acoustic analysis of voice samples (vowels /a/ and /i/) was performed with Praat software as outcome variables. The formant frequencies (F0, F1, F2, and F3) of these vowels were extracted 1 week preoperatively (T0), 1 and 6 months (T1, T2) postoperatively by a speech therapist. The significance level was set at 0.05 using SPSS 19. The study sample comprised 20 patients including 11 women (55%) and 9 men (45%) with a mean age of 31.95 ± 4.72 years. The average mandibular setback and maxillary advancement were 3.30 ± 0.86 and 2.85 ± 0.74 mm, respectively. The fundamental frequency (F0) and the first, second, and third formants (F1, F2, F3) of vowels /i/ and /a/ were significantly decreased over time intervals, postoperatively (P < 0.05). The finding revealed that bimaxillary orthognathic surgery (maxillary advancement and mandibular setback with bilateral sagittal split osteotomy) might reduce the acoustic formant parameters of voice to the normal frequency ranges, in patients with class 3 skeletal deformities. More clinical trials with greater sample sizes and long-term follow-ups are suggested in the future.","Emrani, Erfan; Ghaemi, Hamide; Labafchi, Ali; Samieirad, Sahand",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,335,16

As interoceptive sensitivity and underlying neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood, this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study assessed behavioural and neural responses to visceral stimuli in primary dysmenorrhoea (PMD). METHODS Women with PMD (N = 19) without psychological comorbidity and healthy women (N = 20) were compared with respect to visceral sensory and pain thresholds, and to neural responses to individually calibrated mildly painful and painful rectal distensions implemented during scanning. Trial-by-trial ratings of perceived intensity were accomplished with visual analogue scales (VAS). RESULTS Although women with dysmenorrhoea reported significantly higher chronic pain intensity and pain interference with daily life activities (p < 0.01, assessed with the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory), there were no differences between groups in visceral sensitivity and mean trial-by-trial VAS ratings were virtually identical. Analysis of neural responses revealed activation in brain regions previously shown to be involved in the processing of visceral stimuli with differences between painful and mildly painful stimulation, but no group differences were found even when using a liberal statistical threshold. CONCLUSIONS Dysmenorrhoea patients show unaltered perceptual and neural responses to experimental interoceptive stimuli. Despite limited sample size, these negative results argue against a generalized sensitization towards interoceptive stimuli in patients without psychological comorbidities. Future studies should clarify the role of psychosocial factors in central sensitization using more pain region-specific models in larger and clinically more heterogeneous samples. SIGNIFICANCE Despite higher chronic pain and pain interference with daily life activities, women with primary dysmenorrhoea do not differ from healthy women with respect to visceral sensitivity or neural processing of aversive interoceptive stimuli induced by rectal distensions. Generalized sensitization may be present only in subgroups with pronounced psychosocial or psychiatric disturbances.","Böttcher, Bettina; Gizewski, Elke R; Siedentopf, Christian; Steiger, Ruth; Verius, Michael; Riedl, David; Ischebeck, Anja; Schmid, Julia; Wildt, Ludwig; Elsenbruch, Sigrid",European journal of pain,335,31

We also show that statistical modelling of the trends in future ozone works well in reproducing the model output between 1900 and 2050. However, beyond 2050, and especially under large climate change scenarios, the statistical model results are in poorer agreement with the fully interactive Earth system model output. This suggests that additional processes occurring in the Earth system model such as changes in the production of ozone at higher temperatures or changes in the influx of ozone from the stratosphere, which are not captured by the statistical model, have a first order impact on the evolution of surface ozone over the twenty-first century. We show in a series of idealized box model simulations, with two different chemical schemes, that changes in temperature lead to diverging responses between the schemes. This points at the chemical mechanisms as being a source of uncertainty in the response of ozone to changes in temperature, and so climate, in the future. This underscores the need for more work to be performed to better understand the response of ozone to changes in temperature and constrain how well this relationship is simulated in models.

The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear. We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial. METHODS Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE ≤8 cm in length. Subjects (n = 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years. We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM. We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence. RESULTS Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria. Of those 119, 110 (92%) achieved CEIM. Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17%) had dysplasia recurrence. The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 8.8-20.7). The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 4.2-12.5). Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate. There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM. However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence. Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.","Cotton, Cary C; Wolf, W Asher; Overholt, Bergein F; Li, Nan; Lightdale, Charles J; Wolfsen, Herbert C; Pasricha, Sarina; Wang, Kenneth K; Shaheen, Nicholas J",Gastroenterology,335,1

We compared the preventive effects of a ventilatory strategy, aimed at decreasing pulmonary aspiration and enhancing mucus clearance versus the Trendelenburg position. DESIGN Prospective randomized animal study. SETTING Animal research facility, University of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS Twenty-four Large White-Landrace pigs. INTERVENTIONS Pigs were intubated and on mechanical ventilation for 72 hours. Following surgical preparation, pigs were randomized to be positioned: 1) in semirecumbent/prone position, ventilated with a duty cycle (TITTOT) of 0.33 and without positive end-expiratory pressure (control); 2) as in the control group, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O and TITTOT to achieve a mean expiratory-inspiratory flow bias of 10 L/min (treatment); 3) in Trendelenburg/prone position and ventilated as in the control group (Trendelenburg). Following randomization, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was instilled into the oropharynx. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mucus clearance rate was measured through fluoroscopic tracking of tracheal markers. Microspheres were instilled into the subglottic trachea to assess pulmonary aspiration. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was confirmed by histological/microbiological studies. The mean expiratory-inspiratory flow in the treatment, control, and Trendelenburg groups were 10.7 ± 1.7, 1.8 ± 3.7 and 4.3 ± 2.8 L/min, respectively (p < 0.001). Mucus clearance rate was 11.3 ± 9.9 mm/min in the Trendelenburg group versus 0.1 ± 1.0 in the control and 0.2 ± 1.0 in the treatment groups (p = 0.002). In the control group, we recovered 1.35% ± 1.24% of the instilled microspheres per gram of tracheal secretions, whereas 0.22% ± 0.25% and 0.97% ± 1.44% were recovered in the treatment and Trendelenburg groups, respectively (p = 0.031). Ventilator-associated pneumonia developed in 66.67%, 85.71%, and 0% of the animals in the control, treatment, and Trendelenburg groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The Trendelenburg position predominates over expiratory flow bias and positive end-expiratory pressure in the prevention of gravity-dependent translocation of oropharyngeal pathogens and development of ventilator-associated pneumonia. These findings further substantiate the primary role of gravity in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia.","Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Marti, Joan Daniel; Saucedo, Lina; Rigol, Montserrat; Roca, Ignasi; Cabanas, Maria; Muñoz, Laura; Ranzani, Otavio Tavares; Giunta, Valeria; Luque, Nestor; Esperatti, Mariano; Gabarrus, Albert; Fernandez, Laia; Rinaudo, Mariano; Ferrer, Miguel; Ramirez, Jose; Vila, Jordi; Torres, Antoni",Critical care medicine,335,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS We sought to characterize cardiovascular, hematological, and neurosensory manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and variants. Special attention was given to initial signs and symptoms to facilitate early diagnosis and therapy. Indications of ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) for cardiorespiratory support were evaluated. RESULTS Preliminary neurosensorial symptoms, such as anosmia and dysgeusia, are useful for diagnosis, patient isolation, and treatment. Early angiohematological acro-ischemic syndrome includes hand and foot cyanosis, Raynaud digital ischemia phenomenon, skin bullae, and dry gangrene. This was associated with neoangiogenesis, vasculitis, and vessel thrombosis related to immune dysregulation, resulting from ""cytokine storm syndrome"". The most dangerous complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation, with mortality risks for both children and adults. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 is a prothrombotic disease with unique global lethality. A strong inflammatory response to viral infection severely affects cardiovascular and neurological systems, as well as respiratory, immune, and hematological systems. Rapid identification of acro-ischemic syndrome permits the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation complications. Early sensorial symptoms, such as gustatory and olfactory loss, are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging, principally from United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. These variants seem to spread more easily and quickly, which may lead to more cases of COVID.","Chachques, J C; Mazzini, L; Mitrecic, D; Zavan, B; Rogante, M; Latremouille, C; Rustichelli, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,335,22

USP1 belongs to the cysteine protease family and contains a catalytic triad comprised of C90, H593, and D751. Notably, the catalytic activity of USP1 is stimulated through the formation of a tight complex with a WD40 repeat protein UAF1 (USP1-associated factor 1). Our kinetic analyses revealed a general base catalysis in USP1/UAF1, in contrast to an ion-pair mechanism as demonstrated for papain and cathepsin. The pK(a) value of the catalytic cysteine was determined to be 8.67 ± 0.07 in a pH-dependent inactivation study of USP1/UAF1 by iodoacetamide. A normal solvent kinetic isotope effect of 2.8 for k(cat) and 3.0 for k(cat)/K(m) was observed in the USP1/UAF1-catalyzed hydrolysis of ubiquitin-AMC substrate. Moreover, proton inventory analysis supported the transfer of a single solvent-derived proton in the transition state. Our study also revealed the molecular basis for the activation of USP1 by UAF1. Although the pK(a) of the catalytic cysteine in USP1 and USP1/UAF1 was almost identical, the pK(a) of the catalytic histidine in USP1/UAF1 was 0.43 pH unit lower than that in USP1, which facilitates general base catalysis at a neutral pH and contributes to the elevated catalytic efficiency. We ruled out that the higher catalytic efficiency is due to a tighter binding of ubiquitin. Our results support a regulatory mechanism in which UAF1 activates USP1 by modulating its active site conformation. This finding has a general implication for the regulation of USPs that form complex with partner proteins.","Villamil, Mark A; Chen, Junjun; Liang, Qin; Zhuang, Zhihao",Biochemistry,335,28

Therefore, it might be expected that an EGS service fields many consultations for postoperative patients. However, with the known overutilization of emergency department visits for nonurgent conditions, we hypothesized most postoperative consults received by an EGS service would be nonurgent and could be appropriately managed as an outpatient. METHODS We reviewed all EGS consults at a single urban safety net hospital over a 12-month period, screening for patients who had undergone surgery in the previous 12 mo. This included consultations from the emergency room and inpatient setting. Demographics, admission status, procedures performed, and other details were abstracted from the chart and Vizient reports. Consultation questions were categorized and then reviewed by an expert panel to determine if conditions could have been managed as an outpatient. RESULTS The EGS service received a total of 1112 consults, with 99 (9%) for a postoperative condition. Overall, 85% of postoperative consults were admitted after consultation, 19% underwent surgery and 21% underwent a procedure with gastroenterology or interventional radiology. Expert review classified slightly over one-third (36%) of consults as nonurgent. CONCLUSIONS Most postoperative consults seen at our urban safety net hospital represent true morbidity that required admission, intervention, or surgery. Despite this high acuity, one-third of postoperative consults could have been managed as an outpatient. Efforts to improve discharge instructions and set patient expectations could limit unnecessary postoperative emergency department visits.","Fiorentino, Michele; Mulles, Shanen; Cue, Lauren; Merchant, Aziz M; Tufariello, Ann; Cummings, Dustin; Onwubalili, Kenechi; Glass, Nina E",The Journal of surgical research,335,10

As more recent evidence suggests, however, their use is not always free of ischemic concerns in terms of covered arterial ostia. The authors sought to determine the frequency of silent and clinically evident diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-detected abnormalities related to stent placement as a means of elucidating potential clinical risks. METHODS This is a prospective single-center study on a series of patients with intracranial aneurysms that were treated with flow-diverting stents. All patients systematically underwent an MRI protocol that included DWI before treatment, between 24 and 48 hours postprocedure, and 3 months postembolization. Effectiveness of anticoagulation treatment was assessed for all patients. Lesions seen on DWI were correlated to the parent artery and the side-branch territories and were statistically analyzed in relation to their time of occurrence and clinical presentation. The authors compared the DWI findings in these patients to findings obtained in patients treated with a stent-assisted coiling technique during the same time period. RESULTS Over the course of 18 consecutive months, 38 consecutive patients (7 males and 31 females) with 49 intracranial aneurysms were treated using flow-diverting stents. Overall, 81.6% of the DWI spots found remained clinically silent during the follow-up period. Five ischemic clinical complications (13.2%) occurred in the postprocedural period. No statistically significant correlation could be established between DWI spots or aneurysm location and clinical complications or follow-up modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months. The complication rate was 7.8% (n = 3) at the 3-month follow-up, and mortality was 0%. Compared with stent-assisted coiling, use of flow-diverting stents showed a statistically significant correlation with silent DWI findings postintervention. CONCLUSIONS Lesions seen on DWI resulting from the procedure are far more common than anticipated, but the technique remains safe and effective, providing an interesting alternative for ""difficult"" aneurysms, regardless of location. Late-occurring DWI-detected lesions distal to side arterial branches imply a local pressure gradient drop, related to flow competition by collateral networks. Further research is needed to assess the extent and significance of these events.","Iosif, Christina; Camilleri, Yann; Saleme, Suzana; Caire, François; Yardin, Catherine; Ponomarjova, Sanita; Boncoeur-Martel, Marie-Paule; Mounayer, Charbel",Journal of neurosurgery,335,1

Using immunohistochemistry of cartilage sections, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot of chondrocyte extracts, we found that these cells express GPR30. Nonetheless, the pattern of bands detected by two distinct antibodies does not overlap, suggesting that the proteins detected represent partially degraded forms of the receptor. Treatment with GPR30 agonists did not induce Akt or ERK1/2 phosphorylation, two known GPR30-activated signaling pathways, suggesting that GPR30 is not functional in human chondrocytes. Therefore, the protective anti-osteoarthritic role of estrogen hormones in cartilage homeostasis is likely independent of GPR30.

It has been determined that normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) preservation decreases injury by minimizing cold ischemic storage. The impact of NEVKP on warm ischemic injury is unknown. METHODS We compared pig kidneys retrieved after 30 minutes warm ischemia and immediate transplantation (no-preservation) with grafts that were exposed to 30 minutes of warm ischemia plus 8-hour NEVKP or plus 8-hour static cold storage (SCS). RESULTS After transplantation, the NEVKP group demonstrated lower daily serum creatinine levels indicating better early graft function compared with no-preservation (P = 0.02) or SCS group (P < 0.001). In addition, NEVKP preserved grafts had a significantly lower grade of tubular injury and interstitial inflammation 30 minutes after reperfusion compared to grafts without any storage (injury score, NEVKP 1-2 vs no-preservation, 2-2, P = 0.029; inflammation score, NEVKP, 0-0.5 vs no-preservation, 1-2; P = 0.002), although it did not reach significance level when compared to the SCS group (injury score, 1-2, P = 0.071; inflammation score, 1-1; P = 0.071). Regeneration was assessed 30 minutes after reperfusion by Ki-67 staining. The NEVKP group demonstrated significantly higher number of Ki-67-positive cells: 9.2 ± 3.7 when compared with SCS group (3.9 ± 1.0, P = 0.015) and no-preservation group (4.2 ± 0.7, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS In this porcine model of donation after circulatory death kidney transplantation NEVKP reduced kidney injury and improved graft function when compared with no-preservation. The results suggest that NEVKP does not cause additional damage to grafts during the preservation period, but may reverse the negative effects of warm ischemic insult itself and promotes regeneration.","Hamar, Matyas; Urbanellis, Peter; Kaths, Moritz Johann; Kollmann, Dagmar; Linares, Ivan; Ganesh, Sujani; Wiebe, Aryn; Cen, Jun Yu; Yip, Paul; John, Rohan; Konvalinka, Ana; Mucsi, Istvan; Ghanekar, Anand; Bagli, Darius; Grant, David; Robinson, Lisa A; Selzner, Markus",Transplantation,335,1

Nonetheless, adherence to exercise is low and travel costs and time may limit participation and compliance. Training at home can help avoid these burdens and, as needed during the recent global pandemic (COVID-19), reinforce social distancing and reduce the risk of infection. However, training at home requires motivation and self-control and telerehabilitation is time-consuming for both patient and therapist. In recent years, there is growing use of virtual reality and exergaming to increase motivation and adherence for exercising with evidence of improvements in mobility and balance after using virtual reality in the clinic. Here, a novel telerehabilitation training program using a treadmill-virtual reality system for simultaneous training of two patients with Parkinson disease in their homes is described. Remote monitoring software enabled visual and auditory communication with the two patients, allowing the trainer to adapt the settings remotely and provide feedback. Participants received weekly training sessions over 1 yr. The findings show high adherence to training, increased walking duration throughout the sessions, and increased patient confidence, gait speed, and mobility. Training multiple participants simultaneously was feasible, enabling an individualized treatment approach while conserving therapist time.","Cornejo Thumm, Pablo; Giladi, Nir; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M; Mirelman, Anat",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,335,31

This study investigated the pattern of T790M testing after EGFR TKI treatment in a real-world setting in Japan. METHOD This prospective observational study enrolled patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced/metastatic NSCLC who reported disease progression during treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs. Data regarding sampling methods for T790M mutation testing (plasma sample, cytology or tissue biopsy) and the treatment strategies after disease progression were recorded prospectively. RESULTS A total of 236 patients were included in the study (female, 67.4%; median age, 73.0 years), and 205 patients (86.9%) underwent rebiopsy by any of the three possible methods: plasma sampling in 137 patients (58.1%) and tissue/cytology sampling in 68 patients (28.8%) during the first rebiopsy. Overall, 80.6% of the tissue/cytology samples contained tumor cells, and 40% of these samples were positive for the T790M mutation. T790M mutations were detected in only 19.7% of plasma samples. Of the 199 patients who underwent T790M testing, 61 (30%) tested positive, and 56 (91.8%) subsequently received osimertinib. CONCLUSION Among the 87% of Japanese patients who underwent rebiopsy after progressing on treatment with a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI, approximately 30% tested positive for the T790M mutation and were eligible to receive osimertinib. Although plasma sampling is non-invasive, this rebiopsy method is less sensitive for T790M detection compared with tissue or cytology sampling (UMIN identifier: UMIN000024928).

Although the three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has been successful in the field of surgery, there are not many studies in the field of anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a 3D airway model for prediction of the correct ETT size, and compare the results with a conventional age-based formula in pediatric patients. Methods Thirty five pediatric patients under 6 years of age who were scheduled for congenital heart surgery. In the pre-anaesthetic period, the patient's computed tomography (CT) images were converted to STL (Standard Triangle Language) files using the 3D conversion program. An FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) type 3D printer was used to print 3D airway models from the sub-glottis to the upper carina. ETT size was selected by inserting various sized cuffed-ETTs to a printed 3D airway model. Results The 3D method selected the correct ETT size in 21 out of 35 pediatric patients (60%), whereas the age-based formula selected the correct ETT size in 9patients (26%). Conclusions Prediction of correct size ETTs using a printed 3D airway model has demonstrated better results than the age-based formula. In particular, the selection of ETT size using a printed 3D airway model may be feasible for helping minimize re-intubation attempts and complications in the patients with congenital heart disease or an abnormal range of growth and development.","Park, Seyeon; Ahn, Jisoo; Yoon, Sung Uk; Choo, Ki Seok; Kim, Hye-Jin; Chung, Minwoo; Kim, Hee Young",Korean journal of anesthesiology,335,31

Reasons for this ongoing surge in Shanxi province, both imported and autochthonous infected cases, are currently unclear and demand urgent investigation. In this paper, we developed a SEIQR difference-equation model of COVID-19 that took into account the transmission with discrete time imported cases, to perform assessment and risk analysis. Our findings suggest that if the lock-down date in Wuhan is earlier, the infectious cases are fewer. Moreover, we reveal the effects of city lock-down date on the final scale of cases: if the date is advanced two days, the cases may decrease one half (67, 95% CI: 66-68); if the date is delayed for two days, the cases may reach about 196 (95% CI: 193-199).

Recent reports demonstrate that mitochondria regulate cancer cell death through energy metabolism and that different types of cell death coexist in vivo. We showed that EA inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation, markedly decreased ATP levels, decreased the potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane and decreased oxygen consumption in vitro. In addition, EA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduced HIF-1α in lung cancer cells. Moreover, the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with EA dramatically inhibited tumor growth, increased p-AMPK and suppressed HIF-1α levels. These findings suggest that EA could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent that targets mitochondrial metabolism in lung cancer.","Duan, Jing; Li, Yuxiang; Gao, Huihan; Yang, Donghui; He, Xuan; Fang, Yulin; Zhou, Guangbiao",Food & function,335,24

Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic methods were used with highly active 3CLpro to characterize the reaction mechanism. We show that 3CLpro has mechanistic features common and disparate to the archetypical proteases papain and chymotrypsin. The kinetic mechanism for 3CLpro-mediated ester hydrolysis, including the individual rate constants, is consistent with a simple double displacement mechanism. The pre-steady-state burst rate was independent of ester substrate concentration indicating a high commitment to catalysis. When homologous peptidic amide and ester substrates were compared, a series of interesting observations emerged. Despite a 2000-fold difference in nonenzymatic reactivity, highly related amide and ester substrates were found to have similar kinetic parameters in both the steady-state and pre-steady-state. Steady-state solvent isotope effect (SIE) studies showed an inverse SIE for the amide but not ester substrates. Evaluation of the SIE in the pre-steady-state revealed normal SIEs for both amide and ester burst rates. Proton inventory (PI) studies on amide peptide hydrolysis were consistent with two proton-transfer reactions in the transition state while the ester data was consistent with a single proton-transfer reaction. Finally, the pH-inactivation profile of 3CLpro with iodoacetamide is indicative of an ion-pair mechanism. Taken together, the data are consistent with a 3CLpro mechanism that utilizes an ""electrostatic"" trigger to initiate the acylation reaction, a cysteine-histidine catalytic dyad ion pair, an enzyme-facilitated release of P1, and a general base-catalyzed deacylation reaction.","Solowiej, James; Thomson, James A; Ryan, Kevin; Luo, Chun; He, Mingying; Lou, Jihong; Murray, Brion W",Biochemistry,335,17

Solithromycin has demonstrated efficacy in adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and has also been investigated in pediatric patients. The objective of this study was to develop a framework for leveraging physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to predict CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential in the pediatric population using solithromycin as a case study. To account for age, we performed in-vitro metabolism and time-dependent inhibition studies for solithromycin for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. The PBPK model included CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolism and time-dependent inhibition, glomerular filtration, P-glycoprotein transport, and enterohepatic recirculation. The average fold error of simulated and observed plasma concentrations of solithromycin in both adults (1966 plasma samples) and pediatric patients from 4 days to 17.9 years (684 plasma samples) were within 0.5-2.0-fold. The geometric mean ratios for the simulated area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) extrapolated to infinity were within 0.75-1.25-fold of observed values in healthy adults receiving solithromycin with midazolam or ketoconazole. DDI potential was simulated in pediatric patients (1 month to 17 years of age) and adults. Solithromycin increased the simulated midazolam AUC 4-6-fold, and ketoconazole increased the simulated solithromycin AUC 1-2-fold in virtual subjects ranging from 1 month to 65 years of age. This study presents a systematic approach for incorporating CYP3A in-vitro data into adult and pediatric PBPK models to predict pediatric CYP3A-mediated DDI potential. Significance Statement Using solithromycin as a case study, we present a framework for investigating and incorporating CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 in-vitro data into adult and pediatric PBPK models to predict CYP3A-mediated DDI potential across the pediatric age continuum during drug development. In this study, minor age-related differences in inhibitor concentration resulted in differences in the magnitude of the DDI. Therefore, age-related differences in DDI potential for substrates metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 can be minimized by closely matching adult and pediatric inhibitor concentrations.","Salerno, Sara N; Carreño, Fernando O; Edginton, Andrea N; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael; Gonzalez, Daniel",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,335,20

We assessed whether engineered autologous cartilage grafts allow safe and functional alar lobule restoration. METHODS In a first-in-human trial, we recruited five patients at the University Hospital Basel (Basel, Switzerland). To be eligible, patients had to be aged at least 18 years and have a two-layer defect (≥50% size of alar subunit) after excision of non-melanoma skin cancer on the alar lobule. Chondrocytes (isolated from a 6 mm cartilage biopsy sample from the nasal septum harvested under local anaesthesia during collection of tumour biopsy sample) were expanded, seeded, and cultured with autologous serum onto collagen type I and type III membranes in the course of 4 weeks. The resulting engineered cartilage grafts (25 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm) were shaped intra-operatively and implanted after tumour excision under paramedian forehead or nasolabial flaps, as in standard reconstruction with native cartilage. During flap refinement after 6 months, we took biopsy samples of repair tissues and histologically analysed them. The primary outcomes were safety and feasibility of the procedure, assessed 12 months after reconstruction. At least 1 year after implantation, when reconstruction is typically stabilised, we assessed patient satisfaction and functional outcomes (alar cutaneous sensibility, structural stability, and respiratory flow rate). FINDINGS Between Dec 13, 2010, and Feb 6, 2012, we enrolled two women and three men aged 76-88 years. All engineered grafts contained a mixed hyaline and fibrous cartilage matrix. 6 months after implantation, reconstructed tissues displayed fibromuscular fatty structures typical of the alar lobule. After 1 year, all patients were satisfied with the aesthetic and functional outcomes and no adverse events had been recorded. Cutaneous sensibility and structural stability of the reconstructed area were clinically satisfactory, with adequate respiratory function. INTERPRETATION Autologous nasal cartilage tissues can be engineered and clinically used for functional restoration of alar lobules. Engineered cartilage should now be assessed for other challenging facial reconstructions.

For adult women, the burden of being responsible for the majority of the household labor and the rise in unmarried parenting are likely explanations for why increased paid work opportunities have not resulted in a decrease in the gender gap in depression.

A previously proposed score for Stroke Prognostication Using Age and NIHSS Stroke Scale (SPAN) indicated that SPAN-100-positive patients (ie, age + NIHSS score = 100 or more) do not benefit from IV-tPA. If this finding holds true for endovascular therapy, this score can impact patient selection for such interventions. This study investigated whether a score combining age and NIHSS score can improve patients' selection for endovascular stroke therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The SPAN index was calculated for patients in the prospective Solitaire FR Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization study: an international single-arm multicenter cohort for anterior circulation stroke treatment by using the Solitaire FR. The proportion with favorable outcome (90-day mRS score ≤2) was compared between SPAN-100-positive versus-negative patients. RESULTS Of the 202 patients enrolled, 196 had baseline NIHSS scores. Fifteen (7.7%) patients were SPAN-100-positive. There was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3) between SPAN-100-positive versus -negative groups (93.3% versus 82.8%, respectively; P = .3). Stroke SPAN-100-positive patients had a significantly lower proportion of favorable clinical outcomes (26.7% versus 60.8% in SPAN-100-negative, P = .01). In a multivariable analysis, SPAN-100-positive status was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P = .04). A higher baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score and a short onset to revascularization time also predicted favorable outcome in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS A significantly lower proportion of patients with a positive SPAN-100 achieved favorable outcome in this cohort. SPAN-100 was an independent predictor of favorable outcome after adjusting for time to treatment and the extent of preintervention tissue damage according to the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score.","Almekhlafi, M A; Davalos, A; Bonafe, A; Chapot, R; Gralla, J; Pereira, V M; Goyal, M",AJNR.

Learning such patterns may enable accurate perceptual organization. In five experiments, we investigated the behavioral and neural signatures of rapid perceptual learning of regular sound patterns. We show that recurring (compared to novel) patterns are detected more quickly and increase sensitivity to pattern deviations and to the temporal order of pattern onset relative to a visual stimulus. Sustained neural activity reflected perceptual learning in two ways. Firstly, sustained activity increased earlier for recurring than novel patterns when participants attended to sounds, but not when they ignored them; this earlier increase mirrored the rapid perceptual learning we observed behaviorally. Secondly, the magnitude of sustained activity was generally lower for recurring than novel patterns, but only for trials later in the experiment, and independent of whether participants attended to or ignored sounds. The late manifestation of sustained activity reduction suggests that it is not directly related to rapid perceptual learning, but to a mechanism that does not require attention to sound. In sum, we demonstrate that the latency of sustained activity reflects rapid perceptual learning of auditory patterns, while the magnitude may reflect a result of learning, such as better prediction of learned auditory patterns.","Herrmann, Björn; Araz, Kurdo; Johnsrude, Ingrid S",NeuroImage,335,16

One of the steps that can be chosen is by utilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from animal venom by targeting the specific receptor of SARS-CoV-2, namely the main protease (Mpro). Through this research, a computational approach will be conducted to predict antiviral activity, including protein-peptide docking using PatchDock algorithm, to identify, evaluate, and explore the affinity and molecular interactions of four types of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as Mucroporin, Mucroporin-M1, Mucroporin-S1, and Mucroporin-S2 derived from scorpion venom (Lychas mucronatus) against main protease (Mpro) SARS-CoV-2. These results were then confirmed using protein-peptide interaction dynamics simulations for 50 ns using Gromacs 2016 to observe the molecular stability to the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Based on protein-peptide docking simulations, it was proven that the Mucroporin S-1 peptides have a good affinity against the active site area of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with an ACE score of −779.56 kJ/mol. Interestingly, Mucroporin-S1 was able to maintain the stability of its interactions based on the results of RMSD, RMSF, and MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations.

The proportion of participants with adverse events at the vaccination site (immediately or within 30 minutes after vaccination) was 0.5%, and anaphylaxis occurred in one female student (0.03%). We analyzed 1,877 data obtained from a questionnaire survey of 1,993 vaccinated individuals. Eighty-two percent of participants complained of local adverse events. Injection site pain was the most common local adverse event (71%). Systemic adverse events occurred in 48% of participants. The most common adverse event was myalgia (34%). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine risk factors. Local adverse events were associated with sex (female) and allergy history, with odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 2.15 (1.69-2.73) and 1.73 (1.10-2.74), respectively. Systemic adverse events were associated with sex (female), age (<20 years old), allergy history, and history of adverse events with previous medications, with ORs (95% CI) of 2.49 (2.03-3.06), 1.80 (1.44-2.24), 1.39 (1.03-1.89), and 1.53 (1.02-2.29). The results of this study clarified for the first time that age less than 20 years is a risk factor for systemic adverse events from the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna Intramuscular Injection. This information will give impacts on considering adverse events and its mechanisms in mRNA vaccination.","Suehiro, M.; Okubo, S.; Nakajima, K.; Kanda, K.; Hayakawa, M.; Oiso, S.; Kabashima, T.; Fujita, H.; Ando, Y.; Muro, T.",,335,24

We found that most of the filamentary structures in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission do not show a global preferential orientation either parallel or perpendicular to the Galactic plane. However, we found ranges in Galactic longitude and radial velocity where the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO filamentary structures are parallel to the Galactic plane. These preferential orientations are different from those found for the HI emission.

The point-like curvature profile, obtained by means of the Chern-Simons currents, can be used to infer the position of the given mutations within the genetic string.

Publicly shared data during an outbreak often suffers from two sources of misreporting (underreporting and delay in reporting) that should not be overlooked when estimating epidemiological parameters. The main statistical challenge in models that intrinsically account for a misreporting process lies in the joint estimation of the time-varying reproduction number and the delay/underreporting parameters. Existing Bayesian approaches typically rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that are extremely costly from a computational perspective. We propose a much faster alternative based on Laplacian-P-splines (LPS) that combines Bayesian penalized B-splines for flexible and smooth estimation of the time-varying reproduction number and Laplace approximations to selected posterior distributions for fast computation. Assuming a known generation interval distribution, the incidence at a given calendar time is governed by the epidemic renewal equation and the delay structure is specified through a composite link framework. Laplace approximations to the conditional posterior of the spline vector are obtained from analytical versions of the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood, implying a drastic speed-up in the computation of posterior estimates. Furthermore, the proposed LPS approach can be used to obtain point estimates and approximate credible intervals for the delay and reporting probabilities. Simulation of epidemics with different combinations for the underreporting rate and delay structure (one-day, two-day and weekend delays) show that the proposed LPS methodology delivers fast and accurate estimates outperforming existing methods that do not take into account underreporting and delay patterns. Finally, LPS is illustrated on two real case studies of epidemic outbreaks.","Gressani, O.; Faes, C.; Hens, N.",,335,24

However, outlets with different political slants, when talking about the same news story, usually emphasize various aspects and choose their language framing differently. This framing implicitly shows their biases and also affects the reader's opinion and understanding. Therefore, understanding the framing in the news stories is fundamental for realizing what kind of view the writer is conveying with each news story. In this paper, we describe methods for characterizing moral frames in the news. We capture the frames based on the Moral Foundation Theory. This theory is a psychological concept which explains how every kind of morality and opinion can be summarized and presented with five main dimensions. We propose an unsupervised method that extracts the framing Bias and the framing Intensity without any external framing annotations provided. We validate the performance on an annotated twitter dataset and then use it to quantify the framing bias and partisanship of news.","Mokhberian, Negar; Abeliuk, Andr'es; Cummings, Patrick; Lerman, Kristina",,335,25

The crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. In this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and Upwork workers---as well as 2 expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between public opinion and expert consensus. Examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. From these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content.","Bhuiyan, Md Momen; Zhang, Amy X.; Sehat, Connie Moon; Mitra, Tanushree",,335,16

With an established history of burnout amongst health-care workers (HCWs), it is important that the NHS recognises the impact of mental well-being. Studies have shown that those who perform, or experience acts of kindness experience a greater feeling of well-being. We wanted to discover the way in which acts of kindness impacted on our team during the busiest times of the pandemic, and if we could improve well-being during emotionally draining times. 15 HCWs were interviewed over 4 weeks at the peak of the pandemic during May 2020 to discuss their feelings of working within our intensive care unit, their motivation, and acts of kindness they had seen or directly received.All interviewees had witnessed or received acts of kindness that had boosted their morale. They also recognised acts of kindness they had done for themselves, including self-care, hobbies and wider support networks. It is these acts of kindness that are often overlooked but have a strong evidence base for its impact on the well-being of staff. Actively integrating acts of kindness within our teams can improve overall morale and motivation to work, even during times of unprecedented stress. Examples included clinicians taking the time to check in on staff, including more formal sessions. Informal conversations, dedicated team work and shared debriefs played a vast role in helping our team identify stressors and what one could do to help.We believe leadership should not just be task-based, but rather team-focused.

Patients often have recurrent and chronic open wounds, but one of the major barriers to the development of clinical trials is the lack of understanding of the natural history of RDEB wounds, as the measurement of target wound change has not been studied prospectively or validated. We conducted a longitudinal, clinical observational study of 10 patients with RDEB who used a mobile phone photography application, with built-in machine learning, to outline and track RDEB wounds autonomously. Patients used this mobile application to capture photographs weekly, alongside reporting associated pain and itch. 507 photos of 10 participants with RDEB were collected: 202 of chronic open wounds (unhealed >12 weeks) and 290 of recurrent wounds (heal but re-open), with an average of 44.7 wound photos per participant. The top three locations recorded were hips or legs (n=241), feet (n=115) and upper extremity (n=82). For chronic open wounds, there was a statistically significant positive correlation for both wound size and pain (0.76, p<0.001), and wound size and itch (0.74, p<0.001). Recurrent wounds also had a significant association between wound size and pain and itch, but the strength of the correlation was weaker;pain (0.37, p<0.0009), itch (0.32, p<0.005). Neither wound types significantly healed over an average follow up time of 95.5 days. This validated previously known information about the nature of RDEB wounds, and we found that use of a mobile application can be a valuable method to track the natural history. The covid-19 travel restrictions have shown the value of being able to obtain weekly wound images whilst participants are at home. The challenges we faced included encouraging regular submission of wound photographs, loss-to-follow up due to enrollment in other clinical trials, and technical difficulties associated with using the application.","Fulchand, S.; Harris, N.; Li, S.; Tang, J.",Journal of Investigative Dermatology,335,13

Managing the risks that arise from changes in the climate over the coming months, years and decades is one of the most pressing challenges that society faces, but there are also some opportunities. The provision and use of climate information in decision-making (i.e. climate services) are central to managing the risks and opportunities. In this article we describe the seemingly complex climate service landscape, the actors in it, what the services are used for, and what next, to help stimulate further action to enable society to reduce risks and realise benefits, particularly timely as the world looks ahead to build a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on the path to net zero emissions. Through a consideration of the value chain for climate services, we emphasise the importance of dialogue and collaboration between those developing, providing and using climate information in decision-making, and stress that a climate service is only worth delivering if it is going to be used by someone to influence an outcome. Co-production can be highly useful for enabling the dialogue and collaborating across the value chain, helping create services based on credible, salient and legitimate knowledge.","Hewitt, Chris D.; Stone, Roger",Climate Services,335,7

Confronted with environmental deterioration, economic disruptions, wars, and civil unrest, we are challenged to engage in coherent conversations that could lead to collective action, based on a shared understanding. Instead, we are enmeshed in polarized narratives, competing agendas, and emotional conflict. The uneven response to the global COVID-19 pandemic is but the most recent example of this lack of unity. As we seek to find our way in this increasingly complex social landscape, one of the best potential sources for learning about social systems and communication in conflict has gone largely unexamined. For nearly two decades, Military veterans of many nations have struggled while returning from wartime service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite best efforts to welcome these service members home and provide access to educational and health benefits, many of them report a difficulty in relating to fellow citizens and institutions upon their return. One indicator of this sense of alienation is the growing number of suicides among this population, now exceeding the number of casualties of combat service itself. Thwarted ability to communicate with others outside of the military and veterans community, and therefore participate in post-service social life, is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor for suicide. It has never been easy for military veterans to talk about combat experiences. However, the levels of social isolation we are seeing now points toward a deeper and more systemic issue that is not necessarily connected to specific experiences of combat trauma, but instead rooted in real or perceived cultural and moral misalignments associated with difficult experiences in both service and post-serve transition. The longer term effects of thwarted communication and social isolation of veterans, or the feeling of not fitting in can lead to further damage to the underlying moral structures, manifesting as moral conflict (Pearce and Littlejohn, 1997) or moral injuries (Shay, 2014). These moral injuries may include perceived personal failings or culpability based on specific combat experiences, or more generally, a sense of futility in the political limitations of military missions, or perceived betrayals of trust by those in authority. Additionally, stressors and misalignments in the transition process around homecoming are likely as much of a factor as combat experience in creating moral injuries. Many veterans point to a lack of shared values and principles among citizens, and within social institutions and media, as one reason for the difficulty of post-service reintegration. Moral injuries in this sense have further existential implications, with important (but often unheard) messages for our entire society. These are not simple issues that can be addressed by our current array of social work or clinical interventions, or by altering narratives and messages. Rather, they demand a full and interdisciplinary engagement in collective assessment and meaning-making at the society level. As a way of inviting communication scholars into this conversation, I present several models drawn from the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) Theory (Pearce, 2007) to look at the way that moral conflict and moral injuries are made or socially constructed in misaligned communication between returning service members and families, institutions, and others at both the population level and in community settings. Mental health implications are drawn Adlerian psychology, a body of psychological theory that is intersubjectively oriented, and shares a relational or social constructionist orientation with CMM. I then discuss the significance of these intersections in communication and mental health theory and practice, and implications for looking more closely at social connections and communication as key components of well-being and coherence.","Buechner, B.

Objective: To investigate the intention of parents to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 and the factors influencing this intention. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional study in Greece and we collected data during the first week of September 2021. A convenience sample was used by collecting questionnaires through social media. Our study population included adult parents with children aged 12-17 years who were eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Study population included 813 parents with a mean age of 42.3 years. Among parents, 36% reported that they will vaccinate their children against the COVID-19, 33.5% denied vaccination and 30.5% were undecided. Concerns about the safety, effectiveness and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines were the most important reasons for decline of COVID-19 vaccination. Parents who took the flu vaccine in 2020 and those who had more knowledge and fewer concerns about COVID-19 vaccines had a greater probability to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19. Increased self-perceived severity of COVID-19, and increased trust in COVID-19 vaccines and the government regarding the information about the COVID-19 vaccines were associated with parents intention to vaccinate their children. However, increased knowledge regarding COVID-19 was associated with decreased intention of parents to vaccinate their children. Conclusions: Parents intention to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 was low. Our findings could contribute to the development of target strategies to implement adherence to COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","Galanis, P.

Hotels are the most common form of accommodation for tourists and the hotel industry is intricately to tourism. A review of the academic literature indicates that existing research is primarily focused on sustainability in tourism, but very few studies have analysed the environmental dimension of sustainability in hotels in Australia, an important facet of the Australian tourism industry. The paper presents the findings of the influence of stakeholders on environmentally sustainable policies and practices (ESPPs) in the Australian hotel industry. One-on-one interviews were conducted with hotel managers as a representative sample of Australian hotels in Melbourne, Australia. The selected sample for the research comprised managers who manage approximately 60 hotels. The data was collected through in-depth interviews. It was then transcribed, coded, and analysed with NVIVO, a computer-aided qualitative data analysis software program. The sample size ensured representation by different segments of the hotel industry to include international chain-affiliated hotels, Australian chain-affiliated hotels and independent hotels. An analysis of the findings suggests that owners and shareholders are the biggest influencers as their investment takes primary importance. Other key stakeholders such as guests generally play a secondary role in influencing the ESPPs of hotels. ESPPs should lead to well-intentioned initiatives and practices that are undertaken by stakeholders to create drivers for change to contribute to environmental sustainability.","Khatter, Ajay White Leanne Pyke Joanne McGrath Michael",Sustainability,335,24

Next to the more common forms like video and audio conference calls, telepresence solutions are also becoming more popular. Telepresence robots can be remotely driven and allow, with the help of cameras and displays on the robot and the users’ side, face-to-face communication with onsite personal, establishing a remote telepresence. Depending on the model, the height of the robot can be adjusted by the remote user. Even though the effect of the height in relation to onsite people is being researched, the effect on the users’ side has not been examined immensely. Therefore, this work examines the effect of the difference in height between a telepresence robot and its user on the users’ spatial awareness. Subjects have experienced the usage of a telepresence robot driving at a fixed height through a video. Afterwards, they filled out a questionnaire, which asks the user to answer questions about the experience. These questions were regarding the spatial awareness of the user in the remote location, asking them to estimate different parts of the tour. Their estimations were mapped to the users’ height, allowing to correlate the difference in height and the users’ spatial awareness. The work has shown, that only the perceived height of the telepresence robot was affected by the difference in size. However, more tests have to be conducted, to factor in multiple robot heights. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gawron, O.; Keller, L.; Huffstadt, K.; Müller, N.

The PVG can manage the uncertainty, connected to the unpredictable and unspecified data of all real-world problems, in which fuzzy graphs (FGs) will not conceivably ensue into generating adequate results. The limitations of previous definitions in FGs have led us to present new definitions in PVGs. Domination is one of the highly remarkable areas in fuzzy graph theory that have many applications in medical and computer sciences. Therefore, in this study, we introduce distinctive concepts and properties related to domination in product vague graphs such as the edge dominating set, total dominating set, perfect dominating set, global dominating set, and edge independent set, with some examples. Finally, we propose an implementation of the concept of a dominating set in medicine that is related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shi, X. L.; Kosari, S.",Frontiers in Physics,335,12

We set up video clinics from end of March 2020 using Webex initially and then Attend Anywhere when this became available in July 2020. We also arranged supplies of rescue antibiotics at home and arranged to collect cough swabs from patients’ doorsteps. Objectives: To obtain feedback from parents on the cystic fibrosis service provided during COVID-19 pandemic, including virtual clinics, and to get their opinion about use of virtual cystic fibrosis clinics post COVID-19. Methods: Short questionnaire was devised and e-mailed to parents in January 2021. Results: 23 of 26 questionnaires have been returned to date. 100% were very satisfied with service provided during the COVID-19 pandemic and 78%were very satisfied, with 17% satisfied with use of virtual consultations. Mean score for ease of use of Attend Anywhere was 9.4 out of 10. 74% were very satisfied and 22% satisfied that their needs were met via virtual consultations. 39% were very satisfied, 35% satisfied with alternate virtual and face-to-face clinic appointments post-COVID-19. Concerns were raised around no clinical examination and delays in replacing physiotherapy equipment with virtual appointments. Areas suggested for improvement included the ability to do lung function at home. Conclusion: Parents were supportive of the use of virtual clinics during COVID-19 but there were mixed views with continuing virtual clinics post-COVID-19.","Powell, M.; Rees, R.; John, L.; Street, R.; Evans, R.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,335,16

We planned an evaluation in a lab session under mixed conditions, i.e. students could choose between attending physically or virtually. We used the PANAS questionnaire, which allows assessing 20 emotions, classified into positive and negative. The outcomes show that students experienced higher emotional levels for positive emotions than negative. Furthermore, students who attended face-to-face scored stronger emotions. After the session, all students decreased their negative emotional levels, with the students who attended physically also experiencing an increase in positive emotions.

However, in a wide range of experimental settings in particular for studies in infectious or brain-related diseases, human samples cannot be easily obtained. Hence, due to their close developmental, immunological and neurological proximity with humans, non-human primates are used in many research fields of human diseases and for preclinical research. Few studies have used DNA methylation microarrays in simian models. Microarrays designed for the analysis of DNA methylation patterns in the human genome could be useful given the genomic proximity between human and nonhuman primates. However, there is currently information lacking about the specificity and usability of each probe for many nonhuman primate species, including rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), originating from Asia, and African green monkeys originating from West-Africa (Chlorocebus sabaeus). Rhesus macaques and African green monkeys are among the major nonhuman primate models utilized in biomedical research. Here, we provide a precise evaluation and re-annotation of the probes of the two microarrays for the analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these two Cercopithecidae species. We demonstrate that up to 162,000 of the 450K and 255,000 probes of the EPIC BeadChip can be reliably used in Macaca mulatta or Chlorocebus sabaeus. The annotation files are provided in a format compatible with a variety of preprocessing, normalization and analytical pipelines designed for data analysis from 450K/EPIC arrays, facilitating high-throughput DNA methylation analyses in Macaca mulatta and Chlorocebus sabaeus. They provide the opportunity to the research community to focus their analysis only on those probes identified as reliable. The described analytical workflow leaves the choice to the user to balance coverage versus specificity and can also be applied to other Cercopithecidae species.","Pichon, Fabien; Busato, Florence; Jochems, Simon; Jacquelin, Beatrice; Le Grand, Roger; Deleuze, Jean-Francois; Müller-Trutwin, Michaela; Tost, Jörg",bioRxiv,335,7

The study identified internal and external factors affecting the psychological state of teachers. The correlation between the harmony of the teacher's personality and successful labor activity has been substantiated. In the course of the work, the problem of changing the technical equipment of participants in the educational process during an emergency and close to it was revealed. As a result of the research, the author came to a well-grounded conclusion that the psychological state of the participants in the learning process has a significant impact on the educational process when organizing distance learning. The most significant in this regard is the psychoemotional state of the teacher as the organizer of the process and mentor.

In many cases, and for a variety of reasons, NSAGs perform some form of governance in these territories, which can include the maintenance of order or the provision of justice, health care, or social services. The significance of such measures became particularly apparent when in 2020 not only governments but also armed groups took steps to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article examines key legal issues that arise in these contexts. First, it analyzes the extent to which international humanitarian law protects the life and dignity of persons living under the control of NSAGs, rebutting doubts as to whether this field of international law has a role in regulating what is sometimes called “rebel governance”. Second, it provides a brief overview of aspects of the lives of people in armed group-controlled territory that are addressed by international humanitarian law and aspects that instead fall into the realm of human rights law. Third, the article discusses whether and to what extent human rights law can be said to bind NSAGs as a matter of law and flags issues that need further attention in current and future debates. © The Author(s), 2021.

Although lockdown plays an important role, at the same time, it can adversely affect the psychological health of the population. In addition, because of stay at home order, people are more inclined to use the media which can further aggravate the mental health issues in population. This study was planned to study the perceived psychological issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Methods: An online social survey was conducted using semi-structured questionnaire, participants were added through snowball sampling technique. Results: A total of 455 people (264 females and 191 males) participated in the study. Majority of participants 228 (50.1%) felt stressed out during coronavirus lockdown period. Female gender was associated with greater negative psychological impact of lockdown. Most participants 263 (57.8%) were worried about the health of the loved ones.

Barotrauma is one such complication, with reports of spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX) and pneumomediastinum. We present a case series of four patients with severe C-ARDS, complicated by subcutaneous emphysema and mediastinal emphysema with and without pneumothroracies, which required supportive care, except one patient with PTX. Of the four patients only one patient was discharged alive. C-ARDS can induce lung injury, resulting in subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema, which may not represent a PTX as etiology. The exact mechanism of subcutaneous emphysema and mediastinal emphysema without pneumothoracies in the setting of severe C-ARDS has not been clearly elucidated. Two plausible mechanisms may be related to the “Macklin effect” vs. type I and II pneumocyte breakdown when infected by COVID-19. Strategies used to minimize worsening of subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema with and without pneumothoracies, may be to minimize positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), continue to maintain a lung protective strategy (LPS), while utilizing a higher fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration. In the majority of cases, supportive care is usually required, unless PTX presents or tension pneumomediastinum develops, at which time treatment with a thoracostomy tube placement may be necessary or cardiothoracic surgery consultation may be warranted, to perform “gills” procedure. © Journal of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine.

The type III secretion system 1 of the marine pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, utilizes the sequential action of four effectors to induce a rapid, pro-inflammatory cell death uniquely characterized by a pro-survival host transcriptional response (2, 3). Herein, we show that this pro-survival response is caused by the action of the channel-forming effector VopQ that targets the host V-ATPase resulting in lysosomal deacidification and inhibition of lysosome-autophagosome fusion. Recent structural studies have shown how VopQ interacts with the V-ATPase and, while in the ER, a V-ATPase assembly intermediate can interact with VopQ causing a disruption in membrane integrity. Additionally, we observe that VopQ-mediated disruption of the V-ATPase activates the IRE1 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) resulting in an IRE1-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. We also find that this early VopQ-dependent induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is terminated by the VopS-mediated inhibitory AMPylation of Rho GTPase signaling. Since VopS dampens VopQ-induced IRE1-dependent ERK1/2 activation, we propose that IRE1 activates ERK1/2 phosphorylation at or above the level of Rho GTPases. This study illustrates how temporally induced effectors can work as in tandem as agonist/antagonist to manipulate host signaling and reveal new connections between V-ATPase function, UPR and MAPK signaling. Importance Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. para) is a seafood-borne pathogen that encodes two Type 3 Secretion Systems (T3SS). The first system T3SS1 is thought to be maintained in all strains of V. para to to maintain survival in the environment, whereas the second sytem T3SS2 is linked to clinical isolates and disease in humans. Herein, we find that first system targets evolutionarily conserved signaling systems to manipulate host cells, eventually causing a rapid, orchestrated cells death within three hours. We have found that the T3SS1 injects virulence factors that temporally manipulate host signaling. Within the first hour of infection, the effector VopQ acts first by activating host surval signals while diminishing the host cell apoptotic machinery. Less than an hour later, another effector VopS reverses activation and inhibition of these signaling systems ultimately leading to death of the host cell. This work provides example of how pathogens have evolved to manipulate the interplay between T3SS effectors to regulate host signaling pathways.","De Nisco, Nicole J.; Casey, Amanda K.; Kanchwala, Mohammed; Lafrance, Alexander E.; Coskun, Fatma S.; Kinch, Lisa N.; Grishin, Nick V.; Xing, Chao; Orth, Kim",bioRxiv,335,9

Photometrically, SN 2020ank is one of the brightest SLSN ($M_{g,peak}$ $\sim$ $-$21.84 $\pm$ 0.10 mag), having fast pre-peak rising and post-peak decaying rates. The bolometric light curve of SN 2020ank exhibits a higher peak luminosity ($L_{max}$) of $\sim$(3.9 $\pm$ 0.7) $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and appears to be symmetric around the peak with $L^{rise}_{max}$/e $\approx$ $L^{fall}_{max}$/e $\approx$ 15 d. The semi-analytical light-curve modelling using the MINIM code suggests a spin down millisecond magnetar with $P_i$ $\sim$2.2 $\pm$ 0.5 ms and $B$ $\sim$(2.9 $\pm$ 0.1) $\times$ $10^{14}$ G as a possible powering source for SN 2020ank. The possible magnetar origin and excess ultraviolet flux at early epochs indicate a central-engine based powering source for SN 2020ank. Near-peak spectra of SN 2020ank are enriched with the W-shaped O II features but with the weaker signatures of C II and Fe III. Using the estimated rise time of $\sim$27.9 d and the photospheric velocity of $\sim$12050 km s$^{-1}$, we constrain the ejecta mass to $\sim$7.2 $M_{\odot}$ and the kinetic energy of $\sim$6.3 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg.

The water-abstraction points included two groundwater storage tanks, namely Tank 1 and Tank 2 and the Khandanama river. Indicator microbial counts for total coliforms, faecal coliforms, enterococci, and heterotrophic bacteria exceeded the limit for no risk as stipulated by the South African water-quality guidelines for domestic use for Tank 1 and the Khandanama river. Vibrio, Salmonella, and Shigella species were prevalent in the Khandanama river. The spatial distribution of diarrhoea cases showed a hot-spot of diarrhoea cases close to Tank 1 and the Khandanama river. Results of chi-square analysis showed that the proportion of infection from each water source was different or that infection depends on the type of water source (α=0.05). The demonstrated spatial clustering of diarrhoea cases might have been influenced by the poor microbial quality of water used from Tank 1 and the Khandanama river. The results further highlight the urgent need of water-treatment facilities and monitoring of water quality in rural communities of South Africa.","Bessong, Pascal O.; Odiyo, John O.; Musekene, Justice N.; Tessema, Abera",J Health Popul Nutr,335,5

The pathogenesis of these turkey origin reoviruses (TRVs) was evaluated in commercial and specific pathogen free (SPF) turkey poults and SPF chickens. Mortality, clinical disease, gross lesions, microscopic lesions and body weights were observed. TRVs replicated poorly and did not cause disease in chickens. Clinical disease induced by the TRV isolates, characterized by diarrhoea and depression, was mild in both SPF and commercial origin poults. Several TRV isolates caused moderate to severe bursal atrophy in poults. Additionally, each of the TRV isolates caused significant body weight decreases in SPF and/or commercial poults as compared with sham inoculates. Molecular characterization of the isolates revealed that the TRVs and chicken origin reoviruses had identical electropherotype profiles.","Spackman, Erica; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary; Day, J Michael; Sellers, Holly",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,335,1

Replacement of the amino acid residues from the transmembrane domain (TM) Cys-16, Gln-23, Cys-29, and Tyr-33 by Leu (FT3np) caused a shift in enzyme localization to the plasma membrane. The mislocalization caused a dramatic decrease in the amount of biosynthetic products of FT3wt, the Lewis determinants. Determination of the expression levels on the surface with mutants of the enzyme, where one, two, or three of these residues were replaced by Leu, suggested that Cys from the TM was required for the localization of FT3 in the Golgi. Furthermore, Cys-23 and Cys-29 mediated the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers but not higher molecular weight oligomers. In vitro reconstitution of intra-Golgi transport showed that FT3wt was incorporated into coatomer protein (COP) I vesicles, contrary to FT3np. These data suggested that Cys, Gln, and Tyr residues are important for FT3wt sorting into the transport vesicles possibly due to interactions with other membrane proteins.","Sousa, Victor L; Brito, Catarina; Costa, Teresa; Lanoix, Joel; Nilsson, Tommy; Costa, Julia",The Journal of biological chemistry,335,14

We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical and laboratory data of 234 patients admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Singapore General Hospital. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 21 years, 31.6% of patients were males and 41.8% were healthcare workers. At presentation, the common symptoms were fever, myalgia, cough and headache; rhinorrhoea was uncommon. On admission, 21% had leukopenia, 18% had thrombocytopaenia, 29% had hyponatraemia, 31% had hypokalaemia, 21% had transaminitis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of respiratory and stool samples provided the best yield at the end of the first week of illness. Thirty-two patients were initially not recognised as probable SARS and were reclassified when the serology test results were available. The chief reasons for not identifying these patients early were persistently normal chest X-rays (68.8%), very mild presentation (43.8%) and the presence of a concomitant illness (12.5%). Overall, 12% of the patients were probable SARS with atypical presentations. Overall mortality was 11.8%.

Macrophages activated by intraperitoneal injection of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), showed both extrinsic antiviral activity and high nitrite production in contrast to non-activated, resident macrophages. The extrinsic antiviral activity was observed in cultures of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2. The NO inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate (l-NMA) impaired the antiviral activity of HSV-elicited macrophages. The effect was dose dependent and correlated with a reduction of nitrite in the culture media. The effect of l-NMA was reversed by the addition of l-arginine. These data indicate that NO could be responsible for the described activity. Furthermore, l-NMA treatment resulted in the aggravation of HSV-1-induced keratitis in the mouse model, supporting a defensive role of NO in the pathogenesis of HSV-1 corneal infection.","Benencia, F; Courreges, M C",Immunology,335,17

METHODS This is a retrospective ecological study. Data of daily emergency hospital admissions to 15 major hospitals in HK for asthma and indices of air pollutants [sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 microm particulate matter (PM(10)) and 2.5 microm (PM(2.5))] and meteorological variables from January 2000 to December 2005 were obtained from several government departments. Analysis was performed by the generalized additive models with Poisson distribution. The effects of time trend, season, other cyclical factors, temperature and humidity were adjusted. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected. RESULTS Altogether, 69 716 admissions were assessed. Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for asthma and levels of NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5). The relative risks (RR) for hospitalization for every 10 microg/m(3) increase in NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5) were 1.028, 1.034, 1.019 and 1.021, respectively, at a lag day that ranged from cumulative lag 0-4 to 0-5. In a multi-pollutant model, O(3) was significantly associated with increased admissions for asthma. The younger age group (0-14 years) tended to have a higher RR for each 10 microg/m(3) increase in pollutants than those aged 15-65 years. The elderly (aged >/=65 years) had a shorter 'best' lag time to develop asthma exacerbation following exposure to pollutants than those aged <65 years. CONCLUSION Adverse effects of ambient concentrations of air pollutants on hospitalization rates for asthma are evident. Measures to improve air quality in HK are urgently needed.","Ko, F W S; Tam, W; Wong, T W; Lai, C K W; Wong, G W K; Leung, T-F; Ng, S S S; Hui, D S C",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,335,1

One explanation is the fear of complications due to anastomotic dehiscence in oesophagojejunal anastomosis known to carry high morbidity and mortality. The introduction of staplers have contributed to making anastomosis safer and easier to perform and has facilitated more advanced laparoscopic surgery. In open surgery, most surgeons use a circular stapler for oesophagojejunal anastomosis or a hand sutured technique. Both techniques are difficult to use in laparoscopic surgery, especially if the oesophagus is narrow. To facilitate the creation of oesophagojejunal anastomoses, we have adopted a technique with a linear stapled anastomosis. Our method is based on a stapling technique where the oesophagus is divided above the gastric cardia followed by a oesophagojejunostomy performed with Covidien's new Endo GIA-60™ Ultra Universal stapler. The residual opening is closed with a 3-0 re-absorbable suture. PATIENTS AND METHODS From June 2009 to May 2012, 14 men and 16 women (median age=66 years, range=39-84 years) underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy due to gastric cancer. RESULTS One patient died during hospital stay; corresponding to a postoperative mortality of 3,3%. Leakage in the oesophagojejunal anastomosis occurred in three patients (10%). Two of the patients with leakage in the oesophagojejunal anastomosis had an additional duodenal bulb leakage, which might have caused anastomotic dehiscence. The patients had a median postoperative hospital stay of six days (range=3-156 days). Six patients had a re-operation due to complications, including one endoscopic stent application in the anastomosis. CONCLUSION Even though a leakage rate of 10% can be considered high, this study describes a simple method for performing oesophagojejunostomy after gastrectomy by a laparoscopic approach independently of the width of the oesophagus. This study also shows that laparoscopic gastrectomy can be performed in more advanced stages of gastric cancer.","Petersen, Torben Ingemann; Pahle, Einar; Sommer, Thorbjørn; Zilling, Thomas",Anticancer research,335,26

The ORF must remain open throughout most of its sequence for replication to occur. To determine the qualitative importance of the N portion of the chimeric ORF in DI RNA replication, transcripts of mutated reporter-containing constructs were tested for replication in helper virus-infected cells. It was determined that the N ORF could not be replaced by the naturally occurring internal I protein ORF, accomplished by deleting the first base in the N start codon which leads to a +1 frameshift, nor could it be replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ORF. Furthermore, 3'-terminal truncations of the N gene leaving less than 85% of its total length were likewise not tolerated. Small in-frame deletions and in-frame foreign sequence insertions of up to 99 nucleotides within certain regions of the N ORF were tolerated, however, but the rate of DI RNA accumulation in these cases was lower. These results indicate that there is a requirement for translation of most if not all of the N protein in cis for optimal replication of the bovine coronavirus DI RNA and suggest that a similar requirement may exist for viral genome replication.","Chang, R Y; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,335,1

Poverty has been cited by the World Health Organization as a major force driving the development of antimicrobial resistance. In developing countries, factors such as inadequate access to effective drugs, unregulated dispensing and manufacture of antimicrobials, and truncated antimicrobial therapy because of cost are contributing to the development of multidrug-resistant organisms. Within the United States, poverty-driven practices such as medication-sharing, use of ""leftover"" antibiotics, and the purchase and use of foreign-made drugs of questionable quality are likely contributing to antimicrobial resistance. However, there is currently a dearth of studies in the United States analyzing the socioeconomic and behavioral factors behind antimicrobial resistance in United States communities. Further studies of these factors, with an emphasis on poverty-driven practices, need to be undertaken in order to fully understand the problem of antimicrobial resistance in the United States and to develop effective intervention to combat this problem.","Planta, Margaret B",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,335,9

The role of infections in COPD exacerbations is controversial. OBJECTIVES We investigated whether COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization are associated with viral and/or bacterial infection and evaluated relationships among infection, exacerbation severity, assessed by reduction of FEV1, and specific patterns of airway inflammation. METHODS We examined 64 patients with COPD when hospitalized for exacerbations, and when in stable convalescence. We measured lung function, blood gases, and exhaled nitric oxide, and examined sputum for inflammation and for viral and bacterial infection. RESULTS Exacerbations were associated with impaired lung function (p < 0.01) and increased sputum neutrophilia (p < 0.001). Viral and/or bacterial infection was detected in 78% of exacerbations: viruses in 48.4% (6.2% when stable, p < 0.001) and bacteria in 54.7% (37.5% when stable, p = 0.08). Patients with infectious exacerbations (29.7% bacterial, 23.4% viral, 25% viral/bacterial coinfection) had longer hospitalizations (p < 0.02) and greater impairment of several measures of lung function (all p < 0.05) than those with noninfectious exacerbations. Patients with exacerbations with coinfection had more marked lung function impairment (p < 0.02) and longer hospitalizations (p = 0.001). Sputum neutrophils were increased in all exacerbations (p < 0.001) and were related to their severity (p < 0.001), independently of the association with viral or bacterial infections; sputum eosinophils were increased during (p < 0.001) virus-associated exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory infections are associated with the majority of COPD exacerbations and their severity, especially those with viral/bacterial coinfection. Airway neutrophilia is related to exacerbation severity regardless of viral and/or bacterial infections. Eosinophilia is a good predictor of viral exacerbations.","Papi, Alberto; Bellettato, Cinzia Maria; Braccioni, Fausto; Romagnoli, Micaela; Casolari, Paolo; Caramori, Gaetano; Fabbri, Leonardo M; Johnston, Sebastian L",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,335,1

The development of resistance in enterococci and staphylococci has stimulated the search for new derivatives with improved activity, particularly against strains resistant to conventional derivatives. Three of these, obtained by hemi-synthesis starting from natural compounds, are now in clinical development (oritavancin and telavancin, as derivatives of vancomycin; and dalbavancin, as a derivative of teicoplanin). The presence of a lipophilic tail on these molecules results in them having a prolonged half-life. It also modifies their mode of action, conferring to them a concentration-dependent bactericidal activity. Their spectrum of activity includes methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains for oritavancin and telavancin). Ongoing clinical studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of these molecules for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and bactereamia, in a once-daily (oritavancin, telavancin) or once-weekly (dalbavancin) scheme of administration.

DESIGN : The authors conducted a cross-sectional study. METHODS : From February to July 2003, men who attended 10 participating gay bars in five cities in Jiangsu Province were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire, including measures of alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors. Blood samples and urethral swabs were taken to examine the presence of STDs, including HIV infection. RESULTS : A total of 144 men were recruited in the study. Forty-six percent of men reported unprotected anal intercourse with their male sexual partners in the past 3 months. No one was found to be HIV-infected, but the prevalence of STDs was high: gonorrhea 2.7%, chlamydial infection 8.0%, nonchlamydial nongonococcal urethritis 27.7%, active syphilis 6.9%, hepatitis B virus infection 9.1%, herpes simplex virus-2 infection 7.8%, and genital warts 13.2%. CONCLUSIONS : Given that HIV prevalence among MSM in some other parts of China has been as high as 3%, STDs facilitate the transmission of HIV, and high prevalence of STDs and sexual risk behaviors among MSM exist in Jiangsu Province, the potential for the future spread of HIV is of concern, and it is urgent to provide MSMs with STD healthcare services and HIV/AIDS/STD prevention education and intervention.","Jiang, Juan; Cao, Ningxiao; Zhang, Jinping; Xia, Qiang; Gong, Xiangdong; Xue, Huazhong; Yang, Haitao; Zhang, Guocheng; Shao, Changgeng",Sexually transmitted diseases,335,16

The behavior of the general public will probably have the most important bearing on the course of the disease over the next few months in India. We aim to study the awareness, attitudes and perceptions of COVID-19 among the adult Indian population. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the 'Google Survey Forms' between 29th March and 14th April 2020 and distributed through email and various social media groups. Results There were 1502 respondents, majority were male (56.7%), between 30-49 years (47.7%). 90% of the respondents had either an undergraduate or postgraduate degree, with a third of them being in the healthcare sector (34.6%). Most of the respondents were aware of the common symptoms of COVID-19, but worryingly only a third (31%) were aware of the risk of spread from infected asymptomatic individuals, which is a major concern in India. Majority were aware of the modes of virus transmission, but only two-thirds (68.6%) were aware of the safe physical distance (6 feet) for maintain social distancing. A majority of respondents were appreciative of the government interventions in containing the virus spread and would support further extension of lockdown if necessary. Conclusion Despite limitations of generalizability, this survey has identified areas which the public health authorities need to target in future information campaigns.","Hakeem, Abdul Rahman; Baskaran, Kavin; Chandrasekaran, Sruti; Menon, Jagadeesh; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Rela, Mohamed",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,335,3

SARS-CoV-2 is an etiological mediator of coronavirus 2 (COVID-19), characterized by pneumonic contagion in human beings. In spite of forceful suppression, this virus has spread worldwide. No specific drugs have been approved by the FDA for treating COVID-19 patients. Objective The study intended to examine the data from studies on clinical management of COVID-19. Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. The sources of data included bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, Embase, PsychINFO, WanFang Data, and PubMed. The search terms were treatment of the novel coronavirus, management of nCoV-19, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. Setting The study took place in the main library of the University of Sargodha in Sargodha, Pakistan. Results The study identified 42 unique studies that had reported and confirmed over 1500 cases of nCoV-19 by April 21, 2020. The studies found that clinical management, for patients who presented with symptoms, included supportive care and control measures that comprised mechanical ventilator support and supplementary oxygen. Conclusions There have been intensive attempts to explore drug therapy for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection during this COVID-19 pandemic. Several drugs have been identified which including remdesivir, two antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and immunosuppressive agents. The effects of most drug interventions are currently highly uncertain and several drugs and vaccines are under trail for the effective treatment of COVID-19 virus, until an effective treatment will discover social distancing and physical hygiene should be practiced strictly.","Nazir, Saeed Ur Rashid; Nazir, Taha; Sultana, Misbah; Shamim, Rahat; Riaz, Humayun; Sultana Munir, Safia; Kayani, Ruqaiya Rasheed; Manzoor, Saba; Islam, Azharul",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,335,1

Adjuvant TaibUVID nutritional supplements are promising home-made or hospital-made supplements suggested for rapidly preventing and treating COVID-19 pandemic. We report here a 44 years old male physician who caught COVID-19 infection at hospital in Egypt with confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Ethical committee approval and informed patient's consent were gained before performing this study. Chest X-ray revealed increased bronchovascular markings. Close follow-up was done with no treatment given and he was sent for home isolation. Few days later, he developed progressive non-productive cough and a sense of difficult breathing with no associated fever or chest pain. An antitussive drug was given to him. The patient read about TaibUVID supplements from social media and started to feel improvement after TaibUVID inhalation therapy (using the heated solution of nigella sativa and chamomile five times a day). He also received a home-made TaibUVID nutritional supplement (nigella sativa, chamomile and natural honey) five times daily for four consecutive days. The next day, he was quite better with mild symptoms. Two days later, nasopharyngeal swab PCR was negative while other patients still had positive nasopharyngeal swabs. As few attacks of mild cough and breathing difficulty existed, he was admitted to hospital. A nasopharyngeal swab PCR was done for him again and the result was negative also. Blood gases were normal. He had lymphocytosis (possibly due to TaibUVID effects) that counteract lymphopenia seen in COVID-19 patients. Biochemical and hematological evaluation were quite normal apart from increased serum chloride and lactate dehydrogenase. There was a mild decrease in serum CO2 and alkaline phosphatase. Chest CT report revealed symmetrically inflated both lungs with non-specific focal nodular infiltrates (scattered in basal and medial lung segments) in left lower lobes with faint ground glass opacities. He was discharged home. Few days later, he was quite improved with no symptoms and returned to his work comfortably. In conclusion, TaibUVID nutritional supplements may be effective in rapidly changing the nasopharyngeal swab PCR from positive to negative. TaibUVID nutritional supplements are advisable as a natural, safe and effective prophylaxis to stop COVID-19 infectiousness, transmission and emergence of new cases. Clinical studies to investigate TaibUVID nutritional benefits are strongly recommended. TaibUVID may be promising and recommended for public prophylaxis to decrease emergence of new COVID-19 cases.","El Sayed, Salah Mohamed; Aboonq, Moutasem Salih; Aljehani, Yasmeen Talal; Hassan, Mohammad Ahmad; Abou El-Magd, Rabab M; Abdelrahman, Abdelrahman I; El-Tahlawi, Rehab; Nabo, Manal Mohamed Helmy; Yousef, Reda S; Mahmoud, Ahmed Alamir; Elsayed, Yasser Yahia; Abu-Elnaga, Mostafa; Soliman, Tamer M; Abdel-Gawad, Abdelhady Ragab; Elshazley, Momen; Baghdadi, Hussam; El-Sawy, Samer; Mahmoud, Hany Salah; El-Anzi, Mariam E; Alharbi, Mansour Barakah",American journal of blood research,335,16
201417,201417,201417,Elective surgery in the time of COVID-19,17.185005,5.3388047,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in late 2002 and the recent outbreaks of avian influenza in Asia are timely reminders of the ever present risks from respiratory viral diseases. Apart from influenza, there are no vaccines and very few antiviral chemotherapeutic agents available for the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections-the most common cause of human illness. If the current H5N1 avian influenza outbreak ever assumes the role of a pandemic, formidable technical difficulties relating to the properties of the agent, itself, will ensure that vaccines will only become available after a significant lead time and then only to a relatively small percentage of the population. The use of existing antivirals could be critical in limiting the initial spread of a pandemic, although their use in the control of epidemics caused by nonpandemic viruses has not been evaluated. It is against this background that a review of recent developments in respiratory antivirals has been undertaken. RECENT FINDINGS The late 1990s were a period of unprecedented activity in the development of new and much superior antivirals for the treatment of influenza infections. However, during the past 2 to 3 years and largely for commercial reasons, there has been a decline in interest in their further development by major drug companies. This situation may soon change with the possible advent of new pandemic viruses, and moves are afoot in several countries to consider the stockpiling of antivirals. The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, remain the only options for controlling respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses, although the latter two could not be used against very recent H5N1 strains. There are several other neuraminidase inhibitors in development. Compounds with activity against other respiratory viruses, notably rhinoviruses, are also in development, many based on a newer knowledge of viral protein structure and function (rational drug design). SUMMARY The following is an overview of recent papers on the further development of neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza viruses and on recent development of newer antivirals against RSV and rhinoviruses. Where possible, comparisons are made with existing antivirals. For considerations of space, this review has been structured around stages in the replication cycle of significant respiratory viruses that have been traditionally used as targets for inhibition.","Brooks, Megan J; Sasadeusz, Joseph J; Tannock, Gregory A",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,335,33

The objective of the present study was to determine whether PRRSV and/or anti-PRRSV antibodies were present in oral fluids at diagnostic levels. The level and duration of PRRSV and anti-PRRSV antibodies in serum and oral fluids was evaluated in 3 age groups of pigs (4, 8, or 12 weeks of age) inoculated with a type 2 (North American) PRRSV isolate. Serum, buccal swabs, and pen-based oral fluid samples were collected for 63 days following inoculation. Specimens were assayed for PRRSV by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and for anti-PRRSV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was detected by real-time qRT-PCR in serum for approximately 5 weeks and in oral fluids for approximately 4 weeks postinoculation. Pig age at the time of inoculation had no effect on the quantity or duration of virus in oral fluid samples. Low levels of anti-PRRSV antibody were detected in oral fluid samples by ELISA and IFAT. Although the approach remains to be validated in the field, the results of this experiment suggest that pen-based oral fluid sampling could be an efficient, cost-effective approach to PRRSV surveillance in swine populations.","Prickett, John; Simer, Robert; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Evans, Richard B; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",335,24

We have focused on the differences between our surgical activity in an Emergency General Surgery department in ""Cardarelli"" Hospital in Naples. METHODS This retrospective study compared the patients treated from March 9, 2020 to April 27, 2020 (Italian lockdown time) and the patients treated in the same period of 2019. We recruited 75 patients in Group A (2020) and 165 patients in Group B (2019). RESULTS There was a reduction in hospitalizations for non-trauma disease (69 in group A and 122 in group B with p: 0.001), a reduction in transfers from other hospitals (2 patients in group A and 17 in group B with p. 0.04) and a reduction in hospitalizations for trauma disease (6 in group A and 43 in group B with p: 0.001). The severity of the disease in 2020 was greater than in the same period in 2019 and there was a higher rate of high-grade complications CONCLUSION: From data analysis, we conclude that there has been a reduction in hospitalizations and surgical interventions in our emergency surgery department. The patients, however, had a much more severe disease that resulted in a greater number of complications in the peri and post-operative time.

Molecular modeling demonstrated that the catalytic residues of mNsp15 are superimposable with its severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ortholog. Alanine substitutions at three key residues in the mNsp15 catalytic pocket (H262, H277, and G275) and a double-mutant version (H262P and H277A) generated proteins with greatly reduced but detectable endoribonuclease activities. Furthermore, these mutant proteins demonstrated lower cleavage specificities for uridylate than wild-type (WT) mNsp15. These mutations were successfully incorporated into viruses named vH262A, vH277A, vG275A, and vH262P+H277A. All four mutant viruses formed plaques with diameters similar to that of MHV-A59 1000 (WT virus) on several different cell lines. Interestingly, viruses with a mutation at a noncatalytic residue, D324A, could not be recovered despite repeated attempts, and expression of mNsp15 containing the D324A mutation in Escherichia coli resulted in an insoluble protein. Plaques derived from vH262A produced approximately 6- to 13-fold fewer PFU than those from WT virus. Cells infected with mNsp15 mutant viruses accumulated lesser amounts of plus- and minus-sense subgenomic RNAs and spike protein than WT virus. The expression of mNsp15 in trans by transient transfection partially restored RNA synthesis by vH262A. These results demonstrate that mNsp15 is required for optimal infection by MHV.","Kang, Hyojeung; Bhardwaj, Kanchan; Li, Yi; Palaninathan, Satheesh; Sacchettini, James; Guarino, Linda; Leibowitz, Julian L; Kao, C Cheng",Journal of virology,335,16

The purpose of the current study was to determine the serological prevalence of past COVID-19 infection in a cohort of municipal law enforcement (LE) and firefighters (FFs). METHODS: Descriptive analysis of a de-identified data reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG), or COR2G, serology results for municipal FRs. As part of the serology process, FRs were surveyed for COVID-19-like symptoms since February 2020 and asked to report any prior COVID-19 nasal swab testing. Descriptive statistics and two-sided Chi Square tests with Yates correction were used to compare groups. RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.","McGuire, Sarayna S; Klassen, Aaron B; Heywood, John; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D",Prehosp Disaster Med,335,23

We identified that many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we indicate the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","Mathavarajah, Sabateeshan; Stoddart, Amina K; Gagnon, Graham A; Dellaire, Graham",Sci Total Environ,335,16

Given n samples collected from patients, how should we select and test mixtures of samples to maximize information and minimize the number of tests? Group testing is a well-studied problem with several appealing solutions, but recent biological studies impose practical constraints for COVID-19 that are incompatible with traditional methods. Furthermore, existing methods use unnecessarily restrictive solutions, which were devised for settings with more memory and compute constraints than the problem at hand. This results in poor utility. In the new setting, we obtain strong solutions for small values of n using evolutionary strategies. We then develop a new method combining Bloom filters with belief propagation to scale to larger values of n (more than 100) with good empirical results. We also present a more accurate decoding algorithm that is tailored for specific COVID-19 settings. This work demonstrates the practical gap between dedicated algorithms and well-known generic solutions. Our efforts results in a new and practical multiplex method yielding strong empirical performance without mixing more than a chosen number of patients into the same probe. Finally, we briefly discuss adaptive methods, casting them into the framework of adaptive sub-modularity.","Abraham, Louis; Becigneul, Gary; Coleman, Benjamin; Scholkopf, Bernhard; Shrivastava, Anshumali; Smola, Alexander",,335,16

Given the limited utility of the test, we aimed to estimate the effectivity of ordering ANA testing in childhood. METHODS: Children referred to our department to be examined due to ANA positivity between 2008 and 2020 were included in the study. Those with less than one-year follow-up period, those with previously known rheumatic or autoimmune disease, and those diagnosed as an autoimmune and/or rheumatic disease at the first visit were excluded. Data were obtained from their medical records, retrospectively. The parents of all of the patients were called via phone, data were verified, and missing information was collected. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-eight patients (230 females) were eligible for the study. The median age at ANA positivity was found is 9.31 (1.3-17.86) years old and the median follow-up duration was 4.85 (1-11.91) years. Most of the patients had no underlying disease (n=337, 94.1%). The most common reason for ordering ANA testing was to evaluate musculoskeletal system symptoms (n=225, 62.8%). None of our patients referred to us due to ANA positivity developed any autoimmune conditions or ANA associated rheumatic disease. Hypermobility syndrome is the most common final diagnosis among our ANA-positive patients CONCLUSION: We suggest that instead of using it as a screening tool, ANA testing should be performed if only there is a strong suspicion of autoimmune diseases or certain rheumatic conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus.","Haslak, Fatih; Yildiz, Mehmet; Altun, Ilayda; Yilmaz, Gizem; Adrovic, Amra; Sahin, Sezgin; Koker, Oya; Aliyeva, Ayten; Barut, Kenan; Kasapcopur, Ozgur",Pediatr. int,335,16

Currently there are no published data available on the prevalence of the infection in ophthalmology patients presenting for intravitreal injection (IVI). The purpose of this retrospective study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV­2 infection in patients presenting for IVI at our hospital. Methods: Patients presenting for IVI in April 2020 at our hospital who had been screened for SARS-CoV­2 infection using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis were included in a retrospective study. To assess the representativity of this sample for IVI patients, characteristics were compared with patients presenting for IVI during March-April 2019. Results: The study included 279 patients and 319 historic control patients. Of 277 valid test results, one SARS-CoV­2 positive patient was found, resulting in a carrier rate of 0.36% with a 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval of 0.01-1.99%. No differences in sex (57.7% vs. 59.9% female, pâ¯= 0.650), age (77.63â¯± 10.29 vs. 77.59â¯± 10.94 years, pâ¯= 0.962), and region of residence were found between groups. Conclusion: The study provides an estimate for the prevalence of SARS-CoV­2 infection in asymptomatic patients presenting for IVI. While these data may be used as a baseline, further research is needed to assess the development of SARS-CoV­2 prevalence in this patient group in order to support risk assessment and infection prevention strategies.","Szegedi, Stephan; Huf, Wolfgang; Miháltz, Kata; Vécsei-Marlovits, Pia Veronika",Spektrum Augenheilkd,335,9

It is involved in signaling the hedonic effects of rewards and has essential roles in reinforcement and motivational processes. Here, we focused on opioid signaling through mu and delta receptors on dopaminoceptive neurons and evaluated the role these receptors play in reward-driven behaviors. We generated a genetically modified mouse with selective double knockdown of mu and delta opioid receptors in neurons expressing dopamine receptor D1. Selective expression of the transgene was confirmed using immunostaining. Knockdown was validated by measuring the effects of selective opioid receptor agonists on neuronal membrane currents using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We found that in the nucleus accumbens of control mice, the majority of dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons were sensitive to a mu or delta opioid agonist. In mutant mice, the response to the delta receptor agonist was blocked, while the effects of the mu agonist were strongly attenuated. Behaviorally, the mice had no obvious impairments. The mutation did not affect the sensitivity to the rewarding effects of morphine injections or social contact and had no effect on preference for sweet taste. Knockdown had a moderate effect on motor activity in some of the tests performed, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Thus, we found that knocking down mu and delta receptors on dopamine receptor D1-expressing cells does not appreciably affect some of the reward-driven behaviors previously attributed to opioid signaling.","Harda, Zofia; Spyrka, Jadwiga; Jastrzebska, Kamila; Szumiec, Lukasz; Bryksa, Anna; Klimczak, Marta; Polaszek, Maria; Golda, Slawomir; Zajdel, Joanna; Misiolek, Klaudia; Blasiak, Anna; Rodriguez Parkitna, Jan",Neuropharmacology,335,26

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SARS-COV-2 transmission through indoor air in hospitals and its prevention methods.This study is a systematic review by searching among published articles in reputable international databases such as Scopus, Google scholar, PubMed, Science Direct and ISI (Web of Science). Data were collected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and by searching for relevant keywords. Qualitative data were collected using the PRISMA standard checklist. Information was entered into the checklist, such as the name of the first author, the year of the study publication, the country, the type of study, the number of samples, the type of air sample, the results, the methods for SARS-COV-2 transmission prevention in the hospital. After reviewing the information and quality of articles, 11 articles were included in this study. An analysis of the articles showed that Asian countries (Iran, China, Singapore) were more concerned with the SARS-COV-2 transmission through hospital air. Four articles did not confirm SARS-COV-2 in the air, but seven articles reported the SARS-COV-2 from air samples. The results of this study showed that many factors could affect the positive or negative SARS-COV-2 detection in the air, such as environmental conditions in hospitals, sampling methods, sampling height and distance from patients, flow rate and sampling time, efficiency and functionality of ventilation systems, use of disinfectants.Therefore, due to the possibility of SARS-COV-2 in the air of hospitals, preventive measures should be taken such as physical distance, personal hygiene, ventilation, and air filtration.

Methods The trauma caseloads between March 25, 2020, and April 14, 2020, and that of the homologous period of 2019 were thoroughly analyzed and compared retrospectively. Results There was an overall decrease in trauma patients. Elderly male patients had an increased incidence of injury during the lockdown period with a significant p-value (0.0009). There was a significant increase in the number of minor orthopedic procedures while there was a significant decrease in the number of major orthopedic procedures. Fractures of the proximal femur were significantly increased during the lockdown period (p-value 0.011) and fractures of the femur and tibia shaft were significantly decreased during the lockdown period (p-value 0.002). Fractures of the distal radius were significantly increased during the lockdown period (p-value 0.005) and fractures of the shaft of humerus, radius, and ulna were significantly decreased during the lockdown period (p-value 0.028).

The total number of patients presenting under the influence of alcohol during the lockdown period was significantly decreased (p-value- &lt;0.0001). The use of government-sponsored ambulances for transport to the hospital was significantly increased during the lockdown period (p &lt;0.0001). Conclusion Strict administrative measures had a high impact on the number and epidemiology of trauma with remarkable changes. There was a decreased number of trauma cases but the mechanism, type, and management of these cases were significantly altered from the homologous period of the previous year.","Mahapatra, S.; Tripathi, S.

We examined associations of stay-at-home order (SAHO) and face-masking recommendation with COVID-19 epidemics in the USA. Methods: In this quasi-experimental interrupted time-series study, we modeled temporal trends in daily new cases and deaths of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers in the USA between March 1 and April 20, 2020. In addition, we conducted simulation analyses. Results: The number of residents under SAHO increased since March 19 and plateaued at 290,829,980 (88.6% of the U.S. population) on April 7. Trends in COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers peaked on March 23, further reduced on April 3, and fell below/around 1.0 on April 13. Early-implementation and early-lift of SAHO would reduce and increase COVID-19 epidemics, respectively. Multivariable piecewise log-linear regression revealed the states' neighboring relationship with New York was linked to COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths. There were two turning points in daily new-case trend, being March 28 (slope-changes = -0.09) and April 3 (slope-changes = -0.09), which appeared to be associated with implementation of SAHO on March 28 (affecting 48.5% of the US population in 22 states and District of Columbia), and face-masking recommendation on April 3, respectively. There were also two turning points in daily new-death trend, being April 9 (slope-changes = -0.06) and April 19 (slope-changes = -0.90). Conclusions: We identified two turning points of COVID-19 daily new cases or deaths in the USA, which seem to be linked to implementation of SAHO and the Center for Disease Control's face-masking recommendation.","Xu, Jie; Hussain, Sabiha; Lu, Guanzhu; Zheng, Kai; Wei, Shi; Bao, Wei; Zhang, Lanjing",Explor Res Hypothesis Med,335,16

Early reports suggested that TTS is a self-limiting disease with better prognosis than acute coronary syndrome. However, recent data showed that TTS is not a benign disease as compared with acute coronary syndrome. In addition to the apical ballooning, several other types of wall motion abnormalities have been classified as variants of TTS. In particular, right ventricular involvement, or biventricular TTS, is not uncommon and is associated with poor in-hospital as well as long-term outcomes. With respect to the pathophysiology, modulation (desensitization) of the beta-adrenergic receptor is suspected as a possible mechanism for transiently depressed myocardial contraction. Although specific treatments to improve prognosis of TTS are still uncertain, observational data suggest favorable impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Finally, in the era of COVID-19, we should pay attention to a variety of cardiovascular conditions related to COVID-19. TTS is one of these conditions that can be triggered by both emotional and physical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Okura, Hiroyuki",J. cardiol.,335,20

Sub-optimal Se status is common, occurring in a significant proportion of the population across the world including parts of Europe and China. Human and animal studies have shown that Se status is a key determinant of the host response to viral infections. In this review, we address the question whether Se intake is a factor in determining the severity of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Emphasis is placed on epidemiological and animal studies which suggest that Se affects host response to RNA viruses and on the molecular mechanisms by which Se and selenoproteins modulate the inter-linked redox homeostasis, stress response and inflammatory response. Together these studies indicate that Se status is an important factor in determining the host response to viral infections. Therefore, we conclude that Se status is likely to influence human response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and that Se status is one (of several) risk factors which may impact on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in populations where Se intake is sub-optimal or low. We suggest the use of appropriate markers to assess the Se status of COVID-19 patients and possible supplementation may be beneficial in limiting the severity of symptoms, especially in countries where Se status is regarded as sub-optimal.","Bermano, Giovanna; Méplan, Catherine; Mercer, Derry K; Hesketh, John E",Br J Nutr,335,1

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ease of access and transmission of information via social media has led to ambiguity, misinformation and uncertainty. This research studies the aforementioned behaviours of information sharing and verification related to COVID-19, in the context of social media. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies have been carried out. Study 1, with Indian social media users, is a two-factor between-subjects experimental design that investigated the effect of message polarity (positive versus negative) and message type (news versus rumour) on the dissemination and verification behaviour of COVID-19-related messages. The study also investigated the mediation of perceived message importance and health anxiety. Study 2 is a replica study conducted with US users. Findings: The study finding revealed significantly higher message sharing for news than rumour. Further, for the Indian users, message with positive polarity led to higher message sharing and message with negative polarity led to higher verification behaviour. On the contrary, for the US users, message with negative polarity led to higher message sharing and message with positive polarity led to higher verification behaviour. Finally, the study revealed message importance mediates the relationship of message type and message sharing behaviour for Indian and US users;however, health anxiety mediation was significant only for Indian users. Practical implications: The findings offer important implications related to information regulation during a health crisis. Unverified information sharing is harmful during a pandemic. The study sheds light on this behaviour such that stakeholders get insights and better manage the information being disseminated. Originality/value: The study investigates the behaviour of sharing and verification of social media messages between users containing health information (news and rumour) related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

It has been an increasing trend in recent years (Wang H, Xu WM, Zhu KJ, Zhu SJ, Zhang HF, Wang J, Yang Y, Shao FY, Jiang NM, Tao ZY, Jin HY, Tang Y, Huo LL, Dong F, Li ZJ, Ding H, Liu ZG, Emerg Microbes Infect 9:889-99, 2020). Brucellosis is capable to invade multiple systems throughout the body, lacking in typical clinical manifestations, and easily misdiagnosed and mistreated. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a male, 5-year-and-11-month old child without relevant medical history, who was admitted to hospital for 20 days of fever. When admitted to the hospital, we found that he was enervated, irritable and sleepy, accompanied with red eyes phenomenon. After anti-infection treatment with meropenem, no improvement observed. Lumbar puncture revealed normal CSF protein, normal cells, and negative culture. Later, doppler echocardiography suggested coronary aneurysms, and incomplete Kawasaki Disease with coronary aneurysms was proposed. The next day, brucellosis agglutination test was positive. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of cerebrospinal fluid suggested B.melitensis, which was confirmed again by blood culture. The child was finally diagnosed as brucellosis with meningocephalitis, coronary aneurysm and keratitis. According to our preliminary research and review, such case has never been reported in detail before. After diagnosis confirmation, the child was treated with rifampicin, compound sulfamethoxazole, and ceftriaxone for cocktail anti-infection therapy. Aspirin and dipyridamole were also applied for anticoagulant therapy. After medical treatment, body temperature of the child has reached normal level, eye symptoms alleviated, and mental condition gradually turned normal. Re-examination of the doppler echocardiographic indicated that the coronary aneurysm was aggravated, so warfarin was added for amplification of anticoagulation treatment. At present, 3 months of follow-up, the coronary artery dilatation gradually assuaged, and the condition is continued to alleviate. CONCLUSION: Brucellosis can invade nervous system, coronary artery, and cornea. Brucellosis lacks specific signs for clinical diagnosis. The traditional agglutination test and the new mNGS are convenient and effective, which can provide the reference for clinical diagnosis.","Geng, Lingling; Feng, Yuan; Li, Dan; Nan, Nan; Ma, Kai; Tang, Xianyan; Li, Xiaoqing",BMC Infect Dis,335,16

We simulated the future trajectory of the epidemic under current conditions, projected the impact of policy interventions, and analyzed the implications for healthcare capacity. METHODS: Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios. RESULTS: The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4. Interventions have decreased the possible maximum number of cases from 71 125 on day 86 to 22 340 on day 119, and have prolonged the doubling time from about 9 days to 21 days. This corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in transmissions from cases of mild infections. There will be 2780 available hospital beds, and at the peak (on day 132), the number of severe cases is estimated to be roughly 6105. Of these cases, 1831 will need intensive care unit (ICU) beds, whereas the number of currently available ICU beds is roughly 446. CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare system in Bali is in danger of collapse; thus, serious efforts are needed to improve COVID-19 interventions and to prepare the healthcare system in Bali to the greatest extent possible.","Wirawan, I Md Ady; Januraga, Pande Putu",J Prev Med Public Health,335,16

(preprint),17.015043,5.469584,2021,"Vaccines are being rapidly developed with the goal of ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induces serum responses that cross-react with other coronaviruses remains poorly studied. Here we define serum profiles in rhesus macaques after vaccination with DNA or Ad26 based vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein followed by SARS-CoV-2 challenge, or SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. Analysis of serum responses showed robust reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD), both included in the vaccine. However, serum cross-reactivity to the closely related sarbecovirus SARS-CoV-1 Spike and RBD, was reduced. Reactivity was also measured to the distantly related common cold alpha-coronavirus, 229E and NL63, and beta-coronavirus, OC43 and HKU1, Spike proteins. Using SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 lentivirus based pseudoviruses, we show that neutralizing antibody responses were predominantly SARS-CoV-2 specific. These data define patterns of cross-reactive binding and neutralizing serum responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in rhesus macaques. Our observations have important implications for understanding polyclonal responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike, which will facilitate future CoV vaccine assessment and development.ImportanceThe rapid development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been unprecedented. In this study, we explore the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses to other coronaviruses. By analyzing responses from NHPs both before and after immunization with DNA or Ad26 vectored vaccines, we find patterns of cross reactivity that mirror those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data highlight the similarities between infection and vaccine induced humoral immunity for SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reactivity of these responses to other CoVs.","Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Feldman, Jared; McMahan, Katherine; Yu, Jingyou; Zahn, Roland; Wegmann, Frank; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Schmidt, Aaron G; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,335,16

It has varied clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to critical illness. It has led to the mortality of several affected individuals. However, the prognosis seems to vary from one person to the other and efforts are being made to identify the prognostic factors. Hypocalcaemia has been identified as a poor prognostic factor with a high frequency among individuals affected with COVID-19. This review aims to estimate the prevalence of hypocalcaemia among COVID-19 patients and identify the poor prognostic factors associated with the presence of hypocalcaemia in COVID-19 patients. Electronic medical databases were searched for publications on the prognostic implications of hypocalcaemia in COVID-19 infection, and relevant articles were selected for systematic review following PRISMA algorithm. The prevalence of hypocalcaemia among patients with COVID-19 was 40.0-74.4%. There was a significant association between the rate of hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as septic shock and hypocalcaemia in patients with COVID-19. Hypocalcaemia is also associated with a higher mortality rate in these patients. COVID-19 patients with hypocalcaemia tend to have elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin6, alanine transaminase, procalcitonin, serum creatinine and low albumin. Hypocalcaemia is common in COVID-19 patients and is a poor prognostic factor in these patients. Presence of hypocalcaemia is associated with a severe illness and even death","Azeez, T.

High emission capability and significant mortality of this disease indicate the need for immediate and effective attention to this issue. So far, many efforts have been made to introduce an effective treatment for Covid-19. Due to the contagiousness and high prevalence of the disease, chemoprophylaxis is a topic of discussion that is frequently asked by people and medical staff. The most suitable of the proposed drugs for this purpose are Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine which, besides anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory effects, have also antiviral effects. However, for introducing these drugs as prophylaxis, more evidence is needed. Methods: In this study, the existing articles and studies on the use of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as an effective drug in the prevention of Covid-19 have been studied. References used in this review were identified through a search of PubMed and Google Scholar with keywords of ""Hydroxychloroquine"", ""Chloroquine"", ""COVID- 19"", ""COVID 19"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""2019-CoV"", ""coronavirus"", "" SARS-nCoV-2"", ""antiviral"", and ""prophylaxis"". Articles obtained from this search and relevant references were reviewed and included. Results: Available studies on the pharmacological effects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 have been performed in the laboratory (In vitro). Till now, 5 clinical trials have been conducted in this field and their preliminary results will be published in the next few months. There are also different prophylactic doses suggested in existing studies. Conclusion: Due to the lack of sufficient clinical evidence and the uncertainty about the dose required to create a prophylactic effect against the disease and due to possible complications, the use of these drugs for prophylaxis is not recommended until the first results of clinical studies are published and then approved by WHO, CDC and FDA. Sufficient attention should be paid to personal protective equipment. © 2020, Journal of Iranian Medical Council.","Janatalipour, A.; Jazaeri, S.; Hadadi, A.",Journal of Iranian Medical Council,335,15

Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.","Koonin, Lisa M; Pillai, Satish; Kahn, Emily B; Moulia, Danielle; Patel, Anita",Health Secur,335,2

The objective of this descriptive analysis was to assess the initial adoption, feasibility and safety of a family medicine-led remote monitoring program, COVIDCare@Home, to manage the care of patients with COVID-19 in the community. METHODS: COVIDCare@Home is a multifaceted, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program developed at an ambulatory academic centre, the Women's College Hospital in Toronto. A descriptive analysis of the first cohort of patients admitted from Apr. 8 to May 11, 2020, was conducted. Lessons from the implementation of the program are described, focusing on measure of adoption (number of visits per patient total, with a physician or with a nurse; length of follow-up), feasibility (received an oximeter or thermometer; consultation with general internal medicine, social work or mental health, pharmacy or acute ambulatory care unit) and safety (hospitalizations, mortality and emergency department visits). RESULTS: The COVIDCare@Home program cared for a first cohort of 97 patients (median age 41 yr, 67% female) with 415 recorded virtual visits. Patients had a median time from positive testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to first appointment of 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-4) days, with a median virtual follow-up time of 8 (IQR 5-10) days. A total of 4 (4%) had an emergency department visit, with no patients requiring hospitalization and no deaths; 16 (16%) of patients required support with mental and social health needs. INTERPRETATION: A family medicine-led, team-based remote monitoring program can safely manage the care of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Virtual care approaches, particularly those that support patients with more complex health and social needs, may be an important part of ongoing health system efforts to manage subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Agarwal, Payal; Mukerji, Geetha; Laur, Celia; Chandra, Shivani; Pimlott, Nick; Heisey, Ruth; Stovel, Rebecca; Goulbourne, Elaine; Bhatia, R Sacha; Bhattacharyya, Onil; Martin, Danielle",CMAJ Open,335,19

Standard COVID-19 testing is insufficient to protect HCWs from these risks and prevent the spread of disease. Continuous monitoring of physiological data with wearable sensors, self-monitoring of symptoms, and asymptomatic COVID-19 testing may aid in the early detection of COVID-19 in HCWs and may help reduce further transmission among HCWs, patients, and families. OBJECTIVE: By using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging, and biospecimens, this project aims to assist HCWs in self-monitoring COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of HCWs at a single institution. The study duration was 1 year, wherein participants were instructed on the continuous use of two wearable sensors (Fitbit Charge 3 smartwatch and TempTraq temperature patches) for up to 30 days. Participants consented to provide biospecimens (ie, nasal swabs, saliva swabs, and blood) for up to 1 year from study entry. Using a smartphone app called Roadmap 2.0, participants entered a daily mood score, submitted daily COVID-19 symptoms, and completed demographic and health-related quality of life surveys at study entry and 30 days later. Semistructured qualitative interviews were also conducted at the end of the 30-day period, following completion of daily mood and symptoms reporting as well as continuous wearable sensor use. RESULTS: A total of 226 HCWs were enrolled between April 28 and December 7, 2020. The last participant completed the 30-day study procedures on January 16, 2021. Data collection will continue through January 2023, and data analyses are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging and survey completion, and biospecimen collections, this study will potentially provide data on the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs at a single institution. The study will also assess the feasibility of leveraging wearable sensors and self-monitoring of symptoms in an HCW population.

Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with intensive care unit (ICU) needs at a tertiary hospital on its peak COVID-19 ICU census day. We used medical record data to calculate a CSC score under 3 criteria: New York, Massachusetts with full comorbidity list (Massachusetts1), and MA with a modified comorbidity list (Massachusetts2). The CSC scores, as well as FCFS, determined which patients were eligible to receive critical care under 2 scarcity scenarios: 50 versus 100 ICU bed capacity. We assessed the association between race/ethnicity and eligibility for critical care with logistic regression. Results Of 211 patients, 139 (66%) were male, 95 (45%) were Hispanic, 23 (11%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 69 (33%) were non-Hispanic White. Hispanic patients had the fewest comorbidities. Assuming a 50 ICU bed capacity, Hispanic patients had significantly higher odds of receiving critical care services across all CSC guidelines, except FCFS. However, assuming a 100 ICU bed capacity, Hispanic patients had greater odds of receiving critical care services under only the Massachusetts2 guidelines (odds ratio, 2.05;95% CI, 1.09 to 3.85). Conclusion Varying CSC guidelines differentially affect racial and ethnic minority groups with regard to risk stratification. The equity implications of CSC guidelines require thorough investigation before CSC guidelines are implemented.","Molina, Melanie F.; Cash, Rebecca E.; Carreras-Tartak, Jossie Ciccolo Gia Petersen Jordan Mecklai Keizra Rodriguez Giovanni Castilla-Ojo Noelle Boms Okechi Velasquez David Macias-Konstantopoulos Wendy Camargo Jr Carlos A.; Samuels-Kalow, Margaret",Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open,335,20

In March 2020, more than 300,000 cases have been reported all over Iraq. This study aims to represent data analysis, modelling and forecasting approaches to the presented data in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODOLOGY: The project involves mathematical models for forecasting and artificial simulations using particles. In the study, time series models including Simple Exponential Model, Holt's Method and Brown's Models have been used for the forecasting of the future potential rates in the area. A series of simulations have been conducted to observe the possibilities of virus spread rates in a virtual world which represents a quarter of Erbil. RESULTS: The outcome of the study shows how the disease have spread in Kurdistan, and what are the current rates to compare with neighbour regions. The modelling clearly shows that with cases still sporadically appearing, the risk of second and third waves of infections is high. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the regional government must reduce unnecessary gatherings to the lowest possible level. A scientific registry system of disease statistics must be put in place and rigorously updated all the times. We recommend the officials use a nationwide database provided to the public to monitor movement of every infected individual, to prevent further spread.","Abdullah, Milad; Kolo, Kamal; Aspoukeh, Peyman; Hamad, Rahel; Bailey, James R",J Infect Dev Ctries,335,16

In conflict with this process is the ability that many viruses have to mutate their antigens to escape infection- or vaccine-induced antibody memory responses. Mutable viruses such as dengue virus, influenza virus and of course coronavirus have a major global health impact, exacerbated by this ability to evade immune responses through mutation. There have been several outstanding recent studies on B-cell memory that also shed light on the potential and limitations of antibody memory to protect against viral antigen variation, and so promise to inform new strategies for vaccine design. For the purposes of this review, the current understanding of the different memory B-cell (MBC) populations, and their potential to recognize mutant antigens, will be described prior to some examples from antibody responses against the highly mutable RNA based flaviviruses, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.","White, Harry N",Viruses,335,16

The protein is smaller than previously described ACE2-Ig Fc fusion proteins and contains an H345A mutation in the ACE2 catalytic active site that inactivates the enzyme without reducing its affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The disulfide-bonded ACE2 microbody protein inhibits entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus and replication of live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in a mouse model. Its potency is 10-fold higher than soluble ACE2, and it can act after virus bound to the cell. The microbody inhibits the entry of ß coronaviruses and virus with the variant D614G spike.

We use a nationally representative survey of 1476 adults in the UK between 12 and 18 December 2020, along with 5 focus groups conducted during the same period. Trust is a core predictor, with distrust in vaccines in general and mistrust in government raising vaccine hesitancy. Trust in health institutions and experts and perceived personal threat are vital, with focus groups revealing that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is driven by a misunderstanding of herd immunity as providing protection, fear of rapid vaccine development and side effects, and beliefs that the virus is man-made and used for population control. In particular, those who obtain information from relatively unregulated social media sources—such as YouTube—that have recommendations tailored by watch history, and who hold general conspiratorial beliefs, are less willing to be vaccinated. Since an increasing number of individuals use social media for gathering health information, interventions require action from governments, health officials, and social media companies.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brought challenging times for nurses worldwide. In Brazil, as well as in several countries, nurses are working hard in hospital settings caring for patients infected with the virus, sometimes with unfavourable work environment conditions. METHODS: This study was a convergent embedded mixed methods research. The sample comprised 104 nurses from three Brazilian university hospitals. Data were collected in April-June 2020 from an online questionnaire with a self-reporting Likert scale survey designed to measure the nurses' perceptions of their work environment. Qualitative data in the form of written comments were also collected through an open question. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: The quantitative results showed that the responses to 'I received training on the correct use of personal protective equipment' and 'I am afraid of being infected' items had the best and worst evaluations, respectively. The qualitative findings revealed five themes: feeling of insecurity, lack of personal protective equipment, lack of diagnostic tests, changes in the care flow and fear of the unknown. CONCLUSION: The study has highlighted the challenges faced by hospital nurses while caring for patients with COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND NURSING POLICY: The gaps identified will assist the policymakers and hospital managers in developing policies to enhance the support offered to nurses and improve the care provided to patients with COVID-19 in university hospitals. The results also indicate the need for attention to the mental health of the professionals due to the increasing workload and treatment of an illness hitherto unknown.","Santos, José Luís Guedes Dos; Balsanelli, Alexandre Pazetto; Freitas, Etiane de Oliveira; Menegon, Fernando Henrique Antunes; Carneiro, Ieda Aparecida; Lazzari, Daniele Delacanal; Menezes, Jennifer Aguilar Leocádio De; Erdmann, Alacoque Lorenzini; Camponogara, Silviamar",Int. nurs. rev,335,2

Some studies have suggested that diabetes is associated with a greater risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the clinical features and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with vs without diabetes. METHODS: All consecutive adult patients admitted to Amiens University Hospital (Amiens, France) with confirmed COVID-19 up until April 21st, 2020, were included. The composite primary endpoint comprised admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Both components were also analysed separately in a logistic regression analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 433 patients (median age: 72; 238 (55%) men; diabetes: 115 (26.6%)) were included. Most of the deaths occurred in non-ICU units and among older adults. Multivariate analyses showed that diabetes was associated neither with the primary endpoint (odds ratio (OR): 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.90) nor with mortality (hazard ratio: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.40-1.34) but was associated with ICU admission (OR: 2.06; 95%CI 1.09-3.92, P = .027) and a longer length of hospital stay. Age was negatively associated with ICU admission and positively associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was prevalent in a quarter of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19; it was associated with a greater risk of ICU admission but not with a significant elevation in mortality.

Objective: To determine the efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation >94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group. Results: Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42% hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial.

On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.

It takes time to develop antivirals and vaccines, and implement vaccination campaigns. Therefore, preventive measures such as rapid isolation of cases and identification and early quarantine of cases' close contacts-as well as masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene, surface disinfection and air control-are crucial to reduce the risk of transmission. In this context, disinfectants and antiseptics with proven efficacy against the outbreak virus should be used. However, biocidal formulations are quite complex and may include auxiliary substances such as surfactants or emollients in addition to active substances. In order to evaluate disinfectants' efficacy objectively, meaningful efficacy data are needed. Therefore, the European Committee for Standardisation technical committee 216 'Chemical disinfectants and antiseptics' Working Group 1 (medical area) has developed standards for efficacy testing. The European tiered approach grades the virucidal efficacy in three levels, with corresponding marker test viruses.

During the lockdown period due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, our medical staff was reduced. OBJECTIVES: To compare the demographics, treatment pathways, and outcomes of patients with hip fractures during the COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown with the standard at routine times. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all patients who were treated surgically for hip fracture in a tertiary center during the COVID-19 lockdown period between 01 March and 01 June 2020 and the equivalent period in 2019. Demographic characteristics, time to surgery, surgery type, hospitalization time, discharge destination, postoperative complications, and 30- and 90-day mortality rates were collected for all patients. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, 105 patients were operated due to hip fractures compared to 136 in the equivalent period with no statistical difference in demographics. The rate of surgeries within 48 hours of admission was significantly higher in the COVID-19 period (92% vs. 76%, respectively;P = 0.0006). Mean hospitalization time was significantly shorter (10 vs. 12 days, P = 0.037) with diversion of patient discharge destinations from institutional to home rehabilitation (P < 0.001).

METHOD: From January 2011 through August 2019, a total of 97 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical data, comedications, and the occurrence of HBV reactivation were recorded. RESULTS: Seven patients were HBsAg+ (7.2%), 64 were HBsAg-/HBcAb+ (65.9%), and 26 were HBsAg-/HBcAb- (26.8%). The median disease follow-up time was 9 years. TCZ was administered for a median of 29 months. Four patients (4.1%) experienced HBV reactivation after tocilizumab therapy. Of the 7 HBsAg+ patients, 4 received antiviral prophylaxis and had no HBV reactivation; the remaining 3 patients did not receive antiviral prophylaxis, and all 3 (100%) experienced HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare-up. Hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 2 of these 3 patients, with mild prothrombin time prolongation in one. After salvage entecavir treatment, all patients had a favorable outcome. Of the 64 HBsAg-/HBcAb+ patients, only one became positive for serum HBV DNA (2.5 × 107 IU/mL) after 18 months of tocilizumab treatment (1.6%; 1/64). This patient was immediately treated with entecavir, which prevented hepatitis flare-up. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab is widely used in treating rheumatoid arthritis and has the potential to reduce the mortality rate among severe COVID-19 patients. However, HBV reactivation needs to be considered. HBsAg+ patients have a high risk of HBV reactivation, which could be prevented by antiviral prophylaxis. Although the risk of reactivation is low in HBsAg-/HBcAb+ patients, strict monitoring is necessary.","Kuo, Meng Hsuan; Tseng, Chih-Wei; Lu, Ming-Chi; Tung, Chien-Hsueh; Tseng, Kuo-Chih; Huang, Kuang-Yung; Lee, Chi-Hui; Lai, Ning-Sheng",Dig. dis. sci,335,24

It is unclear if and how prestress neurocognitive factors moderate risk for anxiety during high-stress situations. Enhanced error monitoring and a cognitive control strategy of more instantaneous (reactive) control have both been independently related to anxiety. We examined if a specific neurocognitive profile characterized by heightened error monitoring and a more reactive cognitive control strategy in adolescence predicts young adults' anxiety trajectories across 3 early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study (N = 291), data were acquired in adolescence (13 years) on error monitoring (n = 124) and cognitive control strategy (n = 119). In young adulthood (18 years), anxiety was assessed three times during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 162). RESULTS: On average, participants experienced greater anxiety in the first COVID-19 pandemic assessment, then anxiety decreased in the following months. Error monitoring and cognitive control strategy interacted to predict anxiety trajectories, such that among adolescents with an increased reliance on reactive control, error monitoring predicted greater anxiety in the first assessment but greater decreases the following months as stay-at-home orders were lifted and families adapted to the restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that neurocognitive profiles in adolescence predict young adults' anxiety responses during a highly stressful period, such as the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings have implications for the early identification of individuals at greater risk for anxiety.","Morales, Santiago; Zeytinoglu, Selin; Buzzell, George A; Valadez, Emilio A; Troller-Renfree, Sonya V; Bowers, Maureen E; Chronis-Tuscano, Andrea; Degnan, Kathryn A; Almas, Alisa N; Pine, Daniel S; Fox, Nathan A",Biol.

Therefore, knowledge about the effect of vaccination in this specific group is limited. This information is essential to empower lactating women to make a well-informed decision on their choice for vaccination. After natural infection, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are present in human milk, which might offer protection for her newborn. The dynamics of these antibodies in human milk following vaccination remain to be elucidated. RESEARCH AIM: To determine the effect of vaccination with BNT162b2 on the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in human milk. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal study, we included lactating women who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Human milk samples were collected prior to vaccination and 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days after both vaccine doses. Samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In total, 366 human milk samples from 26 lactating women were analyzed. A biphasic response was observed, with SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) starting to increase between day 5 and 7 after the first dose of the vaccine. After the second dose, an accelerated IgA antibody response was observed. CONCLUSION: After vaccination with the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine, a SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response was observed in human milk. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA after vaccination is important as antibodies are transferred via human milk, and thereby might provide protection to infants against COVID-19.","Juncker, Hannah G; Mulleners, Sien J; van Gils, Marit J; de Groot, Christianne J M; Pajkrt, Dasja; Korosi, Aniko; van Goudoever, Johannes B; van Keulen, Britt J",J Hum Lact,335,1

Current state-of-the-art cryoET combined with subtomogram averaging analysis enables the high-resolution structural determination of macromolecular complexes that are present in multiple copies within tomographic reconstructions. Tomographic experiments usually require a vast amount of tilt series to be acquired by means of high-end transmission electron microscopes with important operational running-costs. Although the throughput and reliability of automated data acquisition routines have constantly improved over the recent years, the process of selecting regions of interest at which a tilt series will be acquired cannot be easily automated and it still relies on the user's manual input. Therefore, the set-up of a large-scale data collection session is a time-consuming procedure that can considerably reduce the remaining microscope time available for tilt series acquisition. Here, the protocol describes the recently developed implementations based on the SerialEM package and the PyEM software that significantly improve the time-efficiency of grid screening and large-scale tilt series data collection. The presented protocol illustrates how to use SerialEM scripting functionalities to fully automate grid mapping, grid square mapping, and tilt series acquisition. Furthermore, the protocol describes how to use PyEM to select additional acquisition targets in off-line mode after automated data collection is initiated. To illustrate this protocol, its application in the context of high-end data collection of Sars-Cov-2 tilt series is described. The presented pipeline is particularly suited to maximizing the time-efficiency of tomography experiments that require a careful selection of acquisition targets and at the same time a large amount of tilt series to be collected.","Weis, Felix; Hagen, Wim J H; Schorb, Martin; Mattei, Simone",J. vis. exp,335,26

Blood parameters, such as lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, or D-dimer, are associated with severity and prognosis of SARS CoV-2 patients. This study aims to identify blood-related predictors of severe hospitalization in patients diagnosed with SARS CoV-2. Methods: Observational retrospective study of all rt-PCR and blood-test positive (at 48 hours of hospitalization) SARS CoV-2 diagnosed inpatients between March-May 2020. Deceased and/or ICU inpatients were considered as severe cases, whereas those patients after hospital discharge were considered as non-severe. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of severity, based on bivariate contrast between severe and mild inpatients. Results: The overall sample comprised 540 patients, with 374 mild cases (69.26%), and 166 severe cases (30.75%). The multivariate logistic regression model for predicting SARS CoV-2 severity included lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, total protein levels, glucose and aspartate aminotransferase as predictors, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.895 at a threshold of 0.29, with 81.5% of sensitivity and 81% of specificity. Discussion: Our results suggest that our predictive model allows identifying and stratifying SARS CoV-2 patients in risk of developing severe medical complications based on blood-test parameters easily measured at hospital admission, improving health-care resources management and distribution.","Gomez, L.

This study aimed to predict the development of the epidemic with specific interventional policies applied in China and evaluate their effectiveness. COVID-19 data of Hubei Province and the next five most affected provinces were collected from daily case reports of COVID-19 on the Health Committee official website of these provinces. The number of current cases, defined as the number of confirmed cases minus the number of cured cases and those who have died, were examined in this study. A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model was used to assess the effects of interventional policies on the epidemic. In this study, 28 January was day 0 of the model. The results of the modified SEIR model showed that the number of current cases in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces tended to be stabilized after 70 days and after 60 days in the four other provinces. The predicted number of current cases without policy intervention was shown to far exceed that with policy intervention. The estimated number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province with policy intervention was predicted to peak at 51 222, whereas that without policy intervention was predicted to reach 157 721. Based on the results of the model, strong interventional policies were found to be vital components of epidemic control. Applying such policies is likely to shorten the duration of the epidemic and reduce the number of new cases.","Li, Bao-Zhu; Cao, Nv-Wei; Zhou, Hao-Yue; Chu, Xiu-Jie; Ye, Dong-Qing",J. med. virol,335,20

To date, multiple editorials and commentaries indicate the severity of the disruption without providing sufficient evidence with quantifiable data. METHODS: An online survey was submitted to the administrative offices of biomedical and medical PhD-programs at eight major universities in Sweden to gauge the impact of the pandemic on the students. It consisted of multiple-choice and open-ended questions where students could provide examples of positive and/or negative supervision strategies. Open answered questions were coded as either examples of positive or negative support. RESULTS: PhD students were divided into two groups: those with improved or unchanged supervision during the pandemic (group 1, n = 185), versus those whose supervision worsened (group 2, n = 69). Group 1 received more help from supervisors and more frequent supervision via both online and alternative platforms (email/messages and telephone). There was no significant difference in educational-stage, gender or caretaking responsibilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for the scientific community to learn how to provide the best possible supervision for PhD students during the pandemic. Our data suggests that more frequent supervision, and using a diverse array of meeting platforms is helpful. In addition, it is important for the students to feel that they have their supervisor's emotional support. Several students also expressed that they would benefit from an extension of their PhD programs due to delays caused by the pandemic.","Börgeson, Emma; Sotak, Matus; Kraft, Jamie; Bagunu, Grace; Biörserud, Christina; Lange, Stephan",BMC Med Educ,335,23

Several international organizations and non-government organizations have well established systems to respond to food security emergencies. However, the role of food science and technology in humanitarian response is not well understood and is seldom considered in humanitarian circles. Scope and approach: The role of food science and technology in humanitarian response and the importance of addressing the requirements of the local consumers within the local food systems are discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Humanitarian food aid policies focus on immediate and short-term assistance to save lives. The implementation of emergency programs and projects tends to induce dependency on aid, rather than strengthening local food systems and ensuring resilience. Transformative change must embrace innovation across the whole food system with an increased emphasis on food science and technology that addresses local food security, generates employment and contributes to the local economy. There needs to be a move beyond rehabilitating and increasing agricultural production to addressing the whole food system with a view to link humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to sustainable livelihoods and resilience.","Bounie, Dominique; Arcot, Jayashree; Cole, Martin; Egal, Florence; Juliano, Pablo; Mejia, Carla; Rosa, Donna; Sellahewa, Jay",Trends in food science &amp; technology,335,16

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics. We used individual-level data from more than 1000 hospitalised patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalisations and deaths. We estimated the national R0 to be 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.1&ndash;3.8) at the beginning of the epidemic. Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79&ndash;90%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3&ndash;0.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April. At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%. Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising. However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7&ndash;96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.","Lemaitre, Joseph C; Perez-Saez, Javier; Azman, Andrew S; Rinaldo, Andrea; Fellay, Jacques",Swiss Med Wkly,335,16

In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment and physical isolation remain the options to control the contagion. The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutinin-mediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related-viral diseases, including COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at S1/S2 subunit interface in S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion. Overall, the detailed 3D structural studies help understand the 3D structural basis of interaction between viruses with host factors and available scope for the new drug discovery process targeting SARS-related virus entry into the host cell.","Kushwaha, Prem Kumar; Kumari, Neha; Nayak, Sneha; Kishor, Keshav; Sharon, Ashoke",Curr. med. chem,335,16

The lack of methods for synthesizing intricate structures from them on the micron and submicron level, however, is stopping the field from developing. In particular, the methods for the synthesis of shape memory polymers (SMPs) and structures at this scale and the effect of new geometries remain unexplored. Here, we describe the synthesis of shape memory polyurethane (PU) capsules accomplished by interfacial polymerization of emulsified droplets. The emulsified droplets contain the monomers for the hard segments, while the continuous aqueous phase contains the soft segments. A trifunctional chemical cross-linker for shape memory PU synthesis was utilized to eliminate creep and improve the recovery ratios of the final capsules. We observe an anomalous dependence of the recovery ratio with the amount of programmed strain compared to previous SMPs. We develop quantitative characterization methods and theory to show that when dealing with thin-shell objects, alternative parameters to quantify recovery ratios are needed. We show that while achieving 94-99% area recovery ratios, the linear capsule recovery ratios can be as low as 70%. This quantification method allows us to convert from observed linear aspect ratios in capsules to find out unrecovered area strain and stress. The hollow structure of the capsules grants high internal volume for some applications (e.g., drug delivery), which benefit from much higher loading of active ingredients than polymeric particles. The methods we developed for capsule synthesis and programming could be easily scaled up for larger volume applications.","Zhang, Fenghua; Zhao, Tianheng; Ruiz-Molina, Daniel; Liu, Yanju; Roscini, Claudio; Leng, Jinsong; Smoukov, Stoyan K",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),335,30

Several experimental studies have shown that this treatment has been used effectively to treat RH. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of ablation parameters (i.e., electrode length, applied voltage, ablation time, and blood flow) on the temperature distribution using a balloon-based array electrodes system. A simplified three-dimensional model including four electrodes and a balloon was established. The balloon diameter was 3 mm and placed in a 5 mm diameter renal artery for forming intra-arterial occlusion. Four electrodes were mounted on the balloon and distributed in the same plane to mimic circumferential RF ablation. Computer simulations were conducted to investigate the thermal performances of the device by setting different electrode configurations, treatment protocols, and physiological factors. The thermal performances including the thermal distribution, maximum lesion depth, length, and area were analyzed. The lesion shape of the array RF electrodes was approximately a sphere with a 100% circumference coverage rate of the renal artery. The lesion depth and length increase with each factor except for blood velocity. Increasing the electrode length from 2 to 4 mm or 2 to 6 mm, the lesion depth increases by 1.15 mm and 0.54 mm at 60 s. The corresponding lesion length increases by 2.65 mm and 2.34 mm, respectively. The range of effective lesion depth is 1.90-4.90 mm, at a voltage of 15-30 V. But the peak temperature at the arterial outer wall exceeded 100 °C when the voltage is above 25 V. In tissue, the degree of thermal injury in the 2 mm area reached 100%, but in blood was not more than 5%. There was no significant difference at different flow conditions because the difference value in lesion depth was not exceeded 0.5 mm. The results showed that the balloon-based four electrodes system is expected to overcome the difficulty of incomplete ablation. In clinical application, 2 mm-electrode is recommended to avoid long wall damage as much as possible and control the voltage below 25 V. This treatment has little thermal injury on the blood, which means it may avoid coagulation formation. Moreover, the application of this device does not need to consider the difference in individual blood velocity.","Cheng, Yanyan; Liu, Hongxing; Tian, Zhen; Zhang, Meng; Liu, Youjun; Nan, Qun",Electromagn Biol Med,335,16

Protein-calorie malnutrition (kwashiorkor) affects the gut microbiota and compromises immune development, leading to environmental enteropathy, vaccine failures, and increased susceptibility to enteric diseases in young children. Relationship between diet and reduced vaccine efficacy in developing countries is not well established; therefore, we investigated the interconnections between the host-microbiota-nutrition-HRV vaccine using HRV-vaccinated, human infant faecal microbiota (HIFM)-transplanted neonatal gnotobiotic pigs fed with a protein deficient or sufficient diet. The microbiota from faecal, intestinal (duodenum, ileum, jejunum, and colon), and systemic tissue (liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node [MLN]) samples was analysed before and after HRV challenge using MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing. Overall, microbiota from deficient fed HIFM pigs displayed, compared to the sufficient group, significantly higher Shannon index, especially in the faeces and lower intestines; higher level of Proteus and Enterococcus, and lower level of Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Streptococcus in the three types of samples collected (P<0.05); and higher unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs), especially in the systemic tissues. Further, the multivariate analysis between microbiota and immunologic data showed that 38 OTUs at the genus level correlated (r2&#8804;0.5 or &#8805;-0.5; P<0.05) with at least one host immune response parameter (regulatory [Tregs and transforming growth factor-ß], effectors [interferon (IFN)-Î³+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IFN-Î³ and interleukin (IL)-12], and inflammatory [tumour necrosis factor-&#945;, IL-17 and IL-22]) and with opposite trends between diet groups. Differences described above were increased after HRV challenge. We demonstrated that a protein deficient diet affects the composition of the gut microbiota and those changes may further correlate with immune responses induced by HRV and perturbed by the deficient diet. Thus, our findings suggest that the reduced efficacy of HRV vaccine observed in Gn pig model is in part attributed to the altered microbiota composition.","Srivastava, V; Deblais, L; Huang, H-C; Miyazaki, A; Kandasamy, S; Langel, S N; Paim, F C; Chepngeno, J; Kathayat, D; Vlasova, A N; Saif, L J; Rajashekara, G",Benef Microbes,335,16

OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between asthma diagnosis and endotype and clinical outcomes among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of outpatients and inpatients presenting to 6 hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System New York metropolitan region between March 7, 2020, and June 7, 2020, with COVID-19 infection, with and without a history of asthma. The primary outcome evaluated was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. The outcomes were compared in patients with or without asthma using a multivariate Cox regression model. The outcomes stratified by blood eosinophilia count were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of 10,523 patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 infection, 4902 were hospitalized and 468 had a diagnosis of asthma (4.4%). When adjusted for COVID-19 disease severity, comorbidities, and concurrent therapies, patients with asthma had a lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.64 (0.53-0.77); P < .001) and a lower rate of hospitalization and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.43 (0.28-0.64); P < .001 and OR, 0.51 (0.41-0.64); P < .001, respectively). Those with blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 200 cells/µL, both with and without asthma, had lower mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma may be at a reduced risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Eosinophilia, both in those with and without asthma, may be associated with reduced mortality risk.","Ho, Kam Sing; Howell, Daniel; Rogers, Linda; Narasimhan, Bharat; Verma, Hannah; Steiger, David",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,335,24

Online metric learning algorithms are proposed to address this challenge. Existing methods are commonly based on (Passive Aggressive) PA approach. Hence, they can rapidly process large volumes of data with an adaptive learning rate. However, these algorithms are based on the Hinge loss and so are not robust against outliers and label noise. Also, existing online methods usually assume training triplets or pairwise constraints are exist in advance. However, many datasets in real-world applications are in the form of input data and their associated labels. We address these challenges by formulating the online Distance-Similarity learning problem with the robust Rescaled hinge loss function. The proposed model is rather general and can be applied to any PA-based online Distance-Similarity algorithm. Also, we develop an efficient robust one-pass triplet construction algorithm. Finally, to provide scalability in high dimensional DML environments, the low-rank version of the proposed methods is presented that not only reduces the computational cost significantly but also keeps the predictive performance of the learned metrics. Also, it provides a straightforward extension of our methods for deep Distance-Similarity learning. We conduct several experiments on datasets from various applications.

In a large multinational cohort of consecutive COVID-19 patients with stroke, we evaluated clinical predictors of cryptogenic stroke, short-term functional outcomes and in-hospital mortality among patients according to stroke etiology. METHODS: We explored clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of consecutively evaluated patients 18 years of age or older with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 31 hospitals in 4 countries (3/1/20-6/16/20). RESULTS: Of the 14.483 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19, 156 (1.1%) were diagnosed with AIS. Sixty-one (39.4%) were female, 84 (67.2%) white, and 88 (61.5%) were between 60 and 79 years of age. The most frequently reported etiology of AIS was cryptogenic (55/129, 42.6%), which was associated with significantly higher white blood cell count, c-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels than non-cryptogenic AIS patients (p</=0.05 for all comparisons). In a multivariable backward stepwise regression model estimating the odds of in-hospital mortality, cryptogenic stroke mechanism was associated with a fivefold greater odds in-hospital mortality than strokes due to any other mechanism (adjusted OR 5.16, 95%CI 1.41-18.87, p = 0.01). In that model, older age (aOR 2.05 per decade, 95%CI 1.35-3.11, p < 0.01) and higher baseline NIHSS (aOR 1.12, 95%CI 1.02-1.21, p = 0.01) were also independently predictive of mortality.

Current prevention policies consist of hand hygiene and social distancing. Emergencies overloaded health services and shocked the logistics chains in many countries, especially Italy and China. Having more than a quarter of its population being elderly, Japan is at high risk for COVID-19 induced morbidity and mortality. This situation cancelled schedules of all routine group exercise activities for the seniors in Japan. While the outbreak is ongoing, staying at home is safe. However, successive days of being house-ridden and limited movement can lead to excessive physical inactivity. Some elderly who are not moving much can lose a significant amount of muscle strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity. It can accelerate the frailty and dependency of the seniors, and subsequently, claiming of care and health services. Moreover, existing and new evidences showed that physical activity can promote antiviral immunity. An alternative to usual group exercise activities is crucial to keep seniors active without affecting social distancing. While staying at home for long, functional exercises maintaining basic level of physical activity and movements are urgently required to be introduced to the seniors in Tokyo and around the world to prevent functional decline. Home exercise is a practical option. Therefore, we made a home-version of the functional training exercise video with different sets of 10-minutes exercise for 7 days a week. This breakthrough alternative may sustain health promotion for the elderly persons to preserve their active aging and maintain optimal health.","Aung, Myo Nyein; Yuasa, Motoyuki; Koyanagi, Yuka; Aung, Thin Nyein Nyein; Moolphate, Saiyud; Matsumoto, Hiromichi; Yoshioka, Takashi",J Infect Dev Ctries,335,21

RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review of the evidence for dietary changes occurring as a result of the pandemic-related restrictions, in Part I of this article, yielded 38 original research articles. These articles had conflicting results, some describing improvements in overall quality and some describing deteriorations. As a whole the studies were characterized by a low study quality, and children were poorly represented. Taken together, these studies do not provide enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether dietary habits changed or not as a result of the pandemic. However, in a wider, narrative review of the psychosocial changes occurring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the known associations of these factors with a dietary intake in Part II, we conclude that there is a reason to expect that the dietary quality of children might have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. One the one hand, the literature fails to provide conclusive evidence on changes in the dietary quality of children resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the broader literature supports the hypothesis that children's dietary quality will have declined during the pandemic. Taken together, we urgently need more high-quality research on children's changes in dietary intake occurring over the pandemic. This will provide important information on whether any potential long-term consequences of such changes, if they exist, need to be examined and ameliorated.","Campbell, Heather; Wood, Alexis C",Curr. nutr. rep,335,16

This study investigated the trends in cycling-related injuries requiring orthopaedic intervention during the COVID-19 lockdown period compared with similar time periods in 2018 and 2019. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for patients in 2020 and collected retrospectively for 2019 and 2018, from hospitals within four NHS Scotland Health Boards encompassing three major trauma centres. All patients who sustained an injury as a result of cycling requiring orthopaedic intervention were included. Patient age, sex, mechanism of injury, diagnosis and treatment outcome from electronic patient records. RESULTS: Number of injuries requiring surgery 2020: 77 (mean age/years - 42.7); 2019: 47 (mean age/years - 42.7); 2018: 32 (mean age/years - 31.3). Overall incidence of cycling injuries 2020: 6.7%; 2019: 3.0%; 2018: 2.1%. Commonest mechanism of injury: fall from bike 2020 n = 54 (70.1%); 2019 n = 41 (65.1%); 2018 n = 25 (67.6%). Commonest injury type: fracture 2020 n = 68 (79.1%); 2019 n = 33 (70.2%); 2018 n = 20 (62.5%). Commonest areas affected: Upper extremity: 2020 n = 45 (58.5%); 2019 n = 25 (53.2%); 2018 n = 25 (78.1%). Lower extremity: 2020 n = 23 (29.9%); 2019 n = 14 (29.7%); 2018 n = 7 (21.8%). CONCLUSION: A significant increase in the number of cycling related injuries requiring orthopaedic intervention, a greater proportion of female cyclists and an older mean age of patients affected was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown period compared with previous years. The most common types of injury were fractures followed by lacerations and fracture-dislocations. The upper extremity was the commonest area affected.","Faulkner, Alastair; MacDonald, David R W; Neilly, David W; Davies, Peter S E; Ha, Taegyeong T; Stevenson, Iain M; Jariwala, Arpit C",Surg.

The robotic platform is made up of an automatic curtain and 3 NAO social robots. The elements are controlled from a user interface (GUI) that easily and intuitively allows the creation of theatrical scripts. As part of the investigation, the adaptation of the play “Planeta” by the author Alan Rejón was staged. This was presented to three groups of people. The first scenario places professionals in the area of education: teachers of regular primary education, students of initial education, and an educational psychologist. A second scenario is a group of students between the ages of 8 and 9. The results obtained show a 92% acceptance of research as an innovative tool, and 90% of those surveyed consider that robotic plays can awaken children’s awareness in education.

Here, we describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Catalonia (Spain) and investigate the dynamics of household transmission. METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter study performed during summer and school periods (1 July-31 October, 2020), in which epidemiological and clinical features, and viral transmission dynamics were analyzed in COVID-19 patients <16 years. A pediatric index case was established when a child was the first individual infected within a household. Secondary cases were defined when another household member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before the child. The secondary attack rate (SAR) was calculated, and logistic regression was used to assess associations between transmission risk factors and SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: The study included 1040 COVID-19 patients <16 years. Almost half (47.2%) were asymptomatic, 10.8% had comorbidities, and 2.6% required hospitalization. No deaths were reported. Viral transmission was common among household members (62.3%). More than 70% (756/1040) of pediatric cases were secondary to an adult, whereas 7.7% (80/1040) were index cases. The SAR was significantly lower in households with COVID-19 pediatric index cases during the school period relative to summer (p=0.02), and when compared to adults (p=0.006). No individual or environmental risk factors associated with the SAR were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Children are unlikely to cause household COVID-19 clusters or be major drivers of the pandemic even if attending school.

However, subgroup analysis of ACTT-1 Study Group showed an apparent reduction in mortality for patients who required non­high-flow oxygen. Presentation of SOLIDARITY study results were associated by a meta-analysis combining mortality results by subsets rom randomized clinical trials. The aim is a methodological assessment of reliability and clinical applicability about findings by subgroups on the effect of remdesivir on mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A validated tool was used to evaluate the findings of subgroup analyses in randomized clinical trials, including meta-analysis atached to SOLIDARITY study. It is structured in preliminary questions to reject subset analyses without relevant minimum conditions, and a specific checklist. The latter considers certain criteria: statistical association, which encompassed p of interaction, prespecification of subgroups, sample size, number of factors analyzed, and overall study result; biological plausibility of observed differences; and consistency between results of similar studies. A score was assigned to each criterion and the tool related global summation to a recommendation on the applicability of subset results in clinical decision making. RESULTS: Preliminary questions had positive answers, so checklist was applied. Statistical association obtained ""null"" assessment (-3 points), including a ""doubtful"" p of interaction (p = 0.0650) among subgroups and mortality reached no statistical significance for global population. These findings reduced the reliability of subset analysis. Biological plausibility was considered ""probable"" (+3 points) because antiviral could have a greater effect before the inflammatory process and clinical worsening. Consistency between results of similar studies was evaluated as ""possible"" (+2 points) analysis for compatibility of ACTT-1 and SOLIDARITY study results. The recommendation about application of subset analysis results according to the risk of patients was ""null"". CONCLUSIONS: This structured interpretation of subgroup analysis suggested too much uncertainty in hypothesis about remdesivir could reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 who required non-high- flow oxygen. It was probably a random finding. Therefore, a randomized clinical trial about effect of remdesivir in mortality in patients with COVID­19 and non-high-flow oxygen is essential.","Alegre-Del Rey, Emilio Jesús; Gil-Sierra, Manuel David; Alarcón de la Lastra-Romero, Catalina; Sánchez-Hidalgo, Marina",Farm Hosp,335,20

The results revealed that QX-like IBV strain SD was severely pathogenic in chickens, causing respiratory, urinary and reproductive infections, irrespective of age, based on clinical observations, viral distribution in tissues and a ciliostasis study. Severe respiratory signs, tracheal cilia injury, nephritis and abnormal development of the oviduct and ovarian follicles were evident throughout the experiment. A challenge experiment demonstrated that the homologous QX vaccine showed superior protection efficacy compared with other available vaccines, confirming the importance of IBV vaccine seed homology against the circulating IBV strains.

Herein, an antifouling electrochemical biosensor was constructed based on electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) nanowires and newly designed peptides for the detection of the COVID-19 N-gene. The inverted Y-shaped peptides were designed with excellent antifouling properties and two anchoring branches, and their antifouling performances against proteins and complex biological media were investigated using different approaches. Based on the biotin-streptavidin affinity system, biotin-labeled probes specific to the N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of COVID-19 were immobilized onto the peptide-coated PANI nanowires, forming a highly sensitive and antifouling electrochemical sensing interface for the detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid. The antifouling genosensor demonstrated a wide linear range (10-14 to 10-9 M) and an exceptional low detection limit (3.5 fM). The remarkable performance of the genosensor derives from the high peak current of PANI, which is chosen as the sensing signal, and the extraordinary antifouling properties of designed peptides, which guarantee accurate detection in complex systems. These crucial features represent essential elements for future rapid and decentralized clinical testing.","Song, Zhen; Ma, Yihui; Chen, Min; Ambrosi, Adriano; Ding, Caifeng; Luo, Xiliang",Anal Chem,335,24

This study aimed to describe the impact of the early phase of the pandemic on physician decision-making, practice patterns, and mental health. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to physician members of the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) on March 24 and April 7, 2020. Respondents provided information regarding changes in clinical volume, treatment, and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-4]) before April 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1,430 individuals who opened the survey, 260 completed it (18.2%). Overall clinical and procedural volume decreased to 69.6% and 13.0% of prepandemic volume, respectively. Mean in-person clinic visits were reduced to 17.7% of total prepandemic clinic volume. Ongoing clinical visits were predominantly completed via telemedicine (video) or telephone (74.5%), rather than in-person (25.5%). Telemedicine and telephone visits represented 24.6% and 27.3% of prepandemic clinical volume, respectively. Respondents decreased in-person visits of select groups of high-risk patients by 85.8-94.6%.

After its first report in China in December 2019, the disease already spread and affected more than 200 countries worldwide. It correlates with different phenotypes ranging from an acute febrile illness to severe respiratory problems. Often, patients with COVID-19 suffer from metabolic disorders, and this can result in a more severe clinical course. COVID-19 might also co-occur with other common diseases in different settings. In tropical countries, COVID-19 has already affected thousands of local populations. Tropical diseases such as dengue and tuberculosis can modify the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and result in difficulty in the diagnosis and treatment of the patients. The complexity of concurrence between COVID-19 and tropical diseases is, thus, a matter of concern in tropical medicine. This chapter is devoted to discussing problems surrounding the management of COVID-19 in tropical countries. To exemplify the effects of COVID-19 on tropical countries, the authors would show how COVID-19 has affected Indochina, a large tropical area.","Sookaromdee, Pathum; Wiwanitkit, Viroj",Adv Exp Med Biol,335,10

In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.

BACKGROUND: Distancing measures aim to break the coronavirus transmission chains. Physical separation from social networks and social isolation are correlated with anxiety and depression. People with a chronic obstructive lung disease are particularly vulnerable due to the increased risk of a serious course of illness, so therefore many of them choose self-isolation to protect themselves from COVID-19. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study using individual semi-structured interviews. METHODS: From June-September 2020, 13 participants were recruited through advertisements on Facebook as a convenience sample for semi-structured individual interviews. The interviews took place through virtual platforms or in physical meetings. Data were analysed using Ricoeur's phenomenological approach, involving naïve reading, a structural analysis and a critical interpretation strategy. The study has been reported in line with COREQ guidelines. FINDINGS: Living with the threat of being infected with coronavirus has greatly affected everyday life for patients with COPD. The nagging fear of coronavirus as a death threat was a dominant feeling, together with anxiety, loneliness and hope. With self-isolation, followed concerns of being forgotten and thoughts of the future, balancing between fearing the worst, and hoping the best. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate to severe COPD feel compelled to self-isolate, as they fear dying from COVID-19. The study revealed a need for proactive contact with health professionals to calm the patients' feelings of deprivation, loneliness, hopelessness and anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Information about the patient's perspective may be used to develop targeted interventions aimed at giving adequate information, supporting hope, implementing digital or virtual solutions to keep in contact and avoid the feeling of being alone and forgotten during a pandemic crisis.","Mousing, Camilla Askov; Sørensen, Dorthe",J. clin. nurs,335,30

Methods: English medical literature with MeSh database was searched using the key words such as ""COVID-19 pandemic,"" ""ICU preparedness,"" ""COVID-19 management,"" ""COVID-19 therapy,"" and ""COVID-19 systemic effects."" The relevant studies were included with significant inputs from interdepartmental meetings for the formulation of a plan. Results: The analysis of the respective studies highlighted the requirements of COVID-19 designated intensive care units (ICUs) with special provisions and the therapeutic agents being used in critical patients with emphasis on Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, Convalescent Plasma, and insight into newer agents. The systemic manifestations of COVID-19 requiring ICU care such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial injury, arrhythmias, hypercoagulable state, and acute renal dysfunction have been highlighted. The need of updating records with research protocols cannot be disregarded. The care of patients should not compromise the health-care personnel requirements. Conclusion: The evidence-based preparedness strategy can curtail the critical care crunch in COVID-19 management;however, institutional specific approach should be formulated.","Sahu, M.

We focus on how trained GNN models could leak information about the \emph{member} nodes that they were trained on. In particular, we focus on answering the question: given a graph, can we determine which nodes were used for training the GNN model? We operate in the inductive settings for node classification, which means that none of the nodes in the test set (or the \emph{non-member} nodes) were seen during the training. We propose a simple attack model which is able to distinguish between the member and non-member nodes while just having a black-box access to the model. We experimentally compare the privacy risks of four representative GNN models. Our results show that all the studied GNN models are vulnerable to privacy leakage. While in traditional machine learning models, overfitting is considered the main cause of such leakage, we show that in GNNs the additional structural information is the major contributing factor.","Olatunji, Iyiola E.; Nejdl, Wolfgang; Khosla, Megha",,335,5

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD admitted to the western district of Union Hospital in Wuhan, from January 20, 2020 to February 15, 2020. They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and general group (n=96) according to the severity of the disease and patients were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte count (0.74×10(9) (0.34×10(9), 0.94×10(9))/L vs. 0.99×10(9) (0.71×10(9), 1.29×10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20 (0.15,0.48) µg/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)µg/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0) kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17, 15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the non-survivors, there were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25 kg/m(2), which was significantly higher than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with the survived patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10, 1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower lymphocyte counts.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on ad hoc questions. RESULTS: Of 214 mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients managed at home under self-isolation, 179 reported to have at least one household contact, with the total number of no study participants contacts being 296. Among 175 household contacts not tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 67 (38.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 compatible symptoms, 39 (22.3%) had loss of smell or taste with 7 (4.0%) having loss of smell or taste in the absence of other symptoms. The prevalence of smell or taste impairment was 1.5% in patients tested negative compared to 63.0% of those tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Smell or taste impairment are quite common in not-tested household contacts of mildly symptomatic home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients.

We develop a method to quantify neighborhood activity behaviors at high spatial and temporal resolutions and test whether, and to what extent, behavioral responses to social-distancing policies vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We define exposure density ([Formula: see text]) as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring in distinct land-use types. Using detailed neighborhood data for New York City, we quantify neighborhood exposure density using anonymized smartphone geolocation data over a 3-mo period covering more than 12 million unique devices and rasterize granular land-use information to contextualize observed activity. Next, we analyze disparities in community social distancing by estimating variations in neighborhood activity by land-use type before and after a mandated stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effects of localized demographic, socioeconomic, and built-environment density characteristics on infection rates and deaths in order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our findings demonstrate distinct behavioral patterns across neighborhoods after the stay-at-home order and that these variations in exposure density had a direct and measurable impact on the risk of infection. Notably, we find that an additional 10% reduction in exposure density city-wide could have saved between 1,849 and 4,068 lives during the study period, predominantly in lower-income and minority communities.","Hong, Boyeong; Bonczak, Bartosz J; Gupta, Arpit; Thorpe, Lorna E; Kontokosta, Constantine E",Proc.

Patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) are believed to be in a vulnerable category. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of a hub cancer center and the measures that were put in place for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioma. METHODS: To prevent in-hospital contagion and preserve the safety of health professionals and patients, specific protocols and strict regulations were introduced. Physical distancing, use of surgical masks, and diligent hand hygiene were adopted. Each case was discussed in a multidisciplinary board meeting before treatment. All patient candidates for surgical procedures were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a nasopharyngeal swab and a chest CT scan. Indications for surgery were the radiological suspicion of HGG in patients with a good performance status and/or the rapid and progressive occurrence of neurological deficits. Adjuvant treatments were performed only in cases of HGG. This therapy consisted of conventional fractional radiotherapy (RT; 60 Gy/30 fractions) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy (TMZCHT) in younger patients; in elderly patients, a short course of RT was employed (40.5 Gy/15 fractions). For recurrent HGG, treatments were assessed after a careful evaluation of the patient's general condition, neurological status, and risk of early impairment in neurological status if not treated. During simulation CT for the RT plan, each patient underwent a chest CT study. In cases in which an imaging study was suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia, the patient was immediately isolated and rapidly underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing. RESULTS: Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, 23 HGGs were treated, and these cases are included in the present evaluation. Fifteen patients harboring newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) underwent resection followed by a regimen of chemotherapy and RT, and 3 patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma underwent surgery followed by adjuvant RT. Five patients were treated for recurrent GBM, and they received surgery plus adjuvant RT. One patient in whom the simulation CT study was suspicious for COVID pneumonia was tested with a nasopharyngeal swab, which proved positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. No patients contracted COVID-19 during hospitalization for surgery or during RT treatment. Corticosteroid therapy was administered to all patients beginning on the 1st day of RT. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' experience during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that patients with HGG can be treated in the most effective manner without a compromise in safety. Careful selection criteria and a multidisciplinary evaluation are pivotal to assessing the optimal therapeutic strategy.","Pessina, Federico; Navarria, Pierina; Bellu, Luisa; Clerici, Elena; Politi, Letterio Salvatore; Tropeano, Maria Pia; Simonelli, Matteo; Fornari, Maurizio; Scorsetti, Marta",Neurosurg Focus,335,18

Widely used to decontaminate nonporous surfaces, UV-C light has demonstrated germicidal efficacy on porous, non-planar N95 respirators when all surfaces receive &#8805;1.0 J/cm2 dose. Of utmost importance across disciplines, translation of empirical evidence to implementation relies upon UV-C measurements frequently confounded by radiometer complexities. To enable rigorous on-respirator measurements, we introduce a photochromic indicator dose quantification technique for: (1) UV-C treatment design and (2) in-process UV-C dose validation. While addressing outstanding indicator limitations of qualitative readout and insufficient dynamic range, our methodology establishes that color-changing dosimetry can achieve the necessary accuracy (>90%), uncertainty (<10%), and UV-C specificity (>95%) required for UV-C dose measurements. In a measurement infeasible with radiometers, we observe a striking ~20× dose variation over N95s within one decontamination system. Furthermore, we adapt consumer electronics for accessible quantitative readout and use optical attenuators to extend indicator dynamic range >10× to quantify doses relevant for N95 decontamination. By transforming photochromic indicators into quantitative dosimeters, we illuminate critical considerations for both photochromic indicators themselves and UV-C decontamination processes.","Su, Alison; Grist, Samantha M; Geldert, Alisha; Gopal, Anjali; Herr, Amy E",PLoS One,335,21

Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives. However, one can anticipate a pandemic-related increase in surgical morbidity and mortality above prepandemic levels, particularly in older or medically frail patients even if they did not have a novel coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19) infection. Therefore, now is the time to consider for patients awaiting surgery a wider adoption of prehabilitation-physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments.","Silver, Julie K",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,335,16

METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry between the years of 1975 and 2016 were analyzed, which included 19,048 women with cancer of the anal canal. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression (HRs) was performed to examine the relative risk of dying among women with anal cancer. Multivariable odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to examine odds of highly fatal disease (death within 12 months from diagnosis). RESULTS: Non-Hispanic Black women (n = 1694) had greater risk of dying when compared with non-Hispanic White women (n = 15,821) with anal cancer (HR = 1.26, CI: 1.17-1.35), independent of other prognostic indicators. Stratifying by age at diagnosis, risk of death was highest for non-Hispanic Black women diagnosed younger than age 50 years compared with non-Hispanic White women of similar age (HR = 1.60, CI: 1.34-1.89), and lowest for Hispanic women (n = 1533) older than 74 years at diagnosis (HR = 0.80, CI: 0.69-0.92).

This has led to massive global economic disruption, placed additional strain on local and global public health resources and, above all, threatened human health. We conducted a review of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, written in English, reporting on the current COVID-19 pandemic. This data includes previously used strategies against infectious disease, recent clinical trials and FDA-approved diagnostic and treatment strategies. The literature was obtained through a systematic search using PubMed, Web of Sciences, and FDA, NIH and WHO websites. Of the 98 references included in the review, the majority focused on pathogen and host targeting, symptomatic treatment and convalescent plasma utilization. Other sources investigated vaccinations in the pipeline for the possible prevention of COVID-19 infection. The results demonstrate various conventional as well as potentially advanced in vitro diagnostic approaches (IVD) for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Mixed results have been observed so far when utilising these approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Some treatments have been found highly effective in specific regions of the world while others have not altered the disease process. The responsiveness of currently available options is not conclusive. The novelty of this disease, the rapidity of its global outbreak and the unavailability of vaccines have contributed to the global public's fear. It is concluded that the exploration of a range of diagnostic and treatment strategies for the management of COVID-19 is the need of the hour.","Jamshaid, Humzah; Zahid, Fatima; Din, Intisar Ud; Zeb, Alam; Choi, Han Gon; Khan, Gul Majid; Din, Fakhar Ud",AAPS PharmSciTech,335,24

We formulate and implement a variant of Gradient boosting wherein the weak learners are DNNs whose weights are incrementally found in a greedy manner over iterations. In particular, we develop a new embedding architecture that improves the performance of many deep learning models on time series using Gradient boosting variant.

For instance, in the current COVID-19 crisis, patients can expect prolonged intubation. This protracted intubation may produce health complications such as tracheal stenosis, pneumonia, and necrosis of tracheal tissue, as current ETTs are not designed for extended use. In this work, we propose an improved ETT design that seeks to overcome these limitations by utilizing unique geometries which enable a novel expanding cylinder. The mechanism provides a better distribution of the contact forces between the ETT and the trachea, which should enhance patient tolerability. Results show that at full expansion, our new ETT exerts pressures in a silicone tracheal phantom well within the recommended standard of care. Also, preliminary manikin tests demonstrated that the new ETT can deliver similar performance in terms of air pressure and air volume when compared with the current gold standard ETT. The potential benefits of this new architected ETT are threefold, by limiting exposure of healthcare providers to patient pathogens through streamlining the intubation process, reducing downstream complications, and eliminating the need of multiple size ETT as one architected ETT fits all.","Berard, David; Navarro, Juan David; Bascos, Gregg; Harb, Angel; Feng, Yusheng; De Lorenzo, Robert; Hood, R Lyle; Restrepo, David",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,335,29

PSGL-1 involvement in core molecular programs, such as SYK, PLCγ2, PI3Kγ or MAPK pathways, suggests additional functions beyond the modulation of cell trafficking. Recently, several studies identified a novel mechanism responsible for PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment and proved a novel concept of PSGL-1 as a critical checkpoint molecule for tumor immunotherapy. The immunotherapeutic approach has gained an ever-growing interest in the treatment of several hematological malignancies, and in particular, novel targets for immunotherapy are still highly sought-after in T-cell lymphomas. Based on our results obtained through gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical analysis, PSGL-1, already suggested as a potential target in multiple myeloma humoral immunotherapy, could be considered noteworthy among the candidates.AbstractDue to the high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in lymphoproliferative disorders and in multiple myeloma, it has been considered as a potential target for humoral immunotherapy, as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor in T-cells. By investigating the expression of SELPLG in 678 T- and B-cell samples by gene expression profiling (GEP), further supported by tissue microarray and immunohistochemical analysis, we identified anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL) as constitutively expressing SELPLG at high levels. Moreover, GEP analysis in CD30+ ALCLs highlighted a positive correlation of SELPLG with TNFRSF8 (CD30-coding gene) and T-cell receptor (TCR)-signaling genes (LCK, LAT, SYK and JUN), suggesting that the common dysregulation of TCR expression in ALCLs may be bypassed by the involvement of PSGL-1 in T-cell activation and survival. Finally, we evaluated the effects elicited by in vitro treatment with two anti-PSGL-1 antibodies (KPL-1 and TB5) on the activation of the complement system and induction of apoptosis in human ALCL cell lines. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that PSGL-1 is specifically enriched in ALCLs, altering cell motility and viability due to its involvement in CD30 and TCR signaling, and it might be considered as a promising candidate for novel immunotherapeutic approaches in ALCLs.","Belmonte, Beatrice Cancila Valeria Gulino Alessandro Navari Mohsen Arancio Walter Macor Paolo Balduit Andrea Capolla Sara Morello Gaia Vacca Davide Ferrara Ines Bertolazzi Giorgio Balistreri Carmela Rita Amico Paolo Ferrante Federica Maiorana Antonino Salviato Tiziana Piccaluga Pier Paolo Mangogna Alessandro",Cancers,335,23

Strengthening national preparedness requires National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs), or their equivalent, to overcome practical challenges affecting timely access to, and use of, data that is critical to preparedness. Our situational analysis in collaboration with NPHIs in three countries-Ethiopia, Nigeria and Pakistan-characterises these challenges. Our findings indicate that NPHIs' role necessitates collection and analysis of data from multiple sources that do not routinely share data with public health authorities. Since initiating requests for access to new data sources can be a lengthy process, it is essential that NPHIs are routinely monitoring a broad set of priority indicators that are selected to reflect the country-specific context. NPHIs must also have the authority to be able to request rapid sharing of data from public and private sector organisations during health emergencies and to access additional human and financial resources during disease outbreaks. Finally, timely, transparent and informative communication of synthesised data from NPHIs will facilitate sustained data sharing with NPHIs from external organisations. These actions identified by our analysis will support the availability of robust information systems that allow relevant data to be collected, shared and analysed by NPHIs sufficiently rapidly to inform a timely local response to infectious disease outbreaks in the future.","Khan, Mishal S; Dar, Osman; Erondu, Ngozi A; Rahman-Shepherd, Afifah; Hollmann, Lara; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Ukandu, Okechukwu; Agogo, Emmanuel; Ikram, Aamer; Rathore, Tayyab Razi; Okereke, Ebere; Squires, Neil",,335,20

Potential unanswered questions regarding sedentary behaviour and physical activity during lockdown were explored. RESULTS: Five systematic reviews and six prospective trials explored the effect of sedentarism affecting chronic disease through potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Sedentary behaviour especially prolonged sitting is found to be a pleiotropic risk factor with altered energy expenditure, adipogenic signalling, immunomodulation, autonomic stability and hormonal dysregulation perpetuating underlying chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders.

Higher weight gain was associated with changes in the dietary pattern (3.8 ± 2.1 kg vs. 2.0 ± 1.3 kg in ""no change in dietary pattern""; p = 0.002). Glucose blood levels increased after lockdown in the SC group, with a mean increase of 15 mg/dl (p = 0.023). The remaining metabolic parameters remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: The maintenance of dietary intervention, using telemedicine, can mitigate the adverse change in dietary habits and physical activity pattern, preventing a substantial increase in body weight.","Policarpo, Sara; Machado, Mariana V; Cortez-Pinto, Helena",Clin Nutr ESPEN,335,16

Further, studies comparing cardiac biomarker levels in survivors versus nonsurvivors were included. A total of 14 studies (3,175 patients) were utilized for the final analysis. Cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of mortality (risk ratio [RR]:7.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.69 to 13.01; I2=58%), ICU admission (RR: 4.06; 95% CI: 1.50 to 10.97; I2â¯=â¯61%), mechanical ventilation (RR: 5.53; 95% CI: 3.09 to 9.91; I2â¯=â¯0%), and developing coagulopathy (RR: 3.86; 95% CI:2.81 to 5.32; I2â¯=â¯0%).

Limited by the ability of the country or city to perform tests, the officially reported number of confirmed cases is expected to be much smaller than the true number of infected cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a new susceptible-exposed-infected-confirmed-removed (SEICR) model for predicting the spreading progression of COVID-19 with consideration of intercity travel and the difference between the number of confirmed cases and actual infected cases, and to apply the model to provide a realistic prediction for the United States and Japan under different scenarios of active intervention. METHODS: The model introduces a new state variable corresponding to the actual number of infected cases, integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that a realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. RESULTS: By fitting the model with the data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the United States (February 20 to March 20, 2020), model parameters were found and then used to predict the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the United States. The model revealed that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the United States could be 20-fold and 5-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. The results showed that, without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the United States will see about 6.55% and 18.2% of the population eventually infected, respectively, and with a drastic 10-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The new SEICR model has revealed the effectiveness of active intervention for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Stepping up active intervention would be more effective for Japan, and raising the level of public vigilance in maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing is comparatively more important for the United States.","Zhan, Choujun; Tse, Chi Kong; Lai, Zhikang; Chen, Xiaoyun; Mo, Mingshen",JMIR Public Health Surveill,335,1

Although the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have long-lasting adverse psychological effects on children, there have been comparatively few studies on children's health as compared with adults, particularly in low-income countries. Uganda implemented one of the most stringent lockdowns with bans on transportation and gatherings as well as the closure of schools, stores and places of worship. In order to address the dearth of information in less developed regions, the article aims to provide an insight into the increased cases of child abuse in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data and information were primarily compiled from government and child welfare organisation open-source databases. The psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 have greatly disrupted the living conditions of children, limiting their access to basic needs such as food and health care. In addition, there is a lack of social support, thus putting children at an increased risk of different forms of child abuse. Since the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown in Uganda, there has been a rise in the incidence of child abuse. Increased cases of physical and sexual abuse against children have been reported in different parts of the country as well as increased cases of child labour.

After exponential growth, the pandemic&rsquo;s first wave was contained, with the last case being diagnosed 52 days after the initial occurrence. AIM: To characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Liechtenstein. METHODS: All patients diagnosed in Liechtenstein were followed up until recovery and again 6&ndash;8 weeks after symptom onset. They were contacted every 2 days to record their clinical status until the resolution of their symptoms. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on clinical symptoms and molecular testing. Household and close workplace contacts were included in the follow-up, which also comprised antibody testing. In addition, public health measures installed during the pandemic in Liechtenstein are summarised. RESULTS: During the first wave, 5% of the population obtained a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. A total of 95 patients (median age 39 years) were diagnosed with COVID-19 (82 who resided in Liechtenstein), resulting in an incidence in Liechtenstein of 0.211%. One patient, aged 94, died (mortality rate 1%). Only 62% of patients could retrospectively identify a potential source of infection. Testing the patients&rsquo; household and close workplace contacts (n = 170) with antibody tests revealed that 25% of those tested were additional COVID-19 cases, a quarter of whom were asymptomatic. Those households which adhered to strict isolation measures had a significantly lower rate of affected household members than those who didn&rsquo;t follow such measures. The national public health measures never restricted free movement of residents. Masks were only mandatory in healthcare settings. The use of home working for the general workforce was promoted. Gatherings were prohibited. Schools, universities, certain public spaces (like sports facilities and playgrounds), childcare facilities, nonessential shops, restaurants and bars were closed. Social distancing, hygienic measures, solidarity and supporting individuals who were at risk were the main pillars of the public health campaigns. CONCLUSION: The close collaboration of all relevant stakeholders allowed for the complete workup of all COVID-19 patients nationwide. A multitude of factors (e.g., young age of the patients, low-threshold access to testing, close monitoring of cases, high alertness and adherence to public health measures by the population) led to the early containment of the first wave of the pandemic, with a very low rate of serious outcomes. Antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 revealed a substantial proportion of undiagnosed COVID-19 cases among close contacts of the patients.","Thiel, Sarah Lucia; Weber, Myriam Carol; Risch, Lorenz; Wohlwend, Nadia; Lung, Thomas; Hillmann, Dorothea; Ritzler, Michael; Risch, Martin; Kohler, Philipp; Vernazza, Pietro; Kahlert, Christian R; Fleisch, Felix; Cusini, Alexia; Karajan, Tomas V; Copeland, Sandra; Paprotny, Matthias",Swiss Med Wkly,335,1

Thus, it is critical to detect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using natural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting misinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language processing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and effectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with fact checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset for AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good performance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in order to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects experiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE), and text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in the TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition. Our results provided good implications in detecting misinformation about COVID-19 and improving public trust.","Ayoub, Jackie; Yang, X. Jessie; Zhou, Feng",,335,10

Neck circumference is a simple and low-cost measure that can estimate this risk precociously. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the cardiovascular risk obtained by Neck Circumference (NC) is associated with the main cardiometabolic risk factors in patients on hemodialysis treatment on waiting list for transplantation. METHODS: cross-sectional study including 96 patients in a single transplantation center. Sociodemographic, clinical-laboratory and anthropometric data were collected. NC was considered as a dependent variable and the independent variables were body mass index (BMI), biochemical tests of fasting glycemia and lipid profile, triglyceride ratio and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TGL / HDL-C) and triglyceride Index and glycemia (TyG). For the comparison of averages, we used the Mann Whitney and Students t Tests, as well as the one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis tests. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed for the association between NC and cardiometabolic risk factors. A significance level of 5% was assumed. RESULTS: There were higher BMI averages, blood glucose, triglycerides (TGL), TGL/HDL-C ratio and TyG index in the tertile 3 of the NC, whereas the HDL-c decreased as the tertile increased. There was a statistically significant risk of cardiovascular disease, according to NC, with overweight, high levels of TGL, TGL/HDL-c, TyG index, and low HDL-c. CONCLUSION: NC has been shown to be associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in kidney patients undergoing hemodialysis on transplant waiting lists.","Medeiros, Lívia Torres; Sales, Andressa Eslayne Caldas; da Silva E Sousa, Francisca Isabelle; Moreira, Tyciane Maria Vieira; Batista, Ana Clara Vital; Braga, Ribanna Aparecida Marques; Daltro, Ana Filomena Camacho Santos; de Oliveira, Claudia Maria Costa",J. hum. nutr. diet,335,4

In this review, we critically appraise guidance in regard to pharmacologic considerations unique to pregnant and lactating women with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We summarize the evidence, which supports the routine use of antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate and low-dose aspirin where clinically indicated, and if not contraindicated for medical reasons. We highlight that decision-making about initiation, dose and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation for pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be made by a multidisciplinary team and must consider disease severity, timing of delivery in relation to disease onset, inpatient versus outpatient status, underlying comorbidities, and contraindications to the use of anticoagulation. We discuss the rationale behind suggested modifications to the use of peripartum analgesia and anaesthesia at the time of the pandemic, as well as considerations specific to mechanically-ventilated pregnant patients. Finally, we discuss emerging evidence supporting the reduction in mortality in patients with COVID-19 with the use of corticosteroids, while tabulating up-to-date information on the safety of various investigational therapies for COVID-19. It is hoped that this comprehensive review while providing guidance to clinicians caring for pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic will also encourage researchers to consider their inclusion in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.

Case reports and case series have shown encouraging results. This study investigated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and epidemiological characteristics in convalescent plasma donors, to identify criteria for donor selection. METHODS: Recovered COVID-19 patients, aged 18-55 years, who had experienced no symptoms for more than 2 weeks, were recruited. Donor characteristics such as disease presentations were collected and SARS-CoV-2 N-specific IgM, IgG, and S-RBD-specific IgG levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Whereas levels of N-specific IgM antibody declined after recovery, S-RBD-specific and N-specific IgG antibodies increased after 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms, with no significant correlation to age, sex, or ABO blood type. Donors with the disease presentation of fever exceeding 38.5°C or lasting longer than 3 days exhibited higher levels of S-RBD-specific IgG antibodies at the time of donation. Of the 49 convalescent plasma donors, 90% had an S-RBD-specific IgG titer of &#8805;1:160 and 78% had a titer of &#8805;1:640 at the time of plasma donation. Of the 30 convalescent plasma donors, who had donated plasma later than 28 days after the onset of symptoms and had a disease presentation of fever lasting longer than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5°C, 100% had an S-RBD-specific IgG titer of &#8805;1:160 and 93% had a titer of &#8805;1:640. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the S-RBD-specific IgG antibody reaches higher levels after 4 weeks from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. We recommend the following selection criteria for optimal donation of COVID-19 convalescent plasma: 28 days after the onset of symptoms and with a disease presentation of fever lasting longer than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5°C. Selection based on these criteria can ensure a high likelihood of achieving sufficiently high S-RBD-specific IgG titers.","Li, Ling; Tong, Xunliang; Chen, Hanwei; He, Rui; Lv, Qilu; Yang, Ru; Zhao, Lei; Wang, Jue; Xu, Haixia; Liu, Chuanqiao; Chen, Guoan; Chen, Sitian; Li, Chenyue; Qiao, Jiajia; Yang, Juntao; Wu, Yanyun; Liu, Zhong",Transfusion,335,2

The assessment of their uptake in tissues is mandatory but, to date, available technology does not allow to track and quantify incorporation in real-time. To fill this knowledge gap, the present study was intended to develop an innovative technology to determine kinetics of fluorescent MSC-EV uptake by means of time-lapse quantitative microscopy techniques. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs)-EVs were fluorescently labeled and tracked during their uptake into chondrocytes micromasses or cartilage explants, both derived from OA patients. Immunofluorescence and time-lapse coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation and two-photon excited fluorescence were used to follow and quantify incorporation. EVs penetration appeared quickly after few minutes and reached 30-40 µm depth after 5 h in both explants and micromasses. In explants, uptake was slightly faster, with EVs signal overlapping both extracellular matrix and chondrocytes, whereas in micromasses a more homogenous diffusion was observed. The finding of this study demonstrates that this innovative technology is a powerful tool to monitor EVs migration in tissues characterized by a complex extracellular network, and to obtain data resembling in vivo conditions.","Mortati, Leonardo; de Girolamo, Laura; Perucca Orfei, Carlotta; Viganò, Marco; Brayda-Bruno, Marco; Ragni, Enrico; Colombini, Alessandra",,335,1

This has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions. Anatomy faces some unique challenges. Intrinsically, anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures, often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material, models, and virtual resources. This study sought to identify the approaches taken in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means. Data were collected from 14 different universities in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach. Once themes were generated, they were collectively brought together using a strength, weakness, opportunity, threat (SWOT) analysis. Key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations. Academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources was to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure. Comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveal the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand. Discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy.","Longhurst, Georga J; Stone, Danya M; Dulohery, Kate; Scully, Deirdre; Campbell, Thomas; Smith, Claire F",Anat Sci Educ,335,30

This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in social settings. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at aspects of the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require measures to be switched on and off and for this reason elimination is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for elimination, it would not on its own be an efficient mechanism to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up elimination, and be a better tool for the prevention of infection or reinfection. Because the analysis presented here is theoretical, and not data-driven, it is intended to be a stimulus for further data-collection, particularly on individual interactivity levels, and for more comprehensive modelling which takes account of the type of heterogeneity discussed here. While there are some clear lessons from the simple model presented here, policy makers should have these tested and validated by epidemiological specialists before acting on them.","Bronk Ramsey, Christopher",PLoS One,335,32

METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with DKA and managed in our pediatric ED during a 1-year period. A ""flight plan"" was created for each patient's ED visit, from triage to final disposition. Each flight was analyzed with the goal of identifying threats and errors that may impact patients' clinical status or management. Particular focus was placed on physicians' adherence to hospital and provincial DKA protocols. Unintended patient states or outcomes were also noted. RESULTS: A total of 46 patient flights were outlined and analyzed. A total of 146 threats were identified, affecting 43 (93%) patient flights. No flight was error-free. Errors in communication and lack of adherence to protocol were the most common types of errors. Unintended patient states occurred in 30 cases (65%), some of which were preceded by at least 1 error. There were no cases of cerebral edema or death. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to identify and appropriately mitigate threats and errors that commonly occur during initial management of DKA in the ED to prevent unintended states and patient morbidity. This study demonstrates the threat-and-error model as a potentially useful tool for focusing quality improvement initiatives in the pediatric ED setting.","Tenedero, Christine Bernice; Soliman, Aiah; Samaan, M Constantine; Kam, April Jacqueline",Pediatr. emerg. care,335,24

In addition, several studies suggest that more vulnerable women are less likely to use them. Yet significant investments continue to be made in building and running MWHs within conflict-affected and under-resourced health systems. AIMS: We critically examine the literature to shed light on the challenges and opportunities provided by MWHs during health emergencies and in conflict situations. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: MWHs are difficult to utilise during crises because they require women to be away from home, are often designed as dormitories, can lack security and be over-crowded. Some MWHs have been adapted during situations of political conflict to incorporate birthing and broader reproductive health care, thereby improving the availability of care away from over-burdened health facilities. How MWHs are adapted during times of crisis may provide insights into what systems of care are more appropriate in meeting women's needs more broadly. CONCLUSION: The current global pandemic is an important time to reflect on whether MWHs are meeting the needs of a diverse range of women, in times of stability and during emergencies, and engage in genuine dialogue with women about the kinds of maternity care they want. We need to co-create those systems now so that they are more resilient during the inevitable crises we will face in the future.","Wild, Kayli; Kurji, Jaameeta",,335,1

Weighted average mean times to tracheotomy, to decannulation, and to death were calculated from reported or approximated means. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were screened by 3 investigators independently. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies including patients with COVID-19 who underwent a tracheotomy were identified. Studies without reported mechanical ventilation weaning or decannulation were excluded. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: After identifying 232 unique studies, 18 articles encompassing outcomes for 3234 patients were ultimately included for meta-analysis, with a weighted mean follow-up time of 28.6 ± 6.2 days after tracheotomy. Meta-analysis revealed that 55.0% of tracheotomized patients were weaned successfully from mechanical ventilation (95% CI, 47.4%-62.2%). Approximately 34.9% of patients were decannulated successfully, with a mean decannulation time of 18.6 ± 5.7 days after tracheotomy. The pooled mortality in tracheotomized patients with COVID-19 was 13.1%, with a mean time of death of 13.0 ± 4.0 days following tracheotomy. CONCLUSION: At the current state of the coronavirus pandemic, over half of patients who have required tracheotomies are being weaned off of mechanical ventilation. While 13.1% patients have died prior to decannulation, over a third of all tracheotomized patients with COVID-19 reported in the literature have undergone successful decannulation.","Benito, Daniel A; Bestourous, Daniel E; Tong, Jane Y; Pasick, Luke J; Sataloff, Robert T",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,335,16

Objective To assess the immunological and virological response to antiretroviral therapy among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected individuals. Method This is a cross-sectional study including people living with HIV (PLHIV) taking antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months and was conducted in Dhulikhel Hospital in 2017. The socio-demographic profile, clinical characteristics, CD4 count and viral load were analyzed. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic and other characteristics was done. Result Fifty-two patients undertaking antiretroviral therapy were included in the study with the mean age of 29.69±9.59 years at diagnosis. The majority of the patients were male (51.9%). Sexual transmission was the dominant mode of transmission (78.9%). The mean CD4 count at baseline was 244.08±214.32 cells/µL. Four patients (7.7%) had a virological failure.

272604,272604,272604,Impacts of COVID-19 on childhood malnutrition and nutrition-related mortality,16.689356,5.292831,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The emergence of the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus disease COVID-19 has impacted enormously on non-COVID-19-related hospital care. Curtailment of intensive care unit (ICU) access threatens complex surgery, particularly impacting on outcomes for time-sensitive cancer surgery. Oesophageal cancer surgery is a good example. This study explored the impact of the pandemic on process and short-term surgical outcomes, comparing the first wave of the pandemic from April to June in 2020 with the same period in 2019. METHODS: Data from all four Irish oesophageal cancer centres were reviewed. All patients undergoing resection for oesophageal malignancy from 1 April to 30 June inclusive in 2020 and 2019 were included. Patient, disease, and peri-operative outcomes (including COVID-19 infection) were compared. RESULTS: In 2020, 45 patients underwent oesophagectomy, and 53 in the equivalent period in 2019. There were no differences in patient demographics, co-morbidities, or use of neoadjuvant therapy. The median time to surgery from neoadjuvant therapy was 8 weeks in both 2020 and 2019. There were no significant differences in operative interventions between the two time periods. There was no difference in operative morbidity in 2020 and 2019 (28% vs 40%, p = 0.28). There was no in-hospital mortality in either period. No patient contracted COVID-19 in the perioperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing surgical resection for oesophageal cancer was feasible and safe during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. The national response to this threat was therefore successful by these criteria in the curative management of oesophageal cancer.","Bolger, Jarlath C; Donlon, Noel E; Butt, Waqas; Neary, Colm; Al Azzawi, Mohammed; Brett, Orla; King, Sinead; Downey, Eithne; Arumugasamy, Mayilone; Murphy, Thomas; Robb, William B; Collins, Chris G; Carroll, Paul A; Donohoe, Claire L; Ravi, Narayanasamy; Reynolds, John V",Ir. j. med. sci,335,23

Some of these alternative treatments maybe second-best. Treatments that are known to be superior might not be appropriate to deliver during a pandemic when consideration must be given to distributive justice and protection of patients and their medical teams as well the importance given to individual benefit and autonomy. What is required of the doctor discussing these alternative, potentially inferior treatments and seeking consent to proceed? Should doctors share information about unavailable but standard treatment alternatives when seeking consent? There are arguments in defence of non-disclosure; information about unavailable treatments may not aid a patient to weigh up options that are available to them. There might be justified concern about distress for patients who are informed that they are receiving second-best therapies. However, we argue that doctors should tailor information according to the needs of the individual patient. For most patients that will include a nuanced discussion about treatments that would be considered in other times but currently unavailable. That will sometimes be a difficult conversation, and require clinicians to be frank about limited resources and necessary rationing. However, transparency and honesty will usually be the best policy.","Turnham, Helen Lynne; Dunn, Michael; Hill, Elaine; Thornburn, Guy T; Wilkinson, Dominic",J Med Ethics,335,7

Indeed, neutralizing titers of &#8805;1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here, we performed repeated analyses at 1-month intervals on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that the levels of receptor-binding-domain (RBD)-specific IgG and IgA slightly decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after the onset of symptoms but that RBD-specific IgM levels decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S or its D614G variant. If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after resolution of symptoms.IMPORTANCE While waiting for an efficient vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, alternative approaches to treat or prevent acute COVID-19 are urgently needed. Transfusion of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients is currently being explored; neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma is thought to play a central role in the efficacy of this treatment. Here, we observed that plasma neutralization activity decreased a few weeks after the onset of the symptoms.

The explanation for this finding is not entirely clear. The goal of this study was to compare clinical characteristics, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcome between men and women. This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 Virginia hospitals from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers, including C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, and the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, as well as patient outcomes, were compared between men and women. During the study period, 701 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted. The patient's mean age was 61±17 years. There were 370 men (52.8%). There was no difference in age, racial distribution, and comorbidities in the male patients compared with the female patients. However, both the baseline and peak levels of CRP and ferritin were significantly higher in men as compared with women. While the baseline D-dimer was similar between the sexes, men had a significantly higher maximal D-dimer. Men had evidence of greater disease severity, with a significantly greater admission to the intensive care unit and borderline higher hospital mortality. Our study supports the observation that COVID-19 causes more severe disease in men. The greater disease severity in men was not due to the effect of age or comorbidities; however, in keeping with experimental studies, men had evidence of a heightened inflammatory response, likely contributing to disease severity.","Marik, Paul Ellis; DePerrior, Sarah E; Ahmad, Qamar; Dodani, Sunita",J. invest. med,335,23

In this work, we present a convolutional neural network for detecting clinically-relevant abnormalities in $\text{T}_2$-weighted head MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report classifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK hospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans labelled by a team of neuroradiologists.

The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has forced universities to switch from face-to-face to online instruction. Furthermore, this transfer process was planned and executed quickly, with urgent redesigns of courses originally conceived for live teaching. The aim of this work is to measure the service quality of online teaching delivered during the COVID-19 period. The methodology was based on an importance-performance analysis using a structural equations model. The data were obtained from a sample of 467 students attending a university in southern Spain. The results reveal five priority attributes of online teaching that need to be improved in order to enhance the service quality of the virtual instruction provided to students. Universities need to redefine their online format by integrating methodological and technological decisions and involving collaboration between teachers, students and administration staff and services. The results do not apply to educational institutions that exclusively teach courses online, but to those institutions that had to rapidly adapt, and shift course material originally designed for face-to-face training.","Ramírez-Hurtado, José M; Hernández-Díaz, Alfredo G; López-Sánchez, Ana D; Pérez-León, Víctor E",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),335,16

A 40% increase in effective transmission would yield a rebound of infections. A control effort capable of isolating daily ~5.5% of the exposed and highly infectious individuals proves necessary to maintain the epidemic curve onto the decreasing baseline trajectory.

Because SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through the air and has a relatively long incubation time, COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a global pandemic. As there are no antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of this severe pathogen except for remdesivir, development of antiviral therapies to treat infected individuals remains highly urgent. Here, we showed that baicalein and baicalin exhibited significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 through in vitro studies. Our data through cell-based and biochemical studies showed that both compounds act as SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors directly and inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, but baicalein was more potent. We also showed specific binding of baicalein to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it a potential candidate for further studies towards therapeutic development for COVID-19 as a selective non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor.","Zandi, Keivan Musall Katie Oo Adrian Cao Dongdong Liang Bo Hassandarvish Pouya Lan Shuiyun Slack Ryan L.; Kirby, Karen A.; Bassit, Leda Amblard Franck Kim Baek AbuBakar Sazaly Sarafianos Stefan G.; Schinazi, Raymond F.",Microorganisms,335,3

As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.","Koenig, Kristi L; Beÿ, Christian K; McDonald, Eric C",West J Emerg Med,335,16

Whether the immune response to T&#945;1 treatment for SARS-CoV-2 differs between the sexes, and whether this difference explains the male susceptibility to COVID-19, is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the efficiency and safety of T&#945;1 treatment and provide a basis for practically identifying gender differences characteristics and features of COVID-19. One hundred twenty-seven patients had COVID-19 symptoms and tested COVID19-positive (female 42.52%) in Wuhan union hospital were enrolled for medication. They were randomly divided into groups Control and T&#945;1 intervention. Seventy-eight patients received a subcutaneous injection of 1.6 mg T&#945;1, based on supportive treatment for 15 days. The control group included untreated 49 COVID19 patients closely matched for gender and age and received regular supportive treatment. In this retrospective analysis, we found that COVID-19-infected males reported more symptoms than COVID-19-infected females. A high degree of gender differences-related variability was observed in CRP and PCT levels and the cell counts of many lymphocyte subpopulations in the COVID-19 patients after T&#945;1 intervention. Levels of CRP and IL-6 were higher in T&#945;1-treated male group than T&#945;1-treated female group, while the level of PCT was significantly lower in T&#945;1-treated male group. Gender differences may be a factor in sustaining COVID-19 immunity responded to T&#945;1, male and female show statistically significant differences in relevance to cytokine production associated with the development of a more significant number of symptoms.

We also quantify the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19. We examined the situation when the true prevalence is low (0.07%-2%), medium (2%-5%) and high (6%-10%). Bayesian models informed by published validity estimates were used to account for misclassification error when estimating COVID-19 prevalence. Adjustment for misclassification error captured the true prevalence 100% of the time, irrespective of the true prevalence level. When adjustment for misclassification error was not done, the results highly varied depending on the population's underlying true prevalence and the type of diagnostic test used. Generally, the prevalence estimates without adjustment for misclassification error worsened as the true prevalence level increased. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data led to a minimal but not significant increase in the estimated average daily cases.

METHODS: Case-control study conducted March 15 to June 15, 2020. Cases were infants born to mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at delivery. The infant of non COVID-19 mother born before and after each case were selected as controls. RESULTS: Of 695 deliveries, 62 (8.9%) infants were born to COVID-19 mothers; 124 controls were selected. Among cases, 18.3% were preterm compared to 8.1% in controls (p=0.04). In preterm cases, birth weight was not significantly different between groups. However, there was a significantly higher proportion of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, need for respiratory support, suspected sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, feeding intolerance and longer length of stay (LOS) in preterm cases. Among term cases, birth weight and adverse outcomes were not significantly different between cases and controls except for more feeding intolerance in cases. All infants born to COVID-19 mothers were COVID-19 negative at 24 and 48 h of life. No infants expired during birth hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly, more infants of COVID-19 mothers were premature compared to controls. Preterm cases were more likely to have adverse outcomes despite having similar birth weight and gestational age. These differences were not seen among full term infants. Health care providers should anticipate the need for NICU care when a COVID-19 mother presents in labor.","Zgutka, Kinga; Prasanth, Kaninghat; Pinero-Bernardo, Shirley; Lew, Lily Q; Cervellione, Kelly; Rhythm, Rhythm; Rahman, Lubna; Dolmaian, Gigliola; Cohen, Lourdes",J. perinat. med,335,8

However, recent studies are reporting emergence of aspergillosis in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, named as COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from February 2020 to April 2020. Patients &#8805;18 years of age with clinical features and abnormal chest imaging with confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included. CAPA was diagnosed based on clinical parameters, radiological findings and mycological data. Data were recorded on a structured proforma, and descriptive analysis was performed using Stata ver 12.1. RESULTS: A total of 147 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 23 (15.6%) patients requiring ICU admission were identified. Aspergillus species were isolated from tracheal aspirates of nine (39.1%) patients, and of these, five patients (21.7%) were diagnosed with CAPA and four (17.4%) had Aspergillus colonisation. The mean age of patients with CAPA was 69 years (Median age: 71, IQR: 24, Range: 51-85), and 3/5 patients were male. The most frequent co-morbid was diabetes mellitus (4/5). The overall fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with aspergillosis was 44% (4/9). The cause of death was ARDS in all three patients with CAPA, and the median length of stay was 16 days (IQR: 10; Range 6-35 days).

We described the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in a large urban jail system, including signs and symptoms at time of testing and risk factors for hospitalization. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all patients aged &#8805;18 years who were tested for COVID-19 during March 11-April 28, 2020, while in custody in the New York City jail system (N = 978). We described demographic characteristics and signs and symptoms at the time of testing and performed Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with hospitalization among those with a positive test result. RESULTS: Of 978 people tested for COVID-19, 568 received a positive test result. Among symptomatic patients, the most common symptoms among those who received a positive test result were cough (n = 293 of 510, 57%) and objective fever (n = 288 of 510, 56%). Of 257 asymptomatic patients who were tested, 58 (23%) received a positive test result. Forty-five (8%) people who received a positive test result were hospitalized for COVID-19. Older age (aged &#8805;55 vs 18-34) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 13.41; 95% CI, 3.80-47.33) and diabetes mellitus (aHR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.00-3.95) were significantly associated with hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of people tested in New York City jails received a positive test result for COVID-19, including a large proportion of people tested while asymptomatic. During periods of ongoing transmission, asymptomatic screening should complement symptom-driven COVID-19 testing in correctional facilities. Older patients and people with diabetes mellitus should be closely monitored after COVID-19 diagnosis because of their increased risk for hospitalization.","Chan, Justin; Burke, Kelsey; Bedard, Rachael; Grigg, James; Winters, John; Vessell, Colleen; Rosner, Zachary; Cheng, Jeffrey; Katyal, Monica; Yang, Patricia; MacDonald, Ross",Public Health Rep,335,33

Moreover, dentists experience unique challenges with preventing transmission due to frequent aerosol-producing procedures. This paper presents reviews and protocols implemented by directors and residents at the Dental College of Georgia to manage a dental emergency clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. The methods presented include committee-based prioritization of dental patients, a multilayered screening process, team rotations with social and temporal spacing, and modified treatment room protocols. These efforts aid in the reduction of viral transmission, conservation of personal protective equipment, and expand provider availability.

Therefore, fast and accurate diagnosis of infection is key to timely treatment and elimination of the spread of the virus. Currently, the standard method for detecting coronavirus is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this method requires expensive equipment and trained personnel, which limits the conduct of mass testing and lengthens the time to obtain a research result. Serological tests for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the determination of protective immunity in various populations are used to retrospectively identify patients with asymptomatic and mild forms of infection, monitor the course of infection in hospitalized patients, and also track contacts and epidemiological surveillance. The use of standard methods for diagnosing COVID-19 in conditions of mass morbidity, especially in conditions of insufficient resources and lack of appropriate infrastructure, is associated with a number of limitations.

The key to understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. METHODS: Using high-throughput sequencing of metatranscriptomic and hybrid captured libraries, we characterized consensus genomes and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) of serial samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The distribution of iSNVs along the SARS-CoV-2 genome was analyzed and co-occurring iSNVs among COVID-19 patients were identified. We also compared the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 population in the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). RESULTS: The 32 consensus genomes revealed the co-existence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30/40) iSNVs presented in a single patient, while ten iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparing allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed a clear genetic differentiation between intra-host populations from the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events during intra-host migrations. Compared to RT populations, the GIT populations showed a better maintenance and rapid development of viral genetic diversity following the suspected intra-host bottlenecks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings here illustrate the intra-host bottlenecks and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in different anatomic sites and may provide new insights to understand the virus-host interactions of coronaviruses and other RNA viruses.","Wang, Yanqun; Wang, Daxi; Zhang, Lu; Sun, Wanying; Zhang, Zhaoyong; Chen, Weijun; Zhu, Airu; Huang, Yongbo; Xiao, Fei; Yao, Jinxiu; Gan, Mian; Li, Fang; Luo, Ling; Huang, Xiaofang; Zhang, Yanjun; Wong, Sook-San; Cheng, Xinyi; Ji, Jingkai; Ou, Zhihua; Xiao, Minfeng; Li, Min; Li, Jiandong; Ren, Peidi; Deng, Ziqing; Zhong, Huanzi; Xu, Xun; Song, Tie; Mok, Chris Ka Pun; Peiris, Malik; Zhong, Nanshan; Zhao, Jingxian; Li, Yimin; Li, Junhua; Zhao, Jincun",Genome Med,335,16

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV. They were admitted to the third people's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.","Feng, K; Yun, Y X; Wang, X F; Yang, G D; Zheng, Y J; Lin, C M; Wang, L F",Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,335,1

The Chi-square was used to compare difference for worry and anxiety among categorical variables. The logistic regression was used to examine the associations between worry as well as anxiety and individual as well as environmental factors. In total, 1970 respondents were recruited and completed an online survey on worry regarding COVID-19, general anxiety during the pandemic, and individual and environmental factors. In total, 51.7% and 43.4% of respondents reported high levels of worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety, respectively. Exhibited worse self-rated mental health, lower self-confidence in COVID-19 management, and insufficient mental health resources were significantly associated with high levels of both worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety. Lower perceived confidence in COVID-19 management by the regional government was associated with a higher level of worry toward COVID-19. Lower perceived social support was associated with a higher level of general anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that high levels of worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety were prevalent during the outbreak. This suggests health care providers need additional surveillance of worry and anxiety during the pandemic. Multiple individual and environmental factors related to worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety were identified. Factors found in the present study can be used for the development of intervention programs, supportive services, and government policy to reduce worry and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lu, Wei-Hsin; Ko, Nai-Ying; Chang, Yu-Ping; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Wang, Peng-Wei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),335,24

All patients completed the first measurement on the day of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan (t = 0), but the second measurement (t = 1) depended on randomization; Group 1 (n = 49) completed the questionnaires before and Group 2 (n = 51) after the consultation with the physician. RESULTS: median HRQoL scale scores on t0/t1 and change scores were comparable between the two groups. Between 8-58% of patients changed to a clinically relevant extent (i.e., &#8805;10 points) on the evaluated HRQoL scales in about one-week time, in both directions, with only 3% of patients remaining stable in all scales. Patients with a stable role functioning had a lower HADS anxiety change score. The HADS depression score was not associated with a change in HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring HRQoL before or after the consultation did not impact HRQoL scores on a group level. However, most patients reported a clinically relevant difference in at least one HRQoL scale between the two time points. These findings highlight the importance of standardized moments of HRQoL assessments, or patient-reported outcomes in general, during treatment and follow-up in clinical trials.","Peeters, Marthe C M; Zwinkels, Hanneke; Koekkoek, Johan A F; Vos, Maaike J; Dirven, Linda; Taphoorn, Martin J B",,335,16

This was the first statewide randomized study of COVID-19 testing in the United States. Both PCR and serological tests were administered to all study participants. This paper describes statistical methods used to address nonresponse among various demographic groups and to adjust for testing errors to reduce bias in the estimates of the overall disease prevalence in Indiana. These adjustments were implemented through Bayesian methods, which incorporated all available information on disease prevalence and test performance, along with external data obtained from census of the Indiana statewide population. Both adjustments appeared to have significant impact on the unadjusted estimates, mainly due to upweighting data in study participants of non-White races and Hispanic ethnicity and anticipated false-positive and false-negative test results among both the PCR and antibody tests utilized in the study.","Yiannoutsos, Constantin T; Halverson, Paul K; Menachemi, Nir",Proc.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.","Xu, Kaijin; Cai, Hongliu; Shen, Yihong; Ni, Qin; Chen, Yu; Hu, Shaohua; Li, Jianping; Wang, Huafen; Yu, Liang; Huang, He; Qiu, Yunqing; Wei, Guoqing; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,335,22

Virulence of the disease has compelled densely populated countries like India to impose severest measures, which include full or partial lockdown to contain the virus spread. The contagious virus has put the lives of many in urban cities on hold and forced them to abandon or restrict regular activities, which includes a basic human need to travel to satisfy one’s daily needs. The eventual impact of the pandemic on individual mobility and the urban city’s sustainability depends upon the resilience of medium and long-term policies during such disruptive events. Objective In order to gauge the impact of this unprecedented disease on travel behavior and mobility patterns of individuals, a web survey is conducted in urban agglomerations of India. The idea is to record travel mode choices before, during and after situations. The study also attempts to elicit responses towards a safer and disaster-resilient public transport, which can also cater to the needs of private vehicle-owning individuals. Further, the study presents and evaluates a set of medium to long-term policy prescriptions to negate the repercussions of this crisis and seize the opportunity it has created so that the long-held dream of sustainable and resilient cities in the context of urban mobility is realized in the best way possible. Key findings The study findings indicate an increase in the car-dependency pan-India level post the COVID-19 crisis. Strikingly the captive users of public transport and non-motorized transport mode (walk) are also willing to make a shift towards private motorized vehicles (car, motorized two-wheeler). The eventual mobility shift will depend upon- (a) the recovery period of mass transportation systems to normalcy (b) investments and promotion of active travel modes (non-motorized transport, i.e., walk, bicycle). The findings also reveal that demand and the willingness to pay extra for a safer, faster, cleaner, comfortable, and most importantly, resilient public transport exists. Further, policy evaluations for sustainable and resilient recovery reveal - (a) the provision of bicycle superhighway will push the bicycle share from 31% to approximately 44% (b) travel demand moderation efforts such as (i) staggering of working days demonstrates the reduction in the congestion externalities. (ii) flexible arrangements for educational activities (two shifts in a day) facilitates overall gain in the system welfare, and (c) incentive such as reducing public transport fare has a positive impact on its share due to the mobility-shift from the private motorized vehicle. Interpretation and Implications of Results Investment and encouragement of active travel mode should be prioritized for personal well-being and disaster-resilient cities. Resilience planning should be an integral part of public transportation systems to handle the future shock of pandemics and other emergencies. Additionally, self-sustainable neighborhoods should be encouraged to reduce the trip lengths substantially or the need for private motorized transport for various secondary activities.","Thombre, Anurag Agarwal Amit",Transport Policy,335,21

When the European Food Safety Authority evaluated the hazards of edible insects as a potential source of pathogenic viruses for humans and livestock, the novel zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had not yet emerged but other pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS (SARS-CoV) and MERS (MERS-CoV) were known. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, animal sources of protein for human consumption are being evaluated for the risks of being a transmission vector of coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. Insects lack a receptor that can bind SARS-CoV-2, thus preventing the virus from replicating in insects, unlike some vertebrate livestock species and companion animals. Despite extensive monitoring, coronaviruses have never been recorded in insect microbiomes. Contamination of insects produced for food or feed may occur during the production process, resulting from rearing substrate or from insect farmers. However, the currently permitted rearing substrates do not include animal products and the farming process is highly automated, thus limiting interactions between farmers and insects. If contamination would still occur, the fact that the insects in production are not hosts to SARS-CoV-2 precludes virus replication and the further processing of the insects will destroy the contamination. We conclude that the hazard of edible insects being a transmission vector of SARS-CoV-2 is extremely low.","Dicke, M.; Eilenberg, J.; Salles, J. Falcao; Jensen, A. B.; Lecocq, A.; Pijlman, G.

RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 manipulate cellular pathways and induce reorganization of subcellular structures to support their life cycle. These morphological changes can be quantified using bioimaging techniques. In this work, we developed DEEMD: a computational pipeline using deep neural network models within a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, to identify putative treatments effective against SARS-CoV-2 based on morphological analysis of the publicly available RxRx19a dataset. This dataset consists of fluorescence microscopy images of SARS-CoV-2 non-infected cells and infected cells, with and without drug treatment. DEEMD first extracts discriminative morphological features to generate cell morphological profiles from the non-infected and infected cells. These morphological profiles are then used in a statistical model to estimate the applied treatment efficacy on infected cells based on similarities to non-infected cells. DEEMD is capable of localizing infected cells via weak supervision without any expensive pixel-level annotations. DEEMD identifies known SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, such as Remdesivir and Aloxistatin, supporting the validity of our approach. DEEMD is scalable to process and screen thousands of treatments in parallel and can be explored for other emerging viruses and datasets to rapidly identify candidate antiviral treatments in the future.","Saberian, M.Sadegh; Moriarty, Kathleen P.; Olmstead, Andrea D.; Nabi, Ivan R.; Jean, Franccois; Libbrecht, Maxwell W.; Hamarneh, Ghassan",,335,16

Numerical simulations show that the evolving dynamics of the network is effectively captured by a single scalar function of time, regardless of the distribution of $\beta$ in the population. The continuum limit of the network model allows a simple derivation of the simpler model, which is a single scalar delay differential equation (DDE), wherein the variation in $\beta$ appears through an integral closely related to the moment generating function of $u=\sqrt{\beta}$. If the first few moments of $u$ exist, the governing DDE can be expanded in a series that shows a direct correspondence with the original compartmental DDE with a single $\beta$. Even otherwise, the new scalar DDE can be solved using either numerical integration over $u$ at each time step, or with the analytical integral if available in some useful form. Our work provides a new academic example of complete dimensional collapse, ties up an underlying continuum model for a pandemic with a simpler-seeming compartmental model, and will hopefully lead to new analysis of continuum models for epidemics.","Vyasarayani, C.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (83.31%), ground glass opacities with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%), and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%), and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had three or more lobes involved (70.81%). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included ground glass opacities and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun",J Am Coll Radiol,335,1

Prior to the arrival of this viral pandemic, the world was already plagued with a significant burden of cardiovascular disease. With the introduction of the novel virus, the world now faces a double jeapordy. Early reports have suggested an increased risk of death in individuals with underlying cardio-metabolic disorders. The exact effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system are not well determined, however lessons from prior viral epidemics suggest that such infections can trigger acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias and heart failure via direct and indirect mechanisms. In this article, we aimed to discuss the effects and potential underlying mechanisms of COVID -19 as well as potential implications of treatments targeted against this virus on the cardiovascular system.","Rojulpote, Chaitanya; Gonuguntla, Karthik; Patil, Shivaraj; Bhattaru, Abhijit; Bravo, Paco E.",Colomb. med,335,10
293317,293317,293317,Coronavirus Disease-19 and Rhinology/Facial Plastics,16.772861,10.372623,2020,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a co-transcriptional/post-transcriptional modification of double-stranded RNA, catalysed by one of two active adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), ADAR1 and ADAR2. ADARB1 encodes the enzyme ADAR2 that is highly expressed in the brain and essential to modulate the function of glutamate and serotonin receptors. Impaired ADAR2 editing causes early onset progressive epilepsy and premature death in mice. In humans, ADAR2 dysfunction has been very recently linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly and epilepsy in four unrelated subjects. METHODS: We studied three children from two consanguineous families with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) through detailed physical and instrumental examinations. Exome sequencing (ES) was used to identify ADARB1 mutations as the underlying genetic cause and in vitro assays with transiently transfected cells were performed to ascertain the impact on ADAR2 enzymatic activity and splicing. RESULTS: All patients showed global developmental delay, intractable early infantile-onset seizures, microcephaly, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, axial hypotonia and progressive appendicular spasticity. ES revealed the novel missense c.1889G>A, p.(Arg630Gln) and deletion c.1245_1247+1 del, p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variants in ADARB1 (NM_015833.4). The p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variant leads to incorrect splicing resulting in frameshift with a premature stop codon and loss of enzyme function. In vitro RNA editing assays showed that the p.(Arg630Gln) variant resulted in a severe impairment of ADAR2 enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these data support the pathogenic role of biallelic ADARB1 variants as the cause of a distinctive form of DEE, reinforcing the importance of RNA editing in brain function and development.","Maroofian, Reza; Sedmík, Jirí; Mazaheri, Neda; Scala, Marcello; Zaki, Maha S; Keegan, Liam P; Azizimalamiri, Reza; Issa, Mahmoud; Shariati, Gholamreza; Sedaghat, Alireza; Beetz, Christian; Bauer, Peter; Galehdari, Hamid; O039,; Connell, Mary A; Houlden, Henry",J. medical. genet,335,27

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another 'flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location-Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.","Gopalan, Aditya; Tyagi, Himanshu",J Indian Inst Sci,335,16

The current global challenge highlighted the need to develop a rapid and cost-effective strategy to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in viral infections. Viruses can use the host lipid machinery to support their life cycle and to impair the host immune response. The altered expression of mevalonate pathway-related genes, induced by several viruses, assures survival and spread in host tissue. In some infections, statins, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, reduce cholesterol in the plasma membrane of permissive cells resulting in lower viral titers and failure to internalize the virus. Statins can also counteract viral infections through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. Beyond statins, interfering with the mevalonate pathway could have an adjuvant effect in therapies aimed at mitigating endothelial dysfunction and deregulated inflammation in viral infection. In this review we depicted the historical and current evidence highlighting how lipid homeostasis and mevalonate pathway targeting represents a valid approach to rapidly neutralize viruses, focusing our attention to their potential use as effective targets to hinder SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality. Pros and cons of statins and Mevalonate-pathway inhibitors have been also dissected.","Proto, Maria Chiara; Fiore, Donatella; Piscopo, Chiara; Pagano, Cristina; Galgani, Mario; Bruzzaniti, Sara; Laezza, Chiara; Gazzerro, Patrizia; Bifulco, Maurizio",Prog Lipid Res,335,16

For promoting the optimization of infection prevention measures by identifying acts and situations with high risk of infection, we conducted a survey and analysis to understand the detailed process of infection spread in these cases. METHODS: A structured interview was conducted for the special training participants on their health status, changes in symptoms, training methods, and behavior history in their private lives. Additionally, a patrol of the training facility was carried out to understand the training environment, and antibody tests were conducted on the close contacts for more accurately grasping the spread of infection, by identifying subclinical infected persons. RESULTS: Within 10 days of COVID-19 onset in the first patient, 15 of the 19 original training participants developed symptoms, and 14 patients tested positive for RT-PCR. PCR tests were also performed on four patients who did not develop the disease - two were positive and negative, each. The two negatives turned positive on a later antibody test, suggesting that there was an asymptomatic infection. In addition, all five patients who participated in the training for only a day developed symptoms and tested positive for PCR in a few days. Of the 64 people who underwent testing for antibodies as close contacts, all but one who was living together with a patient were negative on antibody testing. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 occurred after the start of practice-based training continuously; therefore, the practice-based training was thought to be the main cause of the transmission. We speculate that the main factors behind the rapid spread of infection are as follows: during practice-based training, increased ventilation made it difficult to wear a mask; repeated loud vocalizations at close range; and the training pair was not fixed. Physical training without shouting and desk work, however, did not possess the risk of COVID-19, and avoiding certain situations at high risk of respiratory infections may have significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission. If personnel become infected with SARS-CoV-2, emergency measures should be devised by identifying patients and close contacts and facilitating the investigation of their behavioral history. Furthermore, evaluating and improving the effectiveness of infection control measures is necessary by ascertaining potentially infected persons by performing PCR tests, antigen tests, antibody tests, etc. in combination.","Tsushita, Keitaro; Kobayashi, Syoko; Uno, Saori; Urano, Yuko; Ikedo, Mayumi",Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi,335,26

However, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis remains unknown. Using UK Biobank resource, we investigated the association between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and mortality risk (available death data updated on 07 Sep 2020) among COVID-19 patients who had pre-diagnostic serum IGF-1 measurements at baseline (2006-2010). Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality. Among 1670 COVID-19 patients, 415 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. Compared to the lowest quartile of IGF-1 concentrations, the highest quartile was associated with a 41% lower risk of mortality (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.86, P-trend = 0.01). In the continuous model, per 1-standard deviation increment in log-transformed IGF-1 was associated with a 15% reduction in the risk (intraclass correlation coefficients corrected OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.99). The association was largely consistent in the various stratified and sensitivity analyses.

This multinational study assessed whether demand for SARS-CoV-2 tests could also be predicted by Google searches for key COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: The weekly number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Italy and the United States was retrieved from official sources. A concomitant electronic search was performed in Google Trends, using terms for key COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: The model that provided the highest coefficient of determination for the United States (R2 = 82.8%) included a combination of searching for cough (with a time lag of 2 weeks), fever (with a time lag of 2 weeks), and headache (with a time lag of 3 weeks; the time lag refers to the amount of time between when a search was conducted and when a test was administered). In Italy, headache provided the model with the highest adjusted R2 (86.8%), with time lags of both 1 and 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Weekly monitoring of Google Trends scores for nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms is a reliable approach for anticipating SARS-CoV-2 testing demands ~2 weeks in the future.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Santos de Oliveira, Maria Helena; Henry, Brandon M",,335,16

To respond effectively to this pandemic, it is mandatory to reaffirm science in its different fields of study, including the food safety area. Presently, we review food safety in times of COVID-19, exploring whether the virus can be transmitted by food or water; recommendations from regulatory agencies; perceptions of food hygiene practices during the pandemic; and post-pandemic perspectives. The review was based on papers published in Web of Science, Scopus, Pubmed, and covered recommendations of public health protection and regulatory agencies around the world. The transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) by food was not confirmed until the present time. In any case, the protocols already established for food safety were reinforced, emphasizing the proper hygiene of hands after shopping, handling food packages, or before manipulating or eating food, adequate social distance, the use of individual protection equipment, the health of employees, and the proper preparation of food. It is hoped, in the post-pandemic scenario, to reach a better understanding of the particularities that led to greater care with food hygiene.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the aforementioned considerations. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of observational cohort studies reporting on the occurrence and/or outcomes of patients with cerebrovascular events in association with their SARSCoV- 2 infection status. We used a random-effects model. Summary estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: We identified 16 cohort studies including 44,004 patients. Among patients with SARS-CoV- 2, 1.3% (95%CI: 0.9-1.8%;I =88%) were hospitalized for cerebrovascular events, 1.2% (95%CI: 0.8-1.5%;I =85%) for ischemic stroke, and 0.2% (95%CI: 0.1-0.4%;I =69%) for hemorrhagic stroke. Compared to non-infected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased odds of ischemic stroke (OR=3.58, 95%CI: 1.43-8.92;I =43%) and cryptogenic stroke (OR=3.98, 95%CI: 1.62-9.77;I =0%). Odds for in-hospital mortality were higher among SARS-CoV-2 stroke patients compared to non-infected contemporary or historical stroke patients (OR=5.60, 95%CI: 3.19-9.80;I =45%). SARS-CoV-2 infection status was not associated to the likelihood of receiving intravenous thrombolysis (OR=1.42, 95%CI: 0.65-3.10;I =0%) or endovascular thrombectomy (OR=0.78, 95%CI: 0.35-1.74;I =0%) among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Diabetes mellitus was found to be more prevalent among SARS-CoV-2 stroke patients compared to non-infected contemporary or historical controls(OR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.04-1.86;I =0%). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 appears to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke,particularly the cryptogenic subtype. SARS-CoV-2 infection in stroke substantially increases themortality risk.","Katsanos, A. H.; Palaiodimou, L.; Zand, R.; Yaghi, S.; Kamel, H.; Navi, B.

METHODS: The ELISA was based on serum IgG reactivity to a 46-kDa protein derived from the recombinant SARS-CoV2 nucleoprotein. Assay sensitivity was assessed using serum samples from 134 COVID-19 confirmed cases obtained > 15 days after symptom onset. Specificity was determined by testing sera from 94 healthy controls. Cross-reactivity was evaluated with sera from 96 individuals with previous dengue or zika virus-confirmed infections, with 44 sera from individuals with confirmed infections to other respiratory viruses or with bacterial and fungal infections that cause pneumonia and with 40 sera negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein by commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: The majority of subjects were male and &#8805; 60 years old. Assay sensitivity was 90.3 % (95 % confidence interval 84.1 %-94.2 %) and specificity was 97.9 % (92.6 %-99.4 %). There was no cross-reactivity with sera from individuals diagnosed with dengue, zika virus, influenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, seasonal coronavirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus (S. aureus and coagulase-negative), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The level of concordance of our test with results from commercial ELISA kits was 100 %. CONCLUSION: The nucleoprotein-based ELISA was specific for detection of IgG anti-nucleoprotein antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. It utilizes a frequently employed low expense assay protocol and is easier to perform than other currently available commercial SARS-CoV2 antibody detection tests.","Tozetto-Mendoza, Tania Regina; Kanunfre, Kelly Aparecida; Vilas-Boas, Lucy Santos; Sanchez Espinoza, Evelyn Patricia; Paião, Heuder Gustavo Oliveira; Rocha, Mussya Cisotto; de Paula, Anderson Vicente; de Oliveira, Maura Salaroli; Zampelli, Daniella Bosco; Vieira, José Mauro; Buss, Lewis; Costa, Silvia Figueiredo; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira; Witkin, Steven S; Okay, Thelma Suely; Mendes-Correa, Maria Cassia",J Virol Methods,335,1

Eighty COVID-19 suspects enrolled for the paired sampling. In addition to conventional sampling, suspects were asked to follow stepwise pictorial instructions for self salivary sampling. Separate nylon swab stick was used for taking the samples from NP-OP and the floor of the oral cavity. The data were analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, concordance of COVID-19 status, and limits of agreement for cycle threshold (ct) values by either method. Forty-nine suspects (61.3%) were males, the mean age was 36.4 years. To determine the diagnostic test performance of the saliva, RT-PCR results of the NP-OP samples were used as the reference standard. Out of 80 suspects, 41 showed positivity by NP-OP swabs and 12 by salivary samples. The salivary samples showed significantly lesser positivity rate. The sensitivity and specificity of salivary samples against conventional reference standards are 24.4%, 94.9% respectively. Concordance of these two types of samples in terms of agreement kappa statistics is estimated as K = 0.252 (0.09-0.42). Median ct values of both the E and ORF1ab gene for the salivary samples were higher compared to the corresponding NP-OP sample. This study showed lesser sensitivity with salivary swab samples as compared to conventional NP-OP sampling for RT-PCR, COVID-19 detection.

It could, however, affect their involvement in advance care planning and patients' quality of death. Recent studies on this topic have mostly focused on advance directives but not ACP and nurses in the ward setting. This study aimed to assess the perception of Hong Kong nursing undergraduates of the nurse's role in advance care planning and examine its associations with knowledge, attitude, and experience. A cross-sectional 57-item survey was delivered to nursing undergraduates between June and August 2020. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test were used for univariate analysis. The multiple logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. A total of 469 participants were assessed for eligibility; 242 of them were included in the data analysis, with a response rate of 97.6%. The majority of respondents-77.3% (95% CI: 72.0-82.6%)-perceived having a role in ACP, but large discrepancies were found between their perception of their role regarding different aspects of ACP. Participants who had a better knowledge status (p = 0.029) or supported the use of ACP (p < 0.001) were more likely to have a positive perception of their role in ACP. A negative correlation was found between the experience of life threat and positive role perception (p < 0.001). Through strengthening training, the role clarity of nursing undergraduates could be achieved, maximizing their cooperation with and implementation of ACP in their future nursing career. The enhancement of end-of-life education could also be undertaken to fill nursing undergraduates' knowledge gap in this area and change their attitudes.","Ng, Suet Ying; Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),335,25

The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the perceptions of healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general population regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, (2) to evaluate factors influencing the acceptance of vaccination using the health belief model (HBM), and (3) to qualitatively explore the suggested intervention strategies to promote the vaccination. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on electronic survey data that was collected in Iraq during December first-19th, 2020. The electronic survey was designed using Qualtrics. HBM was followed to develop the survey items. A regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing people accepting vaccination. Thematic analysis for participant comments to an open-ended question. RESULTS: A total of 1680 completed surveys were received. The mean age of 31.2 ± 9.9 years, 53.0% were female and 47.0% were male. The largest group was HCWs (45.7%), followed by general population (37.5%) and health college students (16.8%). Our findings expressed some hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine with the acceptance rate of 61.7%. The HCWs perceived significantly higher susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. The HCWs were significantly more likely than the general population to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns with proper storage was the biggest barrier to vaccine receipt. The regression analysis indicated eight factors that were significantly associated with the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine: Preventive measures, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, cue to action, subjective norm, supportive of vaccination in general and having received a flu vaccine before. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness campaign can focus on enhancing the vaccine perceived benefit, debunking misconceptions, and increasing the disease perceived severity. Additionally, the public health leaders need to minimize the perceived barriers by providing the vaccines and appeasing people concerns about their storage, effectiveness, and adverse events.","Al-Metwali, Basma Zuheir; Al-Jumaili, Ali Azeez; Al-Alag, Zahraa Adel; Sorofman, Bernard",J. eval. clin. pract.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97â%) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4â%, -47.2â%, -47.5â%, -40.7â%, -58.4â%, and -25.2â% respectively.

The viable yellow agouti mouse (Avy) is a powerful epigenetic biosensor model that reports on the DNA methylation status of the Avy locus, which is established prior to the three-germ-layer separation, through the coat color of the animals. Here we show that maternal exposure to rotenone, a potent mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, not only changes the DNA methylation status of the Avy locus in the skin but broadly affects the liver DNA methylome of the offspring. These effects are accompanied by altered gene expression programs that persist throughout life, and which associate with impairment of antioxidant activity and mitochondrial function in aged animals. These pervasive and lasting genomic effects suggest a putative role for mitochondria in regulating life-long gene expression programs through developmental nuclear epigenetic remodeling.","Lozoya, Oswaldo A; Xu, Fuhua; Grenet, Dagoberto; Wang, Tianyuan; Grimm, Sara A; Godfrey, Veronica; Waidyanatha, Suramya; Woychik, Richard P; Santos, Janine H",Cell Rep,335,30

This study tries to identify a suitable pool testing method and algorithm for COVID-19. METHODS: This study tries to derive a general equation for the number of tests required for a pooled sample to detect every infected individual in the specific pool. The gain in pool testing over normal procedure is quantified by the percentage of tests required compared to individual testing. RESULTS: The percentage of tests required by the pool testing strategy varies according to the different splitting procedures, the size of the pooled sample, and the probability of an individual being infected in the population. If the probability of infection is 0.05, then for a pool size of 32, only 14 tests, are sufficient to detect every infected individual.

However, the effectiveness of these apps depends highly on their uptake by the general population. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated factors influencing app use intention, based on the health belief model. In addition, associations with respondents' level of news consumption and their health condition were investigated. METHODS: A survey was administered in Flanders, Belgium, to 1500 respondents, aged 18 to 64 years. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate relationships across the model's constructs. RESULTS: In total, 48.70% (n=730) of respondents indicated that they intend to use a COVID-19 tracing app. The most important predictor was the perceived benefits of the app, followed by self-efficacy and perceived barriers. Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility were not related to app uptake intention. Moreover, cues to action (ie, individuals' exposure to [digital] media content) were positively associated with app use intention. As the respondents' age increased, their perceived benefits and self-efficacy for app usage decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives to stimulate the uptake of contact tracing apps should enhance perceived benefits and self-efficacy. A perceived barrier for some potential users is privacy concerns. Therefore, when developing and launching an app, clarification on how individuals' privacy will be protected is needed. To sustain perceived benefits in the long run, supplementary options could be integrated to inform and assist users.","Walrave, Michel; Waeterloos, Cato; Ponnet, Koen",JMIR Public Health Surveill,335,16

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an awake tracheal intubation in a suspected COVID-19–positive patient. Various modifications were put in place during the awake tracheal intubation and surgical tracheostomy procedures to minimise aerosol generation from the patient, such as avoiding high-flow nasal oxygen, establishing conscious sedation with remifentanil before commencing airway topicalisation and avoiding transtracheal local anaesthetic infiltration. A multidisciplinary team discussion before performing the case highlighted aspects of both the airway management and the surgical procedure where particular care and modifications are required. There is a lack of national and international guidance for awake tracheal intubation and tracheostomy in COVID-19 cases.

One of these behaviors is social distancing, which is influenced by diverse variables. Using data from an online survey with 405 responses, this study performed multiple regression analysis to explore effects of personality, risk perception, and personal hygiene practices on social distancing among residents of Qatar. The results showed that 87.3% of participants reported that they preferred to stay at home and not go outside unless necessary, 60.3% said that they maintain an adequate distance when communicating with others, 68.6% reported that they do not allow relatives and friends to visit them at home, 73.5% believed that COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, and 95.8% reported that they embrace personal hygiene practices and washing hands. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that conscientiousness, neuroticism, risk perception, and personal hygiene practices predicted social distancing, with moderate effect sizes. Gender differences were also found in social distancing practices, indicating that women reported higher engagement in social distancing practices than men. These results highlighted the importance of individual differences in reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide important information about the predictors of social distancing practices.","Abdelrahman, Mohamed",Int J Ment Health Addict,335,1

The purpose of this study is to assess changes in STEMI volumes, door to reperfusion, and the time from the onset of symptoms until reperfusion therapy, and in-hospital events between the pre-COVID-19 (PC) and after COVID-19 (AC) period. All acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) cases were retrospectively identified from 16 centers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 period from January 01 to April 30, 2020. These cases were compared to a pre-COVID period from January 01 to April 30, 2018 and 2019. One thousand seven hundred and eighty-five patients with a mean age 56.3 (SD ± 12.4) years, 88.3% were male.

Studies on lung cancer diagnosis and treatment during an epidemic are lacking. We analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer diagnosis in Korea, where lung cancer incidence continues to rise. METHODS: The number of newly diagnosed lung cancer cases in three university-affiliated hospitals during the pandemic and their clinical features were compared with lung cancer cases diagnosed during the same period in the past 3 years. The effectiveness of measures taken by the study hospitals to prevent nosocomial transmission was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 612 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer from February through June, 2017-2020. During the pandemic, the number of patients who sought consultation at the division of pulmonology of study hospitals dropped by 16% from the previous year. Responding to the pandemic, the involved hospitals created physically isolated triage areas for patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Wide-range screening and preventive measures were implemented, thus minimizing the delay in lung cancer diagnosis. No patient acquired COVID-19 due to hospital exposure. The proportion of patients with stage III-IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) significantly increased (2020: 74.7% vs. 2017: 57.9%, 2018: 66.7%, 2019: 62.7%, p = 0.011). The number of lung cancers diagnosed during this period and the previous year remained the same.

STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter case series. SETTING: Five tertiary care hospitals (3 in China, 1 in France, 1 in Germany). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In total, 394 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19-positive patients were screened, and those with olfactory or gustatory dysfunction were included. Data including demographics, COVID-19 severity, patient outcome, and the incidence and degree of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction were collected and analyzed. The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and visual analog scale (VAS) were used to quantify olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, respectively. All subjects at 1 hospital (Shanghai) without subjective olfactory complaints underwent objective testing. RESULTS: Of 394 screened subjects, 161 (41%) reported olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction and were included. Incidence of olfactory and/or gustatory disorders in Chinese (n = 239), German (n = 39), and French (n = 116) cohorts was 32%, 69%, and 49%, respectively. The median age of included subjects was 39 years, 92 of 161 (57%) were male, and 10 of 161 (6%) were children.

In many aspects, GI endoscopy has led the field of nonsurgical interventional medicine. In many aspects, this growth is facilitated by advancements in sedation-both drugs and techniques. Unfortunately, the topic of GI endoscopy sedation is also mired in many controversies, mainly emanating from the cost of anesthesia providers. While no one debates their role in the majority of advanced endoscopic procedures, the practice of universal propofol sedation in the USA, delivered by anesthesia providers, needs a closer look. In this review, medical, political, and economic considerations of this important topic are discussed in a very frank and honest way. While such ubiquitous propofol use has increased satisfaction of both patients and gastroenterologists, there is little justification. More importantly, going by the evidence, there is even less justification for the mandated anesthesia providers use for such delivery. Unfortunately, the FDA could not be convinced otherwise. The new drug fospropofol met the same fate. Approval of SEDASYS®, the first computer-assisted personalized sedation system, was a step in the right direction, nevertheless an insufficient step that failed to takeoff. As a result, in spite of years of research and efforts of many august societies, the logjam of balancing cost and justification of propofol sedation has continued. We hope that recent approval of remimazolam, a novel benzodiazepine, and potential approval of oliceridine, a novel short-acting opioid, might be able to contain the cost without compromising the quality of sedation.","Goudra, Basavana; Singh, Preet Mohinder; Lichtenstein, Gary R",Dig Dis Sci,335,25

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Kayseri City Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, from April to September 2020. METHODOLOGY: All COVID-19 patients' clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained through medical record extraction. Group A had 50 patients (22 men and 28 women) without SPM, and Group B had 20 patients (10 men and 10 women) with SPM. RESULTS: Considering the accompanying comorbidities, the frequencies of asthma and inhaler-use was significantly higher in Group B than in Group A (p <0.05). In the CT evaluation at presentation, the rate of involvement of all five lobes of the lung in Group B was significantly higher than in Group A.

Furthermore, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are controversial at role in the process of COVID-19 cases. The aim of the study was to investigate whether underlying diseases and taking ACEi/ARBs, affect the duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Medical usage claims data for the past three years until 15 May 2020, from the ""CORONA-19 International Cooperation Research"" project was used. We analyzed the medical insurance claims data for all 7590 coronavirus (COVID-19) patients confirmed by RT-PCR tests nationwide up to 15 May 2020. Among the comorbidities, a history of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.056-2.158) and diabetes (HR, 1.867; 95% CI, 1.408-2.475) were associated significantly with mortality. Furthermore, heart failure (HR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.027-1.884), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.615; 95% CI, 1.185-2.202), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.451; 95% CI, 1.018-2.069), mental disorder (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.106-2.343), end stage renal disease (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.185-13.12) were also associated significantly with mortality. The underlying disease has increased the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes, hypertension, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and mental disorders increased mortality.

In this paper, we review representative techniques in honeypots, honeytokens, and moving target defense, spanning from the late 1980s to the year 2021. Techniques from these three domains complement with each other and may be leveraged to build a holistic deception based defense. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a work that provides a systematic retrospect of these three domains all together and investigates their integrated usage for orchestrated deceptions. Our paper aims to fill this gap. By utilizing a tailored cyber kill chain model which can reflect the current threat landscape and a four-layer deception stack, a two-dimensional taxonomy is developed, based on which the deception techniques are classified. The taxonomy literally answers which phases of a cyber attack campaign the techniques can disrupt and which layers of the deception stack they belong to. Cyber defenders may use the taxonomy as a reference to design an organized and comprehensive deception plan, or to prioritize deception efforts for a budget conscious solution. We also discuss two important points for achieving active and resilient cyber defense, namely deception in depth and deception lifecycle, where several notable proposals are illustrated. Finally, some outlooks on future research directions are presented, including dynamic integration of different deception techniques, quantified deception effects and deception operation cost, hardware-supported deception techniques, as well as techniques developed based on better understanding of the human element.","Zhang, Li; Thing, Vrizlynn L.

Almost every sector of human-beings and their related activities are severely infected and affected by this COVID-19 pandemic. As days are passing, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic is going to be more severe. The fundamental needs for personal protective equipment (PPEs) are rising drastically all over the world. In India, many non-pharmaceutical companies or organizations such as automobile companies are engaged in producing the PPEs at a very marginal rate. Thus this paper proposes a modeling and optimization framework for sustainable production and waste management (SPWM) decision-making model for COVID-19 medical equipment under uncertainty. To quantify the uncertainties among parameter values, we have taken advantage of the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory. A robust ranking function is presented to obtain a crisp version of it. Furthermore, a novel interactive intuitionistic fuzzy programming approach is developed to solve the proposed SPWM model. An ample opportunity to generate the desired solution sets are also depicted. The performance analysis based on multiple criteria such as savings from baseline, co-efficient of variations, and desirability degrees is also introduced. Practical managerial implications are also discussed based on the significant findings after applying to the real case study data-set.

Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","Sun, Chuan-Bin; Wang, Yue-Ye; Liu, Geng-Hao; Liu, Zhe",Front.

This is extremely important in the setting of older women, who have treatment-specific goals which may differ from their younger counterparts, and may include conservation of quality of life rather than curative intent of treatment. One method employed to assist with this is the use of tumour-based prognostic and predictive tools. This article explores six of the most common tumour-based tools currently available on the market: MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, Mammostrat, Prosigna, EndoPredict, IHC4. The article discusses the creation and validation of these tools, their use and validation in older women, and future directions in the field. With the exception of Oncotype Dx, which has also been licensed for prediction of response from adjuvant chemotherapy, these tools have been licensed for use as prognostic tools only, mainly in the setting of adjuvant therapy following surgery. The evidence base for use in older women is strongest for Mammostrat and PAM50, although overall the evidence is much weaker than that in younger women. Where older women have been included in validation studies, this is often in small numbers, or the exact proportion of older women is unknown. In practice, all six of the tools are recommended to be utilised on surgical excision specimens, as well as in core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens in all of the tools except Mammostrat. This is extremely important in the setting of older women, of whom a large proportion do not undergo surgery. The suggested nature of the sample is formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded in all the tools except MammaPrint, which can also be performed on fresh-frozen samples. Future development of prognostic tools in older women with breast cancer should focus on treatment dilemmas specific to this population. This includes the decision of primary treatment between surgery or endocrine therapy and decisions regarding adjuvant therapy, in particular, chemotherapy.","Gordon-Craig, Sophie; Parks, Ruth M; Cheung, Kwok-Leung",,335,29

All nations and communities have applied many countermeasures to control the spread of the epidemic. In terms of countermeasures, lockdowns and reductions of social activities are meant to flatten the curve of infection. Nevertheless, to date, there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods. Thus, the present study aims to interpret the change in the population density of Sapporo city in the emergency's period declaration using big data obtained from mobile spatial statistics. The results indicate that, in the time of refraining from traveling, the city's residents have been more likely to stay home and less likely to travel to the center area. This has led to a decrease of up to 90% of the population density in crowded areas. The study's outcomes partly explain the statement of reducing 70%–80% of contact between people in line with the purpose of the emergency declaration. Moreover, these findings establish the primary step for further analysis of estimating the efficiency of policy in controlling the epidemic.","Arimura, Mikiharu; Ha, Tran Vinh; Okumura, Kota; Asada, Takumi",Transp.

We conducted an economic evaluation of pralatrexate from a societal perspective in Korea based on data from the PROPEL phase II study. METHODS: Using a Markov model with a weekly cycle, we simulated the experience of patients with R/R PTCL receiving pralatrexate or CC for 15 years. The model consists of five health states; initial treatment, treatment pause, subsequent treatment, stem cell transplantation (SCT) success, and death. Comparative effectiveness was based on PROPEL phase II single-arm study and its matched historical control analysis. Costs included drug, drug administration, monitoring, adverse event management, and SCT costs. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the base case was $39,153 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The results of one-way sensitivity analysis ranged from $33,949 to $51,846 per QALY gained, which remained within an implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of anticancer drugs in Korea. CONCLUSIONS: Pralatrexate is a cost-effective intervention with improved OS and incremental costs within the WTP limit. Pralatrexate could function as a new therapeutic option for patients suffering from life-threatening R/R PTCL.","Park, Seonyoung; Kim, Ah-Young; Cho, Hyeonseok; Baik, Deborah; Lee, Hankil; Cho, Sunghwa; Kang, Hye-Young",BMC Cancer,335,20

How the similarities between these two conditions can help us cope with the emergency effort represented by the management of cancer patients in the COVID-19 era, today and in the future? In a manner similar to the Cancer Moonshot initiative in the United States, we can hypothesize a multinational moonshot project towards the management of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we believe that the main road to elaborate meaningful scientific evidence is represented by the collection of all the data on COVID-19 and cancer comorbidity that are and will become available in cancer centers, coupled with the design of large clinical studies. To address this goal, it is essential to identify the entity that can produce this scientific evidences and the potentially most successful research strategy to undertake.

Our objective was to survey rhinologists and understand the extent to which telemedicine serves as a rejoinder to in-person consultation: appreciation of relevant factors may be important in planning for present and future considerations. METHODS: A 14-question anonymous survey sent out to the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) membership in April 2020. It included demographic factors and detailed questions examining the extent of telemedicine use. Numerous topics including the degree of use, satisfaction with services, and utility of services were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 134 respondents. Most reported seeing &#8804;30% of typical in-person volume, with 14.8% not seeing any patients at all. 88.1% used telemedicine; 82.0% reported some level of satisfaction with telemedicine. The vast majority utilized platforms employing audio and video (83.3%), and a plurality reported spending 5-15 min on calls. Numerous reasons were cited for the use of telemedicine, including significant public health benefits amid the crisis (89.7%). Only 12.0% of respondents reported using telemedicine for hospital consultation. CONCLUSION: Rhinologists have embraced telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to improve accessibility, patient satisfaction, and revenue stream. When utilized appropriately, this technology obviates the need for seeing at-risk patients and performing procedures such as nasal endoscopy. Only a minority of rhinologists was dissatisfied, viewing this as a temporary fix during the pandemic.","Svider, Peter F; Setzen, Michael; Ow, Randall; Folbe, Adam J; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Johnson, Andrew P",Am J Otolaryngol,335,1

Although video visits offer some benefits compared with telephone visits, they require complex setup, which may disadvantage some patients due to the ""digital divide."" Our objective was to determine patient and neighborhood characteristics associated with visit modality. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study across 1652 primary care and specialty care practices of adult patients at an integrated health system from April 23 to June 1, 2020. METHODS: We used electronic health record and administrative data. Our primary outcome was visit modality (in-person, video, or telephone), which was captured using billing codes. We assessed predictors of using video vs telephone using multivariable logistic regression. We used hierarchical logistic regression to determine the contribution of patient-, physician-, and practice-level components of variance in the choice of video or telephone visits. RESULTS: We analyzed 231,596 visits by 162,102 patients. Sixty-five percent of the visits were virtual (31.7% telephone, 33.5% video). Patients who were older than 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.40-0.43), Black (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.63), Hispanic (AOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.80), Spanish-speaking (AOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-0.61), and from areas with low broadband access (AOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) were less likely to use video visits. Practices (38%) and clinicians (26%) drove more of the variation in video visit use than patients (9%).

In May 2020, BSGAR and SCoR issued guidelines outlining steps for conduct of CTC in the early recovery phase. We evaluated the implementation of these in four English hospital trusts. METHODS: Ethical permission was not required for this multicentre service evaluation. We identified patients undergoing CTC over a 2-month period from May to July 2020 at four Trusts. We recorded demographics, scan indications, colonic findings, and incidental lung base changes compatible with COVID-19. A subset of patients were contacted via telephone to document new symptoms 2 weeks following their scan. Staff were contacted to determine if any acquired COVID-19 during the period. RESULTS: 224 patients (118 male, 52.7%) were scanned during the period. In 55 patients (24.6%), CTC showed a &#8805;6 mm polyp. 33 of 224 (14.7%) scans showed incidental lung base changes felt unrelated to COVID-19, and only one patient had changes indeterminate for COVID-19; no classic COVID-19 pulmonary changes were found. Of 169 patients with telephone follow-up, none reported any new symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, anosmia, ageusia) within 14 days of CTC. None of the 86 staff contacted developed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found no cases of patients or staff acquiring COVID-19 infection following CTC; and no evidence of significant asymptomatic COVID-19 patients attending for CTC appointments based on lung base changes. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our findings suggest that current practice is unlikely to contribute significantly to spread of SARS-nCOV2.

To further characterize cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in COVID-19, we review the current literature of published cases and additionally report the clinical presentation, laboratory and diagnostic testing results of 12 cases with COVID-19 infection and concurrent CVD from two academic medical centers in Houston, TX, USA, between March 1 and May 10, 2020. To date, there are 12 case studies reporting 47 cases of CVD in COVID-19. However, only 4 small case series have described the clinical and laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent stroke. Viral neurotropism, endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy and inflammation are plausible proposed mechanisms of CVD in COVID-19 patients. In our case series of 12 patients, 10 patients had an ischemic stroke, of which 1 suffered hemorrhagic transformation and two had intracerebral hemorrhage. Etiology was determined to be embolic without a clear cause identified in 6 ischemic stroke patients, while the remaining had an identifiable source of stroke. The majority of the patients had elevated inflammatory markers such as D-dimer and interleukin-6. In patients with embolic stroke of unclear etiology, COVID-19 may have played a direct or indirect role in the processes that eventually led to the strokes while in the remaining cases, it is unclear if infection contributed partially or was an incidental finding.","Reddy, Sujan T.; Garg, Tanu; Shah, Chintan; Nascimento, Fábio A.; Imran, Rajeel; Kan, Peter; Bowry, Ritvij; Gonzales, Nicole; Barreto, Andrew; Kumar, Abhay; Volpi, John; Misra, Vivek; Chiu, David; Gadhia, Rajan; Savitz, Sean I.",Case Rep.

Methods Review of home care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and emergency care, and Covid-19 shielding categories as per UK government guidance. New clinical pathways developed to manage patients safely during the pandemic;staff wellbeing initiatives described. Results LSDU staff redeployed and/or had additional roles to support increased needs of hospitalised Covid-19 patients. During the first lockdown in March 2020, 286 of 602 LSD patients were shielding;72 of 221 had home care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) infusions interrupted up to 12?weeks. During the pandemic, there was a 12% reduction in home care nursing support required, with patients learning to self-cannulate or require support for cannulation only. There were no increased adverse clinical events during this period. Twenty-one contracted covid-19 infection, with one hospitalised and no Covid-19 related deaths. In 2020, virtual clinics increased by 88% (video and/or telephone) compared to 2019. RFL well-being initiatives supported all staff. Conclusions We provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on staff and patients attending a highly specialised rare disease service. As far as we are aware, this is the first detailed narrative on the challenges and subsequent rapid adaptations made, both as part of a large organisation and as a specialist centre.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared the rates of positive screening tests for postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 9 or more or self-injury factors) and liaison/psychiatric intervention rates between pre-pandemic and pandemic groups of postpartum women who delivered a live birth at our tertiary perinatal center in Yokohama, Japan between January 2019 and May 2020. Those whose postpartum health screening was performed in 2019 (March-June 2019) were considered the pre-pandemic group, and those whose screening was performed between March and June 2020 were considered the pandemic group. Adjustments were made for maternal background, pregnancy, and delivery outcomes, including a history of psychiatric disorders, complications, preterm delivery, NICU admission, and maternal postpartum complications, and the data were analyzed using a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Postpartum health screenings were performed on 339 women before the pandemic and 279 women during the pandemic. Positive screening rates for postpartum depression did not change before and during the pandemic (adjusted odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 0.885-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: There was no apparent increase in maternal psychological stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Yokohama, Japan.

We test: (1) Whether global aging narratives have become more negative from before to during the pandemic (Oct'19 to May'20) across 20 countries; (2) Model pandemic (incidence and mortality), and cultural factors associated with the trajectory of aging narratives. METHODS: We leveraged a 10-billion-word online-media corpus, consisting of 28 million newspaper and magazine articles across 20 countries, to identify nine common synonyms of 'older adults' and compiled their most frequently-used descriptors (collocates) from Oct'19 to May'20-culminating in 11,504 collocates that were rated to create a Cumulative-Aging-Narrative-Score-(CANS) per month. Widely used cultural dimension scores were taken from Hofstede, and pandemic variables, from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. RESULTS: Aging narratives became more negative as the pandemic worsened across 20 countries. Globally, scores were trending neutral from Oct'19 to Feb'20, and plummeted in Mar'20, reflecting COVID-19's severity. Pre-pandemic (Oct'19), UK evidenced the most negative aging narratives; peak-pandemic (May'20), South Africa took on the dubious honor. Across the 8-month period, Philippines experienced the steepest trend towards negativity in aging narratives. Ageism, during the pandemic, was ironically, not predicted by COVID-19's incidence and mortality rates, but by cultural variables: Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long-term Orientation. DISCUSSION: The strategy to reverse this trajectory lay in the same phenomenon that promoted it: A sustained global campaign-though, it should be culturally nuanced and customized to a country's context.","Ng, Reuben; Chow, Ting Yu Joanne; Yang, Wenshu",,335,33

There is also intense debate about policies for limiting the damage, both to health and to the economy. On the one hand, the health and safety of the population is the principal consideration for most countries. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the potential for long-term economic damage caused by strict nation-wide lockdowns. In this working paper, we present a quantitative way to compute lockdown decisions for individual cities or regions, while balancing health and economic considerations. Furthermore, these policies are learnt automatically by the proposed algorithm, as a function of disease parameters (infectiousness, gestation period, duration of symptoms, probability of death) and population characteristics (density, movement propensity). We account for realistic considerations such as imperfect lockdowns, and show that the policy obtained using reinforcement learning is a viable quantitative approach towards lockdowns.","Khadilkar, Harshad; Ganu, Tanuja; Seetharam, Deva P",,335,21

The COVID-19 pandemic required such activation of individuals, but little is known about medical students' preferences of such engagement. We investigated potential variations in medical students' educational preferences, attitudes, and volunteerism during the COVID-19 pandemic based on socio-demographics to better prepare for future activation scenarios. A web-based, anonymous survey of U.S. medical students at a single institution was conducted in May 2020. Across four training year, 518 (68% response rate) students completed the survey. During the pandemic, 42.3% (n = 215) wanted to discontinue in-person clinical experiences, 32.3% (n = 164) wanted to continue, and 25.4% (n = 129) were neutral. There was no gender effect for engagement in volunteer activities or preference to engage in clinical activities during the pandemic. However, second-year (n = 59, 11.6%) and third-year students (n = 58, 11.4%) wanted to continue in-person clinical experiences at a greater proportion than expected, while a small proportion of fourth-year students (n = 17, 3.3%) wanted to continue, &#967;2(6) = 43.48, p < .001, &#966; = 0.29. Majority of respondents (n = 287, 55.5%) volunteered in clinical and non-clinical settings. A lower proportion of fourth-year (n = 12, 2.3%) and first-year students (n = 50, 9.7%) volunteered than expected. Likelihood to volunteer during a pandemic varied by gender, training year, and/or prior experience with disaster event depending on the type of volunteer-site setting. Our findings suggest socio-demographic factors may impact medical student engagement and volunteerism during a public health crisis. Educational leadership should be sensitive to such variations and can facilitate volunteer activities that allow student engagement during future pandemics.","Appelbaum, Nital P; Misra, Sanghamitra M; Welch, Jennifer; Humphries, M Harrison; Sivam, Sunthosh; Ismail, Nadia",J. community health,335,26

The establishment of centers dedicated to COVID-19 treatment and care also necessitates preparation of the surgical departments for the forthcoming emergency interventions for infected patients and patients with an unclear infection status. This article summarizes the evidence on standards for personal protective equipment for personnel in the central emergency admission department and in the operations area as well as restructuring measures for the procedures in the operations area in a COVID-plus area. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out. RESULTS: The grey area of unknown infected and potential transmitters of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is high. Patients with an unclear infection status or who are highly suspected of having an infection should be classified as infectious until the contrary can be proven. The protection of personnel in healthcare professions against infections is of particular importance. The supply of adequate personal protective equipment in a risk-stratified form can substantially influence the success of combating the pandemic. Most operations must be assessed as aerosol-forming procedures and necessitate the maximum protection of personnel working directly on the patient. Particular attention should be paid to obligatory hygiene regulatory measures for protection against contamination during the reorganization in the operations area and on the transport routes between the wards. CONCLUSION: The correct personal protective equipment considering the occupational safety helps to sustainably protect personnel from infections. Reorganizational measures in the operating room are urgently indicated for potential aerosol-forming procedures in infected patients or patients with an unclear infection status. The current dynamic situation necessitates a high level of flexibility as well as reassessment and adaptation of the measures at short intervals.,"Schnitzbauer, Andreas A; Kempf, Volkhard A J; Hack, Daniel; Ciesek, Sandra; Meier, Simon; Vehreschild, Maria J G T; Wicker, Sabine; Kippke, Ulf; Graf, Jürgen; Marzi, Ingo",Chirurg,335,1

PATIENTS & METHODS: Within nine months starting from April-2020, the presence of COVID-19 infection was determined by thoracic CT and SARS-CoV-2 PCR in all acute stroke cases managed in a single tertiary center. Consecutive and prospective data on vascular risk factors/comorbidities, in-hospital quality metrics, discharge outcomes, etiological subclassification and blood markers of thrombosis / inflammation were compared in 44 COVID-19 positive cases (37 acute ischemic stroke, 5 TIA, 2 intracerebral hematoma) and 509 COVID-19 negative patients (355 ischemic, 105 TIA, 44 hematoma and 5 stroke mimic). RESULTS: COVID-19 positive patients had more severe strokes, delayed hospital admission, longer hospital stay, higher mortality rates, but had similar vascular risk factors/comorbidities frequency, thrombolysis/thrombectomy utilization rates, metrics, and stroke etiological subtype. They had significantly higher CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, leukocyte count and lower lymphocyte count.

However, hospitalist perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and potential differences between APPs and physicians are unknown. Understanding hospitalist perspectives could help to address vaccine hesitancy among patients.Methods: We conducted an online survey of hospitalists at Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin from 14 December 2020 through 4 January 2021. We collected demographic information and assessed perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and, for comparison, on the influenza vaccine. Descriptive statistics were used to compare responses between APPs and physicians.Results: The overall response rate was 42.7% (n = 128/300) and comprised of 53.9% women (n = 69/128) and 41.4% APPs (n = 53/128). Most hospitalists reported receiving or planning to receive vaccination against COVID-19 (93.7%; n = 119/128) and influenza (97.7%; n = 125/128). Most hospitalists reported they would advise 100% of patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (66% for APPs; 74.7% for physicians) and influenza vaccine (83% for APPs; 80% for physicians). Barriers to recommending the COVID-19 vaccine included patient health status and vaccine safety profile. Hospitalists reported that patients and coworkers receiving the COVID-19 vaccine would reduce their anxiety (~80% of hospitalists), social isolation (~64% of hospitalists), and improve their emotional support (~40% of hospitalists). APP and physician responses were similar. The possible reduction in social isolation was associated with higher odds of hospitalists advising all patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (adjusted odds ratio 2.95 [95% confidence interval, 1.32-6.59]; P< .008), whereas hospitalist age, gender, and profession showed no association.Conclusion: Most hospitalists would reportedly advise patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Barriers to this recommendation included patient health status and vaccine safety.

At discharge, previous lesions were mostly absorbed in 11 patients (11/37, 29.7%), the main residues were GGOs (24/37, 64.9%), followed by fibrous strips (13/37, 35.1%). On the latest CT, all the pulmonary lesions were completely absorbed, the duration of lesions was 31.6 ± 11.4 days (range: 5-50 days). Conclusion: The pulmonary lesions in some mild COVID-19 patients (generally with normal laboratory indicators at admission, GGOs as the main manifestation on initial CT, and representation of continuous absorption after treatment) could be completely absorbed with a mean duration of 31.6 days.","Liu, Xue-Yan; Lv, Fa-Jin; Lv, Sheng-Xiu; Fu, Bin-Jie; Md, Wang-Jia Li; Ouyang, Yu; Chu, Zhi-Gang",Int J Med Sci,335,16

DESIGN: Service evaluation involving descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire. SETTING: Orthodontic Departments at Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital and Burnley General Teaching Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and clinicians involved in video consultations. METHODS: Patient- and clinician-specific questionnaires were designed and those involved in virtual clinics were invited to complete these at the end of their consultation. The questionnaires focused on setting up and connecting to the virtual clinic, assessing if the correct types of patients were involved in the clinics and satisfaction with these types of remote consultations. RESULTS: A total of 121 questionnaires (59 patient and 62 clinician) were completed. Of the patients, 93% found the instructions provided to access the consultation easy to follow and 70% of clinicians did not report any connection issues. In 90% of cases, a virtual appointment was seen to be appropriate by the clinician. Respondents showed a high level of satisfaction with 76% of patients saying a remote consultation was more convenient than face-to-face, and 66% reporting they would, if appropriate, like more appointments like this in the future. CONCLUSION: The overall satisfaction among patients with virtual clinics introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic was generally high. The majority of patients would, where appropriate, prefer more virtual appointments in the future in comparison to face-to-face appointments and it was found to be more convenient for the patient.","Byrne, Emer; Watkinson, Simon",J Orthod,335,16

Research concerning the role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and investigating the clinical effects of infection in children, has been vital. This paper describes the publication trend for pertinent scientific literature relating to COVID-19 in children during the first 6 months of the pandemic. METHODS: A comprehensive search of preprint and published literature was conducted daily across four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid-Embase and MedRXiv) between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. FINDINGS: Over the study period, a total of 45 453 papers were retrieved, of which 476 met our inclusion criteria. The cumulative number of children described in included publications totalled (at most) 41 396. The median number of children per paper was 6 (IQR 1-33). Nearly one-third of papers (30.2%) reported on a single child, and a further 28.3% reported on between 1 and 9 children. Half of all the publications originated from Asia. INTERPRETATION: Our prospective bibliographic analysis of paediatric COVID-19 publications demonstrated a steady increase in the number of papers over time. Understanding and policy evolved with new information that was gathered over the course of the study period. However, over half of publications were individual case reports or small case series, which may have had a limited contribution to advancement of knowledge. During a pandemic, literature should be interpreted with great caution, and clinical/policy decisions should be continually reviewed in light of emerging evidence.","Stilwell, Philippa Anna; Munro, Alasdair P S; Basatemur, Emre; Talawila Da Camara, Nishanthi; Harwood, Rachel; Roland, Damian",Arch. dis. child,335,30

The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus that belongs to the family of Coronaviruses which are known to cause a wide spectrum of diseases both in humans and animals. One of the characteristic features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the high reproductive rate (R0) that results in high transmissibility of the virus among humans. Vaccines are the best option to prevent and control this disease. Though, the traditional intramuscular (IM) route of vaccine administration is one of the effective methods for induction of antibody response, a needle-free self-administrative intradermal (ID) immunization will be easier for SARS-CoV-2 infection containment, as vaccine administration method will limit human contacts. Here, we have assessed the humoral and cellular responses of a RBD-based peptide immunogen when administered intradermally in BALB/c mice and side-by-side compared with the intramuscular immunization route. The results demonstrate that ID vaccination is well tolerated and triggered a significant magnitude of humoral antibody responses as similar to IM vaccination. Additionally, the ID immunization resulted in higher production of IFN-Î³ and IL-2 suggesting superior cellular response as compared to IM route. Overall, our data indicates immunization through ID route provides a promising alternative approach for the development of self-administrative SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.","Yadav, Naveen; Vishwakarma, Preeti; Khatri, Ritika; Siddqui, Gazala; Awasthi, Amit; Ahmed, Shubbir; Samal, Sweety",Microbes Infect,335,28

Health researchers conduct survey among the citizens to capture their opinion on COVID-19. In such surveys like in Hanafiah and Wan (2020), structural-zero (different from sampling zero) category occurs as they question about perception, knowledge, and communication regarding COVID-19. Materials: The data were collected in a survey conducted among Malaysians by Hanafiah and Wan regarding COVID-19. The survey focused on people’s response about the public communication, knowledge, and perception. Methods: One of the four question categories in the survey is mutually exclusive with the other three questions. Consequently, there will be no entry in that category. Such group is called structurally zero category in the literature. The literature never probed the migrative split to other categories of the unknown proportion belonging to the structural zero category. In this article, the probability-based new and innovative method configures what proportion in that mutually exclusive category and it is the essence of our method. Results: The mutually exclusive nature of subquestions manufactured structural zero in their data. A careful analysis of the data has created so far unknown probability concepts in the literature, which we named as “Exodus probabilities” in this article. Its discovery and utility are illustrated and elaborated with application in COVID-19. This methodology is also useful in applications in engineering, epidemiology, marketing, communication networking, etc. Conclusion: What is quite novel about the discovery of the exodus probability in this article is the evolution of the concepts from the structural-zero category. In such situation, when a category is eliminated, the proportions of the sample might have uncommunicatively transited to other viable categories and our research question is all about configuring their proportions. This is an innovative approach.","Shanmugam, Ramalingam Singh Karan P.",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,335,21

This article considers the psychological significance of the socially experienced situation based on the latest research conducted in Poland during the first wave of the pandemic. It is an attempt to show both the risk and protective factors, as well as possible remedial effects against unfavorable social and health phenomena, which are related to the increase in costs incurred by individuals in the process of experiencing the crisis and adaptation to the conditions after its end. These are considered in the context of the costs of adaptations used by individuals and of re-adaptation in the period of coping with COVID-19. This study conducted a meta-analysis of 13 psychological and sociological studies conducted so far in the first period of the pandemic.

Infection of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell is characterized by direct translation of positive single stranded (+ ss) RNA to form large polyprotein polymerase 1ab (pp1ab), which acts as precursor for a number of nonstructural and structural proteins that play vital roles in replication of viral genome and biosynthesis of new virus particles. The maintenance of viral protein homeostasis is essential for continuation of viral life cycle in the host cell. To test whether the protein homeostasis of SARS-CoV-2 can be disrupted by inducing specific protein aggregation, we made an effort to examine whether the viral proteome contains any aggregation prone regions (APRs) that can be explored for inducing toxic protein aggregation specifically in viral proteins and without affecting the host cell. This curiosity leads to the identification of several (> 70) potential APRs in SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The length of the APRs ranges from 5 to 25 amino acid residues. Nearly 70% of total APRs investigated are relatively smaller and found to be in the range of 5-10 amino acids. The maximum number of ARPs (> 50) was observed in pp1ab. On the other hand, the structural proteins such as, spike (S), nucleoprotein (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins also possess APRs in their primary structures which altogether constitute 30% of the total APRs identified. Our findings may provide new windows of opportunities to design specific peptide-based, anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic molecules against COVID-19.","Gour, Shalini; Yadav, Jay Kant",J Proteins Proteom,335,16

The sample of this single-center cross-sectional study consisted of 76 children with ADHD and their parents. Trauma symptoms were evaluated with the Children's Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-8); sleep habits were assessed using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ); and chronotype was assessed using the Children's Chronotype Questionnaire (CCQ). There were significant differences in CRIES-8 and CSHQ scores between the eveningness type group and the non-eveningness type group. The CRIES-8 scores of children with ADHD were related to the CCQ and CSHQ scores and severity of ADHD symptoms. In mediation analyses, sleep problems were found to be the full mediating factor in the relationship between CRIES-8 scores and severity of ADHD symptoms and the relationship between CCQ scores and the severity of ADHD symptoms.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate individuals' health anxiety and emotion regulation during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to some variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between emotion regulation and health anxiety. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 874 individuals reached online through the google e-forms. The participants were administered the ""Health Anxiety Scale and Emotion Regulation Scale"" to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, Mann- Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Spearman Correlation Coefficient were used. RESULTS: In the current study, healthy anxiety scores of the participants were analyzed depending on some variables. Health anxiety was found to be higher in women, 18-30 age group, singles, students, and groups with physical and mental health problems. The research also found that there is a low and negative relationship between health anxiety and cognitive reappraisal. It is understood that men's suppression scores are higher than women. There is no significant difference between suppressing emotions and health anxiety. It was found that educators received the highest scores in terms of cognitive reappraisal. The cognitive reappraisal level of the group without mental disorder was found to be higher than the other group. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the research, more supportive services should be provided for the groups with the higher health anxiety. Considering that especially students and young people are affected more, it can be said that mental health preventive services should be included more in these groups. At the same time, the fact that men have higher emotion suppression scores than women shows that this situation should also be taken into consideration in mental health services.","Canli, Derya; Karasar, Burcu",Psychiatr Danub,335,27

Literature data regarding the response rate towards COVID-19 vaccination in dialysis patients is inconclusive. The published response rates varied from 29.6 to 96.0%. The variable response rates across these clinical trials may be explained by different vaccine types, vaccine doses, criteria for positive immune response, timings of antibody detection, races and ethnicities. Side effects of COVID-19 vaccination comprise of pain at injection site, fatigue, myalgia, headache, low fever, syncope, pericarditis, etc. Clinical predictors of positive response towards COVID-19 vaccination include age, previous infection, immunosuppressive therapy, body mass index and serum albumin level.

To better utilize DSG as an antitumor compound, two series of DSG-amino acid ester derivatives (3a-3g and 7a-7g) were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic activities against six human cancer cell lines (K562, T24, MNK45, HepG2, A549, and MCF-7) were evaluated. The results obtained showed that a majority of derivatives exhibited cytotoxic activities against these six human tumor cells. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the introduction of l-tryptophan to the C-3 position of DSG and the C-26 position of derivative 5 was the preferred option for these compounds to display significant cytotoxic activities. Among them, compound 7g exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the K562 cell line (IC50 = 4.41 µM) and was 6.8-fold more potent than diosgenin (IC50 = 30.04 µM). Further cellular mechanism studies in K562 cells elucidated that compound 7g triggered mitochondrial-related apoptosis by increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which was associated with upregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bax, downregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and activation of the caspase cascade. The above results suggested that compound 7g might be considered a promising scaffold for further modification of more potent anticancer agents.","Ma, Liwei; Zhang, Jinling; Wang, Xuemei; Yang, Jifang; Guo, Lina; Wang, Xiaoli; Song, Bo; Dong, Wei; Wang, Wenbao",Eur J Med Chem,335,10

Communication strategies disseminate information among the population that such masks are essential for mitigating virus diffusion. However, scientific studies are not conclusive in showing the undisputed filtration efficiency of fabric/cloth facial masks (both commercial and homemade). OBJECTIVES: This study examines scientific data about the effectiveness of face masks before and during the COVID-19 emergency. Present trends in the making of commercial and homemade fabric/cloth face masks are also examined. METHODS: Statistical data of published studies are analyzed and compared. Main considerations and suggestions are also extracted and discussed. Current approaches are examined for assessing the characteristics and effectiveness of fabric/cloth commercial and homemade face masks intended for the population. RESULT: Conflicting data exist as to whether non-medical masks have a protective effect from the spread of respiratory viruses. Both medical masks (MDs) and respiratory personal protection equipment (PPE) show a given effectiveness value. CONCLUSION: Concerning commercial and homemade fabric/cloth masks, giving general indications on the choice of materials and their assemblage is difficult as it is not possible to assess the effectiveness of the filter media with respect to the kind of multiphase fluid that may be emitted upon breathing, sneezing, or coughing under different environmental conditions. This is particularly important because airflow rate, temperature, humidity, and duration of use will affect the performance of filter media. Moreover, while a mask may have excellent filter media, droplets may leak into the face-piece unless there is an adequate facial seal. In the presence of leaks, any type of mask may actually offer less protection independently of its nominal filtering effìciency.","Santarsiero, A; Giustini, M; Quadrini, F; D039,; Alessandro, D; Fara, G M",Ann. ig,335,32

STUDY DESIGN: Diagnosis of MIS-C like disease was pursued after echocardiography showed severely depressed ventricular function and pathological coronary artery dilation in the setting of medically refractory multisystem organ failure and maternal COVID-19 infection. The neonate did not respond to standard medical therapy, and there was no alternative disease that could explain the clinical course. High index of clinical suspicion coupled with low risk of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prompted us to pursue IVIG administration even though the neonate did not meet classic criteria for MIS-C. RESULT: Following treatment with IVIG, there was rapid clinical improvement. Ventricular function improved within 15 hours and coronary artery dilation resolved in 8 days. There was no recurrence of disease during follow-up. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 associated MIS-C like disease has not been well described in neonates. As typical features may be conspicuously absent, a high index of suspicion is warranted in critically ill neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Echocardiography may provide critical diagnostic information and narrow the differential diagnosis.

Health promotion foregrounds the pertinence of social, economic, cultural, political and spiritual life in creating and maintaining health. This necessitates a critical structural determinants of health perspective that actively engages with the experiences of health and wellbeing among diverse peoples. The inequitable impacts of pandemics are well documented, as are calls for improved pandemic responses. Yet, current pandemic and emergency preparedness plans do not adequately account for the social and structural determinants of health and health equity. METHODS: Through five one-hour online conversations held in April 2020, we engaged 13 practice, policy, research and community leaders on the intersections of COVID-19 and gender, racism, homelessness, Indigenous health and knowledge, household food insecurity, disability, ethics and equitable futures post-COVID-19. We conducted a thematic analysis of speaker and participant contributions to investigate the impacts and influence of COVID-19 related to the structural and social determinants of health. We analyzed which policies, practices and responses amplified or undermined equity and social justice and identified opportunities for improved action. FINDINGS: Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed four broad themes:â¢ oppressive, unjust systems and existing health and social inequities;â¢ health and social systems under duress and non-responsive to equity;â¢ disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 driven by underlying structural and socioeconomic inequity; andâ¢ enhanced momentum for collective mobilization, policy innovations and social transformation. DISCUSSION: There was a strong desire for a more just and equitable society in a post-COVID-19 world, going 'back to better' rather than 'back to normal.' Our analysis demonstrates that equity has not been well integrated into pandemic planning and responses. Social movement and systems theories provide insight on ways to build on existing community mobilization and policy openings for sustained social transformation.","Ndumbe-Eyoh, Sume; Muzumdar, Pemma; Betker, Claire; Oickle, Diane",Glob Health Promot,335,21

The WatchPAT (WP) device was shown to be accurate for the diagnosis of sleep apnea; however, studies using the WatchPAT device have thus far excluded patients with arrhythmias due to the potential effect of arrhythmias on the peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) amplitude and pulse rate changes. Purpose: To examine the accuracy of the WP in detecting sleep apnea in patients with AF. Patients and Methods: Patients with AF underwent simultaneous WP and PSG studies in 11 sleep centers. PSG scoring was blinded to the automatically analyzed WP data. Results: A total of 101 patients with AF (70 males) were recruited. Forty-six had AF episodes during the overnight sleep study. A significant correlation was found between the PSG-derived AHI and the WP- derived AHI (r=0.80, p<0.0001). There was a good agreement between PSG-derived AHI and WP-derived AHI (mean difference of AHI: -0.02±13.2). Using a threshold of AHI &#8805;15 per hour of sleep, the sensitivity and specificity of the WP were 0.88 and 0.63, respectively. The overall accuracy in sleep staging between WP and PSG was 62% with Kappa agreement of 0.42. Conclusion: WP can detect sleep apnea events in patients with AF. AF should not be an exclusion criterion for using the device. This finding may be of even greater importance in the era of the COVID19 epidemic, when sleep labs were closed and most studies were home based.","Tauman, Riva; Berall, Murray; Berry, Richard; Etzioni, Tamar; Shrater, Noam; Hwang, Dennis; Marai, Ibrahim; Manthena, Prasanth; Rama, Anil; Spiegel, Rebecca; Penzel, Thomas; Koren Morag, Nira; Pillar, Giora",Nat Sci Sleep,335,24

The known data of oxytocin receptor presence in endometrioid heterotopy smooth muscle cells give some grounds to assume oxytocin participation in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The present study objective was to evaluate oxytocin level in peripheral blood (PB) in patients with endometriosis associated pain syndrome and to estimate the efficacy of oxytocin receptor inhibitors (IOXTR) administration based on animal endometriosis model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The basic group comprised 61 patients with endometriosis associated pain syndrome, while 21 patients formed the control group. VAS, MPQ, and BBS objective tests were applied for pain syndrome evaluation. Oxytocin level in PB was measured by immunoenzyme method. After confirmation of endometriosis experimental model formation in rats and further randomization, a daily IOXTR intra-abdominal injection was performed in a dose of 0.35 mg/kg/24 h in the basic group (n = 12) or saline solution administration in the control (n = 12). On the final stage, endometrioid heterotopy size measuring was performed along with histological examination. RESULTS: Oxytocin level in PB was authentically higher in patients with GE compared to the control: 51.45 (35.54-62.76) pg/mL and 27.64 (23.23-34.12) pg/mL, respectively (p<.001). Positive correlation between oxytocin PB level and pain syndrome expression was established in patients with GE: VAS (r = 0.76; p<.001), MPQ (r = 0.52; p<.001), and BBS (r = 0.57; p<.001). Based on the experimental disease model authentical decrease of endometrioid heterotopy average area was observed after IOXTR therapy compared to the control (7.3 ± 1.8 mm2 and 22.2 ± 1.2 mm2, respectively, p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results confirm the oxytocin role in the pathogenesis of endometrioid associated pain syndrome. The high efficacy of IOXTR administration based on animal model of surgically induced endometriosis allows viewing this method as a perspective therapy.","Yarmolinskaya, Maria; Khobets, Vladislav; Tral, Tatyana; Tkachenko, Natalia",Gynecol Endocrinol,335,5

Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has been identified as an important regulator in the development of inflammatory disorders. However, the direct involvement of HDAC6 in CBNPs-induced pulmonary inflammatory responses remains unclear. To explore whether HDAC6 participates in CBNPs-induced pulmonary inflammation, human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE cells) was transfected with HDAC6 small interference RNA (siRNA) and then exposed to CBNPs at concentrations of 0, 25, and 50 µg/ml for 24 h. Intracellular HDAC6 and intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) mRNA and protein were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. The secretions of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CBNPs induced a significant increase in the expressions of IL-8 and IL-6, accompanied by a high level of intracellular HDAC6 mRNA when compared with a blank control group (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant changes in the levels of TNF-&#945; secretion, intracellular HDAC6 and IFT88 protein induced by CBNPs (p > 0.05). The HDAC6 mRNA expression was significantly suppressed in HDAC6 siRNA-transfected cells (p < 0.05). The secretions of IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6 were significantly less in HDAC6 siRNA-transfected cells than that in normal 16HBE cells with exposure to 25 or 50 µg/ml of CBNPs, but intracellular IFT88 mRNA expression was markedly increased in HDAC6 siRNA-transfected cells when compared with normal 16HBE cells exposed to 50 µg/ml of CBNPs (all p < 0.05). Downregulation of the HDAC6 gene inhibits CBNPs-induced inflammatory responses in bronchial epithelial cells, partially through regulating IFT88 expression. It is suggested that CBNPs may trigger inflammatory responses in bronchial epithelial cells by an HDAC6/IFT88-dependent pathway.","Lin, Hui; Fu, Guoqing; Yu, Qimei; Wang, Zhenyu; Zuo, Yao; Shi, Yuqin; Zhang, Ling; Gu, Yingying; Qin, Lingzhi; Zhou, Ting",Toxicol Ind Health,335,24

Implementation of social isolation and distancing measures to stop the spread of the disease and to reduce potential harm to patients has necessitated the use of alternate models of health-care delivery. Changes that would normally take months or years have occurred within days to weeks. METHODS: We conducted analysis of outpatient clinic data during the period of the pandemic and compared this to previous telehealth use. We also present the results of clinician and patient telehealth experience surveys. RESULTS: We describe a 2255% increase in the use of telehealth at a tertiary hospital within a period of six weeks, and a significant simultaneous reduction in the outpatient clinic failure-to-attend rate. The vast majority of patients and clinicians agreed that the standard of care provided by telehealth was the same as that provided by on-site appointments. DISCUSSION: Telehealth that previously had only limited utilisation has now become a main method for the delivery of outpatient care. Clinicians and patients agreed that consultations provided by telehealth were of the same standard as those provided on site. Health care in the post-pandemic period should embed the use of telehealth for outpatient care and consider the range of other clinical contexts where this can be utilised.","Schulz, Thomas; Long, Karrie; Kanhutu, Kudzai; Bayrak, Ilana; Johnson, Douglas; Fazio, Timothy",J Telemed Telecare,335,1

Imatinib Mesylate (IM) blocks Colony Stimulating Factor1 Receptor (CSF1R), the driver mechanism in TGCT. The aim of this study was to determine if IM reduces the tumour metabolic activity evaluated by PET-CT and to compare this response with the response seen on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 25 Consecutive patients treated with IM (off label use) for locally advanced (N = 12) or recurrent (N = 13) diffuse-type TGCT were included, 15 male and median age at diagnosis 39 (IQR 31-47) years. The knee was most frequently affected (n = 16; 64%). The effect of IM was assessed pre- and post-IM treatment by comparing MR scans and PET-CT. MR scans were assessed by Tumour Volume Score (TVS), an estimation of the tumour volume as a percentage of the total synovial cavity. PET-CT scans were evaluated based on maximum standardized uptake value (SUV-max). Partial response was defined as more than 50% tumour reduction with TVS and a decrease of at least 30% on SUV-max. RESULTS: Median duration of IM treatment was 7.0 (IQR 4.2-11.5) months. Twenty patients (80%) discontinued IM treatment for poor response or intended surgery. Twenty patients experienced an adverse event grade 1-2, three patients grade 3 (creatinine increment, neutropenic sepsis, liver dysfunction). MR assessment of all joints showed 32% (6/19) partial response and 63% (12/19) stable disease, with a mean difference of 12% (P = 0.467; CI -22.4-46.0) TVS between pre- and post-IM and a significant mean difference of 23% (P = 0.021; CI 4.2-21.6) in all knee lesions. PET-CT, all joints, showed a significantly decreased mean difference of 5.3 (P = 0.004; CI 1.9-8.7) SUV-max between pre- and post-IM treatment (58% (11/19) partial response, 37% (7/19) stable disease). No correlation between MR imaging and PET-CT could be appreciated in 15 patients with complete radiological data. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the moderate radiological response of IM in diffuse-type TGCT. PET-CT is a valuable additional diagnostic tool to quantify response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Its value should be assessed further to validate its efficacy in the objective measurement of biological response in targeted systemic treatment of TGCT.","Mastboom, M J L; Lips, W; van Langevelde, K; Mifsud, M; Ng, C; McCarthy, C L; Athanasou, N A; Gibbons, C L M H; van de Sande, M A J",Surg Oncol,335,17

Previous studies of community-wide disasters suggested people are fairly resilient and identified resources and strategies that promote that resilience. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic is in some ways unique, with high levels of uncertainty, evolving implications and restrictions, and varied and uneven impacts. How resilient were Americans as the pandemic progressed? What psychosocial resources and coping strategies facilitated adjustment as the country moved into a summer of uneven reopenings and reclosures? Data from a national sample of 674 Americans were gathered at the height of early lockdowns and peaking infections in mid-April, 2020, and again, 5 and 10 weeks later. The study aimed to determine levels and sources of distress and to identify the resources and coping efforts that promoted or impeded resilience. Early levels of distress diminished to some extent over subsequent months while levels of wellbeing were comparable with usual norms, suggesting a largely resilient response. COVID-19-related stress exposure also decreased gradually over time. Older age, higher levels of mindfulness and social support, and meaning focused coping predicted better adjustment, reflecting resilience, while avoidance coping was particularly unhelpful. In models predicting change over time, approach-oriented coping (i.e., active coping, meaning-focused coping, and seeking social support) was minimally predictive of subsequent adjustment. Given the unique and ongoing circumstances presented by COVID-19, specific interventions targeting psychosocial resources and coping identified here may help to promote resilience as the pandemic continues to unfold.

AIM: To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1st and February 30th, 2020, in which front-line members of medical staff who took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25; betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest influence (degree: 370; closeness: 29; betweenness centrality: 0.37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree: 201; closeness: 28; betweenness centrality: 5.64). For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two isolated nodes. CONCLUSION: High self-protection score was the main factor that prevented medical staff from contracting COVID-19 infection.

Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II, and XII, with each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. Coupling structure-based drug design with the one-pot Ugi four-component reaction, we discovered one of the most potent noncovalent inhibitors, 23R (Jun8-76-3A) that is structurally distinct from the canonical Mpro inhibitor GC376. Significantly, 23R is highly selective compared with covalent inhibitors such as GC376, especially toward host proteases. The cocrystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study discovered 23R, one of the most potent and selective noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors reported to date, and a novel binding pocket in Mpro that can be explored for inhibitor design.","Kitamura, Naoya; Sacco, Michael Dominic; Ma, Chunlong; Hu, Yanmei; Townsend, Julia Alma; Meng, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Fushun; Zhang, Xiujun; Ba, Mandy; Szeto, Tommy; Kukuljac, Adis; Marty, Michael Thomas; Schultz, David; Cherry, Sara; Xiang, Yan; Chen, Yu; Wang, Jun",J. med. chem,335,5

Italy was the first country after China to experience a lock-down period. Our objective is to determine whether, during the COVID-19 period, there has been any modification in urological emergencies. METHODS: we retrospectively reviewed urgent urological consultations requested by the Emergency Department (ED) of Padua University Hospital in the 36-day period between February 22nd and March 30th, 2020 and compared them to the prior year cases within a similar time frame (February 24th to March 31st, 2019). Pediatric population (age < 15 years); surgical complications and traumas were excluded to avoid confounding from the reduction of activities during the lockdown. The number of daily consultations, the number of invasive procedures performed and admissions were evaluated, together with the predictors of admission were identified through multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: The final sample resulted in 107 consultations performed in 2020 and 266 in 2019. A higher number of daily consultations was performed during 2019 (7.33 vs 2.97, p < 0.001). Similarly, the number of daily-invasive procedures was higher in 2019 (p = 0.006), while there was no difference in the number of daily admissions (15 vs 12, p = 0.80). On multivariate analysis, the year (2020 vs 2019, OR 2.714, 95% CI 1.096-6.757, p = 0.0297) was a significant predictor of admission. CONCLUSIONS: Urgent urology practice was affected during COVID-19 pandemic with a remarkable reduction in urgent urological consultations; furthermore, a higher risk of admissions was observed in 2020. The consequences of a potentially delayed diagnosis remain to be determined.","Motterle, Giovanni; Morlacco, Alessandro; Iafrate, Massimo; Bianco, Marta; Federa, Giuliano; Xhafka, Orest; Zattoni, Filiberto; Prayer-Galetti, Tommaso",World j. urol,335,21

They must also motivate members of the public to cooperate with the guidelines, specifically by changing their usual behavior. Policy makers have traditionally adopted a didactic and formalistic stance by conveying dry, statistics-based health information to the public. They have not yet considered the alternative of providing health information in the form of narrative evidence, using stories that address both cognitive and emotional aspects. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to introduce policy makers to the advantages of using narrative evidence to provide health information during a disease outbreak or pandemic such as COVID-19. Throughout human history, authorities have tended to employ apocalyptic narratives during disease outbreaks or pandemics. This viewpoint paper proposes an alternative coping narrative that includes the following components: segmentation; barrier reduction; role models; empathy and support; strengthening self-efficacy, community efficacy, and coping tools; preventing stigmatization of at-risk populations; and communicating uncertainty. It also discusses five conditions for using narrative evidence to produce an effective communication campaign on social media: (1) identifying narratives that reveal the needs, personal experiences, and questions of different subgroups to tailor messaging to produce targeted behavioral change; (2) providing separate and distinct treatment of each information unit or theory that arises on social networks; (3) identifying positive deviants who found creative solutions for stress during the COVID-19 crisis not found by other members of the community; (4) creating different stories of coping; and (5) maintaining a dialogue with population subgroups (eg, skeptical and hesitant groups). The paper concludes by proposing criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of a narrative.","Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat",J Med Internet Res,335,26

Global efforts in drug and vaccine development to fight the disease have yielded vaccines and drug candidates to cure COVID-19. However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens the continued efficacy of these treatments. In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family. RESULTS: Combining coronavirus family sequence information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family. Although the results are focused on SARS-CoV-2, these approaches stem from evolutionary principles that are agnostic to the organism or infective agent.

PA levels of adolescents aged 11-18 years with T1D (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 34) were assessed through self-reported and parent proxy-reported questionnaires. Overall, PA levels during lockdown were below recommended levels. PA levels did not differ between T1D and control participants (p = 0.212) nor between genders (p = 0.149). Younger adolescents tended to be more active than older adolescents (p = 0.079).

We conducted a phase I study to investigate high-dose camostat mesylate as a treatment for coronavirus disease 2019. Camostat mesylate was orally administered to healthy adults at 600 mg 4 times daily under either of the following conditions: fasted state, after a meal, 30 min before a meal, or 1 h before a meal, and the pharmacokinetics and safety profiles were evaluated. In addition, the time of plasma GBPA concentration exceeding the effective concentration was estimated as the time above half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) by using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation. Camostat mesylate was safe and tolerated at all dosages. Compared with the fasted state, the exposure of GBPA after a meal and 30 min before a meal was significantly lower; however, no significant difference was observed at 1 h before a meal. The time above EC50 was 11.5 h when camostat mesylate 600 mg was administered 4 times daily in the fasted state or 1 h before a meal.

Objective: To elucidate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and symptom onset in a culturally linked community across 5 states in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included adults (aged &#8805;18 years) recruited from the orthodox Jewish community across 5 states (California, Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York) in 3 geographically distinct areas of the United States between May 13 and July 6, 2020. Participants completed an online survey and underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seroprevalence and date of symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2. Results: Overall, 9507 adults (mean [SD] age, 39.6 [15.0] years; 3777 [39.7%] women) completed the SARS-CoV-2 survey, of whom 6665 (70.1%) had immunoglobin G anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels assessed. A high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was observed across all communities, with the highest proportion of positive testing observed in New Jersey (1080 of 3323 [32.5%]) and New York (671 of 2196 [30.6%]). Most individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobin G antibody test reported a date of symptom-onset between March 9 and March 31, 2020 (California: 135 of 154 [87.7%]; Connecticut: 32 of 34 [94.1%]; Michigan: 44 of 50 [88.0%]; New Jersey: 964 of 1168 [82.5%]; New York: 571 of 677 [84.3%]).

A correlation has been identified between the severity of COVID-19 and a patient's preexisting comorbidities. Although COVID-19 primarily involves the respiratory system, dysfunction in multiple organ systems is common, particularly in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, renal, and nervous systems. Patients with amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis represent a population particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidity due to the multisystem nature of ATTR amyloidosis. MAIN BODY: ATTR amyloidosis is a clinically heterogeneous progressive disease, resulting from the accumulation of amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues. Amyloid deposition causes multisystem clinical manifestations, including cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy, along with gastrointestinal symptoms and renal dysfunction. Given the potential for exacerbation of organ dysfunction, physicians note possible unique challenges in the management of patients with ATTR amyloidosis who develop multiorgan complications from COVID-19. While the interplay between COVID-19 and ATTR amyloidosis is still being evaluated, physicians should consider that the heightened susceptibility of patients with ATTR amyloidosis to multiorgan complications might increase their risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with ATTR amyloidosis are suspected to have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to age and underlying ATTR amyloidosis-related organ dysfunction. While further research is needed to characterize this risk and management implications, ATTR amyloidosis patients might require specialized management if they develop COVID-19. The risks of delaying diagnosis or interrupting treatment for patients with ATTR amyloidosis should be balanced with the risk of exposure in the health care setting. Both physicians and patients must adapt to a new construct for care during and possibly after the pandemic to ensure optimal health for patients with ATTR amyloidosis, minimizing treatment interruptions.","Brannagan, Thomas H; Auer-Grumbach, Michaela; Berk, John L; Briani, Chiara; Bril, Vera; Coelho, Teresa; Damy, Thibaud; Dispenzieri, Angela; Drachman, Brian M; Fine, Nowell; Gaggin, Hanna K; Gertz, Morie; Gillmore, Julian D; Gonzalez, Esther; Hanna, Mazen; Hurwitz, David R; Khella, Sami L; Maurer, Mathew S; Nativi-Nicolau, Jose; Olugemo, Kemi; Quintana, Luis F; Rosen, Andrew M; Schmidt, Hartmut H; Shehata, Jacqueline; Waddington-Cruz, Marcia; Whelan, Carol; Ruberg, Frederick L",Orphanet J Rare Dis,335,1

Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery-go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer-colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma-morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3-4 and/or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections. Most complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality-oesogastric, hepatic or pancreatic-is most often best deferred.","Tuech, J-J; Gangloff, A; Di Fiore, F; Michel, P; Brigand, C; Slim, K; Pocard, M; Schwarz, L",J Visc Surg,335,14

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play a vital role in the genetic dissection of complex diseases. In-depth analysis of SNP-related information could recognize disease-associated biomarkers and further uncover the genetic mechanism of complex diseases. Risk-related variants might act on the disease by affecting gene expression and gene function. Through integrating SNP disease association study and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, as well as functional enrichment of containing known causal genes, four risk SNPs and four corresponding susceptibility genes were identified utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of COPD. Of the four risk SNPs, one could be found in the SNPedia database that stored disease-related SNPs and has been linked to a disease in the literature. Four genes showed significant differences from the perspective of normal/disease or variant/nonvariant samples, as well as the high performance of sample classification. It is speculated that the four susceptibility genes could be used as biomarkers of COPD. Furthermore, three of our susceptibility genes have been confirmed in the literature to be associated with COPD. Among them, two genes had an impact on the significance of expression correlation of known causal genes they interact with, respectively. Overall, this research may present novel insights into the diagnosis and pathogenesis of COPD and susceptibility gene identification of other complex diseases.","Liu, Yang; Huang, Kun; Wang, Yahui; Hu, Erqiang; Wei, Benliang; Song, Zhaona; Zou, Yuqing; Ge, Luanfeng; Chen, Lina; Li, Wan",Biomed Res Int,335,1

In a previous work, by using model membranes we studied P6, a peptide that shows no antimicrobial activity, and P6.2, which exhibits antibacterial activity. In the present work we aimed to unravel the mode of action of these peptides by studying their interaction in vivo with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In this sense, to study the interactions with bacterial cells and their effect on the bacterial surface, zeta potential, spectroscopic, and microscopic methodologies were applied. P6.2 exhibits a higher affinity toward both bacterial envelopes. The ability of both peptides to disrupt afterwards the bacterial membrane was also studied. Both peptides were able to induce bacterial membrane damage, but higher concentrations of P6 were needed to obtain results comparable to those obtained for P6.2. Additionally, P6.2 exhibited faster damage kinetics. Altogether, these data allow postulating, in a physiologic model, that the lower affinity of P6 for bacterial envelope results in a minor final concentration of the peptide in the bacterial membrane unable to trigger the antimicrobial activity. Finally, the fact that the active P6.2 has the same MIC value for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested, but not the same profile in the permeabilization assays, reinforces the question of whether cell wall components act as electrostatic barriers preventing or minimizing membrane-active AMPs lethal action at the membrane level.","Maturana, Patricia; Gonçalves, Sónia; Martinez, Melina; Espeche, Juan C; Santos, Nuno C; Semorile, Liliana; Maffia, Paulo C; Hollmann, Axel",Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,335,5

Brazilian CHWs are overwhelmingly women from poor backgrounds, with precarious and sometimes hazardous working conditions, as well as fragmented and unsystematic training. This paper evaluates how the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities of CHWs (pertaining to low salary, precarious and hazardous working conditions and inadequate training) and created new ones, with a profound impact on their ability to carry out health promotion activities. Drawing on testimonials of dozens of CHWs and online discussions promoted by their unions, the paper reveals that during the pandemic CHWs were asked to continue their work without adequate training and protective equipment, thus exposing themselves to the risk of infection. It further shows how the pandemic rendered dangerous the close interaction with patients that is at the heart of their health promotion role. Nonetheless, CHWs sought to adapt their work. In the absence of leadership and coordination on the part of the federal government, CHWs mobilized different forms of resistance at the national and individual levels. Despite this, COVID-19 contributed to a trajectory of erosion of health promotion in Brazil. Findings from this case signal the difficulties for health promotion in low- and middle-income countries relying on CHWs to bridge the health system and vulnerable users.","Lotta, Gabriela; Nunes, João",Glob Health Promot,335,30

A total of 131 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 13 February 2020 to 14 March 2020 in a hospital in Wuhan designated for treating COVID-19 were enrolled in the current study. These 131 patients had a median age of 64 years old (interquartile range: 56-71 years old). Furthermore, among these patients, 111 (91.8%) patients were discharged and 12 (9.2%) patients died in the hospital. The pooled analysis revealed that the NLR at admission was significantly elevated for non-survivors, when compared to survivors (P < 0.001). The NLR of 3.338 was associated with all-cause mortality, with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 84.0% (area under the curve (AUC): 0.963, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.911-1.000; P < 0.001). In view of the small number of deaths (n = 12) in the current study, NLR of 2.306 might have potential value for helping clinicians to identify patients with severe COVID-19, with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 56.7% (AUC: 0.729, 95% CI 0.563-0.892; P = 0.063).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of hospitalization (as a marker of severe COVID-19) in patients by smoking status: former, current and never smokers, who tested positive for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) at an academic medical center in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with SARS-COV2 between March-1-2020 and January-31-2021 to identify the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by smoking status. RESULTS: We identified 10216 SARS-COV2-positive patients with complete documentation of smoking habits. Within 14 days of a SARS-COV2 positive test, 1150 (11.2%) patients were admitted and 188 (1.8%) died. Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized from COVID-19 than current or never smokers (21.2% former smokers; 7.3% current smokers; 10.4% never smokers, p<0.0001). In univariable analysis, former smokers had higher odds of hospitalization from COVID-19 than never smokers (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.94-2.74). This association remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age, race and gender (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.55), but became non-significant when analysis included Body Mass Index, previous hospitalization and number of comorbidities (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86-1.29). In contrast, current smokers were less likely than never smokers to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized and died from COVID-19 than current or never smokers. This effect is mediated via age and comorbidities in former smokers.","Puebla Neira, Daniel; Watts, Abigail; Seashore, Justin; Polychronopoulou, Efstathia; Kuo, Yong-Fang; Sharma, Gulshan",Respir Med,335,1

COVID-19 started in China in 2019, and it is still spreading even now. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan are the most important imaging techniques for diagnosing COVID-19. All researchers are looking for effective solutions and fast treatment methods for this epidemic. To reduce the need for medical experts, fast and accurate automated detection techniques are introduced. Deep learning convolution neural network (DL-CNN) technologies are showing remarkable results for detecting cases of COVID-19. In this paper, deep feature concatenation (DFC) mechanism is utilized in two different ways. In the first one, DFC links deep features extracted from X-ray and CT scan using a simple proposed CNN. The other way depends on DFC to combine features extracted from either X-ray or CT scan using the proposed CNN architecture and two modern pre-trained CNNs: ResNet and GoogleNet. The DFC mechanism is applied to form a definitive classification descriptor. The proposed CNN architecture consists of three deep layers to overcome the problem of large time consumption. For each image type, the proposed CNN performance is studied using different optimization algorithms and different values for the maximum number of epochs, the learning rate (LR), and mini-batch (M-B) size. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other modern and state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f_score.","Saad, Waleed; Shalaby, Wafaa A; Shokair, Mona; El-Samie, Fathi Abd; Dessouky, Moawad; Abdellatef, Essam",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,335,22

As patients are usually observed from hospital admission to discharge and drug initiation starts during hospitalization, advanced statistical methods are needed to account for time-dependent drug exposure, confounding and competing events. Our objective is to evaluate the observational studies on the three common methodological pitfalls in time-to-event analyses: immortal time bias, confounding bias and competing risk bias. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on 23 October 2020, in the PubMed database to identify observational cohort studies that evaluated drug effectiveness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We included articles published in four journals: British Medical Journal, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet as well as their sub-journals. RESULTS: Overall, out of 255 articles screened, 11 observational cohort studies on treatment effectiveness with drug exposure-outcome associations were evaluated. All studies were susceptible to one or more types of bias in the primary study analysis. Eight studies had a time-dependent treatment. However, the hazard ratios were not adjusted for immortal time in the primary analysis. Even though confounders presented at baseline have been addressed in nine studies, time-varying confounding caused by time-varying treatment exposure and clinical variables was less recognized. Only one out of 11 studies addressed competing event bias by extending follow-up beyond patient discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In the observational cohort studies on drug effectiveness for treatment of COVID-19 published in four high-impact journals, the methodological biases were concerningly common. Appropriate statistical tools are essential to avoid misleading conclusions and to obtain a better understanding of potential treatment effects.","Martinuka, Oksana; von Cube, Maja; Wolkewitz, Martin",Clin. microbiol. infect,335,1

To review the clinical usefulness of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as treatment or adjunctive therapy in a number of medical conditions. Use in Tylenol overdose, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive lung disease has been well documented, but there is emerging evidence many other conditions would benefit from this safe, simple, and inexpensive intervention. Quality of Evidence. PubMed, several books, and conference proceedings were searched for articles on NAC and health conditions listed above reviewing supportive evidence. This study uses a traditional integrated review format, and clinically relevant information is assessed using the American Family Physician Evidence-Based Medicine Toolkit. A table summarizing the potential mechanisms of action for N-acetylcysteine in these conditions is presented. Main Message. N-acetylcysteine may be useful as an adjuvant in treating various medical conditions, especially chronic diseases. These conditions include polycystic ovary disease, male infertility, sleep apnea, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza, parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, stroke outcomes, diabetic neuropathy, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, and obsessive compulsive disorder;it can also be useful as a chelator for heavy metals and nanoparticles. There are also a number of other conditions that may show benefit;however, the evidence is not as robust. Conclusion. The use of N-acetylcysteine should be considered in a number of conditions as our population ages and levels of glutathione drop.

On admission, antipsychotic therapy was set up which had the role to reduced delusional and hallucinatory symptoms but the suspiciousness, the presence of magical thought and the closure towards surrounding world that characterize it, combined with the presence of intrusive images, consequently increased the anxiety experiences and negatively affects the establishment of a therapeutic relationship with the operators. During the hospitalization, daily support interviews were carried out: G.B. showed clear difficulty in expressing his own thought contents in presence of more than two operators emerged jointly with the tendency to project different emotional experiences based on the gender of the operator. Following these observations, with the aim to carrying out an intervention that could integrate a psychological approach to the pharmacological therapy in place, a specific personalized support setting was set up, consisting of a female and a male operator. This setting was structured coherently with the therapeutic goals to be achieved: creation of a therapeutic alliance, the integration of the patient's emotional experiences and containing the splitting through the transference analysis. By means of this setting, the patient has obtained a substantial improvement of the splitting framework allowing a better integration of his emotional experiences.

These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. METHODS: A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to deliver EI and mindfulness training in a scalable way using the Ajivar app during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in improvements in anxiety, depression, and EI in the college student population.","Sturgill, Ronda; Martinasek, Mary; Schmidt, Trine; Goyal, Raj",JMIR Form Res,335,25

Understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the versatile clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is incomplete without comprehension of how different immune cells are recruited to various compartments of virus-infected lungs, and how this recruitment differs among individuals with different levels of disease severity. As in other respiratory infections, leukocyte recruitment to the respiratory system in people with COVID-19 is orchestrated by specific leukocyte trafficking molecules, and when uncontrolled and excessive it results in various pathological complications, both in the lungs and in other organs. In the absence of experimental data from physiologically relevant animal models, our knowledge of the trafficking signals displayed by distinct vascular beds and epithelial cell layers in response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is still incomplete. However, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus elicit partially conserved inflammatory responses in the different respiratory epithelial cells encountered early in infection and may trigger partially overlapping combinations of trafficking signals in nearby blood vessels. Here, we review the molecular signals orchestrating leukocyte trafficking to airway and lung compartments during primary pneumotropic influenza virus infections and discuss potential similarities to distinct courses of primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. We also discuss how an imbalance in vascular activation by leukocytes outside the airways and lungs may contribute to extrapulmonary inflammatory complications in subsets of patients with COVID-19. These multiple molecular pathways are potential targets for therapeutic interventions in patients with severe COVID-19.","Alon, Ronen; Sportiello, Mike; Kozlovski, Stav; Kumar, Ashwin; Reilly, Emma C; Zarbock, Alexander; Garbi, Natalio; Topham, David J",Nat. rev. immunol,335,20

Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; ""optimising"" the employment services"" in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen - or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy.","Kuziemski, Maciej; Misuraca, Gianluca",Telecomm Policy,335,16

Different animal species can serve as reservoirs and sources of dissemination of the disease, such as rodent species due their potential in transmitting zoonotic pathogens to humans and other animals. In the Canary Islands (Spain), Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis have been identified in patients with diarrhea. However, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in possible reservoirs in this archipelago remains unclear. Considering the zoonotic potential of these protozoans, the aim of the present study was to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in peridomestic wild rodents and the possible role of these mammals as a source of transmission of these protozoans in Canary Islands. METHODS: A total of 179 rodents belonging to Rattus rattus and Mus musculus domesticus from four Canary Islands, La Palma, El Hierro, Tenerife and Lanzarote, were analyzed. Feces were screened for Cryptosporidium spp. by nested PCR of the 18S ribosomal RNA fragment and the sequences used for phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Cryptosporidium spp. were found widely distributed with an overall prevalence of 12.30% in rodents (13.86% for R. rattus and 10.25% for M. m. domesticus). The overall prevalence by island was 19.60% for Tenerife, 7.14% for La Palma, 5.71% for El Hierro and 0% for Lanzarote. Cryptosporidium tyzzeri, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium sp. rat genotype I and II/III were successfully identified, in addition to two unidentified Cryptosporidium genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the knowledge of the biodiversity and distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rodents from the Canary Islands, highlighting the presence of three zoonotic species, C. tyzzeri, C. meleagridis and C. muris, being the first detection of these three species in wild rodents in the Canary Islands and the first report of C. meleagridis in R. rattus. Given the results obtained in our study, future studies in non-sampled areas are required to better understand the epidemiology of these protozoans in wild rodents in the archipelago.","García-Livia, Katherine; Martín-Alonso, Aarón; Foronda, Pilar",Parasit Vectors,335,6

Because clinical diagnosis of ARDS includes several diseases, understanding the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS is necessary for precise treatment. We report 2 patients with ARDS due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia. CASE REPORT Case 1 involved a 72-year-old Japanese man who presented with respiratory distress and fever. Computed tomography (CT) revealed subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Six days after symptom onset, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia. He was intubated and received veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 8 days after symptom onset. Follow-up CT revealed large diffuse areas with a crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, which indicated progression of COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Following treatment with antiviral medications and supportive measures, the patient was weaned off ECMO after 20 days. Case 2 involved a 70-year-old Asian man residing in Canada who presented with cough, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and fever. COVID-19-associated pneumonia was diagnosed based on a positive result from RT-PCR testing. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated 8 days after symptom onset. Follow-up CT showed that while the initial subpleural GGOs had improved, diffuse GGOs appeared, similar to those observed upon diffuse alveolar damage. He was administered systemic steroid therapy for ARDS and extubated after 6 days. CONCLUSIONS Because the pattern of symptom exacerbation in COVID-19-associated pneumonia cases seems inconsistent, individual treatment management, especially the CT-based treatment strategy, is crucial.","Matsumura, Kazuki; Toyoda, Yukitoshi; Matsumoto, Shokei; Kawai, Yoshiaki; Mori, Takaaki; Omasa, Kosei; Fukada, Takuya; Yamada, Masaki; Kazamaki, Taku; Furugori, Shintaro; Hiroe, Nao; Senoo, Satomi; Shimizu, Masayuki; Funabiki, Tomohiro; Yamazaki, Motoyasu",Am J Case Rep,335,16

When deposited into oceans, it can further influence phytoplankton growth. These roles of Fe fundamentally depend on its concentration and solubility. However, the sources of aerosol Fe and controlling factors of Fe solubility in megacities remain poorly understood. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic causes large changes in human activities, which provides a unique opportunity to answer these key issues. Field observations were conducted before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Hangzhou, China. Our results show that in the COVID-19 lockdown stage, the concentrations of total Fe (FeT, 75.0 ng m−3) and soluble Fe (FeS, 5.1 ng m−3) in PM2.5 decreased by 78% and 62%, respectively, compared with those (FeT 344.7 ng m−3, FeS 13.5 ng m−3) in the pre-lockdown stage. The sharp reduction (81%) in on-road vehicles was most responsible for the aerosol Fe decrease. Surprisingly, the Fe solubility increased by a factor of 1.9, from 4.2% in the pre-lockdown stage to 7.8% in the COVID-19 lockdown stage. We found that the atmospheric oxidizing capacity was enhanced after lockdown restrictions were implemented, which promoted the formation of more acidic species and further enhanced the dissolution of aerosol Fe.","Liu, Lei Lin Qiuhan Liang Zhuoran Du Rongguang Zhang Guizhen Zhu Yanhong Qi Bing Zhou Shengzhen Li Weijun",Gondwana Research,335,1

With the successful development of a vaccine, these restrictions are likely to become obsolete-on the condition that people get vaccinated. However, parts of the population have reservations against vaccination. While this is not a recent phenomenon, it might prove a critical one in the context of current attempts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the task of designing policies suitable for attaining high levels of vaccination deserves enhanced attention. In this study, we use data from the Eurobarometer survey fielded in March 2019. They show that 39% of Europeans consider vaccines to cause the diseases which they should protect against, that 50% believe vaccines have serious side effects, that 32% think that vaccines weaken the immune system, and that 10% do not believe vaccines are tested rigorously before authorization. We find that-even when controlling for important individual-level factors-ideological extremism on both ends of the spectrum explains skepticism of vaccination. We conclude that policymakers must either politicize the issue or form broad alliances among parties and societal groups in order to increase trust in and public support for the vaccines in general and for vaccines against COVID-19 in particular, since the latter were developed in a very short time period and resulted-in particular in case of the AstraZeneca vaccine-in reservations because of the effectiveness and side effects of the new vaccines.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the 2019 global pandemic of COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia. We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicentre, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include the following: patients > 16 years, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19, and availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are : onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization, intubated or imminent plan for intubation, and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP is collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test; &#945; = 0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n = 600). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine whether CCP will reduce intubation or death non-intubated adults with COVID-19. The trial will also provide information on the role of and thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and neutralization assays for donor qualification.

We sought to determine COVID-19 outcomes among patients with RMD 6 months into the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study at Mass General Brigham in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients with RMD matched to up to five comparators by age, sex and COVID-19 diagnosis date (between 30 January 2020 and 16 July 2020) and followed until last encounter or 18 August 2020. COVID-19 outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Risk of mechanical ventilation was compared in an early versus a recent cohort of patients with RMD. RESULTS: We identified 143 patients with RMD and with COVID-19 (mean age 60 years; 76% female individuals) and 688 comparators (mean age 59 years; 76% female individuals). There were no significantly higher adjusted risks of hospitalisation (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.68-1.11), intensive care unit admission (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.86-1.86), or mortality (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.53-1.95) in patients with RMD versus comparators. There was a trend towards a higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the RMD cohort versus comparators, although not statistically significant (adjusted HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.93-2.44). There was a trend towards improvement in mechanical ventilation risk in the recent versus early RMD cohort (10% vs 19%, adjusted HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.17-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RMD and comparators had similar risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes after adjusting for race, smoking and comorbidities. The higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the early RMD cohort was no longer detected in a recent cohort, suggesting improved management over time.","Serling-Boyd, Naomi; D039,; Silva, Kristin M; Hsu, Tiffany Yt; Wallwork, Rachel; Fu, Xiaoqing; Gravallese, Ellen M; Jorge, April M; Zhang, Yuqing; Choi, Hyon; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Wallace, Zachary S",Ann. rheum. dis,335,21

However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. RESULTS: Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs > 1.20, ps < 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been prevalent among college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, and showed a significant increase after the initial stage of the outbreak. Some college students, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibited persistent or delayed symptoms.","Li, Yuanyuan; Zhao, Jingbo; Ma, Zijuan; McReynolds, Larkin S; Lin, Dihuan; Chen, Zihao; Wang, Tong; Wang, Dongfang; Zhang, Yifan; Zhang, Jinfang; Fan, Fang; Liu, Xianchen",J. affect. disord,335,24

Encouraging results related to the use of telemedicine in women with hyperglycaemia in pregnancy, have been recently published. It is well known that hyperglycaemia alters the immune response to infections, that inflammation, in turn, worsens glycaemic control and that any form of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) has effects not only on the mother but also on development of the foetus. Therefore, the Italian Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group, together with a group of experts, developed these recommendations in order to guide physicians in the management of HIP, providing specific diagnostic, therapeutic and assistance pathways (PDTAs) for the COVID-19 emergency.

These measures include interventions as stringent as strict lockdown but also school closure, bar and restaurant closure, curfews and barrier gestures i.e. social distancing. Disentangling the effectiveness of each NPI is crucial to inform response to future outbreaks. To this end, we first develop a multi-level estimation of the French COVID-19 epidemic over a period of one year. We rely on a global extended Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) mechanistic model of the infection including a dynamical (over time) transmission rate containing a Wiener process accounting for modeling error. Random effects are integrated following an innovative population approach based on a Kalman-type filter where the log-likelihood functional couples data across French regions. We then fit the estimated time-varying transmission rate using a regression model depending on NPI, while accounting for vaccination coverage, apparition of variants of concern (VoC) and seasonal weather conditions. We show that all NPI considered have an independent significant effect on the transmission rate. We additionally demonstrate a strong effect from weather conditions which decrease transmission during the summer period, and also estimate increased transmissibility of VoCs.","Collin, Annabelle; Hejblum, Boris; Vignals, Carole; Lehot, Laurent; Thiebaut, Rodolphe; Moireau, Philippe; Prague, Melanie",,335,1

Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents a computation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network. We utilize our methods to evaluate the effects of various mitigation measures in the District of Columbia, USA, at various times and to various degrees. Rcode for our method is provided in the supplementry material, thereby allowing others to utilize our approach for other regions.","Sewell, Daniel K; Miller, Aaron",PLoS One,335,13

Although coronaviruses typically infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, the virus RNA can be detected in plasma. The risk of transmitting coronavirus via transfusion of blood products remains. As more asymptomatic infections are identified in COVID-19 cases, blood safety has become particularly important. Methylene blue (MB) photochemical technology has been proven to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses with high efficiency and safety. The present study aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation effects of MB in plasma. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 virus strain was isolated from Zhejiang University. The live virus was harvested from cultured VERO-E6 cells, and mixed with MB in plasma. The MB final concentrations were 0, 1, 2, and 4 µM. The ""BX-1 AIDS treatment instrument"" was used at room temperature, the illumination adjusted to 55,000 ± 0.5 million Lux, and the plasma was irradiated for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mins using light at a single wavelength of 630 nm. Virus load changes were measured using quantitative reverse transcription- PCR. RESULTS: BX-1 could effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2 within 2 mins in plasma, and the virus titer declined to 4.5 log10 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose)/mL. CONCLUSION: BX-1 is based on MB photochemical technology, which was designed to inactivate HIV-1 virus in plasma. It was proven to be safe and reliable in clinical trials of HIV treatment. In this study, we showed that BX-1 could also be applied to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. During the current outbreak, this technique it has great potential for ensuring the safety of blood transfusions, for plasma transfusion therapy in recovering patients, and for preparing inactivated vaccines.","Jin, Changzhong; Yu, Bin; Zhang, Jie; Wu, Hao; Zhou, Xipeng; Yao, Hangping; Liu, Fumin; Lu, Xiangyun; Cheng, Linfang; Jiang, Miao; Wu, Nanping",BMC Infect Dis,335,1

By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemistry, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes, including the 43S pre-initiation complex and the non-translating 80S ribosome. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain into the mRNA channel, where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in an in vitro translation system and in human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5' untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines global inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to allow expression of viral genes.","Schubert, Katharina; Karousis, Evangelos D; Jomaa, Ahmad; Scaiola, Alain; Echeverria, Blanca; Gurzeler, Lukas-Adrian; Leibundgut, Marc; Thiel, Volker; Mühlemann, Oliver; Ban, Nenad",Nat Struct Mol Biol,335,16

Studies based on in-hospital exposure have suggested a beneficial effect of these drugs, unlike those based on chronic exposure. We aimed to analyse RAAS blocker prescription before and during hospital stay in patients with COVID-19, and the corresponding outcomes, to explain these discrepant results. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study conducted in 347 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (Bichat Hospital, Paris, France, 23 January-29 April 2020), RAAS blocker exposure, as well as timing and reason for treatment modifications, were collected. The association between exposure and mortality within 30 days of hospital admission was analysed using logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Median age was 61 [interquartile range, 51-72] years, 209 (60%) were male, 169 (49%) had a history of treated hypertension, and 117 (34%) received a RAAS blocker prior to hospitalization. RAAS blockers were discontinued within the first 7 days of hospital admission in 33% of previously treated patients (mostly driven by severity of the disease), with a corresponding mortality rate of 33%. Mortality was 8% when treatment was maintained or introduced, and 12% in patients never exposed. Adjusted odds ratios for association between exposure and mortality were 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.25-1.48) based on chronic exposure and 0.25 (0.09-0.65) based on in-hospital exposure. CONCLUSION: A 'healthy user-sick stopper' bias influences RAAS blocker prescription after hospital admission for COVID-19, and explains the seemingly favourable outcome associated with in-hospital treatment.","Lahens, Alexandre; Mullaert, Jimmy; Gressens, Simon; Gault, Nathalie; Flamant, Martin; Deconinck, Laurène; Joly, Véronique; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Lescure, François-Xavier; Vidal-Petiot, Emmanuelle",J. hypertens,335,23

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted healthcare in the United States, including cardiovascular services. The impact of COVID-19 on IC fellow training in the United States has not been assessed. METHODS: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) surveyed IC fellows training in both accredited and advanced non-accredited programs, as well as their program directors (PD). RESULTS: Responses were received from 135 IC fellows and 152 PD. All respondents noted reductions in procedural volumes beginning in March 2020. At that time, only 43% of IC fellows had performed >250 PCI. If restrictions were lifted by May 15, 2020 78% of IC fellows believed they would perform >250 PCI, but fell to only 70% if restrictions persisted until the end of the academic year. 49% of IC fellows felt that their procedural competency was impaired by COVID-19, while 97% of PD believed that IC fellows would be procedurally competent at the end of their training. Most IC fellows (65%) noted increased stress at work and at home, and many felt that job searches and/or existing offers were adversely affected by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected IC training in the United States, with many fellows at risk of not satisfying current program procedural requirements. These observations support a move to review current IC program requirements and develop mitigation strategies to supplement gaps in education related to reduced procedural volume.","Shah, Samit; Castro-Dominguez, Yulanka; Gupta, Tanush; Attaran, Robert; Byrum, Graham Vance; Taleb, Adam; Pettyjohn, Amanda; Bartel, Robert C; Szerlip, Molly; Henry, Timothy D; Mahmud, Ehtisham; Applegate, Robert J",Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,335,6

Cytokine storm is linked to the severity and decreasing the survival among infected patients by COVID-19. The serum levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) have been correlated to mortality in COVID-19 cases and could be used as indicator of mortality in COVID-19 cases. The aim of this study was to determine levels of IL-6 and assess its usefulness as indicator of mortality among COVID-19 patients from Mexico. METHODS: A cohort study among 38 adults (28 men, 10 women) was carried out in the Regional High Specialty Hospital of the Yucatan Peninsula in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Demographic and clinical biochemistry data were collected. The serum levels of IL-6 were measured in each patient by specific immunoassays. RESULTS: High frequency of mortality (36.84%) was found in the sample. The average age of individuals that non-survive was significantly higher (59.71 ± 13.83 years) than the survival group (43.29 ± 11.80 years). Serum levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in patients that did not survive. A correlation between IL-6 levels with lymphocyte count, LDH, CRP and procaciltonin was found. The optimal cutoff value of IL-6 was 30.95 pg/mL with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that level of IL-6 is an indicator of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Mexico.","Avila-Nava, Azalia; Cortes-Telles, Arturo; Torres-Erazo, Darwin; López-Romero, Stephanie; Chim Aké, Rodolfo; Gutiérrez Solis, Ana Ligia",Cytokine,335,1

In particular, the nCoV19 CDC kit includes two targets for detecting SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2) and an RNaseP (RP) target for RNA extraction quality control, all of which are labeled with FAM, and thus three PCR reactions are required per sample. METHODS: We designed a triplex RT-qPCR assay based on nCoV19 primers and probes where N1, N2, and RP are labeled with FAM, HEX, and Cy5, respectively, so only a single PCR reaction is required for each sample for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 172 samples were analyzed in both singleplex and triplex assays, where 86 samples tested SARS-CoV-2 negative with both assays, so the triplex assay specificity was 100%. In addition, 86 samples tested SARS-Co-V 2 positive with the singleplex assay and 84 with the triplex assay, so the sensitivity was 97.7%. The limit of detection for the triplex assay was determined as 1000 copies/mL.

Aim: This article identifies the impact of increasing disruption driven by the 4IR and COVID-19 on the content and curriculum design of degree programmes in economic and management sciences offered by South African universities. Setting: Six South African and five top-tier US and UK universities. Methods: The study used a non-positivist qualitative research design and specifically the case-study approach. A document analysis of the information in university yearbooks and prospectuses was conducted, using a purposive sampling design. Results: An online presence will become more important due to increased disruption, and will not only ensure an additional revenue stream, but also promote continuity in operations and mitigate threats from competitors. COVID-19 has accelerated the extent of this disruption and expedited the migration to online teaching and learning platforms. Conclusion: Since science, technology, engineering and mathematics are integral to the majority of 4IR-related modules, South African universities must not shy away from degree programmes that ignore inter- and multi-disciplinary curriculum designs. Coupled with the challenges facing the majority of South African students to access electronic devices, data and the internet, COVID-19 has thrust this challenge to the forefront in the South African higher education landscape. By comparing the developments in South African universities with those in trendsetting, top-tier, global universities, management can assess the extent to which they are internationally competitive and adapting to the demands of the 4IR.","Coetzee, J.; Neneh, B.; Stemmet, K.; Lamprecht, J.; Motsitsi, C.; Sereeco, W.",South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences,335,1

Healthcare workers were most likely to be infected compared to other occupations (p < 0.001). The general lethality rate was 14.1%, and males >62 years were the ones who had a higher lethality rate (p < 0.001); the aforementioned chronic diseases were related to higher lethality of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Likewise, higher lethality was seen in housewives and patient retirees/pensioners compared with other occupations (p < 0.001). Finally, we found there was a relationship between influenza vaccination and a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality (p < 0.001). These findings showed that healthcare workers, men >62 years with chronic diseases, and retired people were most affected.

Despite the broad knowledge about the changes in cortical activity directly related to the motor execution, less is known about age-related differences in the motor initiation phase. We hypothesize that the latter strongly influences the behavioral characteristics, such as reaction time, the accuracy of motor performance, etc. Here, we compare the neuronal processes underlying the motor initiation phase preceding fine motor task execution between elderly and young subjects. Based on the results of the whole-scalp sensor-level electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, we demonstrate that the age-related slowing down in the motor initiation before the dominant hand movements is accompanied by the increased theta activation within sensorimotor area and reconfiguration of the theta-band functional connectivity in elderly adults.","Frolov, Nikita S; Pitsik, Elena N; Maksimenko, Vladimir A; Grubov, Vadim V; Kiselev, Anton R; Wang, Zhen; Hramov, Alexander E",PLoS One,335,20

Determinants of COVID-19 outcomes among patients with psoriasis are yet to be established. OBJECTIVE: Th objective of this study was to characterize a large cohort of patients with psoriasis with COVID-19 and to identify predictors of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: A population-based nested case-control study was performed using the computerized database of Clalit Health Services, Israel. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence (CIs) of predictors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: The study population included 3151 patients with psoriasis who tested positive for COVID-19. Subclinical COVID-19 infection occurred in 2818 (89.4%) of the patients while 122 (3.9%), 71 (2.3%), 123 (3.9%), and 16 (0.5%) of the patients experienced a mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Overall, 332 (10.5%) patients were hospitalized and 50 (1.6%) patients died because of COVID-19 complications. Intake of methotrexate independently predicted COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.11-4.78; p = 0.025). Use of biologic agents was not associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.32-1.73; p = 0.491) or mortality (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.12-6.21; p = 0.870). Older age, the presence of comorbid cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal failure independently predicted both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of oral methotrexate was associated with an increased odds of COVID-associated hospitalization, whereas the use of biologic drugs was not associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with psoriasis.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Tzur Bitan, Dana; Damiani, Giovanni; Peretz, Alon; Weinstein, Orly; Cohen, Arnon D",Am. j. clin. dermatol,335,18

This mutation is present in the Gamma Variant Of Concern (VOC) but it also occurred sporadically in early SARS-CoV-2 human isolates. To better understand the impact of this polymorphism, we analyzed the in vitro properties of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 isolates containing S:655Y in different lineage backgrounds. Results demonstrated that this mutation enhances viral replication and spike protein cleavage. Viral competition experiments using hamsters infected with WA1 and WA1-655Y isolates showed that the variant with 655Y became dominant in both direct infected and direct contact animals. Finally, we investigated the cleavage efficiency and fusogenic properties of the spike protein of selected VOCs containing different mutations in their spike proteins. Results showed that all VOCs have evolved to acquire an increased spike cleavage and fusogenic capacity despite having different sets of mutations in the S protein. Our study demonstrates that the S:655Y is an important adaptative mutation that increases viral cell entry, transmission, and host susceptibility. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 VOCs showed a convergent evolution that promotes the S protein processing.","Escalera, Alba; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S.; Aslam, Sadaf; Mena, Ignacio; Pearl, Rebecca L.; Laporte, Manon; Fossati, Andrea; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Alshammary, Hala; Guchte, Adriana van de; Bouhaddou, Mehdi; Kehrer, Thomas; Zuliani-Alvarez, Lorena; Meekins, David A.; Balaraman, Velmurugan; McDowell, Chester; Richt, Juergen A; Bajic, Goran; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Krogan, Nevan; Simon, Viviana; Albrecht, Randy A.; Bakel, Harm van; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Aydillo, Teresa",,335,31

On March, 11th the WHO declared officially the pandemic of Covid 19. In the absence of an effective treatment of the SARS-Cov2 the measures of social distancing and lockdown remain the most effectives ways against the pandemic. However, these measures can have repercussions in particular on patients followed for chronic diseases, the goal of our study will be to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on non-Covid cardiac patients. METHODS: We have chosen a random sample of patients followed in the cardiology department of the CHU Tangier Tetouan Alhouceima, and we collected their demographic data as well as the symptoms, vital constants, lifestyle before and 60 days after the lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in the study. The average age of our population is 55.34 years±15.86. The average BMI (body mass index) is 26.40 Kg/m2±5.84. The coronary artery disease was present in 27% of the patients, valvular disease in 40% and heart failure in 37%. Finally, arrhythmias appear in 22% and more than the half of our sample has high blood pressure. We noted a significant weight gain of 1.71 Kg (P<0.000) after 60 days of lockdown, with an increase of BMI of 0,58 kg/m2 (P<0,005). The percentage of patients with SBP (systolic blood pressure) &#8805;140mmHg has evolved from 38 to 44%, thus an increase of 6 % (P<0,0001), while the percentage of the patients with DBP (diastolic blood pressure) &#8805;90mmHg has passed from 21 to 15 % (thus a decrease of 6 %, P<0,0001). Twenty patients stop smoking, thus a decrease of 7% (P<0,0001). The sedentary lifestyle rate presented an elevation of 22% (P<0,0001). The daily calorie intake has increased of 35,4 % and 46,8 % of the patients increased their salt intake by more than 4 g per day. The increase of the daily calorie intake concerned more the men than the women (41,9 % of men vs 31,3 % of the women). In the population with high blood pressure, we have not observed a statistically significant difference of the SBP, the DBP and the heart rate between the beginning and two months after the lockdown. Concerning patients with heart Failure, we have noted an worsen of the symptoms of HF. Thus, 8,1% of the patients presenting a stage two dyspnea has passed to a stage three of the NYHA (32,4 vs 40,5%), while the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema has increased of 13,5% but in a non-statistically significant way (P=0,267). We have noticed a diet gap with an increase of salt intakes (more than 4g per day) in more than the half of this subpopulation (55,6 %) during the period of the lockdown. In the subpopulation of patients with valvular pathology, we have identified a worsening of the dyspnea in 7,5% of the patients; this one has passed from stage two to stage three of the NHYA with an increase of the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema from 7,5% to 25% (P=0,065). Furthermore, we have noticed an incidence of 10% of cardiovascular events (2 cases of myocardial infarction [among which one has deceased], one death because of end stage heart failure, three hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, two cases of aortic dissections and 2 cases of rapid atrial fibrillation). OUR OBSERVATION: Depending on the results of this study, the sanitary lockdown induced important repercussions on the patients followed for cardiac diseases, hence the necessity of an awareness of these patients, and mostly a restructuring of our care system strongly disturbed by the Covid 19.","Aajal, A; El Boussaadani, B; Hara, L; Benajiba, C; Boukouk, O; Benali, M; Ouadfel, O; Bendoudouch, H; Zergoune, N; Alkattan, D; Mahdi, Z; Najdi, A; Raissuni, Z",Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),335,16

A prospective pilot study addressed the question if addition of FRWBH to re-irradiation is feasible in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with unfavorable prognostic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study completed accrual with the recruitment of ten patients between April 2018 and March 2020. Re-irradiation was administered using volumetric arc hyperfractionated radiotherapy with bi-daily 1.2 Gray (Gy) single fractions and a total dose of 66 Gy to all macroscopic tumor lesions. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted mostly of cisplatin (7 patients). FRWBH was scheduled weekly during re-irradiation. The study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03547388). RESULTS: Only five patients received all cycles of FRWBH. Poor patient compliance, active infections during treatment and study restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic were the main reasons for omitting FRWBH. No increase of acute toxicity was observed by FRWBH. Exploratory evaluation of outcome data suggests that FRWBH treatment according to protocol does not seem to have a detrimental effect on tumor control or survival and might even increase treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: FRWBH is difficult to apply concomitant to re-irradiation in HNSCC. No excess toxicity was observed in patients receiving FRWBH and exploratory analyses suggest potential anti-tumor activity and decreased patient-reported depression scores after FRWBH.","Zschaeck, Sebastian; Weingärtner, Julian; Ghadjar, Pirus; Wust, Peter; Mehrhof, Felix; Kalinauskaite, Goda; Ehrhardt, Vincent H; Hartmann, Vivian; Tinhofer, Ingeborg; Heiland, Max; Coordes, Annekatrin; Kofla, Grzegorz; Budach, Volker; Stromberger, Carmen; Beck, Marcus",Oral Oncol,335,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 30th March 2020 to 13th April 2020 using anonymous online questionnaire among 864 women at 6-12 weeks postpartum. The Chinese version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and a questionnaire regarding associated factors were administered to all participants. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors that were significantly associated with PPD. RESULTS: The prevalence of PPD among women at 6-12 weeks postpartum was 30.0%. A multivariate logistic regression model identified significant factors as: immigrant women, persistent fever, poor social support, concerns about contracting COVID-19 and certain precautionary measures.

Lately the major component, oleuropein, has gained extra attention due to the anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that causes Coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In this study, extraction of the bioactive compounds from olive leaves was conducted using a non-conventional and green method. New generation green solvents, natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) were used in combination with ultrasound assisted extraction. Screening of NADES type, temperature, and particle size were investigated using one-pot-at-a-time method while, NADES amount and liquid-to-solid ratio were optimized using experimental design. The results were evaluated in terms of total polyphenol yield (YTP), total flavonoid yield (YTF) and antiradical activity (AAR). At the optimized conditions, the highest total polyphenol yield and the highest total flavonoid yield were achieved with choline chloride-fructose-water (CFW) (5:2:5) as 187.31 ± 10.3 mg gallic acid equivalent g-1 dw and 12.75 ± 0.6 mg apigenin equivalent g-1 dw, respectively.

This study examined risk perceptions and attitudinal responses to COVID-19 among the educated section of the society in Ethiopia. METHODS: An internet-based survey was conducted from April 22 to May 04, 2020, in Ethiopia. A questionnaire addressing the perception of health threat-combination of perceived vulnerability (PV) and perceived seriousness (PS), and perceived efficacy-combinations of perceived response efficacy (PRE), perceived self-efficacy (PSE), and perceived collective efficacy (PCE). The data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0. Descriptive statistics were computed after the standardization of the scores. The scores for overall efficacy and threat were split by median value and response classifications were generated through threat by efficacy interactions. For statistical significance, 95% CI and p-value < 0.05 were used. RESULTS: A total of 929 respondents submitted their responses. Eight hundred and twenty-eight (89.1%) of the respondents were male and 753 (81.1%) were Christian. The perceived threat to COVID-19 was generally low (median = 58.3). The median score for overall efficacy, PRE, and PSE were 79.8, 87.5, and 80.0, respectively. However, the median value (66.7) for PCE was relatively low. Perceived threat significantly varied by age, education, occupation, and place of residence (p < 0.05). Perceived efficacy significantly differed by gender, residence, and use of some sources of information (p < 0.05). In terms of response to COVID-19, 290 (31.2%), 239 (25.7%), 175 (18.8%) and 225 (24.2%) of the respondents were in the responsive, pro-active, avoidant, and indifferent attitudinal categories, respectively. The avoidant and indifferent groups constituted a fear control response (mal-adaptive motivation towards COVID-19 protective behavior) whereas responsive and pro-active categories formed a danger control response (self-protective motivation). These responses varied significantly by residence, region, religion, and sources of information (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding people's perceived health threat and efficacy is a critical step toward creating risk communication campaigns. Hence, this study provided an insight that has the potential to inform the COVID-19 risk communication campaigns targeting the educated section of the society, by ensuring a balanced combination of threat appeals and efficacy messages for improved self-protective responses.","Birhanu, Zewdie; Ambelu, Argaw; Fufa, Diriba; Mecha, Mohammed; Zeynudin, Ahmed; Abafita, Jemal; Belay, Ashenafi; Doyore, Feleke; Oljira, Lemessa; Bacha, Endale; Feyisa, Jilcha; Hadis, Zinabu; Ayele, Ketema; Addisu, Yohannes; Gutu, Birhanu; Tesfaye, Demu; Tilahun, Temesgen; Imana, Gudeta; Tolosa, Tadele; Mekonen, Seblework; Yitayih, Yimenu; Jibat, Nega; Moges, Mathewos; Adamu, Ayinengida; Teym, Abraham; Kenea, Adamu; Addis, Taffere; Mengesha, Akalework; Kebede, Yohannes",BMC Public Health,335,1

The incidence of infection with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic was 3.3% among dialysis patients-13 times higher than in the general population. The corresponding mortality rate was high, reaching 21%. As of 19th April, 2021, the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in French dialysis patients was 14%. Convergent scientific data from France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada show that home dialysis reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a factor of at least two. Unfortunately, home dialysis in France is not sufficiently developed: the proportion of dialysis patients being treated at home is only 7%. The obstacles to the provision of home care for patients with end-stage kidney disease in France include (i) an unfavourable pricing policy for home haemodialysis and nurse visits for assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), (ii) insufficient training in home dialysis for nephrologists, (iii) the small number of administrative authorizations for home dialysis programs, and (iv) a lack of structured, objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We propose a number of pragmatic initiatives that could be simultaneously enacted to improve the situation in three areas: (i) the provision of objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced CKD, (ii) wider authorization of home dialysis networks and (iii) price increases in favour of home dialysis procedures.","Rostoker, Guy; Issad, Belkacem; Fessi, Hafedh; Massy, Ziad A",J. nephrol,335,21

However, there is a need for a full picture of mental health problems with comprehensive analysis among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to systematically identify the mental health problems among healthcare workers in various countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed of the following databases: PubMed, Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, MEDLINE Complete, and SocINDEX. The last date of our search was November 2, 2020. We included all cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and used the Joanna Briggs Institute tool to assess their quality. A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the pooled prevalence of mental health problems using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 statistic and Egger's test was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies were identified that reported the mental health problems of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of healthcare workers analyzed in this review included 27.9% doctors, 43.7% nurses, and 7.0% allied health workers. The pooled prevalence of mental health problems for post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and distress was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22-75%), 40% (95% CI: 29-52%), 37% (95% CI: 29-45%), and 37% (95% CI: 25-50%), respectively. CONCLUSION: This review yielded evidence that estimated the global prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-traumatic stress disorder was the most common mental health disorder reported by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by anxiety, depression, and distress. Additional studies remain necessary to assess the appropriate management strategies for treating and preventing mental health disorders among healthcare workers during the pandemic.","Saragih, Ita Daryanti; Tonapa, Santo Imanuel; Saragih, Ice Septriani; Advani, Shailesh; Batubara, Sakti Oktaria; Suarilah, Ira; Lin, Chia-Ju",Int J Nurs Stud,335,26

In the early stages of the pandemic, countries with universal BCG vaccination programs registered a low number of new cases of COVID-19, with the situation now reversed, as exemplified by India. The high genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2, a known characteristic of RNA viruses, causing the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may have led to the virus adapting to overcome the initial immune protection. The strains from the United Kingdom (B1.1.7), Brazil (B1.1.28 and B1.1.33), South Africa (B.1.351), and India (B.1.617) are characterized by a greater ability to spread in the environment, in comparison with the original infectious agent of SARS-CoV-2. It should be remembered that the large variation in the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 may result in future changes in its pathogenicity, immunogenicity and antigenicity, and therefore it is necessary to carefully study the mutations occurring within the virus to determine whether the current vaccines will remain effective. However, most studies show that monoclonal antibodies produced after vaccination against COVID-19 are effective against the newly developed variants.","Kulus, Jakub Kulus Magdalena Stefańska Katarzyna Sobolewski Jarosław Piotrowska-Kempisty Hanna Mozdziak Paul Kempisty Bartosz",Vaccines,335,20

We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate this difference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI was obtained in 2-mm quasi-coronal planes in central gaze, and smaller (~23-25°) and larger (~30-31°) adduction and abduction in 21 controls and 12 POAG subjects whose intraocular pressure never exceeded 21 mmHg. ON cross-sections were analyzed from the globe to 10 mm posteriorly. Area centroids were used to calculate ON path lengths and changes in cross-sections to calculate elongation assuming volume conservation. RESULTS: For both groups, ON path was nearly straight (<102.5% of minimum path) in smaller adduction, with minimal further straightening in larger adduction. ON length was redundant in abduction, exceeding 103% of minimum path for both groups. For normals, the ON elongated 0.4 ± 0.5 mm from central gaze to smaller adduction, and 0.4 ± 0.5 mm further from smaller to larger adduction. For POAG subjects, the ON did not elongate on average from central gaze to smaller adduction and only 0.2 ± 0.4 mm from smaller to larger adduction (P = .045 vs normals). Both groups demonstrated minimal ON elongation not exceeding 0.25 mm from central gaze to smaller and larger abduction. The globe retracted significantly more during large adduction in POAG subjects than normals (0.6 ± 0.7 mm vs 0.2 ± 0.5 mm, P = .027), without appreciable retraction in abduction. For each mm increase in globe axial length, ON elongation in large adduction similarly increased by 0.2 mm in each group. CONCLUSIONS: The normal ON stretches to absorb force and avert globe retraction in adduction. In POAG with mild to severe visual field loss, the relatively inelastic ON tethers and retracts the globe during adduction beyond ~26°, transfering stress to the optic disc that could contribute to progressive neuropathy during repeated eye movements.","Clark, Robert A; Suh, Soh Youn; Caprioli, Joseph; Giaconi, JoAnn A; Nouri-Mahdavi, Kouros; Law, Simon K; Bonelli, Laura; Coleman, Anne L; Demer, Joseph L",Curr Eye Res,335,24

The study consists of an online survey, including thefollowing instruments: Self-Perceived Health, WHO-5 Well-Being Indexand Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data are collected intwo phases: the first wave of the pandemic (from May 14th to July 18th2020) and the second wave (to be conducted in winter 2020).Results558 patients with rheumatic diseases participated in REUMAVID UK.The most frequently reported diagnoses were axial spondyloarthritis(44.6%), rheumatoid arthritis (44.1%) and osteoarthritis (25.6%). Themean age was 58.513.4 years, 78.7% women, 70.8% married or in arelationship and 54.1% having university studies. 45.8% perceivedtheir health status being ""fair to very poor"" with 38.4% reporting aworsening during lockdown. 48.8% had their rheumatology appointment cancelled. Of these, 46.9% were offered either online ortelephone follow-up, while the remaining 50.6% were not given anyalternative. 15.6% changed their medication, of which 66.3% wereindicated to do so by the medical team and 21.7% did so out ofconcern with COVID-19 with the major fear being that their treatmentwould lead to serious illness if they contracted SARS-CoV-2, while thegreater hope was to be able to continue with their treatment as usual.10.3% smoked more than before, 59.4% quit smoking and 36.3%drank more alcohol than before. 20.7% were unable to physicallyexercise at home and 39.2% reported weight gain. According to theWHO-5 scale, 52.5% declared poor well-being (-50). A total of 43.6%were at risk of anxiety and 33.6% at risk of depression according tothe HADS scale.

By engaging whole communities, the IPM has been found to be effective in reducing youth substance use behaviours across Iceland. As an extension to the IPM's participatory approach, this research will examine how youth involvement can enhance outcomes. In addition, this research will evaluate whether the IPM approach is beneficial for mental health promotion and general youth wellbeing. METHODS: The present research protocol applies the bioecological model within a participatory mixed-method case study design to examine the implementation of the IPM in a rural community in Canada. This study was designed to identify whether the Icelandic substance use prevention model is effective in reducing substance use and promoting mental health and development for Canadian youth. It will also explore how to engage youth within the approach and how this adaptation influences implementation and outcomes. DISCUSSION: The findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of upstream prevention of youth substance use and will be used to support scaling of the IPM across Canada.","Halsall, Tanya; Lachance, Lisa; Kristjansson, Alfgeir L",BMC Public Health,335,21

We explore the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19, and put forward effective recommendations for epidemic prevention and control. We collected demographic characteristics, exposure history, and course of action of COVID-19 cases. We described the demographic and case characteristics of these cases to show the basic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in both provinces. Combined with the spatial analysis of confirmed cases, the distribution law of the number of confirmed cases in different regions was analyzed. We exhibit the relationship among COVID-19 cases with a transmission network. The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed through the transmission network. Mainly cases in Liaoning and Jilin provinces were imported cases from other provinces and the vast majority of these cases were related to Hubei province. The number of confirmed cases in different regions was positively correlated with their GDP and population. The main clinical symptoms of the cases were fever. Judge from the transmission network relationship between the 2 provinces, the transmission chain in Liaoning province contains fewer cases than that in Jilin province. The main transmission routes of the local cases in the 2 provinces were the family members, and the infection of the imported cases were mainly occurred in public places. It was estimated that the unidentified asymptomatic infected cases in the 2 provinces account for approximately 7.3% of the total number of infected cases. The length of the transmission chain suggests that the spread of COVID-19 can be effectively controlled with effective prevention measures.","Feng, TianYu Zhang YuLong Sun HeLin Zhang He Sun MengZi Wang YuDan Sun Chong Li KeXin Wang YingShuang Chai RuiYu Zheng PingPing Chen Yang Pan Pan Bi ChunLi Yao Yan Liu SiYu",Medicine,335,16

Limited information was available about the working experience of nurses in fighting against the pandemic. To learn the physical and psychological responses of nurses during the pandemic and explore the potential determinants, we conducted a large-scale survey in Wuhan. This multicenter cross-sectional study enrolled 5521 nurses who worked in designated hospitals, mobile cabins, or shelters during the pandemic. A structured online questionnaire was distributed to assess the physical discomforts, emotional distress and cognitive reactions of nurses at work, and the log-binomial regression analysis was performed to explore potential determinants. A considerable proportion of nurses had symptoms of physical discomforts [3677 (66.6%)] and emotional distress [4721 (85.5%)]. Nurses who were directly involved in the care of patients (i.e., care for severe patients: RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.95-2.84), with irregular work schedules (RR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.95-2.87), and working overtime (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08-1.65) were at a higher risk for physical discomforts.

Efficient operation and dispatch of DERs requires reasonably accurate prediction of future energy consumption in order to conduct near-real-time optimized dispatch of on-site generation and storage assets. Load forecasting has traditionally been done by electric utilities for load pockets spanning large geographic areas and therefore has not been a common practice in the buildings' and campuses' operational arena. Given the growing trends of research and prototyping in the grid-interactive efficient buildings domain, characteristics beyond simple algorithm forecast accuracy are important in determining the algorithm's true utility for the smart buildings. These other characteristics include the overall design of the deployed architecture and the operational efficiency of the forecasting system. In this work, we present a deep-learning-based load forecasting system that predicts the building load at one-hour interval for 18 hours in the future. We also present the challenges associated with the real-time deployment of such systems as well as the research opportunities presented by a fully functional forecasting system that has been developed within the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Intelligent Campus program.","Mishra, Sakshi; Petersen, Anya; Frank, Stephen M.; Slovensky, Michelle",,335,5

Despite their role in fiaviviruses replication, few high-resolution structural studies have investigated the RNA elements required for viral replication. Here we report the NMR structures of stem-loop B from WNV and DENV4 viruses.

METHODS: A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and confirmed COVID-19. He developed hypoxic respiratory failure and heart failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Mobility was limited by severe impairments in strength, endurance, balance, and cognition. The referral, screening, and rehabilitation of this patient were guided by a COVID-19 Service Delivery Plan designed to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of care delivery while minimizing staff exposure to the virus. Coordinated physical and occupational therapy sessions focused on progressive mobility and cognitive retraining. Progress was monitored using a series of standardized outcome measures, including the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care, Timed Up and Go test, and the Saint Louis University Mental Status examination. RESULTS: Rehabilitation was initiated on day 18, and the patient participated in 19 treatment sessions, each approximately 30 minutes, over the remaining 30 days of his hospital stay. His Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care mobility and function scores both improved from 100% to 0% disability, he experienced substantial improvements in both Timed Up and Go (&#916; = 4.2 seconds) and Saint Louis University Mental Status (discharge score = 25). There were no adverse events. He was discharged to home with his family and home rehabilitation services. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 contributed to severe declines in mobility and function in this middle-aged man. He experienced substantial gains in his function, mobility, and cognition during his in-hospital rehabilitation, which was guided by a facility-wide plan to prevent virus transmission.

During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether greenness was related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the US. METHODS: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with higher population density. DISCUSSION: Exposures to NDVI were associated with reduced county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US as well as reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates in densely populated counties.","Klompmaker, Jochem O; Hart, Jaime E; Holland, Isabel; Sabath, M Benjamin; Wu, Xiao; Laden, Francine; Dominici, Francesca; James, Peter",Environ Res,335,24

Doctors' community led the fight against COVID-19 as frontline warriors leaving their families at home for prolonged periods. The psychological issues among the family members, particularly spouses of doctors, are significantly high and need special attention. Aims: We aimed to assess the level of psychological distress among doctors' spouses and the possible relationship between different variables and the level of the distress. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in online mode using chain-referral sampling method. Sample size was 120 and comprises doctors' spouses who were not related to medical field. Those who were working in medical field or having any past psychological illness were excluded from the study. A semi-structured pro forma was used to collect the basic demographic details, and Kessler's Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to rate psychological distress. Results: 72.5% of the study population had reported psychological distress, and half of these participants reported severe psychological distress. Age was the single variable that had significance (P &lt; 0.1), whereas other variables did not show statistically significant values. Conclusion: Psychological distress is much higher compared to the general population in the spouses of the doctors. In long run, this may result in psychological illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders. As a special group, these require targeted interventions and care for the prevention of severe mental health problems. © 2021 Archives of Mental Health ;Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Goud, S.

Studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease were selected for the final analysis. The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. A random effects meta-analysis was applied. RESULTS: We identified 19 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 11,590 COVID-19 patients, 2,133 (18.4%) with severe disease and 731 (6.3%) with a history of smoking. A total of 218 patients with a history of smoking (29.8%) experienced disease progression, compared with 17.6% of non-smoking patients. The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.59, p = 0.001). Limitations in the 19 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers.

Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.","Spadon, Gabriel; Hong, Shenda; Brandoli, Bruno; Matwin, Stan; Rodrigues-Jr, Jose Fernando; Sun, Jimeng",,335,5

It activates coagulation and fuels the risk of thrombosis. Human pregnancy is associated with a mild proinflammatory state characterized by circulatory neutrophil activation which is further increased in complicated pregnancies, placenta-mediated complications being associated with an increased thrombotic risk. This aberrant activation leads to an increased release of nucleosomes in the blood flow. The aim of our study was to initially quantify nucleosome-bound histones in normal pregnancy and in placenta-mediated complication counterpart. We analyzed the role of histones on extravillous trophoblast function. Circulating nucleosome-bound histones H3 (Nu.QH3.1, Nu.QH3PanCit, Nu.QH3K27me3) and H4 (Nu.QH4K16Ac) were increased in complicated pregnancies. In vitro using the extravillous cell line HTR-8/SVNeo, we observed that free recombinant H2B, H3, and H4 inhibited migration in wound healing assay, but only H3 also blocked invasion in Matrigel-coated Transwell experiments. H3 and H4 also induced apoptosis, whereas H2B did not. Finally, the negative effects of H3 on invasion and apoptosis could be restored with enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), but not with aspirin. Different circulating nucleosome-bound histones are increased in complicated pregnancy and this would affect migration, invasion, and induce apoptosis of extravillous trophoblasts. Histones might be part of the link between the risk of thrombosis and pregnancy complications, with an effect of LMWH on both.","Bouvier, Sylvie; Fortier, Mathieu; Vincent, Laura; Demattei, Christophe; Mousty, Eve; Herzog, Marielle; Rommelaere, Guillaume; Nouvellon, Eva; Mercier, Eric; Letouzey, Vincent; Gris, Jean-Christophe",Thromb. haemost,335,15

These proteins include the viral receptor, ACE2 and the proteases TMPRSS2 and furin. A number of studies have reported cell-type specific expression of the genes encoding these molecules. However, less is known about the protein expression of these molecules. METHODS: We assessed the suitability of primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells maintained in air-liquid interface (ALI) as an experimental system for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. During cellular differentiation, we measured the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin over progressive ALI days by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. We also explored the effect of the fibrotic cytokine TGF-b on the expression of these proteins in well-differentiated HBE cells. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Like ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin proteins are localized in differentiated ciliated cells as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. These data suggest that well-differentiated HBE cells maintained in air-liquid interface is a reliable in vitro system for investigating cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further identified that profibrotic mediators, TGF-ß1 and TGF-ß2, increase the expression of furin, which is a protease required for the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2.","O039,; Sullivan, Michael J; Mitchel, Jennifer A; Mwase, Chimwemwe; McGill, Maureen; Kanki, Phyllis; Park, Jin-Ah","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",335,7

We report our experience and measures in dealing with challenging cases of large or multiple RCCs without/with TT during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 4/2020-10/2020, five patients underwent RCC resection with/without TT. Patients 1 and 2 had RCCs/TT in RV; Patient 3 had RCC/TT supradiaphragmatic below right atrium; Patient-4 had a 26 cm RCC; Patient-5 had multiple RCCS as part of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. RESULTS: Patients were preoperatively tested negative for Covid-19. Operation times were 105, 85, 255, 200 and 247 minutes for Patients 1-5. Estimated blood loss was: 100, 50, 3,900,100 and 50 ml, respectively. Patient 3 underwent RCC resection en bloc with IVC/TT. Patients 1 and 2 underwent resections of RCC/TT in RV. Patient 4 underwent a 26 cm RCC resection. Patient 5 underwent laparoscopic bilateral radical nephrectomies. No immediate postoperative complications were reported. CONCLUSION: We successfully managed 5 challenging cases of RCCs despite the recommendations imposed by hospitals due to Covid-19 pandemic, with favorable outcomes.","Ciancio, Gaetano; Farag, Ahmed; Gaynor, Jeffrey J",Anticancer Res,335,9

Methods: GSE76427 data set was collected through GEO database, and DEGs were identified using GEO2R online analysis. Go and KEGG databases were used for enrichment and functional annotation of DEGs. Protein interaction network was built based on the STRING database and Cytoscape software to analyze the key genes of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the survival curve of these key genes were analyzed using the GEPIA database. Results: A total of 74 hepatocellular carcinoma DEGs were screened, of which 3 and 71 were up-and-down-regulated genes. The results of GO enrichment analysis showed that the down-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in cell response to cadmium and zinc ions, negative growth regulation, heterologous metabolic processes and hormone-mediated signaling pathways. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis results showed that the down-regulated DEGs pathway were mainly involved in retinol metabolism, chemical carcinogenesis, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 metabolizing xenobiotics, tryptophan metabolism and caffeine metabolism. Protein interaction network had screened out 10 down-regulated core genes: MT1G, MT1F, MT1X, MT1E, MT1H, insulin-like growth factor 1, FOS, CXCL12, EGR1, and BGN. Among them, the insulin-like growth factor 1 was related to the prognosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: Bioinformatics analysis results of HCC chip data showed that 10 key genes may play a key role in the occurrence and development of HCC and the insulin like growth factor 1 is associated with the prognosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.","Zhou, Z W; Zhou, X G; Liu, Y C; Qiu, M Q; Wen, Q P; Zhou, Z H; Jiang, Y J; Feng, S X; Yu, H P",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,335,16

The sensitivity need not be as high as normally required by the FDA for screening asymptomatic carriers (as few as 10 virions per sample), as these viral loads are almost certainly not high enough for an individual to present a risk for forward infection. This allows tests specifically useful for this pandemic to trade-off unneeded sensitivity for necessary speed, simplicity, and frugality. In some studies, it was shown that viral load that creates forward-infection risk may exceed 105 virions per milliliter, easily within the sensitivity of an RNA amplification architecture, but unattainable by antibody-based architectures that simply target viral antigens. Here, we describe such a test based on a displaceable probe loop amplification architecture.","Yaren, O.; McCarter, J.; Nikhil, Phadke Bradley K.

In particular, regarding the humidity, the empirically least favorable conditions for the survival of viral pathogens are found at intermediate humidities. However, the precise physico-chemical mechanisms that generate such least-favorable conditions are not understood yet. In this work, we analyze the evaporation dynamics of respiratory-like droplets in air, semi-levitating them on superhydrophobic substrates with minimal solid-liquid contact area. Our results reveal that, compared to pure water droplets, the salt dissolved in the droplets can significantly change the evaporation behaviour, especially for high humidities close to and above the deliquesence limit. Due to the hygroscopic properties of salt, water evaporation is inhibited once the salt concentration reaches a critical value that depends on the relative humidity. The salt concentration in a stable droplet reaches its maximum at around 75% relative humidity, generating conditions that might shorten the time in which pathogens remain infectious.","Seyfert, Carola; Rodr'iguez-Rodr'iguez, Javier; Lohse, Detlef; Marin, Alvaro",,335,16

Hypercholesterolemia is among the main risk factors for developing cardiovascular events, and is highly prevalent in the Mexican population. The primary objective of the present work was to assess the effect of a dietary portfolio (DP) with functional foods containing dehydrated nopal, soy protein, chia seeds, inulin, and oats in LDL-C and TC concentrations of subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia. Also, we explored the changes in the profile of the lipoprotein subclasses measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). METHODS: Sixty-two subjects (47 women, 15 men) with mild hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C, &#8805;130 &#8804; 190 mg/dL, TC > 200 mg/dL) completed the randomized, parallel, controlled study. The dietary intervention was given in two stages. First, a dietary standardization stage with a low saturated fat diet (LSFD) which matched the habitual energy intake of the volunteers for 2-weeks, followed by 2.5 months of dietary intervention with a LSFD plus placebo (PL) or DP. RESULTS: Subjects who consumed the LSFD + DP interventions had a significantly higher reduction of LDL-C (-18.05%, P = 0.003) and TC (-17.08%, P = 0.02) compared to volunteers who consumed an LSFD for the same period. Furthermore, the lipoprotein subclass profiling showed that the small low-density-lipoproteins, and the small high-density-lipoproteins significantly decreased (P = 0.04, P < 0.001, respectively), conveying a less atherogenic state. At the end of the study, 78% of the subjects who consumed LSFD + DP reduced their LDL-C below 160 mg/dL, and of these, 47% reduced it below 130 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results obtained from this study, the inclusion of functional foods as part of the lifestyle modifications is recommended to treat mild hypercholesterolemia and reduce cardiovascular risk.

The severity of symptoms range from mild to critical disease involving multi-organ failure;however, many pregnant COVID-19 patients have mild symptoms. The understanding of COVID-19 is evolving and there is limited data about its effects in pregnancy. This case series features two pregnant patients with COVID-19 with a range of symptoms, including fever, non-productive cough, headache, and worsening dyspnea. Both patients had chest x-ray findings notable for lung opacities, and lymphopenia was a consistent abnormal laboratory finding. Both of the patients had hypoxia which was treated with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir with significant improvement in clinical symptoms and prolongation of pregnancy. © The Author(s) 2021.","Ogamba, I.; Chuang, L.; Panarelli, E.; Zilberman, D.",SAGE Open Medical Case Reports,335,1

Two logistic regression models were developed to predict DV case differences before and during the pandemic. DV reports (N = 4618) were collected from the Chicago Police Department. Cases from March 2019 and March 2020 were analyzed based on multiple variables. One model was set to predict case differences since the pandemic began, and another model was set to predict case differences during the shelter-in-place period later that month. Both models were significant with multiple significant predictors. During the pandemic period, cases with arrests were 20% less likely to have occurred, and cases at residential locations were 22% more likely to have occurred. During the shelter-in-place period, cases at residential locations were 64% more likely to have occurred, and cases with child victims were 67% less likely to have occurred. This study offers a rapid analysis of DV case differences since the pandemic and shelter-in-place began. Additional variables and data sources could improve model explanatory power. Research, policy, and practice in this area must pivot to focus on protecting children whose access to mandated reporters has decreased and moving victims out of dangerous living situations into safe spaces.","McLay, Molly M",J Fam Violence,335,11

Initiated in 2012, the PNAIC involved more than three hundred thousand literacy teachers, from more than five thousand cities for five years. This article uses a qualitative research approach, in the descriptive modality, showing a status of the art of these researches. The set of works analyzed was divided into three groups, according to their declared research objectives: Objective 1: To analyzeinvestigate the meanings brought by the literacy teachers about the PNAIC (75.5%);Objective 2: To analyze-investigate the meanings brought by the other participants about the PNAIC (7.5%);and Objective 3: Unveil the PNAIC (17%). The analysis of the researches results associated with these objectives allowed us to reach four conclusions: 1) The trainings promoted by PNAIC supported changes in the pedagogical practices of the literacy teachers;2) the trainings promoted by PNAIC were necessary, but they wer not enough to combat illiteracy;3) the trainings promoted by the PNAIC induced the literacy teachers to reflections about the pedagogical practices and 4) the trainings promoted by the PNAIC showed weaknesses. In summary, this article presents an initial analysis of the scope from the manifested studies in dissertations and theses and supports the realization of new studies in order to deepen the analysis and evaluation of the varied aspects of one of the broadest training programs ever implemented in Brazil.","Vianna, Carlos Roberto Godoy Elenilton Vieira Rolkouski Emerson",The Mathematics Enthusiast,335,16

Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis on the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection through RT-qPCR based on salivary specimens compared to conventional nasopharyngeal swabs. METHODS: We reported our meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and pre-print archive medRxiv.og for eligible studies published up to June 1st, 2020. Raw data included true/false positive and negative tests, and the total number of tests. Sensitivity and specificity data were calculated for every study, and then pooled in a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 measure. Reporting bias was assessed by means of funnel plots and regression analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review eventually retrieved 14 studies including a total of 15 estimates, the were included in quantitative synthesis. We found a pooled specificity of 97.7% (95%CI 93.8-99.2) and a pooled sensitivity of 83.4% (95%CI 73.1-90.4), with an overall agreement assessed by means of Cohen's kappa equals to 0.750, 95%CI 0.62-0.88 (i.e. moderate agreement), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, diagnostic tests based on salivary specimens are somewhat reliable, but relatively few studies have been carried out. Moreover, such studies are characterized by low numbers and low sample power. Therefore, the of salivary samples is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more conventional RT-qPCR based on nasopharyngeal swabs.","Riccò, Matteo; Ranzieri, Silvia; Peruzzi, Simona; Valente, Marina; Marchesi, Federico; Balzarini, Federica; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Signorelli, Carlo",Acta Biomed,335,26

We aimed to investigate the association between pre-existent physical inactivity and the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We included 164 (61.8 ± 13.6 years) patients with COVID-19 who were admitted between 15 February and 14 March 2020 in this retrospective study. We evaluated the association between pre-existent physical inactivity and severe COVID-19 using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of 164 eligible patients with COVID-19, 103 (62.8%) were reported to be physically inactive. Univariable logistic regression analysis showed that physical inactivity was associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 [unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88-22.62]. In the multivariable regression analysis, physical inactivity remained significantly associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR 4.12, 95% CI 1.12-15.14) after adjustment for age, sex, stroke, and overweight. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that pre-existent physical inactivity was associated with an increased risk of experiencing severe COVID-19.

To experimentally evaluate this within the human antibody repertoire, we perform immune challenges in transgenic mice that bear diverse human CDR3 and light chains but are constrained to different human VH-genes. We find that, of six commonly deployed VH sequences, only those CDRs encoded by IGHV1-2&#8727;02 enable polyclonal antibody responses against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) when introduced to the bloodstream. The LPS is from diverse strains of gram-negative bacteria, and the VH-gene-dependent responses are directed against the non-variable and universal saccrolipid substructure of this antigen. This reveals a broad-spectrum anti-LPS response in which germline-encoded CDRs naturally hardwire the human antibody repertoire for recognition of a conserved microbial target.","Sangesland, Maya; Yousif, Ashraf S; Ronsard, Larance; Kazer, Samuel W; Zhu, Alex Lee; Gatter, G James; Hayward, Matthew R; Barnes, Ralston M; Quirindongo-Crespo, Maricel; Rohrer, Daniel; Lonberg, Nils; Kwon, Douglas; Shalek, Alex K; Lingwood, Daniel",Cell Rep,335,2

We aimed to assess the performance of this modified EB mask and to test its use during different gas mixture supplies. CPAP set at 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O was delivered to 10 healthy volunteers with a high-flow system generator set at 40, 80, and 120 L min-1 and with a turbine-driven ventilator during both spontaneous and loaded (resistor) breathing. Inspiratory CO2 partial pressure (PiCO2), pressure inside the mask, breathing pattern and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were measured at all combinations of CPAP/flows delivered, with and without the resistor. Using the high-flow generator set at 40 L min-1, the PiCO2 significantly increased and the system was unable to maintain the target CPAP of 10 and 15 cmH2O and a stable pressure within the respiratory cycle; conversely, the turbine-driven ventilator did. EAdi significantly increased with flow rates of 40 and 80 L min-1 but not at 120 L min-1 and with the turbine-driven ventilator.

This study crawled seven-month messages from Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, and developed a hybrid approach integrating term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency, latent Dirichlet allocation, and sentiment classification. Results indicate that a rumor about the unfair treatment of elderly travelers triggered public concerns. Primary subjects of concern were the status quo of elderly travelers, the provision of transport services, and unfair event descriptions. Following the government's responses, people still had negative attitudes toward transport services, while they became more positive about the status quo of elderly travelers.

All the patients received antiviral treatment, either lopinavir/ritonavir or oseltamivir. The serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ranged between 0.24 and 15.24 mg/dL. Alanine aminotransaminase was normal in all the patients except for two, with levels 1.6 and 4.2 times above normal values. The INR increased in all the patients. One (10%) patient died in the hospital. No bleeding, ischemic, or thrombotic events occurred during the hospital stay and within the 4-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy in patients with COVID-19 with prosthetic heart valves might be an issue responsible for an uncontrolled INR. Liver injury may happen in a minority of patients. Bridging in these patients during the antiviral treatment might be required and because of significant INR fluctuations, it might be safer to prescribe antiviral treatment in an inpatient setting.","Omidi, Negar; Forouzannia, Seyed Khalil; Poorhosseini, Hamidreza; Tafti, Seyed Hossein Ahmadi; Salehbeigi, Shahrzad; Lotfi-Tokaldany, Masoumeh",J Card Surg,335,16

Here, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). RESULTS: A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95%CI 0.72-1.04; I2 = 75.52% and 1.87; 95%CI 1.25-2.49; I2 = 97.81%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.74 (95%CI 0.98-7.66). CONCLUSION: High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.","Simadibrata, Daniel Martin; Calvin, Julius; Wijaya, Alya Darin; Ibrahim, Naufal Arkan Abiyyu",Am J Emerg Med,335,14

During the study period, 234 patients were admitted for suicide behaviours (28% male; mean age 13.4 years). Using Poisson regression, we found a significant decrease in the incidence of admissions for suicide behaviour during the lockdown (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.46; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86). This association might result from reduced help-seeking and decreased hospital admission rates during the lockdown, as well as cognitive and environmental factors. Further multicentre studies should be conducted to confirm these findings and investigate whether a compensatory rise in admissions for suicide behaviour occurred in the postlockdown period.","Mourouvaye, Maymouna; Bottemanne, Hugo; Bonny, Guillaume; Fourcade, Lola; Angoulvant, Francois; Cohen, Jérémie F; Ouss, Lisa",Arch. dis. child,335,1

In this paper, a variant of physics-informed neural network (PINN) is adopted to identify the time-varying parameters of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model for the spread of COVID-19 by fitting daily reported cases. The learned parameters are verified by utilizing an ordinary differential equation solver to compute the corresponding solutions of this compartmental model. The effective reproduction number based on these parameters is calculated. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed to predict the future weekly time-varying parameters.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey among young adults with T1DM (aged 18-30 years) in the North, Central, South, and West zones of India. It consisted of fifteen, five and eight questions pertaining to knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19, respectively. Certain questions relevant to T1DM were also incorporated. RESULTS: After exclusion, 212 participants were included (mean age = 25.1 ± 4.3 years; M:F = 10:11). The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 83% (mean total knowledge score = 12.4 ± 1.9). Most (74%) had an average knowledge score (mean ± 1SD). Higher educational status, urban residence, and being married were associated with better knowledge scores; however, only urban residence was found to be statistically significant on multinomial logistic regression. Most (88%) felt that being a patient of T1DM, they were at higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19. At the same time, 98% were confident about self-protection. Fifty-one percent of respondents had left home amid lockdown mostly to procure insulin/injection needles/syringes/glucometer strips from the pharmacy. However, all were maintaining proper hand hygiene and majority were following routine dietary advice (95%) and administering prescribed insulin doses (99%). Seventy-two participants (34%) had experienced one or more episodes of hypoglycemia since the commencement of lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with T1DM have average knowledge, positive attitude, and healthy preventive practices towards COVID-19. Awareness campaigns targeted towards rural communities and providing doorstep delivery of insulin/needles/syringes may be more rewarding.","Pal, Rimesh; Yadav, Urmila; Grover, Sandeep; Saboo, Banshi; Verma, Anmol; Bhadada, Sanjay K",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,335,16

This study aims to gain insight into the course of functional and medical recovery of persons who receive geriatric rehabilitation (GR) following SARS-CoV-2 infection across Europe. Special attention will be paid to the recovery of activities of daily living (ADL) and to the GR services offered to these patients. DESIGN: A multi-center observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study will include several European countries (EuGMS member states) each providing at least 52 comparable routine datasets (core dataset) of persons recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 infection and receiving geriatric rehabilitation. The routine data will be anonymously collected in an online CASTOR database. The ethical regulations of each participating country will be followed. PRIMARY OUTCOME: ADL functioning. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: length of stay, discharge destination, hospital readmission and mortality. Other variables that will be collected are quality of life, treatment modalities, complications, cognition, frailty, mood/anxiety, BMI, nutrition and pain. All variables will be reported at admission and compared with follow-up scores (discharge, 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up). CONCLUSION: This study will explore the effect of geriatric rehabilitation on post-COVID-19 patients, especially on ADL recovery, and the variety of geriatric rehabilitation services across Europe. Information from this study may help improve recovery of older persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 and improve geriatric rehabilitation services in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Grund, S; Caljouw, M A A; Haaksma, M L; Gordon, A L; van Balen, R; Bauer, J M; Schols, J M G A; Achterberg, W P",J Nutr Health Aging,335,16

The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with the increased levels of mental health burden among a sample of undergraduate college students in Northern New Jersey, the region of the U.S. severely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: College students (N = 162) enrolled in an introductory core curriculum course completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 information, behavior changes, academic and everyday difficulties, and mental health measurements (depression, anxiety, somatization, and stress). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Descriptive findings indicate that students have a fundamental knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and common symptoms. Students tend to use and trust the official sources and have changed their behaviors in accordance with public health recommendations (i.e., increased hand washing, wearing mask). However, students reported a number of academic and everyday difficulties and high levels of mental health distress. High levels of depression were associated with difficulties in focusing on academic work and with employment losses, while higher levels of anxiety were more likely to be reported by students other than freshmen and those who spend more than one hour per day looking for information on COVID-19. Inability to focus on academic work and an elevated concern with COVID-19 were more likely to be associated with higher levels of somatization, while trusting news sources was associated with lower levels of somatization. Those with higher levels of perceived stress were more likely to be females, unable to focus on academic work, and report difficulties in obtaining medications and cleaning supplies. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is making a significant negative impact on mental health of college students. Proactive efforts to support the mental health and well-being of students are needed.","Kecojevic, Aleksandar; Basch, Corey H; Sullivan, Marianne; Davi, Nicole K",PLoS One,335,1

All hospitalized patients with confirmed and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between 16 March 2020, and 30 April 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. COVID-19 patients were separated into two groups as pneumonia and non-pneumonia and compared to determine predicting factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.20 and not correlated with each other were included in the logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 247 patients included in the study, the median age was 40, 58% was female. COVID-19 was confirmed in 70.9% of these patients. 21.4% of COVID-19 confirmed cases had pneumonia. In the multivariate analysis male sex (p = 0.028), hypertension (p = 0.022) and shortness of breath on hospital admission (p = 0.025) were significant factors predicting COVID-19 pneumonia Conclusion: Shortness of breath, male gender, and hypertension were significant for predicting COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.

The actual coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation, especially in regions that are less affected, has not yet been determined. This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in a frontline hospital in Tokyo, Japan. In this cross-sectional observational study, screening was performed on consented HCWs, including medical, nursing, and other workers, as part of a mandatory health checkup. The screening test results and clinical characteristics of the participants were recorded. The antibody seroprevalence rate among the 4147 participants screened between July 6 and August 21, 2020, was 0.34% (14/4147). There was no significant difference in the seroprevalence rate between frontline HCWs with a high exposure risk and HCWs working in other settings with a low exposure risk. Of those seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, 64% (9/14) were not aware of any symptoms and had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the extent of infection and immune status in HCWs in Japan, which has a relatively low prevalence of COVID-19.

Drug sensitivity of seven non-classical Pt-based compounds as well as cisplatin were determined by CCK-8 assay. Comparison of cytotoxic effects between 56MESS, phenanthriplatin and cisplatin was performed on six different OC cell lines. The anticancer effects of 56MESS was further measured both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the biological role of FACL4 and its relationship with 56MESS-induced growth inhibition were investigated. Two out of seven Pt-based compounds displayed a significant cytotoxic effect. 56MESS was chosen as the most potent compound due to its highly selective cytotoxic activity. 56MESS particularly caused G2/M phase arrest, while failed to induce apoptosis. In vivo, 56MESS had a higher cytotoxic capacity than cisplatin. Overexpression of FACL4 rescued 56MESS-induced growth inhibition in OC cells.

While a higher severity of these patients could be expected from the addition of both respiratory and neurological injury, COVID-19 patients with strokes can present with mild or none respiratory symptoms. We aimed to compare anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes severity between patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a comparative cohort study between patients with COVID-19 who had anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and early brain imaging within 3 hours from onset, in our institution during the 6 first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak and a control group admitted during the same calendar period in 2019. RESULTS: Twelve COVID-19 patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and early brain imaging were included during the study period and compared with 34 control patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and early brain imaging in 2019. Patients in the COVID-19 group were younger (P=0.032) and had a history of diabetes mellitus more frequently (P=0.039). Patients did not significantly differ on initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale nor time from onset to imaging (P=0.18 and P=0.6, respectively). Patients with COVID-19 had more severe strokes than patients without COVID-19, with a significantly lower clot burden score (median: 6.5 versus 8, P=0.016), higher rate of multivessel occlusion (50% versus 8.8%, P=0.005), lower DWI-ASPECTS (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores; median: 5 versus 8, P=0.006), and higher infarct core volume (median: 58 versus 6 mL, P=0.004). Successful recanalization rate was similar in both groups (P=0.767). In-hospital mortality was higher in the COVID-19 patients' group (41.7% versus 11.8%, P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Early brain imaging showed higher severity large vessel occlusion strokes in patients with COVID-19. Given the massive number of infected patients, concerns should be raised about the coming neurovascular impact of the pandemic worldwide.","Escalard, Simon; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Escalard, Clément; Redjem, Hocine; Delvoye, François; Hébert, Solène; Smajda, Stanislas; Ciccio, Gabriele; Desilles, Jean-Philippe; Mazighi, Mikael; Blanc, Raphael; Maïer, Benjamin; Piotin, Michel",Stroke,335,20

As a diabetes care center specialized in technology, we developed a virtual training program for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who were upgrading to hybrid closed loop (HCL) system. The aim of this study is to describe the efficacy and safety outcomes of the virtual training program. METHOD: ology: A prospective observational cohort study was performed, including patients with diagnosis of T1D previously treated with multiple doses of insulin (MDI) or sensor augmented pump therapy (SAP) who were updating to HCL system, from March to July 2020. Virtual training and follow-up were done through the Zoom video conferencing application and Medtronic Carelink System version 3.1 software. CGM data were analyzed to compare the time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR) and glycemic variability, during the first two weeks corresponding to manual mode with the final two weeks of follow-up in automatic mode. RESULTS: 91 patients were included. Mean TIR achieved with manual mode was 77.3 ± 11.3, increasing to 81.6% ± 7.6 (p < 0.001) after two weeks of auto mode use. A significant reduction in TBR <70 mg/dL (2,7% ± 2,28 vs 1,83% ± 1,67, p < 0,001) and in glycemic variability (% coefficient of variation 32.4 vs 29.7, p < 0.001) was evident, independently of baseline therapy. CONCLUSION: HCL systems allows T1D patients to improve TIR, TBR and glycemic variability independently of previous treatment. Virtual training can be used during situations that limit the access of patients to follow-up centers.","Gómez, Ana M; Henao, Diana; Parra, Darío; Kerguelen, Alfonso; Pinilla, Marisol Vergara; Muñoz, Oscar Mauricio; Rondón, Martin",Diabetes Metab Syndr,335,16

The number of deaths reached 12 784, with estimated case-fatality rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.7%. Children population seems to be the least affected by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with comorbidities. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed. Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Abduljalil, J.

Although less common than upper respiratory symptoms, thrombotic complications are not infrequent and may result in severe and long-term sequelae. Common thrombotic complications include pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, or venous thromboembolism; less commonly seen are acute myocardial injury, renal artery thrombosis, and mesenteric ischemia. Several case reports and case series have described acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 characterized by elevations in serum biomarkers. CASE REPORT: Here, we report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with acute coronary syndrome confirmed on catheter angiography and cardiac MRI. This patient was found to additionally have a left ventricular thrombus and ultimately suffered an acute cerebral infarction. Recognition of thrombotic complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection is essential for initiating appropriate therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In acute myocardial injury, given the different treatment strategies for myocarditis versus acute myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery thrombus, imaging can play a key role in clinical decision making for patients.","Capaccione, Kathleen M; Leb, Jay S; D039,; souza, Belinda; Utukuri, Pallavi; Salvatore, Mary M",Clin Imaging,335,1

These catabolic pathways have been known to be involved in respiratory exacerbations and the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Briefly, proteostasis and autophagy processes are known to decline over time with age, cigarette or biomass smoke exposure, and/or influenced by underlying genetic factors, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and cellular debris, elevating apoptosis and cellular senescence, and initiating the pathogenesis of acute or chronic lung disease. Moreover, autophagic dysfunction results in an impaired microbial clearance, post-bacterial and/or viral infection(s) which contribute to the initiation of acute and recurrent respiratory exacerbations as well as the progression of chronic obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. In addition, the autophagic dysfunction-mediated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) immune response impairment further exacerbates the lung disease. Recent studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of novel autophagy augmentation strategies, in alleviating the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive or restrictive lung diseases and exacerbations such as those commonly seen in COPD, CF, ALI/ARDS and COVID-19.","Pehote, Garrett; Vij, Neeraj",,335,21

In November/December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, a SARS-like viral disease with a high adhesive capacity and the potential to endanger the life of the patient was reported. It soon became clear that the disease was very contagious and new hospitals were being built on the site and a General closure was underway. Many doctors from all over China were recruited and sent to the isolated area. Local medical reports were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like, and patients needed respiratory support for oxygenation and some needed ventilation on respiratory devices with significant mortality rates. The disease has since spread to many parts of the world, mainly towards Europe. Hospitals have received hundreds of patients, to the point of partially collapsing the glorious Italian healthcare system. Italy and Spain reported a lung disease that causes severe oxidative disruption but no disruption in ventilation unlike ARDS. Initial post-mortem shows that the main cause of death is thromboembolic. Heart involvement with myocarditis and even heart attacks are beginning to be reported. Various drugs are involved in the treatment plan and are often known to fail. Even promising remedies such as Remdesavir, which is an antiviral drug, are beginning to receive reports from controlled trials, which are not as successful as originally expected. All in all, we continue to wander in the dark, both about the disease and certainly, regarding the treatment. The primary treatment involves maximum efforts for respiratory, hematologic, nephrologic and cardiologic support. In this review, I will try to describe the disease and the enigma concerning suggested treatments.","Levinger, Uriel",Harefuah,335,24

Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between the rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. Insight into different rates of decline infection numbers following the wave peak was also possible which could be a useful tool to guide the reopening of societies. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large-scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","Wu, Dan; Mac Aonghusa, Pól; O039,; Shea, Donal F",PLoS One,335,1

The problem of precarious employment, the scope of which is steadily expanding in different countries of the world, is discussed. The purpose of this paper is to determine the content of precarious employment, identity problems and approaches to their psychological study. The review actively uses interdisciplinary knowledge. Findings. Multidimensional interpretations of precarious employment are analyzed, which include not only the type of employment (non-standard), but also the conditions of employment and its subjective components. The main subject area is considered: the influence of precarious employment on the health and psychological well-being of a person. The transition from the study of precarious employment to the study of careers in conditions of precarious employment is recorded, the concepts of ""career complexity"", ""discontinuous occupational trajectory"", ""employment strain"" are revealed. The necessity of analyzing the social contexts of precarious employment is justified. Conclusions. The analysis of the literature made it possible to identify the directions of the evolution of ideas about precarious employment and ways of studying it. It is necessary to develop a definition and concept of precarious employment which more fully presents its psychological components. The progress in this direction will allow taking into account the interaction between manifest and latent precarity in the development of complex psychodiagnostic tools. It is concluded that it is necessary to study the psychological prerequisites and mechanisms of adaptation to unstable forms of employment. The value of the results. In Russian science, the psychology of precarious employment is clearly insufficiently studied. The review will contribute to the development of organizational psychology and labor market psychology, as well as increase the importance of psychological research on employment in Russia, especially in the context of the global threat of COVID-19, which is rapidly transforming labor relations.","Diomin, A.",Organizatsionnaya Psikologiya,335,32

A life-saving vaccine is available, but sensitivity to vaccines is generally lower in dialysis patients. Little is yet known about antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination in this vulnerable group. Design, setting, participants, and measurements In this prospective single-center study, we included 22 dialysis patients and 46 healthy controls from Heidelberg University Hospital between December 2020 and February 2021. We measured anti-S1 IgG with a threshold index for detection >1, neutralizing antibodies with a threshold for viral neutralization of &#8805;30% and antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 fragments 17-22 days after the first and 18-22 days after the second dose of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Results After the first vaccine dose, 4/22 (18%) dialysis patients compared with 43/46 (93%) healthy controls developed positive anti-S1 IgG, with a median (IQR) anti-S1 IgG index of 0.2 (0.1-0.7) compared with 9 (4-16), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies exceeded the threshold for neutralization in 4/22 (18%) dialysis patients compared with 43/46 (93%) in healthy controls, with a median (IQR) percent inhibition of 11 (3-24) compared with 65 (49-75), respectively. After the second dose, 14/17 (82%) of dialysis patients developed neutralizing antibodies exceeding the threshold for viral neutralization and antibodies against the receptor-binding S1-domain of the spike protein, compared to 46/46 (100%) of healthy controls, respectively. The median (IQR) percent inhibition was 51 (32-86) compared to 98 (97-98) in healthy controls.

Certain guidelines issued by National Health Commission of the People's Repubilic of China recommend intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of IVIG. METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 in the Respiratory and Critical Care Unit of Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, China. Patient information, including demographic data, laboratory indicators, the use of glucocorticoids and IVIG, hospital mortality, the application of mechanical ventilation, and the length of hospital stay was collected. The primary outcome was the composite end point, including death and the use of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 285 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 113 severely ill patients were included in this study. Compared to the non-IVIG group, more patients in the IVIG group reached the composite end point [12 (25.5%) vs 5 (7.6%), P = 0.008] and had longer hospital stay periods [23.0 (19.0-31.0) vs 16.0 (13.8-22.0), P < 0.001]. After adjusting for confounding factors, differences in primary outcomes between the two groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.167), however, patients in the IVIG group had longer hospital stay periods (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with IVIG did not improve in-hospital mortality rates or the need for mechanical ventilation in severe COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups according to a random number table: control group, model group, high-, medium- and low-dose BXD groups (9.2, 4.6 and 1.8 g/(kg·d), respectively), and domperidone group (10 mg/(kg·d)), 10 rats per group. DGP model was established initially by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and was confirmed by recording gastric emptying, intestinal transport velocity and gastric myoelectric activity of rats after 2 months. Each group was treated with a corresponding drug for 4 weeks. The mRNA and protein expressions of phospholipase C (PLC), inositol triphosphate (IP3), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) dependent protein kinase G (PKG) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively, while nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP expressions were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric tissues were obtained from rats for primary cell culture preparation. Gastric SM cells were treated with 0.8 µmol/L of STZ or STZ plus 1,000, 500 and 200 µg/mL of BXD or STZ plus 2.5 µmol/mL of domperidone for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h, respectively. The length of gastric SM cells and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) before and after BXD treatment was measured. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone significantly increased the expressions of PLC, IP3, NO, nNOS, cGMP and PKG in rat's gastric tissue (P<0.01). Gastric SM cells treated with BXD showed a time- and dose-dependent increase in cell viability (P<0.01). The treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone inhibited the increase in gastric SM cells length and increased [Ca2+]i compared with the model cells (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD significantly attenuated STZ-induced experimental DGP in rats.

METHODS: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 21 to 30, 2020 among clients seeking service in Dessie town health facilities. A total of 81 clients were included from the selected health facilities with simple random sampling technique. We developed measuring tools by adopting from World Health Organization and center for disease prevention recommendation manual for assessing service providers' knowledge and preventive practices. For data entry Epi-data 3.1 version was employed and further data management and analysis was performed using STATA Version 14. Student T-test and one way ANOVA were computed to see the mean difference in knowledge and practice between and among the group. Chi-square test was also done to portray the presence of association between different co-variants with client's knowledge and preventive practices. RESULTS: Findings of the study showed that more than half (56.8%) of the participants had good knowledge about its symptoms, way of spread and prevention of the virus. Furthermore, 65.4% of clients demonstrated five or more preventive practice measures of COVID-19. The mean preventive practice score with standard deviation was (4.75±1.28 from 6 components). In the current study, knowledge had no significant difference among sex, education status, and monthly income. However, COVID-19 transmission knowledge was significantly higher among urban residents. Thus, clients who were knowledgeable about way of transmission and symptoms of COVID-19 had significantly higher COVID-19 preventive practice. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that clients' knowledge and preventive practice of COVID-19 were not optimal. Clients with good knowledge and urban residents had practiced better prevention measures of the pandemic, signifying that packages and programs directed in enhancing knowledge about the virus is useful in combating the pandemic and continuing safe practices.","Dewau, Reta; Mekonnen, Tefera Chane; Tadesse, Sisay Eshete; Muche, Amare; Bogale, Getahun Gebre; Tadesse Amsalu, Erkihun",PLoS One,335,16

We aimed to assess if 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25OHD) levels are associated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels and with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively studied 103 in-patients admitted to a Northern-Italian hospital (age 66.1 ± 14.1 years, 70 males) for severely-symptomatic COVID-19. Fifty-two subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection but mild COVID-19 symptoms (mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients) and 206 subjects without SARS-CoV-2 infection were controls. We measured 25OHD and IL-6 levels at admission and focused on respiratory outcome during hospitalization. RESULTS: Severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients had lower 25OHD levels (18.2 ± 11.4 ng/mL) than mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected controls (30.3 ± 8.5 ng/mL and 25.4 ± 9.4 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). 25OHD and IL-6 levels were respectively lower and higher in severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care Unit [(ICU), 14.4 ± 8.6 ng/mL and 43.0 (19.0-56.0) pg/mL, respectively], than in those not requiring ICU admission [22.4 ± 1.4 ng/mL, p = 0.0001 and 16.0 (8.0-32.0) pg/mL, p = 0.0002, respectively]. Similar differences were found when comparing COVID-19 patients who died in hospital [13.2 ± 6.4 ng/mL and 45.0 (28.0-99.0) pg/mL] with survivors [19.3 ± 12.0 ng/mL, p = 0.035 and 21.0 (10.5-45.9) pg/mL, p = 0.018, respectively). 25OHD levels inversely correlated with: i) IL-6 levels (&#961; - 0.284, p = 0.004); ii) the subsequent need of the ICU admission [relative risk, RR 0.99, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.98-1.00, p = 0.011] regardless of age, gender, presence of at least 1 comorbidity among obesity, diabetes, arterial hypertension, creatinine, IL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase levels, neutrophil cells, lymphocytes and platelets count; iii) mortality (RR 0.97, 95%CI, 0.95-0.99, p = 0.011) regardless of age, gender, presence of diabetes, IL-6 and C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels, neutrophil cells, lymphocytes and platelets count. CONCLUSION: In our COVID-19 patients, low 25OHD levels were inversely correlated with high IL-6 levels and were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality.","Campi, Irene; Gennari, Luigi; Merlotti, Daniela; Mingiano, Christian; Frosali, Alessandro; Giovanelli, Luca; Torlasco, Camilla; Pengo, Martino F; Heilbron, Francesca; Soranna, Davide; Zambon, Antonella; Di Stefano, Marta; Aresta, Carmen; Bonomi, Marco; Cangiano, Biagio; Favero, Vittoria; Fatti, Letizia; Perego, Giovanni Battista; Chiodini, Iacopo; Parati, Gianfranco; Persani, Luca",BMC Infect Dis,335,25

Here we quantitatively evaluate use and potential of modern information and communication technology (ICT) in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. We conducted a structured, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study that was addressed to patients after kidney, liver, pancreas, or combined transplantation. We focused on: sociodemographic data, present use of digital technologies in daily life and for health reasons, patients' eHealth literacy, and their overall attitude towards eHealth. A total of 234 patients completed the questionnaire. Most of the patients (90%) have a web-enabled computer, 78.2% have a smartphone, and 71.8% regularly search the internet for health-related information. Sixty-eight percent would like to receive discharge summaries online, and 54% would like to chat online with their physicians. Even though ICT use in daily life was age-related, no significant difference could be shown for health reasons or the type of transplanted organ. Modern ICT use is predominantly accepted for health reasons by SOT recipients. Regardless of the transplanted organ, a deeper integration of eHealth has potential for improving cross-sectoral care. To successfully implement eHealth technologies in cross-sectoral care future research should include online physician-patient communication, data security, data safety, and the aspects of quality and safety of care.","Holderried, Martin; Hoeper, Ansgar; Holderried, Friederike; Heyne, Nils; Nadalin, Silvio; Unger, Oliver; Ernst, Christian; Guthoff, Martina",Sci Rep,335,8

Unfortunately, food waste has become an even bigger problem in many countries because of supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and African Swine Fever epidemic. Although Japan and South Korea have been leaders in recycling food waste into animal feed, countries that produce much greater amounts of food waste, such as the United States and the European Union, have lagged far behind. Concerns about the risk of transmission of bacteria, prions, parasites, and viruses have been the main obstacles limiting the recycling of food waste streams containing animal-derived tissues into animal feed and have led to government regulations restricting this practice in the U.S. and EU. However, adequate thermal processing is effective for inactivating all biological agents of concern, perhaps except for prions from infected ruminant tissues. The tremendous opportunity for nitrogen and phosphorus resource recovery along with several other environmental benefits from recycling food waste streams and rendered animal by-products into animal feed have not been fully appreciated for their substantial contribution toward solving our climate crisis. It is time to revisit our global approach to improving economic and environmental sustainability by more efficiently utilizing the abundant supply of food waste and animal tissues to a greater extent in animal feed while protecting human and animal health in food animal production systems.","Shurson, G.

As part of passive immunotherapy, it focuses on various blood derivatives. These include coronavirus neutralising antibodies extracted from different sources to be administered as a pure hyper concentrate intramuscularly or for upgrading and standardising the specific potency of high affinity antibodies. These processes are intended to compose standardised pooled bioproducts of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant that are pathogen inactivated for additional safety by well-established UV technologies. For the best practice of optimising plasma exchange, hyper concentrate NAb should be added to the cryosupernatant, which contains some of the active principles of corona convalescent plasma. The cryosupernatant apart from the high molecular weight viscous part of cold insoluble proteins that are removed, is equivalent to CCP, but makes it safer for general application. Such a bioproduct is often used routinely for substitution therapy of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. Alternative resources of large-scale specific coronavirus antibodies warrant further exploration such as cadaveric donations. The early uses of therapeutic plasma exchange and low molecular weight heparin, for any clinical trial in development is warranted, in order to interdict the intense inflammatory/kinin driven cascade. Because coronavirus positive patients are highly prone to thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis is necessary, even some time after recovery guided by the laboratory data.","Putter, Jeffrey S; Seghatchian, Jerard",Transfus Apher Sci,335,1

This paper suggests that entrepreneurship is also inextricably linked to a fundamental value common among the western developed economies, democracy. Three distinct contexts are examined to link democracy to entrepreneurship, two historical and one contemporary. The first is National Socialism in Germany, which emerged by suppressing both entrepreneurship and democracy. The second is the rise of the Trusts, or dominant large corporations and concomitant decline of small business in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. Finally, both measurement and perception suggest a decline in democracy as well as entrepreneurship in the contemporary era. These concerns are only exacerbated in the current Covid-19 crisis. The paper concludes that an important policy mandate for entrepreneurship may be to ensure the independent, decentralized and autonomous decision-making serving as a cornerstone of democracy.","Audretsch, David B.; Moog, Petra",Entrep.

Lysis is mediated by the small membrane bound toxin &#934;X174-E which is composed of a transmembrane domain and a soluble domain. The toxin requires activation by the bacterial chaperone SlyD and inhibits the cell wall precursor forming enzyme MraY. Bacterial cell wall biosynthesis is an important target for antibiotics, therefore knowledge of molecular details in the &#934;X174-E lysis pathway could help to identify new mechanisms and sites of action. In this study, cell-free expression and nanoparticle technology were combined to avoid toxic effects upon &#934;X174-E synthesis, resulting in the efficient production of a functional full-length toxin and engineered derivatives. Pre-assembled nanodiscs were used to study &#934;X174-E function in defined lipid environments and to analyze its membrane insertion mechanisms. The conformation of the soluble domain of &#934;X174-E was identified as a central trigger for membrane insertion, as well as for the oligomeric assembly of the toxin. Stable complex formation of the soluble domain with SlyD is essential to keep nascent &#934;X174-E in a conformation competent for membrane insertion. Once inserted into the membrane, &#934;X174-E assembles into high-order complexes via its transmembrane domain and oligomerization depends on the presence of an essential proline residue at position 21. The data presented here support a model where an initial contact of the nascent &#934;X174-E transmembrane domain with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain of SlyD is essential to allow a subsequent stable interaction of SlyD with the &#934;X174-E soluble domain for the generation of a membrane insertion competent toxin.","Mezhyrova, Julija; Martin, Janosch; Peetz, Oliver; Dötsch, Volker; Morgner, Nina; Ma, Yi; Bernhard, Frank",FEBS j,335,28

METHODS: We use time series analysis with the data from death cause surveillance database of Suzhou from January 2017 to December 2019 to estimate the expected deaths from January to June 2020 and compare these expected deaths with the reported numbers of deaths. RESULTS: After the implementation of epidemic prevention measures in Suzhou in the first 3 months, overall number of all-cause deaths declined for 5.36, 7.54 and 7.02% compared with predicted numbers. The number of deaths from respiratory causes and traffic accidents declined shapely by 30.1 and 26.9%, totally. When quarantine measures were released (April-June), however, the observed numbers of total deaths exceeded the predicted deaths. People aged over 70 accounted for 91.6% of declined death number in respiratory causes and people aged over 60 accounted for 68.0% of declined death number in traffic accidents. Women over the age of 80 benefited the most from respiratory prevention (accounts for 41% of all reductions), whereas women aged over 60 benefited the most from traffic control (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the whole population benefited from the epidemic prevention measures especially elderly females. This study is a useful supplement to encourage the government to develop regular preventive measures under the era of normalized epidemic.","Shen, Junjie; Wang, Congju; Dong, Chen; Tang, Zaixiang; Sun, Hongpeng",J. public health (Oxf),335,21

The Plumber architecture comprises 33 reusable components for various KG information extraction subtasks, such as coreference resolution, entity linking, and relation extraction. Using these components,Plumber dynamically generates suitable information extraction pipelines and offers overall 264 distinct pipelines.We study the optimization problem of choosing suitable pipelines based on input sentences. To do so, we train a transformer-based classification model that extracts contextual embeddings from the input and finds an appropriate pipeline. We study the efficacy of Plumber for extracting the KG triples using standard datasets over two KGs: DBpedia, and Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Plumber in dynamically generating KG information extraction pipelines,outperforming all baselines agnostics of the underlying KG.

ACE2 plays a key role in the biosynthesis of angiotensin (1-7), catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin 2 into angiotensin (1-7) and the reaction of angiotensin synthesis (1-9), from which angiotensin is (1-7) produced under the influence of ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme). Angiotensin 2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and atherogenic molecule converted by ACE2 to reducing inflammation and vasodilating in action angiotensin (1-7). Angiotensin (1-9), that is a product of angiotensin 1 metabolism and precursor of angiotensin (1-7), also exerts cell protective properties. Balance between angiotensin 2 and angiotensin (1-7) regulates blood pressure and ACE2 plays a critical role in this balance. ACE2, unlike ACE, is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors at the doses used in humans during the treatment of arterial hypertension. Membrane ACE2 is one of the receptors that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. ACE2 after SARS-CoV-2 binding is internalized and degraded. Hence ACE2 activity on the cell surface is reduced leading to increase the concentration of angiotensin 2 and decrease the concentration of angiotensin (1-7). Disturbed angiotensins metabolism, changes in ratio between angiotensins with distinct biological activities leading to domination of atherogenic angiotensin 2 can increase the damage to the lungs.","Dettlaff-Pokora, Agnieszka; Swierczynski, Julian",Int. j. mol. sci.

A telegenetics platform is critical for those with limitations or vulnerabilities compromising their ability to attend clinic in-person, including individuals in rural areas. As the demand for remote genetics services increases, and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with social distancing practices in place, we conducted a literature review to examine the benefits and limitations of telegenetics and explore the views of patients and health professionals utilizing telegenetics. Searches of the PubMed database identified 21 relevant primary studies for inclusion. The majority of studies found acceptability of telegenetics to be high among patients and health professionals and that telegenetics provided access to genetics services for underserved communities. The main benefits cited include cost-effectiveness and reduction in travel time for genetics services providing outreach clinics and patients who would otherwise travel long distances to access genetics. Patients appreciated the convenience of telegenetics including the reduced wait times, although a minority of patients reported their psychosocial needs were not adequately met. Eight studies compared outcomes between telegenetics and in-person services; findings suggested when comparing telegenetics patients to their in-person counterparts, telegenetics patients had a similar level of knowledge and understanding of genetics and similar psychological outcomes. Some studies reported challenges related to establishing rapport and reading and responding to verbal cues via telegenetics, while technical issues were not generally found to be a major limitation. Some service adaptations, for example, counseling strategies, may be required to successfully deliver telegenetics. Further research may be necessary to gather and examine data on how telegenetics outcomes compare to that of in-person genetic counseling and adapt services accordingly.","Gorrie, Anita; Gold, Judy; Cameron, Carolyn; Krause, Molly; Kincaid, Helen",J. genet. couns,335,33

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Children are recruited prior to URTI or within 48 hours of developing URTI symptoms by advertising in areas such as local schools/nurseries, health centres/hospitals, recreational facilities, public events, workplaces, local/social media. Willing parents/guardians, of children <7 years of age will be asked to contact the research team at their local site. Children will be randomised to either a control arm (standard symptomatic care), or intervention arm (three drops/nostril of HS, at least four times a day, until 24 hours after asymptomatic or a maximum of 28 days). All participants are requested to provide a nasal swab at the start of the study (intervention arm: before HS drops) and then daily for four more days. Parent/guardian complete a validated daily diary, an end of illness diary, a satisfaction questionnaire and a wheeze questionnaire (day 28). The parent/guardian of a child in the intervention arm is taught to prepare HS nose drops. Parent/guardian of children asymptomatic at recruitment are requested to inform the research team within 48 hours of their child developing an URTI and follow the instructions already provided. The day 28 questionnaire determines if the child experienced a wheeze following illness. Participation in the study ends on day 28.

Training curricula in CM and ID must constantly evolve to prepare trainees for future pandemics and to allow trainees to reach their full clinical and academic potential. OBJECTIVES: In this narrative review, we aim to outline necessary future adaptations in CM and ID training curricula and identify current structural barriers in training with the aim of discussing possibilities to address these shortcomings. SOURCES: We reviewed literature from PubMed and included selected books and online publications as appropriate. There was no time constraint on the included publications. CONTENT: Drawing from the lessons learnt during the pandemic, we summarize novel digital technologies relevant to CM and ID trainees and highlight interdisciplinary teamwork and networking skills as important competencies. We centre CM and ID training within the One Health framework and discuss gender inequalities and structural racism as barriers in both CM and ID training and patient care. IMPLICATIONS: CM and ID trainees should receive training and support developing skills in novel digital technologies, leadership, interdisciplinary teamwork and networking. Equally important is the need for equity of opportunity, with firm commitments to end gender inequality and structural racism in CM and ID. Policy-makers and CM and ID societies should ensure that trainees are better equipped to achieve their professional goals and are better prepared for the challenges awaiting in their fields.","Last, Katharina; Power, Nicholas R; Dellière, Sarah; Velikov, Petar; Sterbenc, Anja; Antunovic, Ivana Antal; Lopes, Maria João; Schweitzer, Valentijn; Barac, Aleksandra",Clin. microbiol. infect,335,31

Here, we introduce techniques from the Multi-Agent System (MAS) domain in order to account for individual level characterization of societal dynamics for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We hypothesize that a MAS model which considers rich spatial demographics, hourly mobility data and daily contagion information from the metropolitan area of Toronto can explain significant emerging behavior. To investigate this hypothesis we designed, with our modeling framework of choice, GAMA, an accurate environment which can be tuned to reproduce mobility and healthcare data, in our case coming from TomTom's API and Toronto's Open Data. We observed that some interesting contagion phenomena are directly influenced by mobility restrictions and curfew policies. We conclude that while our model is able to reproduce non-trivial emerging properties, large-scale simulation are needed to further investigate the role of different parameters. Finally, providing such an end-to-end model can be critical for policy-makers to compare their outcomes with past strategies in order to devise better plans for future measures.","Azeglio, Simone; Fordiani, Matteo",,335,20

An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for disease treatment and control of the disease spread. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated a low sensibility; therefore chest computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role not only in the early detection and diagnosis, especially for false negative RT-PCR tests, but also in monitoring the clinical course and in evaluating the disease severity. This paper reports the CT findings with some hints on the temporal changes over the course of the disease: the CT hallmarks of COVID-19 are bilateral distribution of ground glass opacities with or without consolidation in the posterior and peripheral lung, but the predominant findings in later phases include consolidations, linear opacities, ""crazy-paving"" pattern, ""reversed halo"" sign and vascular enlargement. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of other diseases, in particular the viral pneumonia including influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, etc. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The aim of this article is to review the typical and atypical CT findings in COVID-19 patients in order to help radiologists and clinicians to become more familiar with the disease.","Carotti, Marina; Salaffi, Fausto; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo; Agostini, Andrea; Borgheresi, Alessandra; Minorati, Davide; Galli, Massimo; Marotto, Daniela; Giovagnoni, Andrea",Radiol Med,335,16

In 2016 there were over 1 million deaths in >70 year olds due to lower respiratory tract infections; 13-31% of these have been reported to be caused by viruses. Since then, there has been a global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused over 2.3 million deaths so far; increased age has been shown to be the biggest risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Thus, the burden of respiratory viral infections in the elderly is becoming an increasing unmet clinical need. Particular challenges are faced due to the interplay of a variety of factors including complex multimorbidities, decreased physiological reserve and an aging immune system. Moreover, their atypical presentation of symptoms may lead to delayed necessary care, prescription of additional drugs and prolonged hospital stay. This leads to morbidity and mortality and further nosocomial spread. Clinicians currently have limited access to sensitive detection methods. Furthermore, a lack of effective antiviral treatments means there is little incentive to diagnose and record specific non-COVID-19 viral infections. To meet this unmet clinical need, it is first essential to fully understand the burden of respiratory viruses in the elderly. Doing this through prospective screening research studies for all respiratory viruses will help guide preventative policies and clinical trials for emerging therapeutics. The implementation of multiplex point-of-care diagnostics as a mainstay in all healthcare settings will be essential to understand the burden of respiratory viruses, diagnose patients and monitor outbreaks. The further development of novel targeted vaccinations as well as anti-viral therapeutics and new ways to augment the aging immune system is now also essential.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Watson, Alastair; Wilkinson, Tom M A",Ther Adv Respir Dis,335,2

Methods quantifying fibrosis severity in lung histopathology samples are semi-quantitative, subjective, and analyze only portions of sections. We sought to determine whether automated computerized imaging analysis shown to continuously measure fibrosis in mice could be applied in human samples to quantify pulmonary fibrosis severity and immunostained cells in whole tissue sections. METHODS: Digital images of entire tissue sections from lung explants or biopsies from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome pulmonary fibrosis (HPSPF) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) stained with picrosirius red and alcian blue or immunostained with anti-CD68 antibody were analyzed using a dedicated software program to quantify fibrosis, collagen, and macrophage content. Automated fibrosis quantification was compared to pulmonary function measurements or Ashcroft score. RESULTS: Automated quantification of pulmonary tissue density and fibrosis scores of HPSPF lung explants (n=3) was significantly higher than that of IPF lung explants (n=3) or biopsies (n=4). These values were also significantly higher in IPF lung explants than in IPF biopsies. Mean Ashcroft score in HPSPF or IPF explants was significantly higher than that of IPF biopsies. In contrast to automated quantification, Ashcroft scores of HPSPF and IPF explants did not differ significantly from each other. Automated tissue density and fibrosis scores correlated with lung function values and Ashcroft scores. Automated quantification of collagen content was similar in the three groups. Immune cell aggregates were identified in hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue;automated quantification of CD68 immunolabeled cells was significantly higher in HPSPF explants than in IPF biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of pulmonary fibrosis in stained human tissue can be automatically quantified in entire lung sections using a dedicated software program. This reader-independent method provides a more accurate assessment of pulmonary fibrosis than Ashcroft scores. Automated quantification of fibrosis, collagen content, and immunostained cells in fibrotic lung tissue sections can be performed simultaneously. Robust automated digital image analysis of human lung samples enhances the available tools to quantify and study pulmonary fibrosis and has potential application in preclinical studies and clinical investigations focusing on fibrotic lung disease and other diffuse pulmonary diseases, such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pneumoconiosis, or COVID-19.","Gochuico, B.

433261,433261,433261,Measuring the Impact of COVID-19 on Hematology-Oncology Trainees: A Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment,17.033558,5.1545973,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019. At the time of writing (October 2020), the number of cases of COVID-19 had been approaching 38 million and more than 1 million deaths were attributable to it. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible and could rapidly spread in hospital wards. OBJECTIVE: The work undertaken aimed to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viral detection point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared with laboratory-based tests. A further objective was to assess occupancy levels in hospital areas, such as waiting bays, before allocation to an appropriate bay. PERSPECTIVE/SETTING: The perspective was that of the UK NHS in 2020. The setting was a hypothetical hospital with an accident and emergency department. METHODS: An individual patient model was constructed that simulated the spread of disease and mortality within the hospital and recorded occupancy levels. Thirty-two strategies involving different hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Recently published desirable and acceptable target product profiles for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests were modelled. Incremental analyses were undertaken using both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits, and key patient outcomes, such as death and intensive care unit care, caused directly by COVID-19 were recorded. RESULTS: A SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test with a desirable target product profile appears to have a relatively small number of infections, a low occupancy level within the waiting bays, and a high net monetary benefit. However, if hospital laboratory testing can produce results in 6 hours, then the benefits of point-of-care tests may be reduced. The acceptable target product profiles performed less well and had lower net monetary benefits than both a laboratory-based test with a 24-hour turnaround time and strategies using data from currently available SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. The desirable and acceptable point-of-care test target product profiles had lower requirement for patients to be in waiting bays before being allocated to an appropriate bay than laboratory-based tests, which may be of high importance in some hospitals. Tests that appeared more cost-effective also had better patient outcomes. LIMITATIONS: There is considerable uncertainty in the values for key parameters within the model, although calibration was undertaken in an attempt to mitigate this. The example hospital simulated will also not match those of decision-makers deciding on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Given these limitations, the results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive, particularly cost-effectiveness results when the relative cost per SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Should a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test with a desirable target product profile become available, this appears promising, particularly when the reduction on the requirements for waiting bays before allocation to a SARS-CoV-2-infected bay, or a non-SARS-CoV-2-infected bay, is considered. The results produced should be informative to decision-makers who can identify the results most pertinent to their specific circumstances. FUTURE WORK: More accurate results could be obtained when there is more certainty on the diagnostic accuracy of, and the reduction in time to test result associated with, SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, and on the impact of these tests on occupancy of waiting bays and isolation bays. These parameters are currently uncertain. FUNDING: This report was commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme as project number 132154.

While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim. AIM: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google. In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo studies needed to include a comparator group. RESULTS: Three studies were identified, two in vitro and one in vivo, which were suitable for inclusion. All three were published as pre-prints. The in vitro studies revealed conflicting results, with one finding anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for azithromycin alone, while the other found activity against SARS-CoV-2 only when azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine. A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection. There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.","Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin",,335,16

Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by countries and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.","Cooper, Ian; Mondal, Argha; Antonopoulos, Chris G.",,335,17

The proposed ODL consists of an efficient computational algorithm for streaming data and approximately normal estimators for the regression coefficients. Its implementation only requires the availability of the current data batch in the data stream and sufficient statistics of the historical data at each stage of the analysis. A dynamic procedure is developed to select and update the tuning parameters upon the arrival of each new data batch so that we can adjust the amount of regularization adaptively along the data stream. The asymptotic normality of the ODL estimator is established under the conditions similar to those in an offline setting and mild conditions on the size of data batches in the stream, which provides theoretical justification for the proposed online statistical inference procedure.

In order to analyse the impact of patient’s fear of COVID-19 on the admittance rate of stroke patients and severity of neurological diseases, we compared the stroke admittance rate, numbers of throm-bectomies and thrombolysis and hospitalization refusal rate during the time period from March 1st until June 30th 2020 in temporal relationship with the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in Croatia. We assessed the patients’ neurologic disease severity measured by ventilation time and mortality rate in the same time period. We compared the data with the data obtained from the same time period in 2019. We observed dramatically decreased presentation in Neurologic Emergency Department due to stroke and neurologic disease in 2020 compared to 2019, increased refused hospitalization rate and similar stroke treatment rate despite bigger catchment area. Greater neurologic disease severity with almost 40% increased ventilation time and double mortality rate during the same time was observed. During the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic, fear of infection had significant impact on neurologic service leading to decreased presentation to NED, resulting in increased stroke or neurologic disease-related morbidity and mortality.","Lovrenčić-Huzjan, A.; Roje-Bedeković, M.",Archives of psychiatry research,335,16

To highlight this principle, we examined acute kidney injury (AKI) in IgA-dominant infection-associated glomerulonephritis (GN) and menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS). Both GN and mTSS are rare diseases caused by staphylococcal infection, and renal function is frequently impaired. The resulting AKIs are disparate pathological entities driven by distinct immune mechanisms. We begin by describing the case of a diabetic man with pyopneumothorax following methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He had endocapillary proliferative GN with in situ IgA-dominant immune-complex formation in the mesangium accompanied by complement C3 deposition in the glomerular capillary wall. By contrast, acute tubular necrosis was observed in a case of mTSS; the patient's immune response was stimulated differently by MRSA enterotoxin and exotoxin resulting in aberrant IgA deposition, complement activation, and insufficient antibody production. As a multidisciplinary communication covering the fields of nephrology, immunology, and pathology, this report may help clinicians to understand these distinct renal lesions and make optimal therapeutic decisions expeditiously.","Zhang, Yan; Wang, He-Bo; Chu, Bao; Zhao, Hui-Zhi; Li, Hang; Zhou, Hui-Min; Wang, Tao",J Int Med Res,335,14

Respiratory tract infections for instance in pilgrims attending the world's largest recurring annual pilgrimage, the Hajj are common. We review recent literature on viral and bacterial infectious diseases with special focus on the Hajj. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of bacterial and viral infections continue to increase, because of the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus during Hajj. Whilst MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East, no cases of MERS-CoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj. SUMMARY: Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity in pilgrims attending mass gathering events. The management of severe respiratory infections should consider investigation and empirical coverage for the most likely agents based on syndromic surveillance data from hosting country and /or other relevant exposure history during events. Pneumococcal and Pertussis vaccines should be recommended for Hajj pilgrims.","Petersen, Eskild; Memish, Ziad A; Zumla, Alimuddin; Maani, Amal Al",Curr Opin Pulm Med,335,1

Since the introduction and proliferation of the Internet, cybersecurity maintenance issues have grown exponentially. The importance of behavioral cybersecurity has recently been amplified by current events, such as misinformation and cyber-attacks related to election interference in the United States and internationally. More recently, similar issues have occurred in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The book presents profiling approaches, offers case studies of major cybersecurity events and provides analysis of password attacks and defenses. Discussing psychological methods used to assess behavioral cybersecurity, alongside risk management, the book also describes game theory and its applications, explores the role of cryptology and steganography in attack and defense scenarios and brings the reader up to date with current research into motivation and attacker/defender personality traits. Written for practitioners in the field, alongside nonspecialists with little prior knowledge of cybersecurity, computer science, or psychology, the book will be of interest to all who need to protect their computing environment from cyber-attacks. The book also provides source materials for courses in this growing area of behavioral cybersecurity. It provides a basis for new approaches to understanding problems in one of our most important areas of research-an approach, agreed upon by most cybersecurity experts, of incorporating not only traditional technical computational and analytic approaches to cybersecurity but also developing psycho-logical and human factor approaches to these problems. With a new approach to the skill set needed for cybersecurity employment, it is hoped that an expanded pool of students will seek to follow this path. It has also not escaped our notice that the field of cybersecurity has been less attractive to women.

The number of people who are still vulnerable to the virus is too high to hamper new outbreaks, leading a compelling need to find new therapeutic options devoted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Drug repurposing represents an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. RESULTS: We developed a network-based tool for drug repurposing provided as a freely available R-code, called SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), with the aim to offer a promising framework to efficiently detect putative novel indications for currently marketed drugs against diseases of interest. SAveRUNNER predicts drug-disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-associated proteins in the human interactome through the computation of a novel network-based similarity measure, which prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases located in the same network neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm was successfully applied to predict off-label drugs to be repositioned against the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2), and it achieved a high accuracy in the identification of well-known drug indications, thus revealing itself as a powerful tool to rapidly detect potential novel medical indications for various drugs that are worth of further investigation.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center case series of the seven maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients infected with COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 13 January to 7 April 2020 and a proactive search of potential cases by chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Results: Of 202 HD patients, 7 (3.5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Five were diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because of compatible symptoms, while two were diagnosed by RT-PCR as a result of screening 197 HD patients without respiratory symptoms by chest CT. Thirteen of 197 patients had positive chest CT features and, of these, 2 (15%) were confirmed to have COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, the most common features at admission were fatigue, fever and diarrhea [5/7 (71%) had all these]. Common laboratory features included lymphocytopenia [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)]. Chest CT showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Four of seven (57%) received oxygen therapy, one (14%) received noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, five (71%) received antiviral and antibacterial drugs, three (43%) recieved glucocorticoid therapy and one (14%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. As the last follow-up, four of the seven patients (57%) had been discharged and three patients were dead. Conclusions: Chest CT may identify COVID-19 patients without clear symptoms, but the specificity is low. The mortality of COVID-19 patients on HD was high.","Wang, Rui; He, Hong; Liao, Cong; Hu, Hongtao; Hu, Chun; Zhang, Juan; Gao, Ping; Wu, Xiaoyan; Cheng, Zhenshun; Liao, Meiyan; Shui, Hua",Clin Kidney J,335,16

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there is a common source for these infections. The overall sequence similarities between the spike protein of 2019-nCoV and that of SARS-CoV are known to be around 76% to 78% and 73% to 76% for the whole protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Thus, they have the potential to serve as the drug and/or vaccine candidate. However, the individual response against 2019-nCoV differs due to genetic variations in the human population. Understanding the variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that may affect the severity of 2019-nCoV infection could help in identifying individuals at a higher risk from the COVID-19.

For diagnosis, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard test for initial diagnosis of COVID-19. A kit based on serological tests are also recommended for investigating the spread of COVID-19 but this is challenging due to the antibodies cross-reactivity.

Measures undertaken to contain the spread of the virus are far-reaching, and older adults were among the first groups to experience restrictions on face-to-face contact. Although reducing viral transmission is critical, physical distancing is associated with negative psychosocial implications, such as increased rates of depression and anxiety. Promising evidence suggests that participatory digital co-design, defined as the combination of user-centered design and community engagement models, is associated with increased levels of engagement with mobile technologies among individuals with mental health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted shortcomings of existing technologies and challenges in their uptake and usage; however, strategies such as co-design may be leveraged to address these challenges both in the adaptation of existing technologies and the development of new technologies. By incorporating these strategies, it is hoped that we can offset some of the negative mental health implications for older adults in the context of physical distancing both during and beyond the current pandemic.","Cosco, Theodore D; Fortuna, Karen; Wister, Andrew; Riadi, Indira; Wagner, Kevin; Sixsmith, Andrew",J Med Internet Res,335,24

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including alkalizing lysosomes and blocking autophagy as well as exhibiting dose-limiting toxicities in patients. Therefore, we evaluated additional lysosomotropic compounds to identify an alternative lysosome-based drug repurposing opportunity. We found that six of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 2.0 to 13 µM and selectivity indices (SIs; SI = CC50/EC50) ranging from 1.5- to >10-fold. The compounds (1) blocked lysosome functioning and autophagy, (2) prevented pseudotyped particle entry, (3) increased lysosomal pH, and (4) reduced (ROC-325) viral titers in the EpiAirway 3D tissue model. Consistent with these findings, the siRNA knockdown of ATP6V0D1 blocked the HCoV-NL63 cytopathic effect in LLC-MK2 cells. Moreover, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cell lysate revealed significant dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, suggesting a contribution of the lysosome to the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest the lysosome as a potential host cell target to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and inhibitors of lysosomal function could become an important component of drug combination therapies aimed at improving treatment and outcomes for COVID-19.","Gorshkov, Kirill; Chen, Catherine Z; Bostwick, Robert; Rasmussen, Lynn; Tran, Bruce Nguyen; Cheng, Yu-Shan; Xu, Miao; Pradhan, Manisha; Henderson, Mark; Zhu, Wei; Oh, Eunkeu; Susumu, Kimihiro; Wolak, Mason; Shamim, Khalida; Huang, Wenwei; Hu, Xin; Shen, Min; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Itkin, Zina; Shinn, Paul; Carlos de la Torre, Juan; Simeonov, Anton; Michael, Sam G; Hall, Matthew D; Lo, Donald C; Zheng, Wei",ACS infect. dis,335,24

However, the role of phosphoprotein (N) in RNA recognition, replicating, transcribing the viral genome, and modulating the host immune response is indispensable. Recently, the NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of the Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein has been reported, but its precise structural mechanism of how the ssRNA interacts with it is not reported yet. Therefore, here, we have used an integrated computational pipeline to identify the key residues, which play an essential role in RNA recognition. We generated multiple variants by using an alanine scanning strategy and performed an extensive simulation for each system to signify the role of each interfacial residue. Our analyses suggest that residues T57A, H59A, S105A, R107A, F171A, and Y172A significantly affected the dynamics and binding of RNA.

With the overwhelming burden imposed by COVID-19 on the healthcare system, an emergent need exists to accurately forecast hospitalization needs, including beds, intensive care units and mechanical ventilators, within an actionable timeframe of two to four weeks. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to leverage an existing COVID-19 case and death forecasting tool to generate expected number of concurrent hospitalizations, occupied ICU beds, and in-use ventilators one day to four weeks in the future for New Mexico and each of its five health regions. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic model that took as input the number of new COVID-19 cases for New Mexico from Los Alamos National Laboratory's COVID-19 Forecasts using Fast Evaluations and Estimation tool and used it to estimate the number of new daily hospital admissions four weeks into the future based on current state-wide hospitalization rates. The model estimated how many of the new admissions would require an ICU bed or use of a ventilator and then projected individual lengths of hospital stays based on the resource need. By tracking the lengths of stay through time, we captured the projected simultaneous need for the inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. We used a post-processing method to adjust the forecasts based on the differences between prior forecasts and the subsequent observed data. Thus, we ensured our forecasts could reflect a dynamically changing situation on the ground. RESULTS: Forecasts made between September 1 and December 9, 2020 showed variable accuracy across time, healthcare resource needs, and forecast horizon. Forecasts made in October, when new COVID-19 cases were steadily increasing, had an average accuracy error of 20.0% while the error in forecasts made in September, a low-COVID activity month, was 39.7%. Across healthcare usage categories, state-level forecasts were more accurate than at the regional-level, with an average accuracy error between 17.0-38.0% and 17.5%-60.9% respectively. While accuracy declined the further into the future the forecast projected, the stated uncertainty of the prediction improved. Forecasts were within 5% of their stated uncertainty at the 50% and 90% prediction intervals at the three-four week forecast horizon for state level inpatient and ICU needs. However, uncertainty intervals were too narrow for forecasts of state-level ventilators and all regional healthcare resource needs. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time forecasting of the burden imposed by a spreading infectious disease is a crucial component of decision support during a public health emergency. Our proposed methodology demonstrated utility in providing near-term forecasts, particularly at the state level. This tool can aid other stakeholders as they face COVID-19 population impacts now and in the future.","Castro, Lauren A; Shelley, Courtney D; Osthus, Dave; Michaud, Isaac; Mitchell, Jason; Manore, Carrie A; Del Valle, Sara Y",,335,18

This study examined the clinical and selected genetic factors associated with NODAT among renal-transplanted Malaysian patients. METHODS: This study included 168 non-diabetic patients (58% males, 69% of Chinese ethnicity) who received renal transplantation between 1st January 1994 to 31st December 2014, and were followed up in two major renal transplant centres in Malaysia. Fasting blood glucose levels were used to diagnose NODAT in patients who received renal transplantation within 1 year. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely; rs1494558 (interleukin-7 receptor, IL-7R) and rs2232365 (mannose-binding leptin-2, MBL2) were selected and genotyped using Sequenom MassArray platform. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine the risk of developing NODAT according to the different demographics and clinical covariates, utilizing four time-points (one-month, three-months, six-months, one-year) post-transplant. RESULTS: Seventeen per cent of patients (n = 29, 55% males, 69% Chinese) were found to have developed NODAT within one-year of renal transplantation based on their fasting blood glucose levels. NODAT patients had renal transplantation at an older age compared to non-NODAT (39.3 ± 13.4 vs 33.9 ± 11.8 years, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, renal-transplanted patients who received a higher daily dose of cyclosporine (mg) were associated with increased risk of NODAT (Hazard ratio (HR) =1.01 per mg increase in dose, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.01, p = 0.002). Other demographic (gender, ethnicities, age at transplant) and clinical factors (primary kidney disease, type of donor, place of transplant, type of calcineurin inhibitors, duration of dialysis pre-transplant, BMI, creatinine levels, and daily doses of tacrolimus and prednisolone) were not found to be significantly associated with risk of NODAT. GA genotype of rs1494558 (HR = 3.15 95% CI 1.26, 7.86) and AG genotype of rs2232365 (HR = 2.57 95% CI 1.07, 6.18) were associated with increased risk of NODAT as compared to AA genotypes.

Although attention has been focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to the limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real-time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers. METHODS: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an assessment within the Ada app in Germany and the United Kingdom was conducted between two periods, namely before and after the implementation of ""Phase One"" COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using a Pearson chi-square test and reported as log2 fold changes. RESULTS: Overall, 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Overall, 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the United Kingdom reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany: 68,600/103,200, 66.52%; United Kingdom: 51,200/71,600, 72.74%). The majority were aged 10-29 years (Germany: 68,500/100,000, 68.45%; United Kingdom: 50,900/68,800, 73.91%), and about one-quarter were aged 30-59 years (Germany: 26,200/100,000, 26.15%; United Kingdom: 14,900/68,800, 21.65%). Overall, 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures period as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were reported in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (log2 fold change, P value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. In total, 14 of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.","Mehl, Alicia; Bergey, Francois; Cawley, Caoimhe; Gilsdorf, Andreas",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,335,1

The dynamical intertwining of many heterogeneous operational elements, agents and locations are oft-cited generic factors to make these systems prone to large-scale disruptions: initially localised perturbations amplify and spread over the network, leading to a complete standstill of transport. Our level of understanding of such phenomena, let alone the ability to anticipate or predict their evolution in time, remains rudimentary. We approach the problem with a prime example: railways. Analysing spreading of train delays on the network by building a physical model, supported by data, reveals that the emergence of large-scale disruptions rests on the dynamic interdependencies among multiple 'layers' of operational elements (resources and services). The interdependencies provide pathways for the so-called delay cascading mechanism, which gets activated when, constrained by local unavailability of on-time resources, already-delayed ones are used to operate new services. Cascading locally amplifies delays, which in turn get transported over the network to give rise to new constraints elsewhere. This mechanism is a rich addition to some well-understood ones in, e.g., epidemiological spreading, or the spreading of rumours and opinions over (contact) networks, and stimulates rethinking spreading dynamics on complex networks. Having these concepts built into the model provides it with the ability to predict the evolution of large-scale disruptions in the railways up to 30-60 minutes up front. For transport systems, our work suggests that possible alleviation of constraints as well as a modular operational approach would arrest cascading, and therefore be effective measures against large-scale disruptions.","Dekker, Mark M; Panja, Debabrata",PLoS One,335,24

METHODS: Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those &#8804;65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

The tsDMARDs are a large family of small molecules targeting mostly the several types of kinases, which are essential in downstream signaling of pro-inflammatory molecules. This review highlights current challenges associated with the treatment of RA using small molecule inhibitors targeting intracellular JAKs/MAPKs/NF-&#954;B/SYK-BTK signaling pathways. Indeed, we have provided the latest update on development of small molecule inhibitors, their clinical efficacy and safety as a strategy for RA treatment. On the other hand, we have highlighted the risk and adverse effects of tsDMARDs administration including, among others, infections and thromboembolism. Therefore, performance of blood tests or viral infection screening should be recommended before the tsDMARDs administration. Interestingly, recent events of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have demonstrated the potential use of small molecule inhibitors not only in RA treatment, but also in fighting COVID-19 via blocking the viral entry, preventing of hyperimmune activation and reducing cytokine storm. Thus, small molecule inhibitors, targeting wide range of pro-inflammatory singling pathways, may find wider implications not only for the management of RA but also in the controlling of COVID-19.","Massalska, Magdalena; Maslinski, Wlodzimierz; Ciechomska, Marzena",,335,17

How does an episode of unemployment or loss of income affect household consumption expenditure is an important question for designing effective safety nets. We use data on household-specific episodes of job loss and decline in income, from an earlier year (March-April 2019) to estimate the household response to employment shocks. We apply diff-in-diff and quantile regressions to a high-frequency panel data from a nationally representative survey of 1,75,000 households to estimate the impact of a job loss (and change in income) on household consumption expenditure-for urban and rural households, and households across different expenditure levels. We find that loss of employment of an earning member leads to a significant immediate decline in household consumption expenditure. The decline is much larger for urban households and households in the lowest and the highest deciles of monthly per capita consumption expenditure. Durable expenses go down the most. Expenditure on health and education also goes down significantly and there is evidence of adjustments in discretionary expenses too, especially for urban households. For households with only one earning member, borrowing does not increase after the job loss, suggesting credit constraints. Government cash transfers help rural households, as the beneficiaries show a smaller reduction in consumption expenditure after the shock. Our findings highlight the high vulnerability of urban households to economic shocks and can inform the design and targeting of income support and other safety-net programs in India and other developing countries.","Gupta, M.; Kishore, A.",IFPRI - Discussion Papers|2020.

In the UK the majority of professional orchestral musicians are freelance and therefore self-employed. These players, previously engaged in enjoyable, busy, successful, portfolio careers, are currently unable to earn a living carrying out their everyday work of performing music, and their future working lives are surrounded by great uncertainty. The aim of the present study was to examine how established professional musicians are experiencing this period, and to look for similarities and differences between the experiences of musicians in the middle of their performing careers (aged 35-45), with those of older players (aged 53 and over). Single semi-structured interviews were carried out over Zoom with 24 freelance, self-employed orchestral musicians;12 mid-career musicians aged 35-45, and 12 seasoned musicians aged 53 and over. Thematic analysis identified themes common to both groups: the loss of a much-loved performing career, missing music making and colleagues, and anxiety about the future of the music profession. It also identified differences between the two groups: challenges to their identity as a musician, the extent of their anxiety about finances, the extent of their emotional distress, attitudes toward practicing and engaging in collaborative music making, and confusion over future career plans. Findings are discussed with reference to lifespan models of musicians' career development, the PERMA model of wellbeing, and the concept of resilience.","Cohen, S.; Ginsborg, J.",Front Psychol,335,17

The entry process involves priming of the S protein by TMPRSS2 and ADAM17, which collectively mediate the binding and promote ACE2 shedding. In this study, microarray and RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐seq) expression data were utilized to profile the expression pattern of ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2 in type 2 diabetic (T2D) and non‐diabetic human pancreatic islets. Our data show that pancreatic islets express all three receptors irrespective of diabetes status. The expression of ACE2 was significantly increased in diabetic/hyperglycemic islets compared to nondiabetic/normoglycemic. Islets from female donors showed higher ACE2 expression compared to males; the expression of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 was not affected by gender. The expression of the three receptors was statistically similar in young (≤40 years old) versus old (≥60 years old) donors. Obese (BMI &gt; 30) donors have significantly higher expression levels of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 relative to those from non‐obese donors (BMI &lt; 25). TMPRSS2 expression correlated positively with HbA1c and negatively with age, while ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 correlated positively with BMI. The expression of the three receptors was statistically similar in muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissues obtained from diabetic and nondiabetic donors. Lastly, ACE2 expression was higher in sorted pancreatic β‐cell relative to other endocrine cells. In conclusion, ACE2 expression is increased in diabetic human islets. More studies are required to investigate whether variations of ACE2 expression could explain the severity of COVID‐19 infection‐related symptoms between diabetics and non‐diabetic patients.","Taneera, Jalal; El‐huneidi, Waseem; Hamad, Mawieh; Mohammed, Abdul Khader; Elaraby, Esraa; Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen",Biology,335,24

We investigated time-varying associations between daily time to oneself and loneliness, and the role of everyday creativity as a resource. METHODS: 126 adults aged 18-84 completed online questionnaires including a 10-day daily diary module, during which they self-reported alone time, everyday creativity, and loneliness. Data were analyzed using multilevel models, controlling for study day, participation date, gender, and relationship status. RESULTS: Greater average amounts of alone time were associated with greater loneliness, an association that was stronger in old age. In a daily context, individuals reported feeling lonelier on days when they had more time to themselves than usual. This within-person association was weaker with older age. Everyday creativity did not moderate alone time-loneliness associations. However, holding time to oneself constant, participants felt less lonely and less bothered by alone time on days when they were more creative than usual. DISCUSSION: Participating in creative behaviors (e.g., pursuing arts and crafts) might be linked with reduced loneliness. Intervention studies are needed to investigate whether fostering creativity could help promote mental well-being in times when people, especially older adults, are vulnerable to loneliness and associated health risks.","Pauly, Theresa; Chu, Li; Zambrano, Elizabeth; Gerstorf, Denis; Hoppmann, Christiane A",,335,16

The occurrence of trans-placental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains highly debated. Placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in selected cases, but infection or virus-associated disease of fetal tissues or newborns remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein expression placentas from 101 women who delivered between February 7 and May 15, 2020, including 15 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 34 tested negative, and 52 not evaluated as they did not meet testing criteria (32), or delivered before COVID-19 pandemic declaration (20). Immunostain for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) was performed in the placentas of all COVID-19 positive women. One placenta resulted positive for the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, which was further studied by RNA-in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for S transcripts, and by electron microscopy. A comprehensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of the placental inflammatory infiltrate completed the investigations. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were strongly expressed in the placenta of a COVID-19 pregnant woman whose newborn tested positive for viral RNA and developed COVID-19 pneumonia soon after birth. SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RNA and/or particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus were identified in villous syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, in maternal macrophages, and in Hofbauer cells and fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. The placenta intervillous inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages expressing activation markers. Absence of villitis was associated with an increase in the number of Hofbauer cells, which expressed PD-L1. Scattered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were identified by immunofluorescence. INTERPRETATION: We provide first-time evidence for maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely propagated by circulating virus-infected fetal mononuclear cells. Placenta infection was associated with recruitment of maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space, without villitis. PD-L1 expression in syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbaeur cells, together with limited production of NETs, may have prevented immune cell-driven placental damage, ensuring sufficient maternal-fetus nutrient exchanges.","Facchetti, Fabio; Bugatti, Mattia; Drera, Emma; Tripodo, Claudio; Sartori, Enrico; Cancila, Valeria; Papaccio, Marta; Castellani, Roberta; Casola, Stefano; Boniotti, Maria Beatrice; Cavadini, Patrizia; Lavazza, Antonio",EBioMedicine,335,20

This perspective allows to model different scenarios and illustrates the evolution and trends of the pandemic because it is based on the open data daily provided by the governments. To measure the severity of the pandemic along the time, a danger index (DI) is proposed in addition to the well-known R0 index.

The participants included 141 primary school teachers (M = 38.4 years, SD = 6.84; 54.6% women). They were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group participated in the 14-week teacher training program, whereas the control group did not participate in the program or receive any other training during the intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (time x group) was performed to identify the effects of the teacher training program. Teachers who participated in the training program evaluated it positively and showed significant differences compared to the control group in their abilities to cope with stress and avoid burnout, their ICT competency, and their introduction of EI in the classroom. Implications for supporting teachers are discussed.","Pozo-Rico, Teresa; Gilar-Corbí, Raquel; Izquierdo, Andrea; Castejón, Juan-Luis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),335,26

During crises at home, donors often cut aid, which would have grave ramifications for developing countries with poor public health capacity during a time of increased demand for health care. Because the major donors are democracies, whether they renege on promises would depend intimately on how donor citizens respond to the specific crisis. We conduct two survey experiments with 887 U.S. residents to examine how the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic influences their attitudes toward aid. We demonstrate that citizens' concern about the impact of COVID-19 on their country's financial situation reduces their support for aid. If they think that aid can help curb the next wave of the disease at home by first alleviating its impact in developing countries, they become substantially more supportive of giving aid. In contrast, merely stressing how COVID-19 might ravage developing countries barely changes their aid attitudes. Our findings have implications for what to expect from donors during global pandemics as well as how advocates may prevent aid from being cut.","Kobayashi, Yoshiharu; Heinrich, Tobias; Bryant, Kristin A",World Dev,335,3

Here, we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and smooth muscle cells (hPSC-SMCs). We find that that SARS-CoV-2 selectively infects hPSC-CMs through the viral receptor ACE2, whereas in hPSC-SMCs there is minimal viral entry or replication. After entry into cardiomyocytes, SARS-CoV-2 is assembled in lysosome-like vesicles and egresses via bulk exocytosis. The viral transcripts become a large fraction of cellular mRNA while host gene expression shifts from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism and upregulates chromatin modification and RNA splicing pathways. Most importantly, viral infection of hPSC-CMs progressively impairs both their electrophysiological and contractile function, and causes widespread cell death. These data support the hypothesis that COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms can result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2.","Marchiano, Silvia; Hsiang, Tien-Ying; Khanna, Akshita; Higashi, Ty; Whitmore, Leanne S; Bargehr, Johannes; Davaapil, Hongorzul; Chang, Jean; Smith, Elise; Ong, Lay Ping; Colzani, Maria; Reinecke, Hans; Yang, Xiulan; Pabon, Lil; Sinha, Sanjay; Najafian, Behzad; Sniadecki, Nathan J; Bertero, Alessandro; Gale, Michael; Murry, Charles E",Stem Cell Reports,335,16

Since the awareness of the public in general and particularly awareness of those with comorbidities, such as cancer, determine the rate of mortality, the primary goal of this study was to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the patients with cancer towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objective of this study was also to measure the effect of COVID-19 on cancer patients' ongoing treatments. METHODS: This study recruited 300 oncology patients through an outpatient community-based oncology clinic in one of the 30 major cities of Turkey, which had taken a lockdown at weekends during April 2020. A questionnaire measuring the knowledge, attitudes and preventive behaviour was completed by each patient either face-to-face or through telephone survey. RESULTS: In general, participants had a positive attitude towards protective measures. No delay for current cancer treatments or appointments has been observed in 98% of patients. More than half of the patients(52.3%) were using some kind of nutritional supplement to increase their body resistance. Nearly two-third of patients could not identify the three most common symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnoea), and half of them were not aware of the routes of transmission (by contact and droplets). It was observed that patients with stage 1 cancer were tend to stay at home, while patients with stage 4 cancer were prone to leave their houses for the hospital at a higher ratio. The rate of people leaving houses was significantly higher for male patients and for patients with a university degree, whereas patients who were older than 65 were tend to go only to the hospital when they leave their houses. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that routine follow-up and guidance for cancer patients seems to provide significant benefit to increase the knowledge and awareness of patients with cancer.","Erdem, Dilek; Karaman, Irem",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),335,16

But in other than healthcare facilities, mechanical ventilation is designed for comfort, not airborne infection control, and cannot achieve the 6 to 12 room air changes per hour recommended for airborne infection control. More efficient air filters have been recommended in ventilation ducts despite a lack of convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads through ventilation systems. Most transmission appears to occur in rooms where both an infectious source COVID-19 case and other susceptible occupants share the same air. Only two established room-based technologies are available to supplement mechanical ventilation: portable room air cleaners and upper room germicidal UV air disinfection. Portable room air cleaners can be effective, but performance is limited by their clean air delivery rate relative to room volume. SARS-CoV-2 is highly susceptible to GUV, an 80-year-old technology that has been shown to safely, quietly, effectively and economically produce the equivalent of 10 to 20 or more air changes per hour under real life conditions. For these reasons, upper room GUV is the essential engineering intervention for reducing COVID-19 spread.","Nardell, Edward A",Photochem Photobiol,335,24

Moreover, it is unknown whether endogenously derived antibodies drive viral clearance that might result in mitigation of clinical severity during natural infection. We developed a series of non-linear mathematical models to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 viral and antibody kinetics are coupled or governed by separate processes. Patients with severe disease had a higher production rate of IgG but not IgM antibodies. Maximal levels of both isotypes were governed by their production rate rather than different saturation levels between people. Our results suggest that an exponential surge in IgG levels occurs approximately 5-10 days after symptom onset with no requirement for continual antigenic stimulation. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies appear to have limited to no effect on viral dynamics but may enhance viral clearance late during primary infection resulting from the binding effect of antibody to virus, rather than neutralization. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies may play only a limited role in clearing infection from the nasal passages despite providing long-term immunity against infection following vaccination or prior infection.","Yang, Shuyi; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L; Schiffer, Joshua T; Goyal, Ashish",Viruses,335,16

The CFS/ME diagnostic criteria include a substantial reduction in usual activities for at least six months, exhaustion after exertion, non-refreshing sleep, and either cognitive impairment (“brain fog”) or feeling light-headed while standing.10 Historical research has found that similar symptoms were noted among survivors of the 1918 influenza pandemic.11 CFS/ME has been noted one year12 and three years13 after SARS infection and one year after MERS.14 A large study of middle-aged SARS survivors in Hong Kong four years after infection found 27% met chronic fatigue syndrome criteria.15 Initial reports of post-COVID-19 illness include symptoms such as extreme fatigue, concentration difficulties, memory lapses, and muscle weakness that are consistent with CFS/ME,16,17 as well as short-term reduced cognitive ability.18 Damage to organs throughout the body COVID-19 also damages organs throughout the body, creating potentially life-long physical health impacts, even for low-risk populations that were not hospitalized.19 COVID-19 symptoms, especially fatigue and difficulty breathing, have been shown to persist for months after infection.20 Lung damage may be life-long for some. While this cardiomyopathy is often reversible, some patients who have otherwise recovered from COVID-19 appear to have long-term myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue), which can lead to arrhythmias, heart attacks, and irreversible heart failure.23,24 Studies on patients with viral myocarditis have also shown an increase in five-year mortality.25 As the body’s immune system fights the virus, scientists believe the immune system overreacts, leading to many of the acute lung complications seen in the severe form of COVID-19, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).26 ARDS is an illness of acute respiratory failure in which both lungs fill with fluid, often leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and intubation with mechanical ventilation. During acute disease, many viruses, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 cause coagulation disorders, leading to an increase in blood clotting (thrombosis) throughout the body, which can ultimately cause multi-organ failure.31 An observational study in the Netherlands found rates of thrombosis as high as 31% in COVID-19 patients.32 In the lungs, a clot can cause a pulmonary embolism leading to reduced oxygenation;in the kidneys, a clot can cause kidney failure;and in the brain, a clot can cause a stroke.","Rosenbaum, Janet E.; Mincer, Shifra",Georgetown Journal of International Affairs,335,22

The healthcare community is at the highest risk of infection and thereby prone to most distress. The aim of this study was to explore and evaluate the degree of depression, anxiety, and stress levels among medical college students during the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in February and March 2020, 3 weeks after the first reported COVID-19 infection was identified in Iran. All medical college students who entered clinical courses were eligible for the study. Depression, stress, and anxiety were evaluated in these students using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using availability sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. Results The total number of participants was 207, with 143 males and 64 females. More than half of the participants (57.97%) were married. The mean duration of working experience among students with COVID-19 infection and experience in a medical ward was 3.00 ± 1.27 days and 17.40 ± 7.26 months, respectively. The majority of students had 2 or 3 days working experience with COVID-19 infection. The mean anxiety score of participants was 28.56 ± 4.68, the depression score was 29.36 ± 4.42, and the stress score was 28.99 ± 4.53. Our findings indicated that the mean scores of depression were at an ""extremely severe"" level, while stress and anxiety were at ""severe"" levels. The prevalence of ""severe"" symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety was 69.57%, 60.87%, and 99.04%, respectively. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among medical students who were exposed to COVID-19-infected patients. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs, training, and self-care for medical college students in relation to mental health. We recommend incorporation of molecular biomarker tests into an algorithm to aid in assessments and consideration of the appropriate therapeutic responses.","Moayed, Malihe Sadat; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Mirmomeni, Golshan; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Goharimoghadam, Keivan; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Abbasi-Farajzadeh, Mohsen; Khatibzadeh, Azam; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Guest, Paul C; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,335,16

We report the largest case series yet described of patients with both these pathologies (including nonventilated patients). METHODS: Cases were collected retrospectively from UK hospitals with inclusion criteria limited to a diagnosis of COVID-19 and the presence of either pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Patients included in the study presented between March and June 2020. Details obtained from the medical record included demographics, radiology, laboratory investigations, clinical management and survival. RESULTS: 71 patients from 16 centres were included in the study, of whom 60 had pneumothoraces (six with pneumomediastinum in addition) and 11 had pneumomediastinum alone. Two of these patients had two distinct episodes of pneumothorax, occurring bilaterally in sequential fashion, bringing the total number of pneumothoraces included to 62. Clinical scenarios included patients who had presented to hospital with pneumothorax, patients who had developed pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum during their inpatient admission with COVID-19 and patients who developed their complication while intubated and ventilated, either with or without concurrent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Survival at 28â days was not significantly different following pneumothorax (63.1±6.5%) or isolated pneumomediastinum (53.0±18.7%; p=0.854). The incidence of pneumothorax was higher in males. 28-day survival was not different between the sexes (males 62.5±7.7% versus females 68.4±10.7%; p=0.619). Patients aged &#8805;70 years had a significantly lower 28-day survival than younger individuals (&#8805;70â years 41.7±13.5% survival versus <70â years 70.9±6.8% survival; p=0.018 log-rank). CONCLUSION: These cases suggest that pneumothorax is a complication of COVID-19. Pneumothorax does not seem to be an independent marker of poor prognosis and we encourage continuation of active treatment where clinically possible.","Martinelli, Anthony W; Ingle, Tejas; Newman, Joseph; Nadeem, Iftikhar; Jackson, Karl; Lane, Nicholas D; Melhorn, James; Davies, Helen E; Rostron, Anthony J; Adeni, Aldrin; Conroy, Kevin; Woznitza, Nick; Matson, Matthew; Brill, Simon E; Murray, James; Shah, Amar; Naran, Revati; Hare, Samanjit S; Collas, Oliver; Bigham, Sarah; Spiro, Michael; Huang, Margaret M; Iqbal, Beenish; Trenfield, Sarah; Ledot, Stephane; Desai, Sujal; Standing, Lewis; Babar, Judith; Mahroof, Razeen; Smith, Ian; Lee, Kai; Tchrakian, Nairi; Uys, Stephanie; Ricketts, William; Patel, Anant R C; Aujayeb, Avinash; Kokosi, Maria; Wilkinson, Alexander J K; Marciniak, Stefan J",Eur. respir. j,335,9

Detailed data on demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes for persons hospitalized with COVID-19 are needed to inform prevention strategies and community-specific intervention messages. For this report, CDC, the Georgia Department of Public Health, and eight Georgia hospitals (seven in metropolitan Atlanta and one in southern Georgia) summarized medical record-abstracted data for hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed* COVID-19 who were admitted during March 2020. Among 305 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 61.6% were aged <65 years, 50.5% were female, and 83.2% with known race/ethnicity were non-Hispanic black (black). Over a quarter of patients (26.2%) did not have conditions thought to put them at higher risk for severe disease, including being aged &#8805;65 years. The proportion of hospitalized patients who were black was higher than expected based on overall hospital admissions. In an adjusted time-to-event analysis, black patients were not more likely than were nonblack patients to receive invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or to die during hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-1.13). Given the overrepresentation of black patients within this hospitalized cohort, it is important for public health officials to ensure that prevention activities prioritize communities and racial/ethnic groups most affected by COVID-19. Clinicians and public officials should be aware that all adults, regardless of underlying conditions or age, are at risk for serious illness from COVID-19.","Gold, Jeremy A W; Wong, Karen K; Szablewski, Christine M; Patel, Priti R; Rossow, John; da Silva, Juliana; Natarajan, Pavithra; Morris, Sapna Bamrah; Fanfair, Robyn Neblett; Rogers-Brown, Jessica; Bruce, Beau B; Browning, Sean D; Hernandez-Romieu, Alfonso C; Furukawa, Nathan W; Kang, Mohleen; Evans, Mary E; Oosmanally, Nadine; Tobin-D039,; Angelo, Melissa; Drenzek, Cherie; Murphy, David J; Hollberg, Julie; Blum, James M; Jansen, Robert; Wright, David W; Sewell, William M; Owens, Jack D; Lefkove, Benjamin; Brown, Frank W; Burton, Deron C; Uyeki, Timothy M; Bialek, Stephanie R; Jackson, Brendan R",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,335,26

The use of powered air-purifying respirators, filtering facepiece particles (FFP) 2-3 masks, protective suits, disposable sterile surgical gowns, and two pairs of sterile gloves as a part of a protocol seemed effective and feasible for trained healthcare workers and allow all the complex activities connected with the positioning of the ECMO support to be completed effectively. The simulation training on donning and doffing procedures and the presence of a dedicated team member to verify the compliance with the safety procedure effectively reassured operators and likely reduced the risk of self-contamination. From 1 March to 31 December 2020, we used the procedure in 35 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients and one acute respiratory failure caused by neoplastic total tracheal obstruction, all positive to COVID-19, to be connected to veno-venous ECMO in peripheral hospitals and centralized for ECMO management. This preliminary experience seems to confirm that the use of ECMO during COVID-19 outbreaks is feasible and the risks associated with its positioning and management are sustainable for the health-care workers and safe for patients.","Montrucchio, G.; Sales, G.; Urbino, R.; Simonetti, U.; Bonetto, C.; Cura Stura, E.; Simonato, E.; Fuoco, G.; Fanelli, V.; Brazzi, L.",Membranes,335,21

Immunocompromised patients are within the high-risk group to severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, there is no clear evidence of the association between impaired immune host status and complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection so far. The virus is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with infected secretions, and therefore the dental office is a highly susceptible environment for such transmission. Here, we review the literature and discuss immunological COVID-19 related issues. We also make suggestions for immunocompromised patients' support in this new emerging context of clinical dental practice. Until comprehensive findings are published, individuals with impaired immunity should be considered as high-risk. Cross infection control procedures for the clinical care of immunocompromised patients should follow the same guidelines that are being proposed for immunocompetent ones. However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room. In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general recommendations should be the same for all subjects. Changes in the current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control in order to provide the best and safe dental practice.

A significant number of elderly patients require hospitalization and develop serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the preliminary impact (8 weeks) of CoVID-19, focusing on proximal femur fractures, analyzing data and results compared to the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 22nd to April 18th, 2020 we surgically treated 121 proximal femur fractures (61 in Piacenza; 60 in Parma, 16 male, 44 female, mean age 81.1). In the same period of 2019, we treated 169 proximal femur fractures (90 in Piacenza, 33 male, 57 female, mean age 81.9; 79 in Parma, 29 males, 50 female, mean age 80.2). We had 21/61 (34.4%) patients resulted positive for COVID-19 and 11/61 in Parma (18.3%), based on nasal-pharyngeal swab, chest CT scan and/or lung US findings. RESULTS: The incidence of proximal femur fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread in Piacenza and Parma. Authors have noticed an elevated number of deaths within 21 days after surgery. Piacenza: 4 cases in 2019 (4.4%) and 11 in 2020 (18.0%), of which 9 cases CoVID positive. In Parma in 2019 two deaths were encountered; in 2020 6 patients died and 5 cases were CoVID positive. CONCLUSION: In the first two months of the Italian epidemic, in the cities of Piacenza and Parma over 80% of deaths have occurred in patients over 70 years old. Even if preliminary, our study shows a significant increase in death in elderly patients surgically treated for proximal femur fractures, particularly in the Piacenza Hospital.","Maniscalco, Pietro; Poggiali, Erika; Quattrini, Fabrizio; Ciatti, Corrado; Magnacavallo, Andrea; Vercelli, Andrea; Domenichini, Marco; Vaienti, Enrico; Pogliacomi, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Francesco",Acta Biomed,335,16

Using a structured and validated questionnaire, an online survey was conducted from May 9 to June 5, 2020. Responses were received from 453 healthcare workers. Of these, 218 (48.12%) were doctors, 183 (40.40%) were nurses, and 52 (11.48%) were paramedical staff. Only 129 (28.48%) healthcare workers reported having adequate access to PPE at all times, whereas 156 (34.44%) never had access to PPE and 168 (37.09%) had access to PPE occasionally. Lack of access to PPE led the majority (71.74%) of healthcare workers to use coping strategies such as reuse of N95 and surgical masks. A total of 312 (68.87%) respondents believed that the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the work environment was high and the majority (62.69%) adopted precautionary measures at home to keep their families safe. A significantly high (n = 233, 51.43%, P = .03) number of respondents reported self-medicating. Of all the respondents, only 136 (30.02%) were tested for COVID-19 at least once, of which 32 (23.53%) ever tested positive.

Current evidence suggests the association of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy with both severe maternal morbidity requiring intensive care and perinatal complications (preterm birth with consequent neonatal morbidity and even perinatal death). Most of the reported cases focused specifically on the maternal outcomes and possible vertical transmission, but less attention has been paid to fetus as a patient in such pregnancies. The use of antenatal steroids and fetal neuroprotection with magnesium sulfate is clearly underreported. Several recently issued guidelines suggest lowering the upper gestational age for antenatal steroid administration and also advocate extreme caution or even restraining from the use of magnesium sulfate. Also, the rate of cesarean deliveries among COVID-19 women is unacceptably high. Here we provide arguments for NOT changing the existing guidelines and caution against cesarean delivery that was the prevalent delivery mode in the reported cases and case series.","Stefanovic, Vedran",J Perinat Med,335,15

This study aimed to assess circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines in adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and stratified according to age (older or younger than 65 years) aiming to explore associations between these markers of inflammation and comorbidities. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 142 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the University Hospital of the Federal University of São Carlos, from July to October 2020. Sociodemographic data, chronic comorbidities, and baseline NEWS2 and SOFA for clinical deterioration were obtained at hospital admission. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Older adults with COVID-19 had higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 as compared to those under 65 years of age (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). IL-10 was independently associated with age (p = 0.04) and severity of the disease (p = 0.05), whereas serum levels of IL-6 were not directly associated with age (p = 0.5). The comorbidity index seems to be the main responsible for this, being significantly associated with IL-6 levels among those aged 65 and over (p = 0.007), in addition to the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 are associated with the severity of the disease and a higher comorbidity index among adults aged 65 and over with COVID-19. This should raise awareness of the importance of comorbidity index, rather than age, during risk stratification.","Luporini, Rafael Luís; Rodolpho, Joice M de A; Kubota, Lauro Tatsuo; Martin, Ana Carolina Baptista Moreno; Cominetti, Marcia R; Anibal, Fernanda de Freitas; Pott-Junior, Henrique",Cytokine,335,1

Efficient disease prevention is challenged by factors, such as population growth, insufficient documentation of clinical effects, dissemination mechanism, and lack of a reliable vaccine. Italy was heavily affected by COVID-19, causing it to have one of the highest COVID-19 deaths in the world. Current statistics show that Italy is on its own way to recover from the second wave of the virus. Therefore, this paper presents a susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered-dead (SEIQRD) model to model and predict the spread of the disease in Italy in the near future. The prediction is based on formulating the SEIQRD model using 365-day statistics of the disease. The parameters of the model are estimated using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The modeling results agree well with the reported data, with normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) values ranging from 0.058 to 0.214 (average NMAE = 0.115), and normalized root mean absolute error (NRMSE) values ranging from 0.104 to 0.305 (average NRMSE = 0.190). The estimated PSO-based model is then used to predict the future of the disease in Italy in the coming 35 days. The forecasted results indicate that the number of infections will keep reducing, ending the second wave of COVID-19. Such results can assist governments around the world in the process of planning for countermeasures that help reduce the spread of the disease based on forecasted numbers. © 2021 IEEE.","Abdallah, M.

This study aimed to compare beer consumption before and after restrictions to alcohol availability during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Australia. Design Interrupted time-series analysis. Setting Australia. Participants Estimated resident population aged 15+ years. Measurements Seasonally adjusted estimates of beer per capita consumption measured in litres of alcohol (LALs) per week, disaggregated by on- and off-premises sales. Findings First-wave restrictions (week beginning 23 March 2020) were associated with a significant immediate reduction in on-premises beer per capita consumption [-0.013 LALs, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.013 to -0.012, P = &lt; 0.001], but no significant change in off-premises beer per capita consumption. Partial removal of first-wave restrictions (week beginning 18 May 2020) was associated with a significant immediate increase in on-premises beer per capita consumption (+0.003 LALs, 95% CI = 0.001 to 0.004, P = 0.006), but no significant change in off-premises beer per capita consumption. Second-wave restrictions (week beginning 06 July 2020) were associated with a significant immediate reduction in on-premises beer per capita consumption (-0.004 LALs, 95% CI = -0.006 to -0.002, P = 0.001) but, again, no significant change in off-premises beer per capita consumption. Conclusion Restricting the availability of on-premises alcohol during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia was associated with significant reductions in on-premises beer consumption, but no significant changes in off-premises beer consumption.

Objective: To quantify how these lockdowns changed the spoken communication environments of children with cochlear implants by comparing the sounds they were exposed to before the Ontario provincial state of emergency in March 2020 and during the resulting closures of schools and nonessential businesses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This experimental cohort study comprised children with hearing loss who used cochlear implants to hear. These children were chosen because (1) their devices monitor and catalog levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs), and (2) this group is particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Children were recruited from the Cochlear Implant Program at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Children whose cochlear implant datalogs were captured between February 1 and March 16, 2020, shortly before lockdown (pre-COVID-19), were identified. Repeated measures were collected in 45 children during initial easing of lockdown restrictions (stages 1-2 of the provincial recovery plan); resulting datalogs encompassed the lockdown period (peri-COVID-19). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hours of sound captured by the Cochlear Nucleus datalogging system (Cochlear Corporation) in 6 categories of input levels (<40, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, &#8805;80 A-weighted dB sound pressure levels [dBA]) and 6 auditory scene categories (quiet, speech, speech-in-noise, music, noise, and other).

Results: A total of 45 children (mean [SD] age, 7.7 [5.0] years; 23 girls [51.1%]) participated in this cohort study. Results showed similar daily use of cochlear implants during the pre- and peri-COVID-19 periods (9.80 mean hours pre-COVID-19 and 9.34 mean hours peri-COVID-19). Despite consistent device use, these children experienced significant quieting of input sound levels peri-COVID-19 by 0.49 hour (95% CI, 0.21-0.80 hour) at 60 to 69 dBA and 1.70 hours (95% CI, 1.42-1.99 hours) at 70 to 79 dBA with clear reductions in speech exposure by 0.98 hour (95% CI, 0.49-1.47 hours). This outcome translated into a reduction of speech:quiet from 1.6:1.0 pre-COVID-19 to 0.9:1.0 during lockdowns. The greatest reductions in percentage of daily speech occurred in school-aged children (elementary, 12.32% [95% CI, 7.15%-17.49%]; middle school, 11.76% [95% CI, 5.00%-18.52%]; and high school, 9.60% [95% CI, 3.27%-15.93%]). Increased daily percentage of quiet (7.00% [95% CI, 4.27%-9.74%]) was most prevalent for children who had fewer numbers of people in their household (estimate [SE] = -1.12% [0.50%] per person; Cohen f = 0.31). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study indicate a clear association of COVID-19 lockdowns with a reduction in children's access to spoken communication.","Gordon, Karen A; Daien, Maya F; Negandhi, Jaina; Blakeman, Alan; Ganek, Hillary; Papsin, Blake; Cushing, Sharon L",JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,335,16

Patients and Methods: We included 250 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. RT-PCR was used to detect influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial viruses. Chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect IgM antibodies for adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the serum of patients. Based on these results, we divided the patients into two groups, the simple SARS-CoV-2-infected group and the coinfected SARS-COV-2 group. Coinfected patients were then further categorized as having a coinfection of viral pathogen (CoIV) or coinfection of atypical bacterial pathogen (CoIaB). Results: No statistically significant differences were found in age, gender, the time taken to return negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results, length of hospital stays, and mortality between the simple SARS-CoV-2 infection group and the coinfection group. Of the 250 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 39 (15.6%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen in addition to SARS-CoV-2. A third of these pathogens were detected as early as the 1st week after symptom onset and another third were identified after more than three weeks. The most detected CAP pathogen was C. pneumoniae (5.2%), followed by the respiratory syncytial virus (4.8%), M. pneumoniae (4.4%) and adenovirus (2.8%). Patients coinfected with viral pathogens (CoIV) (n=18) had longer hospital stays when compared to patients coinfected with atypical bacterial pathogens (CoIaB) (n=21). Except for one fatality, the remaining 38 coinfected patients all recovered with favourable outcomes. Conclusion: Coinfections in COVID-19 patients are common. The coinfecting pathogens can be detected at variable intervals during COVID-19 disease course and remain an important consideration in targeted treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients.","Ma, Ling; Wang, Wenjing; Grange, Jehane Michael Le; Wang, Xiaorong; Du, Shuaixian; Li, Chen; Wei, Jia; Zhang, Jin-Nong",Infect.

To combat this situation, numerous strategies are being thought for either creating its antidote, vaccine, or agents that can prevent its infection. For enabling research on these strategies, several target proteins are identified where, Spike (S) protein is of great potential. S-protein interacts with human angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entering the cell. S-protein is a large protein and a portion of it designated as a receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the key region that interacts with ACE2, following to which the viral membrane fuses with the alveolar membrane to enter the human cell. The hypothesis is to identify molecules from the pool of anticancer phytochemicals as a lead possessing the ability to interact and mask the amino acids of RBD, making them unavailable to form associations with ACE2. Such a molecule is termed as 'fusion inhibitor'. We hypothesized to identify fusion inhibitors from the NPACT library of anticancer phytochemicals. For this, all the molecules from the NPACT were screened using molecular docking, the five top hits (Theaflavin, Ginkgetin, Ursolic acid, Silymarin and Spirosolane) were analyzed for essential Pharmacophore features and their ADMET profiles were studied following to which the best two hits were further analyzed for their interaction with RBD using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Binding free energy calculations were performed using MM/GBSA, proving these phytochemicals containing anticancer properties to serve as fusion inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human &#945;7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human &#945;7 nAChR.

Here we perform both metabolomics and cytokine/chemokine profiling on serum samples from healthy controls, mild and severe COVID-19 patients, and delineate their global metabolic and immune response landscape. Correlation analyses show tight associations between metabolites and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IL-6, M-CSF, IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, and imply a potential regulatory crosstalk between arginine, tryptophan, purine metabolism and hyperinflammation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that targeting metabolism markedly modulates the proinflammatory cytokines release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques ex vivo, hinting that exploiting metabolic alterations may be a potential strategy for treating fatal CRS in COVID-19.","Xiao, Nan; Nie, Meng; Pang, Huanhuan; Wang, Bohong; Hu, Jieli; Meng, Xiangjun; Li, Ke; Ran, Xiaorong; Long, Quanxin; Deng, Haijun; Chen, Na; Li, Shao; Tang, Ni; Huang, Ailong; Hu, Zeping",Nat Commun,335,16

Furthermore, we found that the effective co-delivery of RBD antigen and MnARK to lymph nodes (LNs) elicited an increased cellular internalization and the activation of immune cells, including DC cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.

Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students.

This study was conducted to evaluate the distance of oral and nasal droplet spread in a model that simulates coughing and sneezing in a public setting, specifically a school setting, to guide faculty and staff members with safety measures and guidelines to reduce droplet spread. Several models were prepared to observe and visualize the spread of fluid simulating respiratory droplets in places such as the classroom and the cafeteria, in which a student would be more susceptible to contract a virus since individuals cannot wear masks while eating. For all trials, a 2.54 centimeter balloon with 0.3 milliliters of diluted fluorescent paint was placed inside a mannequin head and was exploded outwards from the mannequin's mouth at 5 pounds per square inch (psi). Using a black light, the expelled fluorescent macroscopic droplets were visualized. When applying safety precautions and guidelines such as mandating face masks, the results of the experiments conducted in this study with a surgical mask, were extremely positive. However, without other safety precautions such as face masks and barriers, social distancing proved to be ineffective. In conclusion the most effective way to prevent droplet spread during activities where masks simply cannot be worn, such as eating, is to apply barriers between the individuals. Applying barriers and wearing masks successfully prevented macroscopic droplet spread.","Bhavsar, Atreyus A",PLoS One,335,16

Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. METHODS: In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Liège University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.","Gilbert, Allison; Brasseur, Edmond; Petit, Mérédith; Donneau, Anne Françoise; Diep, AnhNguyet; Hetzel Campbell, Suzanne; Servotte, Jean-Christophe; Piazza, Justine; Ancion, Aurore; Gensburger, Mathieu; D039,; Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",Acta Clin Belg,335,10

On December 14, 2020, the United States began a nationwide vaccination campaign after the Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended prioritizing health care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, followed by essential workers and persons at risk for severe illness, including adults aged &#8805;65 years, in the early phases of the vaccination program (2). By May 1, 2021, 82%, 63%, and 42% of persons aged &#8805;65, 50-64, and 18-49 years, respectively, had received &#8805;1 COVID-19 vaccine dose. CDC calculated the rates of COVID-19 cases, emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and deaths by age group during November 29-December 12, 2020 (prevaccine) and April 18-May 1, 2021.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major immunogenic protein that can induce protective immunity. To screen for potential T-cell epitopes on IBV N protein, 40 overlapping peptides covering the entirety of the N protein were designed and synthesized. Four T-cell epitope peptides were identified by gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot), intracellular cytokine staining, and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) lymphocyte proliferation assays; among them, three peptides (N211-230, N271-290, and N381-400) were cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, and one peptide (N261-280) was a dual-specific T-cell epitope, which can be recognized by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Multi-epitope gene transcription cassettes comprising four neutralizing epitope domains and four T-cell epitope peptides were synthesized and inserted into the genome of Newcastle disease virus strain La Sota between the P and M genes. Recombinant IBV multi-epitope vaccine candidate rLa Sota/SBNT was generated via reverse genetics, and its immune protection efficacy was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Our results show that rLa Sota/SBNT induced IBV-specific neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses and provided significant protection against homologous and heterologous IBV challenge. Thus, the T-cell epitope peptides identified in this study could be good candidates for IBV vaccine development, and recombinant Newcastle disease virus-expressing IBV multi-epitope genes represent a safe and effective vaccine candidate for controlling infectious bronchitis. IMPORTANCE T-cell-mediated immune responses are critical for the elimination of IBV-infected cells. To screen conserved T-cell epitopes in the IBV N protein, 40 overlapping peptides covering the entirety of the N protein were designed and synthesized. By combining IFN-Î³ ELISpot, intracellular cytokine staining, and CFSE lymphocyte proliferation assays, we identified three CTL epitopes and one dual-specific T-cell epitope. The value of T-cell epitope peptides identified in the N protein was further verified by the design of an IBV multi-epitope vaccine. Results show that IBV multi-epitope vaccine candidate rLa Sota/SBNT provided cross protection against challenges with a QX-like or a TW-like IBV strain. So, T-cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the control of viral infection, and conserved T-cell epitopes serve as promising candidates for use in multi-epitope vaccine construction. Our results provide a new perspective for the development of a safer and more effective IBV vaccine.","Qin, Yifeng; Tu, Kaihang; Teng, Qingyuan; Feng, Delan; Zhao, Ye; Zhang, Guozhong",J Virol,335,16

Hence, it is required to provide the images without any noises for better classification. Since the selection of denoising method to generate the quality image depends on the type of noise present in the image, it is suggested to find the best method to eliminate the noise as far as possible by preserving the edges. This paper presents the various denoising techniques such as Bayes Shrink and VisuShrink wavelet transform, non-local mean filter and median filter to remove the noises added through Gaussian, Speckle and salt and pepper noise in the COVID 19 chest x-ray images and the MRI images. The experiment shows that wavelet transform method performance is good for removing Gaussian noise and median filter performance is good to remove speckle and salt and pepper noise.

The objective was to compare the serum neutralizing antibody (SNA) titers to BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V, cytokine mRNA expression and mucosal BHV1- and BRSV-specific IgA in nasal secretions following administration of IN or subcutaneous (SC) modified-live virus (MLV) booster vaccines 60 days after primary IN vaccination in young beef calves. Twenty-one beef calves were administered 2 mL of an IN MLV vaccine containing BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V (Inforce3®) between one and five weeks of age. Sixty days after primary vaccination, calves were randomly assigned to one of two groups: IN-MLV (n = 11): Calves received 2 mL of the same IN MLV vaccine used for primary vaccination and 2 mL of a SC MLV vaccine containing BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi- Shield GOLD® BVD). SC-MLV (n = 10): Calves were administered 2 mL of a MLV vaccine containing, BHV1, BRSV, BPI3V, and BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi-Shield GOLD® 5). Blood and nasal secretion samples were collected on days -61 (primary vaccination), -28, -14, 0 (booster vaccination), 14, 21, 28, 42 and 60 for determination of SNA titers, cytokine gene expression analysis and nasal virus-specific IgA concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures analysis through PROC GLIMMIX of SAS®. Booster vaccination by neither IN nor SC routes induced a significant increase in SNA titers against BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V. Subcutaneous booster vaccination induced significantly greater BRSV-specific SNA titers (on day 42) and IgA concentration in nasal secretions (on days 21 and 42) compared to calves receiving IN booster vaccination. Both IN and SC booster vaccination were able to stimulate the production of BHV1-specific IgA in nasal secretions. In summary, booster vaccination of young beef calves using either SC or IN route two months after IN MLV primary vaccination resulted in comparable SNA titers, cytokine gene expression profile and virus-specific IgA concentration in nasal secretions. Only a few differences in the systemic and mucosal immune response against BHV1 and BRSV were observed. Subcutaneous booster vaccination induced significantly greater BRSV-specific SNA and secretory IgA titers compared to IN booster vaccination.","Palomares, Roberto A; Bittar, João H J; Woolums, Amelia R; Hoyos-Jaramillo, Alejandro; Hurley, David J; Saliki, Jeremiah T; Ferrer, Maria S; Bullington, Anna C; Rodriguez, Adriana; Murray, Tyler; Thoresen, Merrilee; Jones, Katie; Stoskute, Agne",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,335,16

Given the disproportionate impacts of this pandemic on communities of color, it is essential for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to focus on how structural racism drives these disparate outcomes. In May and June 2020, we conducted a 6-state online survey to examine racial/ethnic differences in exposure to COVID-19, risk mitigation behaviors, risk perceptions, and COVID-19 impacts. Results show that Black and Hispanic individuals were more likely than White respondents to experience factors associated with structural racism (eg, living in larger households, going to work in person, using public transportation) that, by their very nature, increase the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. Controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, non-White respondents were equally or more likely than White respondents to take protective actions against COVID-19, including keeping distance from others and wearing masks. Black and Hispanic respondents also perceived higher risks of dying of the disease and of running out of money due to the pandemic, and 40% of Black respondents reported knowing someone who had died of COVID-19 at a time when the US death toll had just surpassed 100,000 people. To manage the current pandemic and prepare to combat future health crises in an effective, equitable, and antiracist manner, it is imperative to understand the structural factors perpetuating racial inequalities in the COVID-19 experience.","Dickinson, Katherine L; Roberts, Jennifer D; Banacos, Natalie; Neuberger, Lindsay; Koebele, Elizabeth; Blanch-Hartigan, Danielle; Shanahan, Elizabeth A",Health Secur,335,16

Thyroid antibody tests were unremarkable. Thyroid ultrasound showed mildly enlarged thyroid gland with no increased vascularity and 5-mm bilateral cysts. Thyroid dysfunction was attributed to subacute thyroiditis from COVID-19, methimazole was tapered, and prednisone was initiated. The patient's TFTs improved. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that clinicians keep a broad differential in individuals presenting with heart failure, and obtaining baseline TFTs may be reasonable. Rapid treatment of the underlying thyroiditis is important in these patients to improve the cardiovascular outcomes.

Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possible non-linear influences remain unknown. Data were analyzed from COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a single hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile range [IQR] 38-55, range 18-60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical disease course and the mean age was statistically significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased lymphocyte counts influence disease severity independently of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41-122.3; p = 0.039) are particularly associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 specifically in young patients, whereas no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. This study identified increased levels of complement C3 as a unique risk factor for adverse outcomes specific to young COVID-19 patients.","Cheng, Weiting; Hornung, Roman; Xu, Kai; Yang, Cai Hong; Li, Jian",Sci Rep,335,16

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence, severity, duration, risk factors and prognosis of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center analysis of 192 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March to May of 2020. AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) classification based on serum creatinine (SCr) criteria. Persistent and Transient AKI were defined according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup definitions. RESULTS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, 55.2% developed AKI (n=106). The majority of AKI patients had persistent AKI (n=64, 60.4%). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 18.2% (n=35) and was higher in AKI patients (28.3% vs 5.9%, p<0.001, unadjusted OR 6.03 (2.22-16.37), p<0.001).

Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 67 µg/mL (approx. 1.6 µM). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60-fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC 50 : 4084 µg/mL), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind stronger to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.","Nie, Chuanxiong; Pouyan, Paria; Lauster, Daniel; Trimpert, Jakob; Kerkhoff, Yannic; Szekeres, Gergo Peter; Wallert, Matthias; Block, Stephan; Sahoo, Anil Kumar; Dernedde, Jens; Pagel, Kevin; Kaufer, Benedikt B; Netz, Roland R; Ballauff, Matthias; Haag, Rainer",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,335,30

However, next-generation sequencing has not been used for routine viral detection in clinical respiratory samples owing to its sophisticated technology. Here, several pharyngeal samples with COPD were collected to enrich viral particles using an optimized method (M3), which involved M1 with centrifugation, filtration, and concentration, M2 (magnetic beads) combined with mixed nuclease digestion, and M4 with no pretreatment as a control. Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses showed that the M3 method for viral enrichment was superior in both viral sequencing composition and viral taxa when compared to M1, M2, and M4. M3 acquired the most viral reads and more complete sequences within 15-h performance, indicating that it might be feasible for viral detection in multiple respiratory samples in clinical practice. Based on sequence similarity analysis, 12 human viruses, including nine Anelloviruses and three coronaviruses, were characterized. Coronavirus OC43 with the largest number of viral reads accounted for nearly complete (99.8%) genome sequences, indicating that it may be a major viral pathogen involved in exacerbation of COPD.","Liu, Bo; Shao, Nan; Wang, Jing; Zhou, SiYu; Su, HaoXiang; Dong, Jie; Sun, LiLian; Li, Li; Zhang, Ting; Yang, Fan",Front Microbiol,335,16

Many infectious microbial and viral diseases have been shown to respond to A. annua and communities around the world use the plant as a medicinal tea, especially for treating malaria. AIM OF THE STUDY: SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Because of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of artemisinin that includes blockade of SARS-CoV-1, we queried whether A. annua suppressed SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, we measured anti SARS-CoV-2 activity against fully infectious virus of dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. IC50s were calculated and defined as the concentrations that inhibited viral replication by 50%; CC50s were also calculated and defined as the concentrations that kill 50% of cells. RESULTS: Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 0.1-8.7 µM, 0.01-0.14 µg, and 23.4-57.4 µg, respectively. Antiviral efficacy did not correlate with artemisinin or total flavonoid contents of the extracts. One dried leaf sample was >12 years old, yet its hot-water extract was still found to be active. The UK and South African variants, B1.1.7 and B1.351, were similarly inhibited. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 µM, and the clinically used artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC50 = 5.8 µM. Extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude above the antiviral IC90 values. CONCLUSIONS: A. annua extracts inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the active component(s) in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or a combination of components that block virus infection at a step downstream of virus entry. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Nair, M S; Huang, Y; Fidock, D A; Polyak, S J; Wagoner, J; Towler, M J; Weathers, P J",J Ethnopharmacol,335,20

METHODS: An online sub-study was conducted (5/21/2020-6/9/2020) among Black men who have sex with women, >18 years old, and who had previously enrolled in the parent study Check It (5/17/2017-3/16/2020) to assess changes in sexual behavior during the stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: Among 111 participants, from enrollment in Check It to during stay-at-home orders, recent vaginal sex declined from 96.4% to 47.8% (p<0.0001), reports of multiple female sex partners declined from 45.0% to 14.4% (p<0.0001), and sexual abstinence increased from 3.6% to 38.7% (p<0.0001). Among those who did have vaginal sex, condomless sex rates did not change between enrollment in Check it and the sub-study (64.5% vs. 67.9%, p=0.68). During stay-at-home orders oral sex, virtual sex, and pornography viewing were 40.5%, 42.3%, and 76.6%, respectively. Some (17.1%) acquired a new sex partner during stay-at-home orders and 44.1% left their home to meet a partner for sex. Only 27.9% had seen information about safe sex during the pandemic. Income was diminished for 62.2% and 23.4% moved away from New Orleans when stay-at-home orders were enacted. CONCLUSION: While there was an overall reduction in physical sex, half of participants reported physical sex, with many leaving their home to have sex during stay-at-home orders and many not using condoms. Others adopted sexual abstinence, increased virtual sex, and/or pornography viewing which may have protected them from both STIs and COVID-19.

METHODS: 1008 severe COVID-19 patients, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive detected with the mixed specimen of nasopharyngeal swab and oropharyngeal swab by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), were selected to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the 12 types of specimens by RT-qPCR during hospitalization. All of 20 discharged cases with COVID-19 were selected to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in isolation period with 7 types of specimens by RT-qPCR before releasing the isolation period. RESULTS: Of the enrolled 1008 severe patients, the nasopharyngeal swab specimens showed the highest positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (71.06%), followed by alveolar lavage fluid (66.67%), oropharyngeal swab (30.77%), sputum (28.53%), urine (16.30%), blood (12.5%), stool (12.21%), anal swab (11.22%) and corneal secretion (2.99%), and SARS-CoV-2 RNA couldn't be detected in other types of specimen in this study. Of the 20 discharged cases during the isolation period, the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 30% (6/20): 2 cases were positive in sputum at the eighth and ninth day after discharge, respectively, 1 case was positive in nasopharynx swab at the sixth day after discharge, 1 case was positive in anal swab at the eighth day after discharge, and 1 case was positive in 3 specimens (nasopharynx swab, oropharynx swab and sputum) simultaneously at the fourth day after discharge, and no positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in other specimens including stool, urine and blood at the discharged patients.

Colleges are now considering whether and how to expand hybrid or fully in-person instruction for future terms, and learn lessons from this experience for future use. Our paper uses Fall 2019 enrollment data for a medium-sized public American university to analyze whether some student groupings by class standing or course level are more susceptible to the spread of infectious disease through academic enrollment networks. Replicating Weeden and Cornwell [8], we find that enrollment networks at the institution are""small worlds""characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent connections. Connectivity decreases as class standing (graduate vs. undergraduate; senior vs. freshman) and course level increase; as students move from generalized to specialized course loads, networks cluster by major. Holding other factors constant, policies focusing on in-person instruction for lower division students conflict with the greater risk of infectious spread through a lower division network in the absence of additional steps to minimize academic connectivity. There are academic and financial incentives for emphasizing the freshman experience, including concerns about student attrition from the first to second academic year and recouping costs of infrastructure investments in dormitories. Possible solutions could include (i) restricting face-to-face or hybrid instruction to courses in students' academic majors, which would disrupt larger networks into smaller ones and thus restrict the spread of infection across majors, and (ii) take a""scalpel""approach to instruction modes by moving online courses most likely to facilitate epidemic spread.","Subramanian, Kailash; Williams, Joshua M.; DeAnda, Daniel C.; Agrawal, Aditya A.; Racila, Andrei; Prabhu, Aditi R.; Redlinger, Lawrence; Wendt, Christopher; Prakash, Ravi",,335,24

We propose an extended SEIR model and daily data of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the seven largest European countries to forecast possible pandemic dynamics by investigating the effects of infection vulnerability stratification and measures on preventing the spread of infection. We assume that (i) the number of cases would be underestimated at the beginning of a new virus pandemic due to the lack of effective diagnostic methods and (ii) people more susceptible to infection are more likely to become infected; whereas during the later stages, the chances of infection among others will be reduced, thereby potentially leading to pandemic cessation. Based on infection vulnerability stratification, we demonstrate effects brought by the fraction of infected persons in the population at the start of pandemic deceleration on the cumulative fraction of the infected population. We interestingly show that moderate and long-lasting preventive measures are more effective than more rigid measures, which tend to be eventually loosened or abandoned due to economic losses, delay the peak of infection and fail to reduce the total number of cases. Our calculations relate the pandemic's second wave to high seasonal fluctuations and a low vulnerability stratification coefficient. Our characterisation of basic reproduction dynamics indicates that second wave of the pandemic is likely to first occur in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, and a second wave is also possible in the U.K. and the U.S. Our findings show that even if the total elimination of the virus is impossible, the total number of infected people can be reduced during the deceleration stage.","Kumar, Ajay; Choi, Tsan-Ming; Wamba, Samuel Fosso; Gupta, Shivam; Tan, Kim Hua",Ann Oper Res,335,16

In an attempt to respond to this emergency, researchers worldwide are intensively studying the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this study, a Susceptible - Infected - Removed - Sick (SIRSi) compartmental model is proposed, which is a modification of the classical Susceptible - Infected - Removed (SIR) model. The proposed model considers the possibility of unreported or asymptomatic cases, and differences in the immunity within a population, i.e., the possibility that the acquired immunity may be temporary, which occurs when adopting one of the parameters ( Î³ ) other than zero. Local asymptotic stability and endemic equilibrium conditions are proved for the proposed model. The model is adjusted to the data from three major cities of the state of São Paulo in Brazil, namely, São Paulo, Santos, and Campinas, providing estimations of duration and peaks related to the disease propagation. This study reveals that temporary immunity favors a second wave of infection and it depends on the time interval for a recovered person to be susceptible again.

Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in Saudi Arabia between November 2019 and March 2020 at the outpatient IBD clinics. The HRQoL of patients was assessed using the 10-item IBD-disk questionnaire. Results: A total of 59 IBD patients (40 Crohn's disease, 19 Ulcerative colitis) with a mean disease duration of 3.5 years were included. Most of the patients (77.97%) were on biologics while 35.59% were on immune modulators, 16.94% on 5-ASA, and 3.38% were on corticosteroids. There was no difference between any of the 10 IBD-disk variables pre and post-COVID-19 pandemic apart from the perception of body image, where there was a slightly more negative perception with an increase from 2.53 to 3.39 (P = 0.05) There was no significant difference in HRQoL between patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in any of domains.

OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with anosmia and ageusia and the recovery from these symptoms in an ethnically diverse cohort. METHODS: Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 were eligible for the study. Randomly selected participants answered a telephone questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms with a focus on anosmia and ageusia. Additionally, relevant past medical history and data on the COVID-19 clinical course were obtained from electronic medical records. 486 patients were in the COVID-19 group and 103 were COVID-19-negative. RESULTS: Patients who were younger were more likely to report anosmia and/or ageusia (odds ratio (OR) for anosmia per 1-year increase in age: 0·98, 95%CI:0-97-0·99, p = 0·003; for ageusia: 0·98, 95%CI:0·97-0·99, p = 0·005) as were patients with lower eosinophil counts (OR for anosmia per 0.1-K/µL increase in eosinophils: 0·02, 95%CI:0·001-0·46, p = 0·01, for ageusia 0·10, 95%CI:0·01-0·97, p = 0·047). Male gender was independently associated with a lower probability of ageusia (OR:0·56, 95%CI:0·38-0·82, p = 0·003) and earlier sense of taste recovery (HR:1·44, 95%CI:1·05-1·98, p = 0·02). Latinos showed earlier sense of taste recovery than white patients (HR:1·82, 95%CI:1·05-3·18, p = 0·03). CONCLUSION: Anosmia and ageusia were more common among younger patients and those with lower blood eosinophil counts. Ageusia was less commonly reported among men, and time to taste recovery was earlier among both men and Latinos.","Sehanobish, Esha; Barbi, Mali; Fong, Valerie; Kravitz, Meryl; Sanchez Tejera, Denise; Asad, Mohammad; Matsumura, Cynthia; Ferastraoaru, Denisa; O039,; Neill, Meaghan; Karagic, Merhunisa; Akbar, Nadeem; Bottalico, Danielle M; Patel, Viraj; Peshansky, Alexandre; Rangareddy, Mahendra; Hudes, Golda; Kim, Mimi; Eisenberg, Ruth; Nath, Avindra; Smith, Bryan R; Ow, Thomas J; Jerschow, Elina",Am J Rhinol Allergy,335,1

It is believed that this may be due to public anxiety about acquiring COVID-19 infection in hospital and the subsequent risk of mortality. AIM: To identify patients who acquire COVID-19 in hospital (nosocomial COVID-19 infection (NC)) and their risk of mortality compared to those with community-acquired COVID-19 (CAC) infection. METHODS: The COPE-Nosocomial Study was an observational cohort study. The primary outcome was the time to all-cause mortality (estimated with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)), and secondary outcomes were day 7 mortality and the time-to-discharge. A mixed-effects multivariable Cox's proportional hazards model was used, adjusted for demographics and comorbidities. FINDINGS: The study included 1564 patients from 10 hospital sites throughout the UK, and one in Italy, and collected outcomes on patients admitted up to April 28th, 2020. In all, 12.5% of COVID-19 infections were acquired in hospital; 425 (27.2%) patients with COVID died. The median survival time in NC patients was 14 days compared with 10 days in CAC patients. In the primary analysis, NC infection was associated with lower mortality rate (aHR: 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.98). Secondary outcomes found no difference in day 7 mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.47-1.31), but NC patients required longer time in hospital during convalescence (aHR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.37-0.66). CONCLUSION: The minority of COVID-19 cases were the result of NC transmission. No COVID-19 infection comes without risk, but patients with NC had a lower risk of mortality compared to CAC infection; however, caution should be taken when interpreting this finding.","Carter, B; Collins, J T; Barlow-Pay, F; Rickard, F; Bruce, E; Verduri, A; Quinn, T J; Mitchell, E; Price, A; Vilches-Moraga, A; Stechman, M J; Short, R; Einarsson, A; Braude, P; Moug, S; Myint, P K; Hewitt, J; Pearce, L; McCarthy, K",J Hosp Infect,335,1

However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","Qiu, Ye; Zhao, Yuan-Bo; Wang, Qiong; Li, Jin-Yan; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Liao, Ce-Heng; Ge, Xing-Yi",Microbes Infect,335,20

RECENT FINDINGS: Although a majority of pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, pregnancy puts women at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and adverse birth outcomes. Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to intensive care units and receive mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant patients with COVID-19, although preexisting maternal comorbidities are significant risk factors.Early provision of neuraxial labor analgesia with a functional indwelling epidural catheter has been universally promoted, with the goal to reduce avoidable general anesthesia for cesarean delivery and mitigate risks for healthcare workers during airway manipulation. This recommendation, along with updated workflow models of anesthesia coverage, may contribute to a reduction in general anesthesia rates. SUMMARY: Initial recommendations to provide early neuraxial labor analgesia and avoid general anesthesia for cesarean delivery have not changed over time. Although workflows have significantly changed to allow continued patient and healthcare workers' safety, clinical anesthesia protocols for labor and delivery are essentially the same.","Bernstein, Kyra; Landau, Ruth",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,335,1

The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable on surfaces and in aerosols, means indirect contact transmission can occur and so there is an opportunity to reduce transmission using effective disinfectants in public and communal spaces. Virusend (TX-10), a novel disinfectant, has been developed as a highly effective disinfectant against a range of microbial agents. Here we investigate the ability of Virusend (TX-10) to inactivation SARS-CoV-2. Using surface and solution inactivation assays, we show that Virusend (TX-10) is able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titre by 4log 10 PFU/mL within 1 minute of contact. Ensuring disinfectants are highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 is important in eliminating environmental sources of the virus to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Anderson, Enyia R; Hughes, Grant L; Patterson, Edward I",,335,21

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the ß-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide valuable insights on the molecular basis of the specificity of ß-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptor adaptation of circulating and future novel ß-CoVs.","Pontes, Camila; Ruiz-Serra, Victoria; Lepore, Rosalba; Valencia, Alfonso",,335,16

Deletion of the last 36 amino acids of the CTD transforms TRPM8 into a reduced temperature-sensitivity channel (Q10 â¼4). Exposing the intracellular domain to a denaturing agent increases the energy required to open the channel indicating that cold drives channel gating by stabilizing the folded state of the CTD.

This has been exacerbated with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of digital pathology and whole slide imaging (WSI) as an educational tool for distance teaching is underutilised and not fully exploited. This paper highlights the utility and feedback on the use of WSI for distance education/teaching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Building on an existing relationship with the University of the West Indies (UWI), pathologists at University Health Network, Toronto, provided distance education using WSI, a digitised slide image hosting repository and videoconferencing facilities to provide case-based teaching to 15 UWI pathology trainees. Feedback was obtained from residents via a questionnaire and from teachers via a discussion. RESULTS: There was uniform support from teachers who felt that teaching was not hampered by the 'virtual' engagement. Comfort levels grew with each engagement and technical issues with sound diminished with the use of a portable speaker. The residents were very supportive and enthusiastic in embracing this mode of teaching. While technical glitches marred initial sessions, the process evened out especially when the slide hosting facility, teleconferencing and sound issues were changed. CONCLUSIONS: There was unanimous endorsement that use of WSI was the future, especially for distance teaching. However, it was not meant to supplant the use of glass slides in their current routine, daily practice.","Evans, Andrew John; Depeiza, Nadia; Allen, Shara-Gaye; Fraser, Kimone; Shirley, Suzanne; Chetty, Runjan",J. clin. pathol,335,20

Here, the generation of a deep stabilizer for ultra-fast, label-free MS detection and the application of this method for serum metabolic diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) are reported. Nanoparticle-assisted laser desorption/ionization-MS is used to achieve direct metabolic analysis of trace unprocessed serum in seconds. Furthermore, a deep stabilizer is constructed to map native MS results to high-quality results obtained by established methods. Finally, using the newly developed protocol and diagnosis variation characteristic surface to characterize sensitivity/specificity and variation, CHD is diagnosed with advanced accuracy in a high-throughput/speed manner. This work advances design of metabolic analysis tools for disease detection as it provides a direct label-free, ultra-fast, and stabilized platform for future protocol development in clinics.","Zhang, Mengji; Huang, Lin; Yang, Jing; Xu, Wei; Su, Haiyang; Cao, Jing; Wang, Qian; Pu, Jun; Qian, Kun",Adv Sci (Weinh),335,10

Hospitals responded by expanding services to accommodate the forecasted rise in COVID-19-related admissions. We describe the effects these changes had on management of orthopaedic trauma and patient outcomes at a district general hospital in Southern England. Methods: Data were extrapolated retrospectively from two separate 6-week periods in 2019 and 2020 (1st April-13th May) using electronic records of patients referred to the orthopaedic team. Soft tissue injuries were included where a confirmed diagnosis was made with radiological evidence. Patients were excluded if no orthopaedic intervention was required. Data were compared between the two time periods. Results: There were fewer attendances to hospital in 2020 compared with 2019 (178 vs. 328), but time from presentation to surgery significantly increased in 2020 (2.94 days vs. 4.91 days, p = 0.009). There were fewer operative complications in 2020 (36/145 vs. 11/88, p < 0.001). However, ordinal logistic regression analysis found a significantly greater complication severity in 2020 including death (p = 0.039). Complication severity was unrelated to COVID-19 status. Conclusions: Restructuring of orthopaedic services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant delays to surgery and higher post-operative complication severity. Our results demonstrate the need for fast-track emergency operative orthopaedic services in UK district general hospitals whilst the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Patel, B A; Green, S F; Henessy, C; Adamu-Biu, F; Davda, K; Chennagiri, R; Kankate, R; Ghani, Y",Indian J Orthop,335,30

Anecdotal reports suggest that social distancing, exposure avoidance, and restrictions on travel may have impacted the incidence of asthma exacerbations. Methods: CHRONICLE is an observational study of specialist-treated US adults (aged ≥18 years) with SA. At enrollment, patients must be: (1) receiving FDAapproved monoclonal antibody therapy for SA;(2) receiving systemic corticosteroids (SCS) or other systemic immunosuppressants for ≥50% of the prior 12 months;or (3) persistently uncontrolled while treated with highdosage inhaled corticosteroids and additional controllers. Specialists report all exacerbations and asthma hospitalizations for enrolled patients from 12 months prior to enrollment, with updates provided every 6 months. To describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, we calculated the incidence of these events by month from July 2018 to May 2020 (latest month with complete data) among patients enrolled through November 2020. Results: Among enrolled patients (N=2633), specialist-reported exacerbations and asthma hospitalizations declined significantly in April and May 2020, following varying state/local COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders and social distancing recommendations. Relative to the average rates from July 2018 to March 2020, exacerbations (Figure panel A) and asthma hospitalizations (Figure panel B) were 47% and 57% lower, respectively, in April 2020 and 72% and 74% lower, respectively, in May 2020. Relative to the same months in 2019, exacerbations and asthma hospitalizations were 49% and 58% lower, respectively, in April 2020 and 67% and 74% lower, respectively, in May 2020. Conclusions: There was a notable decline in exacerbations and asthma hospitalizations among US patients with SA coincident with COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders and social distancing recommendations. Reasons for these declines are likely multifactorial and may be explained by reduced viral infections due to reduced social contact, altered patient behavior, and possibly reduced access to care. Rates in later months will be evaluated as data become available.","Moore, W. C.; Ledford, D. K.; Carstens, D.; Ambrose, C. S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,335,21

In early 2020, we saw an increase in panic buying as a response to a real and/or perceived lack of resources due to COVID-19. Although panic buying has a long history, there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon. During the early days of COVID-19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty. These negative emotions were, in part, a response to a real shortage of basic supplies. However, the panic response led to behaviors that, for some individuals, resulted in atypical buying patterns. From a therapeutic perspective, one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions, and how this impacts the associated behaviors. This article will focus on psychodynamic understandings of panic buying as a response to events that result in negative emotions. By providing a psychodynamic understanding of panic buying, authors hope to contribute to the therapy of clients presenting with related behaviors and their associated negative affect.","Cooper, Marty A; Gordon, Jamie L",Front Public Health,335,28

Establishing new supply chains in the context of global shortages presented significant challenges. This report describes the development of an innovative platform developed rapidly and voluntarily by clinical engineers, to mobilise the UK's shared medical equipment inventory, in order to match ICU capacity to dynamically evolving clinical demand. The 'Coronavirus ICU Medical Equipment Distribution' platform was developed to optimise ICU equipment allocation, distribution, collection, redeployment and traceability across the National Health Service. Although feedback on the platform has largely been very positive, the platform was built for a scenario that did not fully materialise in the UK and this affected the implementation approach. As such, it was not used to its full potential. Nonetheless, the platform and the insights derived and disseminated in its development have been extremely valuable. It provides a prototype for not only optimising system capacity in future pandemic scenarios but also a means for maximally exploiting the large amount of new equipment in the UK health system, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This early stage innovation has demonstrated that a system-wide pooled information resource can benefit the operations of individual organisations.

There is an instant need to discover how the new variants interact with the host receptor (ACE2). Among the reported mutations in the Spike glycoprotein of the new variants, three are specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and required insightful scrutiny for new therapeutic options. These structural evolutions in the RBD domain may impart a critical role to the unique pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 new variants. Herein, using structural and biophysical approaches, we explored that the specific mutations in the UK (N501Y), South African (K417N-E484K-N501Y), Brazilian (K417T-E484K-N501Y), and hypothetical (N501Y-E484K) variants alter the binding affinity, create new inter-protein contacts and changes the internal structural dynamics thereby increases the binding and eventually the infectivity. Our investigation highlighted that the South African (K417N-E484K-N501Y), Brazilian (K417T-E484K-N501Y) variants are more lethal than the UK variant (N501Y). The behavior of the wild type and N501Y is comparable. Free energy calculations further confirmed that increased binding of the spike RBD to the ACE2 is mainly due to the electrostatic contribution. Further, we find that the unusual virulence of this virus is potentially the consequence of Darwinian selection-driven epistasis in protein evolution. The triple mutants (South African and Brazilian) may pose a serious threat to the efficacy of the already developed vaccine. Our analysis would help to understand the binding and structural dynamics of the new mutations in the RBD domain of the Spike protein and demand further investigation in in vitro and in vivo models to design potential therapeutics against the new variants.","Khan, Abbas; Zia, Tauqir; Suleman, Muhammad; Khan, Taimoor; Ali, Syed Shujait; Abbasi, Aamir Ali; Mohammad, Anwar; Wei, Dong-Qing",J. cell. physiol,335,1

Testicular torsion is an emergent condition with higher risk of testicular loss with longer ischemic times. We sought to investigate whether patients with testicular torsion had longer time from symptom onset to initial presentation, longer total ischemic time, and higher rate of orchiectomy during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using billing data, we identified all patients age >1yo seen in our hospital from 1/1/2018 through 5/31/2020 who underwent emergent scrotal exploration for confirmed testicular torsion, comparing the COVID-19 crisis (3/1/2020-5/31/20) to the pre-COVID-19 period (1/1/2018-2/29/20). The primary outcome was time from symptom onset to initial presentation and secondary outcomes were ischemic time (time from symptom onset to entry of the OR) and orchiectomy rate. Parameters were compared with Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests; Poisson regression compared rates of torsion. RESULTS: Of 94 total cases, 77 occurred during the pre-COVID-19 period and 17 during the COVID-19 crisis. Median time from symptom onset to initial presentation was not significantly different (2.4 h [IQR 1.1 h-38.9] during COVID-19 vs. 5.6 h [IQR 1.6-16.9] during pre-COVID-19 period, p = 0.476). Time to presentation was >12 h in 5/17 patients (29%) during COVID-19 and 24/77 patients (31%) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 1.00). Median ischemic time during COVID-19 was 7.5 h (IQR 4.7 h-45.5 h) compared to 9.4 h (IQR 5.4 h-22.5 h) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 0.694). Incidence of orchiectomy in our center was 29% (5/17) during COVID-19 and 17% (13/77) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 0.397). About half of patients were seen initially at outside facilities prior to arrival (47% [8/17] during COVID-19 vs. 49% [38/77] during pre-COVID-19 period, p = 1.00). The number of torsion case presentations per week to our facility increased from 0.7 cases/week in the pre-COVID-19 period to 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p = 0.015); when comparing only the March 1 to May 31 calendar period, there were 0.6 cases/week during the pre-COVID-19 period and 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Time to presentation, ischemic times, and orchiectomy rates for testicular torsion at our center were not significantly different during the COVID-19 period compared to the preceding 2 year period. The number of torsion case per week presenting to our facility increased significantly.","Nelson, Caleb P; Kurtz, Michael P; Logvinenko, Tanya; Venna, Alyssia; McNamara, Erin R",J Pediatr Urol,335,15

For this purpose, we extend the multivariate time-series model for infection counts proposed in Paul and Held (Stat Med 30(10):118-1136, 2011) by augmenting the model specification with B-spline regressors in order to account for complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics in the propagation of the disease. The results of the model estimated on the time series of the number of infections for the Italian provinces show that the containment measures, despite being globally effective in reducing both the spread of contagion and its self-sustaining dynamics, have had nonlinear impacts across provinces. The impact has been relatively stronger in the northern local areas, where the disease occurred earlier and with a greater incidence.

O ensaio foi conduzido pelo teste de potência com desafio em hamsters. A vacina experimental, bivalente foi inativada com fenol a 37%, ajustada para concentração de 108 leptospiras por mL, por sorovar e produzida nas versões com e sem adjuvante hidróxido de alumínio a 0,15%. Os hamsters foram imunizados com 0,25 mL de vacina, via subcutânea em duas aplicações com 15 dias de intervalo. Os desafios foram efetuados com as estirpes LO4 (Canicola) ou L1-130 (Copenhageni) isoladas no Brasil, respectivamente nas diluições de 10-3 e 10-1 no volume de 0,5 mL via intraperitoneal por animal, 15 dias após a última dose da vacina. A estirpe de desafio do sorovar Copenhageni foi caracterizada, por anticorpos monoclonais, como idêntica a M64/06 e foi escolhida devido a apresentar melhor regularidade em termos de patogenicidade para os hamsters.

Nos desafios efetuados com a estirpe autóctone, L1-130 do sorovar Copenhageni foi obtida a proteção contra a doença clínica em oito de dez animais, para as duas vacinas experimentais, no entanto, entre os sobreviventes, houve portadores renais de leptospiras, em maior número para a vacina sem adjuvante (n=5), quando comparado a vacina acrescida de Al(OH)3, (n=3); para a vacina comercial a proteção foi total, tanto contra a doença como quanto a infecção não havendo qualquer morte por leptospirose e todos os cultivos renais dos sobreviventes foram negativos para leptospiras. Nos desafios efetuados com a estirpe autóctone, LO4 do sorovar Canicola, a proteção conferida pelas três vacinas ensaiadas foi total, não havendo mortes por leptospirose e todos os sobreviventes apresentaram resultados negativos para leptospiras nos cultivos de tecido renal. Os números de DL50 empregadas nos inóculos de desafio foram superiores a 10.000, para os dois sorovares ensaiados, pois na titulação dos inóculos morreram mais do que 50% dos animais até a última diluição testada. Foi, portanto, demonstrado a existência de proteção cruzada entre os sorovares Copenhageni e Icterohaemorrhagiae e que a bacterina importada foi capaz de induzir proteção contra a doença e contra a infecção para estirpes de leptospiras autóctones dos sorovares Canicola e Copenhageni isoladas no Brasil. Nos desafios efetuados com o sorovar Canicola a vacina experimental induziu proteção contra a doença e contra a infecção, mas nos que empregaram o sorovar Copenhageni houve proteção apenas contra a doença, constatando-se menor número de portadores renais de leptospiras entre os animais imunizados com a bacterina experimental acrescida do adjuvante de hidróxido de alumínio","Mucciolo, Giancarlo Balotim",,335,6

To promote public adherence to these regimes, governments need to understand the public perceptions and attitudes toward NPI regimes and the factors that influence them. Twitter data offer a means to capture these insights. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries and compare the trends in public perceptions and attitudes toward NPIs across these countries. The aim is to identify factors that influenced public perceptions and attitudes about NPI regimes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 777,869 English language tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was assessed using a Pearson correlation analysis. Topic modeling was used to isolate tweets about NPIs. A comparative analysis of NPIs between countries was conducted. RESULTS: The proportion of NPI-related topics, relative to all topics, varied between countries. The New Zealand data set displayed the greatest attention to NPIs, and the US data set showed the lowest. The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was statistically significant only for Australia (r=0.837, P<.001) and New Zealand (r=0.747, P<.001). Topic modeling produced 131 topics related to one of 22 NPIs, grouped into seven NPI categories: Personal Protection (n=15), Social Distancing (n=9), Testing and Tracing (n=10), Gathering Restrictions (n=18), Lockdown (n=42), Travel Restrictions (n=14), and Workplace Closures (n=23). While less restrictive NPIs gained widespread support, more restrictive NPIs were perceived differently across countries. Four characteristics of these regimes were seen to influence public adherence to NPIs: timeliness of implementation, NPI campaign strategies, inconsistent information, and enforcement strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter offers a means to obtain timely feedback about the public response to COVID-19 NPI regimes. Insights gained from this analysis can support government decision making, implementation, and communication strategies about NPI regimes, as well as encourage further discussion about the management of NPI programs for global health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Doogan, Caitlin; Buntine, Wray; Linger, Henry; Brunt, Samantha",J Med Internet Res,335,16

Early reports identify protective roles for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We leveraged our bioinformatics binding prediction tools for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and HLA-II alleles that were developed using mass spectrometry-based profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict peptide binding to diverse allele sets. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family and specifically focused on T cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We assayed a subset of these epitopes in a T cell induction assay for their ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses. RESULTS: We first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then utilized our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,897 HLA-I and 8046 HLA-II candidate peptides which were highly ranked for binding across 13 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. These peptides are predicted to provide over 99% allele coverage for the US, European, and Asian populations. From our SARS-CoV-2-predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 374 pairs identically matched what was previously reported in the ViPR database, originating from other coronaviruses with identical sequences. Of these pairs, 333 (89%) had a positive HLA binding assay result, reinforcing the validity of our predictions. We then demonstrated that a subset of these highly predicted epitopes were immunogenic based on their recognition by specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, we characterized the expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in virally infected cells to prioritize those which could be potential targets for T cell immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Using our bioinformatics platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes that are potential targets for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population. We also confirm that our binding predictors can predict epitopes eliciting CD8+ T cell responses from multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Protein expression and population HLA allele coverage, combined with the ability to identify T cell epitopes, should be considered in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design strategies and immune monitoring.","Poran, Asaf; Harjanto, Dewi; Malloy, Matthew; Arieta, Christina M; Rothenberg, Daniel A; Lenkala, Divya; van Buuren, Marit M; Addona, Terri A; Rooney, Michael S; Srinivasan, Lakshmi; Gaynor, Richard B",Genome Med,335,1

METHODS: Preterm infants <32 weeks' gestation were prospectively imaged with 3 T MRI near term. CSO and CMAP were retrospectively summed over the first 14 and 28 days. Neurodevelopment was assessed at 30 months adjusted using the Bayley-III. ROC and linear regression were used to evaluate the relationship between CSO, CMAP, and BPD with WMI and neurodevelopmental performance, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 87 infants, 30 (34.5%) had moderate-severe BPD, which was associated with WMI (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.1-34.9, p = 0.012). CSO and CMAP predicted WMI as well as BPD (AUC 0.68-0.77). CSO was independently associated with decreased language and cognitive performance (mean difference at 14 days: -11.0, 95% CI -19.8 to -2.2, p = 0.015 and -9.8, 95% CI -18.9 to -0.7, p = 0.035, respectively) at 30 months adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: BPD precursors predict WMI as well as BPD. Cumulative supplemental oxygen over the first 14 days of life is independently associated with lower language and cognitive performances. These data suggest that early respiratory status influences the risk of adverse neurodevelopment in preterm infants. IMPACT: Respiratory precursors to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cumulative supplemental oxygen and mean airway pressure, over the first 14-28 days performed as well as BPD for the prediction of white matter injury on MRI in preterm infants.Cumulative supplemental oxygen was independently associated with lower language and cognitive performance on the Bayley-III at 30 months adjusted.These data suggest that early respiratory status may help explain why BPD is independently associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the preterm population and highlights the importance of interventions targeting respiratory status as a potential avenue to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Grelli, Kimberly N; Keller, Roberta L; Rogers, Elizabeth E; Colin Partridge, J; Xu, Duan; James Barkovich, A; Gano, Dawn",Pediatr. res,335,23

METHODS: A total of 244 inpatients aged &#8805; 60 years with COVID-19 were included in this study, of whom 52 were clinically diagnosed and 192 were microbiologically diagnosed. Clinical and laboratory data on hospital admission and outcomes (discharged or died in hospital) of all patients were retrieved from medical records retrospectively. Patients who met the criteria for clinical diagnosis with negative virus test results were assigned to the clinical diagnosis group, whereas those with positive virus test results were assigned to the microbiological diagnosis group. After univariate analyses, two propensity score analyses [i.e., covariate adjustment using propensity score (CAPS) and propensity score matching (PSM)] were conducted to control bias. RESULTS: The clinical and microbiological diagnosis groups demonstrated significant differences in outcomes and in the majority of laboratory findings. After propensity score analyses, many differences between the two groups disappeared and the rate of mortality had no statistically significant difference (P = 0.318 and 0.828 for CAPS and PSM, respectively).

The three components are (a) nearly simultaneous self-testing for the pathogen by an entire population, followed rapidly by (b) nearly simultaneous self-isolation of carriers, and (c) secondary screening at entrances to facilities where people congregate. After a period of preparation lasting roughly 5-10 weeks, these steps could and probably should be taken in a single day. The power of this methodology has already been demonstrated in varying degrees with groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 11 million. Although this plan might seem daunting, its costs are minimal compared to the losses we have incurred by relying on half measures, and the US and other countries have the technological, logistical, and industrial capacities to implement this plan in a matter of weeks. With proper messaging during the weeks leading up to the testing, compliance in such a program is likely to be high given the potential benefits, and because participation is voluntary and testing is noninvasive, the legal and ethical issues associated with such a program are minimal - trivial, in fact, compared to those associated with imposing a months-long lockdown on an entire population. A SIRD/CSP model suggests that the single-day testing and separation procedure will substantially lower the number of infections, even if compliance with the procedure is modest. Modeling also suggests that when long-term secondary screening is added to the 1-day procedure, over time, the pathogen is eradicated from the population. This can occur even when compliance with secondary screening is itself relatively low.","Epstein, Robert; Houser, Connan; Wang, Ruixiao",Front Public Health,335,20

A triad of hypotension, tachycardia, and facial flushing seems provoked by prostacyclin (PGI2) release from the gut in response to mesenteric traction. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibits PGI2 release, stabilizing the hemodynamic response. Here, we examined the effect of mesenteric traction on splanchnic blood flow in pigs randomized to NSAID or placebo treatment. Materials and Methods: Twenty pigs were allocated to either ketorolac or placebo treatment. Five minutes of manual mesenteric traction was applied. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1&#945;, a stable metabolite of PGI2, hemodynamic variables, and regional blood flow (laser speckle contrast imaging) to the liver, stomach, small intestine, upper lip, and snout (laser Doppler flowmetry) were recorded prior to traction and 5 and 30 minutes thereafter. Results: Both groups of pigs presented a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (P = .01), mean arterial blood pressure (P = .001), and blood flow in the gastric antrum (P = .002). Plasma 6-keto-PGF1&#945; did not increase in either group (P = .195), and cardiac output, heart rate, central venous pressure, and blood flow to the liver, small intestine, upper lip, and snout remained unchanged. Conclusion: Mesenteric traction resulted in cardiovascular depression, including reduced blood flow in the gastric antrum. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1&#945; did not increase, and ketorolac administration did not alter the response to mesenteric traction. Furthers studies are needed to identify which substance is responsible for eliciting the cardiovascular response to mesenteric traction in pigs.","Strandby, Rune B; Osterkamp, Jens T F; Ambrus, Rikard; Henriksen, Amelie; Goetze, Jens P; Secher, Niels H; Achiam, Michael P; Svendsen, Lars-Bo",Animal Model Exp Med,335,16

RESULTS: Unlike the C-group (baseline ""T0"" to post-infusion ""T1"" interval 294±97 vs 238±71 mmHg respectively, p=0.04 ±SD), the Mg-group exhibited preserved intraoperative PaO2 (T0 to T1 interval 271±89 vs 257±53 mmHg respectively, p=0.54 ±SD) and PaO2 /FiO2 (C-group T0 to T1 interval 404±81 vs 349±84, p=0.04 and Mg- group 394±91 vs 379±95, p=0.61, respectively), and these effects were modest. Further, compared to the C-group, the Mg-group exhibited lower airway resistance, dead space, airway plateau pressure, and peak airway pressure, and higher dynamic compliance. The postoperative PaO2 and PaO2 /FiO2 were higher in the Mg-group compared to the C-group. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative infusion of MgSO4 in patients with moderate COPD undergoing laryngectomy surgery under GA produces mild perioperative protective effects on both arterial oxygenation and lung mechanics.","Ahmed, Abeer; Sayed, Ahmed H; Elkholy, Jehan; Elshal, Sahar; Badwy, Abdelrahman; Abdelhamid, Bassant; Ollaek, Mohamed",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,335,1

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in the host cells as a receptor of Spike-I Glycoprotein of COVID-19 which causes final infection. ACE2 is highly expressed in the bladder, ileum, kidney and liver, comparing with ACE2 expression in the lung-specific pulmonary alveolar type II cells. In this study, the single-cell RNAseq data of the five tissues from different humans are curated and cell types with high expressions of ACE2 are identified. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction networks have been established. From the network, potential biomarkers which can form functional hubs, are selected based on k-means network clustering. It is observed that angiotensin PPAR family proteins show important roles in the functional hubs. To understand the functions of the potential markers, corresponding pathways have been researched thoroughly through the pathway semantic networks. Subsequently, the pathways have been ranked according to their influence and dependency in the network using PageRank algorithm. The outcomes show some important facts in terms of infection. Firstly, renin-angiotensin system and PPAR signaling pathway can play a vital role for enhancing the infection after its intrusion through ACE2. Next, pathway networks consist of few basic metabolic and influential pathways, e.g. insulin resistance. This information corroborate the fact that diabetic patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the key regulators of the aforementioned pathways are angiontensin and PPAR family proteins. Hence, angiotensin and PPAR family proteins can be considered as possible therapeutic targets.

METHODS: We searched the Cochrane, Medline, Trip, and EMBASE databases from 2019. The review included all available studies of COVID-19 patients published in the English language and studied the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and disease outcomes from the beginning of the pandemic. Two authors extracted studies characteristics and the risk of bias. Odds ratio (OR) was used to analyze the data with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The review included 1,885 COVID-19 patients from 7 observational studies with some degree of bias risk and substantial heterogeneity. A significant association was recorded between COVID-19 severity and the following variables: male (OR= 1.60, 95%CI= 1.05 - 2.43); current smoker (OR=2.06, 95%CI= 1.08 - 3.94); and the presence of comorbidities including hypertension (OR=2.05, 95%CI= 1.56 - 2.70), diabetes (OR=2.46, 95%CI= 1.53 - 3.96), coronary heart disease (OR=4.10, 95%CI= 2.36 - 7.12), chronic kidney disease (OR=4.06, 95%CI= 1.45 - 11.35), and cancer (OR=2.28, 95%CI= 1.08 - 4.81).

This finding proves robust to alternative measures of NPI adoption speed, model specifications that control for testing, other NPIs, and mobility and across various samples (national, the Northeast, excluding New York, and excluding the Northeast). We also find that the adoption speed of NPIs is associated with lower infections and is unrelated to non-COVID deaths, suggesting these measures slowed contagion.

To date, little is known about the characteristics of pulmonary auscultation in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the features and clinical significance of pulmonary auscultation in COVID-19 pneumonia using an electronic stethoscope in isolation wards. METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Wuhan Red-Cross Hospital during the period from January 27, 2020, to February 12, 2020. Standard auscultation with an electronic stethoscope was performed and electronic recordings of breath sounds were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients with average age of 60.6 years were enrolled. The most common symptoms were cough (73.7%) during auscultation. Most cases had bilateral lesions (96.4%) such as multiple ground-glass opacities (69.1%) and fibrous stripes (21.8%). High-quality auscultation recordings (98.8%) were obtained, and coarse breath sounds, wheezes, coarse crackles, fine crackles, and Velcro crackles were identified. Most cases had normal breath sounds in upper lungs, but the proportions of abnormal breath sounds increased in the basal fields where Velcro crackles were more commonly identified at the posterior chest. The presence of fine and coarse crackles detected 33/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 84.6% and specificity 12.5%) and 8/9 patients with consolidation (sensitivity 88.9% and specificity 15.2%), while the presence of Velcro crackles identified 16/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 41% and specificity 81.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal breath sounds in COVID-19 pneumonia had some consistent distributive characteristics and to some extent correlated with the radiologic features. Such evidence suggests that electronic auscultation is useful to aid diagnosis and timely management of the disease. Further studies are indicated to validate the accuracy and potential clinical benefit of auscultation in detecting pulmonary abnormalities in COVID-19 infection.","Wang, Bo; Liu, Yanbin; Wang, Ye; Yin, Wanhong; Liu, Tao; Liu, Dan; Li, Diandian; Feng, Mei; Zhang, Yanlin; Liang, Zong039; an,; Fu, Ziqiao; Fu, Siyun; Li, Weimin; Xiong, Nian; Wang, Gang; Luo, Fengming",Respiration,335,11

Notre objectif principal était d’identifier les motifs d’acceptation et de refus vaccinal chez les femmes ayant reçu une proposition préalable par un professionnel de santé (PS). Nos objectifs secondaires étaient d’estimer le niveau de connaissance sur la grippe et le vaccin et la confiance dans les différentes sources d’informations. Matériels et méthodes Une étude monocentrique a été réalisée entre février et mai 2020 via un questionnaire anonyme administré aux femmes hospitalisées en suite de couche dans une maternité de niveau 3 avec mise à disposition du vaccin. Nous avons recueilli les caractéristiques sociodémographiques, le statut vaccinal, et les connaissances et représentations sur la grippe et son vaccin. Des analyses thématiques ont été réalisées pour l’étude des motifs de vaccination et des modèles de régression logistique pour celle des facteurs associés. Résultats Au total, 251 femmes ont été incluses dans l’étude, 176 (70 %) nées en France, 202 (80 %) âgées de 30 ans et plus, 173 (69 %) avec un haut niveau d’étude ;31 (12 %) présentaient une pathologie chronique ciblée par les recommandations et 212 (84 %) ont été vaccinées contre la grippe. La proposition de vaccination, multiple pour une même femme, émanait de plusieurs PS : sage-femme (55 %), gynécologue-obstétricien (50 %), médecin traitant (18 %). La vaccination a eu principalement lieu à la maternité (61 %), dans des cabinets libéraux (21 %) ou en pharmacie (11 %). Les motifs décisifs d’acceptation retrouvés chez les femmes vaccinées étaient la recommandation d’un PS (38 %), la protection du nouveau-né (36 %) ou la perception d’une maladie grave pendant la grossesse (28 %) ;les motifs de refus étaient la peur des effets indésirables du vaccin (74 %) et des doutes sur son intérêt (51 %). Un niveau de confiance plus élevé envers les PS était observé chez les femmes vaccinées. La vaccination était associée à un score élevé de connaissance sur la grippe et le vaccin (OR=8,0 ;IC95 % [2,4–50,1], p=0,005), un antécédent de vaccination grippale (OR=4,2 ;IC95 % [1,8–11,1], p=0,002), un âge maternel entre 30–35 ans (OR=3,6 ;IC95 % [1,3–10,1], p=0,0013), et la présence d’enfant&lt;15 ans au domicile (OR=0,3 ;IC95 % [0,1–0,7], p=0,006). Une majorité des femmes rapportaient être favorable à d’autres vaccinations pendant la grossesse comme la coqueluche (77 %), le VRS (62 %) ou une future vaccination contre la COVID-19 (61 %). Conclusion Ces résultats soulignent le rôle clé de la proposition vaccinale par les PS dans l’acceptation de la vaccination durant la grossesse ainsi que l’importance d’informations personnalisées sur les bénéfices et la sécurité du vaccin pour la mère et son futur enfant. Cette étude ouvre aussi la réflexion sur l’acceptabilité d’autres vaccins, notamment contre la COVID-19.","Gaudefroy, C.; Descamps, A.; Lachatre, M.; Anselem, O.; Launay, O.",Infectious Diseases Now,335,6

Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household characteristics, leisure activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, facemask wearing, and institutional preventive measures were assessed. Descriptive analysis was performed. Among 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%). Compared to pre-pandemic times, screen time (e.g., TV, gaming, social media) increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity (42.2%). Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, acceptance of adapted health behaviors was high. In this post-lockdown period of low SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Berlin, individual and school-level infection prevention measures were largely adhered to. Nevertheless, vigilance and continued preventive measures are essential to cope with future pandemic activity.","Hommes, Franziska; van Loon, Welmoed; Thielecke, Marlene; Abramovich, Igor; Lieber, Sascha; Hammerich, Ralf; Gehrke-Beck, Sabine; Linzbach, Elisabeth; Schuster, Angela; von dem Busche, Katja; Theuring, Stefanie; Gertler, Maximilian; Martinez, Gabriela Equihua; Richter, Joachim; Bergmann, Clara; Bölke, Alisa; Böhringer, Falko; Mall, Marcus A; Rosen, Alexander; Krannich, Alexander; Keller, Jan; Bethke, Norma; Kurzmann, Marco; Kurth, Tobias; Kirchberger, Valerie; Seybold, Joachim; Mockenhaupt, Frank P; Study Group, Becoss",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),335,1

METHODS: Counts of the number of patients filling and number of providers prescribing buprenorphine were calculated for each weekday between November 4, 2019 and May 12, 2020. The change in daily patients and prescribers between March 2, 2020 and May 12, 2020, was modeled as a change in slope compared to the baseline period using autoregressive, interrupted time series regression. RESULTS: The rate of change of daily buprenorphine prescriptions (ß = -1.75, 95% CIâ=â-5.8-2.34) and prescribers (ß = -0.32, 95% CIâ=â-1.47-0.82) declined insignificantly during the COVID-19 period compared to the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a 57% decline in ambulatory care utilization in the south-central US during March and April of 2020, health services utilization related to buprenorphine in Texas remained robust. Protecting access to buprenorphine as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold will require intensive efforts from clinicians and policy makers alike. While the presented results are promising, researchers must continue monitoring and exploring the clinical and humanistic impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of substance use disorders.","Thornton, James Douglas; Varisco, Tyler J; Bapat, Shweta S; Downs, Callie G; Shen, Chan",J Addict Med,335,31

This study was aimed to find out impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on management of epilepsy. A cross-sectional study was conducted through telephone interviews, targeting 213 caregivers of pediatric patients with epilepsy, belonging to underserved areas of Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. A simple questionnaire was designed to record the responses of participants relevant to the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic and their knowledge about possible ways that can be accessed for the management of epilepsy during an ongoing pandemic. The current study, which holds 77% of the respondents from rural areas and 23% from urban settings, showed that partial measures of lockdown taken to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 resulted in adverse economic and health outcomes in the said population including cancelation of follow-up visits, worsening of seizures, job loss, burden of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) costs, and discontinuation of medicines. Furthermore, knowledge about alternative ways to access health facilities was found very poor among caregivers. Income sources of poor people disrupted by lockdown can lead to unintentional nonadherence to medication, which is a clear picture of inequitable distribution of resources. This study highlights the major issues faced by the caregivers during this ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.","Saleem, Tayyaba; Sheikh, Nadeem; Abbasi, Muddasir Hassan; Javed, Iram; Khawar, Muhammad Babar",Epilepsy Behav,335,22

To date, the influence of surface wettability on fomite formation remains elusive. Here, we report that superhydrophobicity prevents the attachment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces by repelling virus-laden droplets. Compared to bare surfaces, superhydrophobic (SHPB) surfaces exhibit a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 attachment of up to 99.99995%. We identify the vital importance of solid-liquid adhesion in dominating viral attachment, where the viral activity (N) is proportional to the cube of solid-liquid adhesion (A), N â A3. Our results predict that a surface would be practically free of SARS-CoV-2 deposition when solid-liquid adhesion is &#8804;1 mN.

We have developed an internet-based, OSCE-like, conversational VP system designed both for training and assessment of medical students. The system, that encompasses complete patient management from H&P to diagnostic procedures and treatment, has now been used regularly during the clerkship of internal medicine. The present article describes the system and compares assessments undertaken with the VP-system over the last five years, to traditional bed-side oral exams. All students practiced on their own exercise VP cases, while preparing for the final exam. A total of 586 students were evaluated simultaneously with both assessment modalities. The &#945;Cronbach of the VP exam averaged 0.86. No correlation was found between the grades obtained in the two exams, indicating that the VP exam evaluated different parameters than those assessed by the examiners in the oral examinations. We conclude that a VP system can be utilized as a valid and reliable examination tool. It is also most useful for independent training by students during their ward-based learning, as well as when not studying in classes, wards or clinics, when social distancing is required.","Oliven, Arie; Nave, Rachel; Baruch, Adam",Med Educ Online,335,23

A substantial reduction in gBRCA testing (about 60%) compared to the first 2 months of the current year was registered, but the requests have not been reset. The requesting physicians were mainly gynaecologists and oncologists. These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) into clinical oncology. Finally, a re-organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit, mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests was necessary, ensuring, however, a high-quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting.","Minucci, Angelo; Scambia, Giovanni; Santonocito, Concetta; Concolino, Paola; Urbani, Andrea",Mol.

In addition to these drugs, rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine to treat COVID-19, arguably with certain precautions and criticism. In line with the proposed use of chloroquine, Nigella sativa (black seed) could be considered as a natural substitute that contains a number of bioactive components such as thymoquinone, dithymoquinone, thymohydroquinone, and nigellimine. Further benefits to use N. sativa could be augmented by Zn supplement. Notably, Zn has been proven to improve innate and adaptive immunity in the course of any infection, be it by pathogenic virus or bacteria. The effectiveness of the Zn salt supplement could also be enhanced with N. sativa as its major bioactive component might work as ionophore to allow Zn2+ to enter pneumocytes – the target cell for SARSCoV-2.

The purpose of this study was to document how the experience of providing medical assistance in dying (MAiD) changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews with key informants in Canada who provided or coordinated MAiD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed participants from April to June 2020 by telephone or email. We collected and analyzed data in an iterative manner and reached theme saturation. Our team reached consensus on the major themes and subthemes. RESULTS: We interviewed 1 MAiD coordinator and 15 providers, including 14 physicians and 1 nurse practitioner. We identified 4 main themes. The most important theme was the perception that the pandemic increased the suffering of patients receiving MAiD by isolating them from loved ones and reducing available services. Providers were distressed by the difficulty of establishing rapport and closeness at the end of life, given the requirements for physical distancing and personal protective equipment. They were concerned about the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and found it difficult to enforce rules about distancing and the number of people present. Logistics and access to MAiD became more difficult because of the new restrictions, but there were many adaptations to solve these problems. INTERPRETATION: Providers and coordinators had many challenges in providing MAiD during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their perception that the suffering of their patients increased. Some changes in how MAiD is provided that have occurred during the pandemic, including more telemedicine assessments and virtual witnessing, are likely to remain after the pandemic and may improve service.","Wiebe, Ellen; Kelly, Michaela; McMorrow, Thomas; Tremblay-Huet, Sabrina; Sum, Brian; Hennawy, Mirna",CMAJ Open,335,1

Objective To analyze stress levels during social distancing due to COVID-19 by gender and to determine the moderating effect of adaptability to the situation. Method The study is cross-sectional and quantitative, with a descriptive-correlational scope. The sample consisted of 1,173 Mexican subjects (522 males [44.5%] and 651 females [22.5%]) with an average age of 25.99 years (DT = 11.19; range = 12 - 77 years). Adaptability and perceived stress were measured, obtaining reliability from appropriate instruments. Results The results indicated that the greater the number of weeks of social distancing, the higher the perceived level of stress. Also, the better people adapt to social distancing, the less stress occurs. Women were observed to have higher levels of stress compared to men. Discussion and conclusion The findings highlight the importance of adaptability to the stressful situation of the pandemic, because the effect of severe stress on women largely disappears when there is a high level of adaptability to the event.","Zamarripa, Jorge; Delgado-Herrada, Maritza; Morquecho-Sánchez, Raquel; Baños, Raúl; Cruz-Ortega, Manuel de la; Duarte-Félix, Héctor",Salud ment,335,24

Here, we present an innovative, stepwise approach to participatory modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic that engaged decision-makers and public health professionals from countries throughout all stages of the modelling process. Our approach consisted of first identifying the relevant policy questions, collecting country-specific data and interpreting model findings from a decision-maker's perspective, as well as communicating model uncertainty. We used a simple modelling methodology that was adaptable to the shortage of epidemiological data, and the limited modelling capacity, in our region. We discuss the benefits of using models to produce rapid decision-making guidance for COVID-19 control in the WHO EMR, as well as challenges that we have experienced regarding conveying uncertainty associated with model results, synthesising and comparing results across multiple modelling approaches, and modelling fragile and conflict-affected states.","Adib, Keyrellous; Hancock, Penelope A; Rahimli, Aysel; Mugisa, Bridget; Abdulrazeq, Fayez; Aguas, Ricardo; White, Lisa J; Hajjeh, Rana; Al Ariqi, Lubna; Nabeth, Pierre",,335,6

In this cross-sectional comparative study, our objective is to compare the depression and anxiety symptoms in elderly COVID-19 survivors with a control group. METHOD: 69 elderly COVID-19 survivors (age 65 or older) within 2 weeks post-discharge were assessed for anxiety and depression symptoms by a package of self-rating scales (Geriatric Anxiety Scale-10 (GAS-10), Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) and General Health Questionar-28 (GHQ-28)). Their scores were compared with a group of aged-matched residents without COVID-19 in their community. RESULTS: The mean scores on GAS-10, GDS-15 and GHQ-28 in the COVID-19 survivors group and control group were 12.06 vs. 6.53 (p < .001), 12.48 vs. 5.73 (p < .001), 52.7 vs. 29.8 (p < .001), respectively. All of the COVID-19 survivors and 60% of the controls had scores in the pathological range of GHQ-28 scale. A total of 93.2% of COVID-19 survivors revealed anxiety symptoms in GAS-10 scale. This rate was 60% in the control group. A total of 86.6% of COVID-19 survivors compared to 46.6% of the controls reported symptoms of depression in GDS-15 scale. CONCLUSION: The rate of depression and anxiety symptoms in elderly COVID-19 survivors and controls found to be high during the pandemic. However, COVID-19 survivors significantly suffered more.","Mowla, Arash; Ghaedsharaf, Mehrnoosh; Pani, Azadeh",J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol,335,1

Comparative results based on employment status, gender, and background were evaluated to identify the impact. While all the groups maintain having information about the pandemic and necessary safety protocols, there is an observable difference in the apprehension levels of financial and mental stability. Due to job security, employed people are less tense and better connected to their family, while unemployed people and students are more concerned with their productivity and quality of work. Students also display higher feelings of uncertainty and helplessness. A considerable number of people feel lonely and deserted during the pandemic. Such thoughts may leave a lasting effect if not tackled at the earliest. While an increase in awareness about mental health is observable, rural and unemployed people are less inclined to approach a professional. The significant difference COVID 19 has created between working people and students and based on gender and background, suggests that the preventive measures to avoid its lasting effects must be devised separately.","Moghe, Kshipra; Kotecha, Disha; Patil, Manjusha",,335,16

To date, there is no proven curative treatment for this virus; as a result, prevention remains to be the best strategy to combat coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been proposed to play a role in coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, there is no conclusive evidence on its impact on COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the present review aimed to summarize the available evidence regarding the association between Vitamin D levels and the risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A systematic literature search of databases (PUBMED/MEDLINE, Cochrane/Wiley library, Scopus, and SciELO) were conducted from May 15, 2020, to December 20, 2020. Studies that assessed the effect of vitamin D level on COVID-19/SARS-2 infection were considered for the review. The qualities of the included studies were evaluated using the JBI tools. Meta-analysis with a random-effects model was conducted and odds ratio with their 95%CI were reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis are reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Results: The electronic and supplementary searches for this review yielded 318 records from which, only 14 of them met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis indicated that vitamin D deficient individuals were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection as compared to vitamin D sufficient patients. The pooled analysis showed that individuals with Vitamin-D deficiency were 80% more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection as compared to those who have sufficient Vitamin D levels (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.72, 1.88). Begg's test also revealed that there was no significant publication bias between the studies (P = 0.764). The subgroup analysis revealed that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was relatively higher in the case-control study design (OR = 1.81). Conclusions: In conclusion, low serum 25 (OH) Vitamin-D level was significantly associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. The limited currently available data suggest that sufficient Vitamin D level in serum is associated with a significantly decreased risk of COVID-19 infection.","Teshome, Amare; Adane, Aynishet; Girma, Biruk; Mekonnen, Zeleke A",Front Public Health,335,1

The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the levels of social support and mental health among Chinese adolescents during the outbreak. METHODS: A total of 7,202 adolescents aged 14-18 years completed online survceys from March 8 to 15, 2020, in China. Researchers assessed the associations between depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety symptoms (Chinese version of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and social support (Social Support Rate Scale). RESULTS: COVID-19 exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.66) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.52). Only 24.6% of adolescents reported high levels of social support. Most adolescents (70%) reported medium levels of support, and 5.4% reported low support. Low support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 4.24, 95% CI: 3.38-5.33) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.54-3.98), while controlling for gender, grade, living situation, and COVID-19 exposure; similarly, medium support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 2.48-3.15) and anxiety (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.94-2.48) symptoms.

Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary. Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used. Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged. Patients with moderate or severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management. Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and vigorous adherence to the principles of social isolation is recommended. In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at 3 and 6 months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased; however, those individuals should be encouraged to maintain social distancing. Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. When extensive differential diagnostic testing and/or surgery is not feasible, it should be deferred and medical treatment should be initiated. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery should be delayed during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence. Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients, since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients. The risk/benefit ratio of these recommendations will need re-evaluation every 2-3 months from April 2020 in each country (and possibly local areas) and will depend on the local health care structure and phase of pandemic.","Newell-Price, John; Nieman, Lynnette K; Reincke, Martin; Tabarin, Antoine",Eur J Endocrinol,335,23

However, a gender vision of health begs the question: Why are pregnant women not considered a risk group for COVID-19? The answer is clear: historically, most community scientific studies have not considered female gender, or pregnancy as a state, to be a focus of special interest or effort. Unfortunately, this bias seems to be maintained in the COVID-19 epidemic: most current guidelines for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy apply the same standard criteria as for the general population. This pandemic is an opportunity to begin redressing this historic gender bias against pregnant women, and to achieve this, we recommend two actions that are easy to implement, and would have a large impact. First, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women with clinical or epidemiological suspicion, regardless of gestational age or the clinical severity. Second, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women at admission for delivery. These actions are essential to understand the true impact of COVID-19 throughout pregnancy, and will improve how we manage many aspects of pre- and postnatal care. It is the scientific community's responsibility to guide, even to anticipate, the recommendations of our respective governments' health policies. If we do not agree to consider pregnant women as a distinct priority subgroup of the population during this pandemic, once again we will miss an opportunity to overcome this historic bias.","Comas, Carmina; Carreras, Elena",J. med. virol,335,19

As of July 2020, there were 8,475 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, and a total of 52 cases and 1 death were reported in Debre Berhan where this study was conducted. Under these conditions, we sought to assess what undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University knew about COVID-19 and how it shaped their attitudes and practices regarding this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess undergraduate student knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 in Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 18-24, 2020 among undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was employed with a total sample size of 634. Proportional allocation of samples was used to the randomly selected colleges, and a systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit the students. The data were checked for completeness, coded, entered into Epi-Data VS 3.1, and then exported into STATA&#8482; Version 14 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors. Factors were selected with the entry method. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the associations between variables and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP). RESULTS: From a total of 546 included participants, more than half of them, 307 (57%) were males. Seventy-three percent of them heard about novel coronavirus from social media. In this study, 73.8% of the participants were knowledgeable, and their overall attitude was favorable. Approximately 71.4% correctly responded that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Nearly half, 229 (42%) of the students approved that they had no concern of being infected with COVID-19. Moreover, most participants showed poor practices; more than half of the study subjects were not maintaining a physical distance. In multivariable analyses, people older than 25 years (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI; 1.2, 4.6) and those who lived in urban areas (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI; 2.6, 15.8) were significantly more knowledgeable about COVID-19. Furthermore, those students that have information about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI; 1.6, 8.7) was significantly associated with the attitude undergraduate students had about COVID-19 as compared with its counterpart. CONCLUSION: The undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University were moderately knowledgeable about COVID-19 and had an optimistic attitude towards its resolution. However, this optimism may lead to poor public health practices within this community. Therefore, greater efforts need to be made through more comprehensive and directed actions and awareness campaigns to increase the knowledge, attitude and practice of the students.","Aynalem, Yared Asmare; Akalu, Tadess Yirga; Gebresellassie Gebregiorgis, Birhan; Sharew, Nigussie Tadesse; Assefa, Hilina Ketema; Shiferaw, Wondimeneh Shibabaw",PLoS One,335,20

STUDY DESIGN: The design of the study was to estimate the 'pre-existing comorbidity'-conditional CFR to eventually explain the mortality risk variability reported around in different countries. METHODS: We use the available information on pre-existing health conditions identified for deceased patients 'positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)' in Italy. We (i) estimated the total number of deaths for different pre-existing health conditions categories and (ii) calculated a conditional CFR based upon the number of comorbidities before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Our results show a 0.6% conditional CFR for a population with zero pre-existing pathology, increasing to 13.9% for a population diagnosed with one and more pre-existing health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Condition-specific mortality risks are important to be evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with potential elements to explain the CFR variability around the globe. A careful postmortem examination of deceased cases to differentiate death 'caused by COVID-19' from death 'positive with SARS-CoV-2' is therefore urgently needed and will likely improve our understanding of the COVID-19 mortality risk and virus pathogenicity.","Aguiar, M; Stollenwerk, N",Public Health,335,21

Subsequently, COVID-19 turned into a global pandemic, causing a global health emergency, triggering an unprecedented event in the modern era. This study assessed the immediate psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on emotional health and well-being. An ad hoc questionnaire was designed for online completion to expedite data collection during the COVID-19 outbreak. People were invited to participate in the study via social media and email from 4 to 18 March 2020. The entire survey comprised of 21 questions, covering a wide range of factors, such as demographics, disease knowledge, psychological impact, daily life activities, and psychological precautionary measures. The main outcome measure was psychological impact. This was measured based on intensity and prevalence of self-reported feelings of anxiety, fear, sadness, anger, and concern during the epidemic. In total, 10,025 respondents completed the online survey. Of these, about 73% were females, and 100% of the sample possessed good knowledge of the disease. The greatest prevalence of high psychological impact was reported in the <34 years' age group and in north Italy. Additionally, the psychological impact influenced important daily life activities, such as sexuality and nutrition. Our study provides information about the immediate psychological (emotional feelings) responses of Italy's general population to the COVID-19 epidemic. The survey covers several factors that can influence mental health; our results help gauge the psychological burden on the community and offer ways to minimize the impact.","Ferrucci, Roberta; Averna, Alberto; Marino, Daniela; Reitano, Maria Rita; Ruggiero, Fabiana; Mameli, Francesca; Dini, Michelangelo; Poletti, Barbara; Barbieri, Sergio; Priori, Alberto; Pravettoni, Gabriella",Front Psychiatry,335,26

However, concerns arise that massive access to information online has created problems with understanding COVID-19 which eventually may risk their attitude. Therefore, this study aims to analyze scientific literacy of students against the ongoing outbreak in terms of the contents. The research employs ADDIE model due to its compactness towards its process. The stages reflect the process of developing studying and implementing contagion literacy assessment products for junior high school students. The instrument design procedure consisted of literature study development of test items internal validation and pilot project. The feasibility will be reviewed from the results of the validity and reliability. The data to be collected in this research are quantitative and qualitative data related to the validity and reliability. The results of the face validity test from three experts show that the questions arranged in the literacy instrument are considered valid with minor revision in terms of materials and construction. The pilot project however showed an opposite result. The instrument was scored invalid because 14 out of 20 questions were invalid. The influencing factor found was students was not ready to read long passage or data in digital format. Transmission prevention and treatment are the issues in which student are familiar with.

METHODS: We built a model for GammaMed Plus high dose rate brachytherapy source in TOPAS. The TG-43 dosimetry parameters including air-kerma strength SK , dose-rate constant &#923;, radial dose function gL (r), and 2D anisotropy function F(r,Î¸) were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation with Geant4 physics models and NNDC 192 Ir spectrum. Calculations using an old 192 Ir spectrum were also carried out to evaluate the impact of incident spectrum and cross sections. The results were compared with published data. RESULTS: For calculations using the NNDC spectrum, the air-kerma strength per unit source activity SK /A and &#923; were 1.0139 × 10-7 U/Bq and 1.1101 cGy.h-1 .U-1 , which were 3.56% higher and 0.62% lower than the reference values, respectively. The gL (r) agreed with reference values within 1% for radial distances from 2 mm to 20 cm. For radial distances of 1, 3, 5, and 10 cm, the agreements between F(r,Î¸) from this work and the reference data were within 1.5% for 15° < Î¸ < 165°, and within 4% for all Î¸ values. The discrepancies were attributed to the updated source spectrum and cross sections. They caused deviations of the SK /A of 2.90% and 0.64%, respectively. As for gL (r), they caused average deviations of -0.22% and 0.48%, respectively. Their impact on F(r,Î¸) was not quantified for the relatively high statistical uncertainties, but basically they did not result in significant discrepancies. CONCLUSION: A model for GammaMed Plus high dose rate 192 Ir brachytherapy source was developed in TOPAS and validated following TG-43 protocols, which can be used for future studies. The impact of updated incident spectrum and cross sections on the dosimetry parameters was quantified.","Wu, Jianan; Xie, Yaoqin; Ding, Zhen; Li, Feipeng; Wang, Luhua",J. appl. clin. med. phys,335,21

Regional variation in internet access and telehealth use are well-documented, but the effect of neighborhood factors, including the pervasiveness of broadband internet, on older adults' telehealth usage in the context of internet access is not known. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how individual and neighborhood characteristics, including the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription, are associated with engagement in telehealth among older adults with internet access. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 5117 community-living older adults aged &#8805;65 years, who participated in the 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study with census tract-level data for participants' places of residence from the American Community Survey. RESULTS: Of an estimated 35.3 million community-living older adults, 21.1 million (59.7%) were internet users, and of this group, more than one-third (35.8%) engaged in telehealth. In a multivariable regression model adjusted for individual- and neighborhood-level factors, age, education, income, and the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription were associated with engagement in telehealth, while race, health, county metropolitan status, and neighborhood social deprivation were not. Among internet users, living in a neighborhood at the lowest (versus highest) tertile of broadband internet subscription was associated with being 40% less likely to engage in telehealth (adjusted odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.87), all else equal.

Due to the sparsity and noise present in such single-cell gene expression data, inference of single-cell gene regulatory networks remains a challenge. Since recent studies have reported the reliable inference of single-cell gene regulatory networks (SCGRNs), the current study focused on discriminating the SCGRNs of T2D patients from those of healthy controls. By accurately distinguishing SCGRNs of healthy pancreas from those of T2D pancreas, it would be possible to annotate, organize, visualize, and identify common patterns of SCGRNs in metabolic diseases. Such annotated SCGRNs could play an important role in accelerating the process of building large data repositories. This study aimed to contribute to the development of a novel deep learning (DL) application. First, we generated a dataset consisting of 224 SCGRNs belonging to both T2D and healthy pancreas and made it freely available. Next, we chose seven DL architectures, including VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet121, and DenseNet169, trained each of them on the dataset, and checked their prediction based on a test set. Of note, we evaluated the DL architectures on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU.

At present, at least 1.8 million people are infected around the world and almost 110,000 people have died. Many studies have analyzed the clinical picture of COVID-19, but they are focused on respiratory symptoms and headache is generically treated. METHODS: I describe and discuss my headaches during my COVID-19 and I review the MEDLINE literature about headaches and COVID-19. RESULTS: More than 41,000 COVID-19 patients have been included in clinical studies and headache was present in 8%-12% of them. However, no headache characterization was made in these studies. As a headache expert and based on my own personal clinical case, headaches related to COVID-19 can be classified in the 2 phases of the disease. Acute headache attributed to systemic viral infection, primary cough headache, tension-type headache and headache attributed to heterophoria can appear in the first phase (the influenza-like phase); and headache attributed to hypoxia and a new headache, difficult to fit into the ICHD3, can appear if the second phase (the cytokine storm phase) occurs. CONCLUSIONS: Several headaches can appear during COVID-19 infection. All of them are headaches specified in the ICHD3, except 1 that occurs from the 7th day after the clinical onset. This headache is probably related to the cytokine storm that some patients suffer and it could be framed under the ICHD3 headache of Headache attributed to other non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease. Although the reported prevalence of headaches as a symptom of COVID-19 infection is low, this experience shows that, very probably, it is underestimated.","Belvis, Robert",Headache,335,22

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a total of 43 COVID-19-confirmed patients (24 men and 19 women, 49.90 ± 18.70 years) and 41 influenza-confirmed patients (17 men and 24 women, 61.53 ± 19.50 years). Afterwards, the chest CT findings were recorded and 3 radiologists recorded their diagnoses of COVID-19 or of H1N1 influenza based on the CT findings. RESULTS: The most frequent clinical symptom in patients with COVID-19 and H1N1 pneumonia were dyspnea (96.6%) and cough (62.5%), respectively. The CT findings showed that the COVID-19 group was characterized by GGO (88.1%), while the influenza group had features such as GGO (68.4%) and consolidation (66.7%). Compared to the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have GGO (88.1% vs. 68.4%, pâ¯=â¯0.032), subpleural sparing (69.0% vs. 7.7%, p <0.001) and subpleural band (50.0% vs. 20.5%, pâ¯=â¯0.006), but less likely to have pleural effusion (4.8% vs. 33.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.001). The agreement rate between the 3 radiologists was 65.8%. CONCLUSION: Considering similarities of respiratory infections especially H1N1 and COVID-19, it is essential to introduce some clinical and para clinical modalities to help differentiating them. In our study we extracted some lung CT scan findings from patients suspected to COVID-19 as a newly diagnosed infection comparing with influenza pneumonia patients.","Zarei, Fariba; Jalli, Reza; Iranpour, Pooya; Sefidbakht, Sepideh; Soltanabadi, Sahar; Rezaee, Maryam; Jahankhah, Reza; Manafi, Alireza",Acad. radiol,335,14

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the practices of DI clinics, and investigate the reasons for the change in their operations during the initial period of the pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was created and distributed to the managers of eighteen outpatient DI clinics in London, Hamilton, and Halton, Ontario, Canada. The managers indicated whether their clinics had closed or decreased operations, the reasons for closure, and the types of imaging examinations conducted in the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the DI clinics surveyed (9/18) closed as a result of COVID-19, and those that remained open had decreased hours of operation. The clinics that closed indicated decreased referrals as the primary reason for closure, followed by staff shortage, concerns for safety, and suspension of elective imaging. Chest radiography and obstetric ultrasound were the most commonly conducted examinations. Clinics that were in close geographical proximity were able to redistribute imaging examinations amongst themselves. All DI clinics had suspended BMD examinations and elective breast screening, and some transitioned to booked appointments only. CONCLUSION: Many DI clinics needed to close or decrease operations as a result of COVID-19, a phenomenon that is unprecedented in radiological practice. The results of this study can assist outpatient DI clinics in preparing for subsequent waves of COVID-19, future pandemics, and other periods of crisis.","Maizlin, Nick N; Ohorodnyk, Pavlo",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,335,30

515659,515659,515659,Abdominal Pain Due to Renal Infarction: An Unexpected Presentation of COVID-19,16.83492,5.6408253,2021,"As of the end of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 82 million verified infections and almost 1.8 million COVID-19-related deaths worldwide,1 resulting to an unprecedented public health response around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic, together with the applied multi-level restrictive measures, has generated a unique combination of an unpredictable and stressful biomedical and socioeconomic environment (i.e., syndemic),2 introducing real-life threat, involuntary and drastic every-day life-style changes with uncertain financial and future prospects, alongside with minimized coping and stress management possibilities.3 This combination of so many different and vital stressors may lead to acute as well as long-term, direct, indirect and even transgenerational unfavourable effects on physical and mental health and functioning, which might even represent the most precarious and still unpredictable public-health-related part of the pandemic.4 Thereby, specific population groups could be at particular risk of poor health outcomes in relation to applied public health measures.4, 5 However, not every individual will experience the same level of negative impact on health and well-being during the pandemic, as several additional national, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, emotional and cognitive factors can moderate individual resilience and coping.6 Pandemic-related research should, thus, assess as many multidimensional risk and protective factors as possible in a longitudinal, large-scale and multi-national manner, enabling a profound and comprehensive understanding of the complex health and societal impact of the pandemic worldwide.7 Nevertheless, to date, most research findings are cross-sectional, report on small and non- representative samples from individual countries, or on specific population groups (e.g., health care workers, students, clinical populations) and usually assess only a very restricted set of outcomes and time-points. Thereby, only few studies assess coping strategies, medical history or detailed socioeconomic, demographic and environmental data. In addition, most studies leave behind linguistic differences, being available in one or at best two different languages. Such investigations of small outcome subsets within a narrow framework preclude a broader and clear understanding of the multifaceted pandemic impact on the general population and specific subgroups. Acknowledging these gaps in the existing literature, large- scale, collaborative research prospectively collecting and monitoring a broad range of real- time, multi-dimensional health-related, societal and behavioural outcome data from countries across the globe is currently explicitly needed. The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH- FIT) envisions to fill this gap. Based on an easy-to-access webpage (www.coh-fit.com), COH- FIT is the currently largest-scale known international collaborative study of over 200 researchers around the globe, prospectively collecting the biggest set of multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary data from 150 high, middle, and low-income countries in over 30 languages and in three different age groups (adults, adolescents, children) of the general population, focusing also on relevant at-risk subgroups. Albeit being a cross-sectional anonymous survey on an individual level, it is a longitudinal study on a population level, as data are collected continuously since April 2020 and until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic. In addition to snowball recruitment, this project also collects information from nationally representative samples. Furthermore, COH-FIT is the first study of this scale investigating pandemic effects on health and functioning measures between family members, while it also specifically assesses a large list of behavioral and coping factors (e.g., screen time, social media usage, physical activity, social interaction, religious practices, etc.) on outcomes of interest. COH-FIT also monitors changes in public health restrictive measures to enhance data harmonization across nations and time, and to better investigate their impact on physical and mental health, while it also collects information on changes in healthcare systems functioning. The COH-FIT project was worldwide first initiated in Greece after the ethics committee approval of the School of Medicine of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and is officially supported by the Hellenic Psychiatric Association, European Psychiatric Association, World Association of Social Psychiatry, ECNP Network on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion, among many other national and international scientific associations. To date, COH-FIT has already collected >115,000 participations worldwide (>8,000 in Greece), but more participants are still needed, both during the second and third wave of the pandemic, as in the future, after the pandemic has ended. Currently, the COH-FIT survey actively collects the largest sample on multifactorial data on the impact of the COVD-19 pandemic on health and functioning not only in Greece, but around the globe. The elaborated design of COH-FIT and similar studies may allow a better identification of key parameters and population groups at increased risk during the pandemic, as well as potential targets for acute and long-term prevention or intervention strategies in the current as in possible future pandemics. A profound understanding of the health and societal impact of the pandemic could facilitate an optimized governmental, social and individual health preparedness during infection times8 and the bridging of individuals', societal and systemic needs and actions through multi-level guideline development with the aim to improve mental health outcomes globally.","Agorastos, Agorastos; Tsamakis, Konstantinos; Solmi, Marco; Correll, Christoph U; Bozikas, Vasilis P",Psychiatriki,335,24

Previously, self-GMPylation/UMPylation activities were reported for an arterivirus NiRAN-RdRp nsp and suggested to generate a transient state primed for transferring nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) to (currently unknown) viral and/or cellular biopolymers. Here, we show that the coronavirus (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) nsp12 (NiRAN-RdRp) has Mn2+-dependent NMPylation activity that catalyzes the transfer of a single NMP to the cognate nsp9 by forming a phosphoramidate bond with the primary amine at the nsp9 N terminus (N3825) following Mpro-mediated proteolytic release of nsp9 from N-terminally flanking nsps. Uridine triphosphate was the preferred nucleotide in this reaction, but also adenosine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and cytidine triphosphate were suitable cosubstrates. Mutational studies using recombinant coronavirus nsp9 and nsp12 proteins and genetically engineered HCoV-229E mutants identified residues essential for NiRAN-mediated nsp9 NMPylation and virus replication in cell culture. The data corroborate predictions on NiRAN active-site residues and establish an essential role for the nsp9 N3826 residue in both nsp9 NMPylation in vitro and virus replication. This residue is part of a conserved N-terminal NNE tripeptide sequence and shown to be the only invariant residue in nsp9 and its homologs in viruses of the family Coronaviridae The study provides a solid basis for functional studies of other nidovirus NMPylation activities and suggests a possible target for antiviral drug development.","Slanina, Heiko; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Bylapudi, Ganesh; Schultheiß, Karin; Karl, Nadja; Gulyaeva, Anastasia; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Linne, Uwe; Ziebuhr, John",Proc.

Over 5 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 330,000 deaths have been recorded worldwide. Transmission is primarily spread through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets, the mouth, and/or nose secretions. Health care professionals (HCPs), including dental HCPs, are recognized to be at considerably high risk for infection due to the close proximity to patients and aerosol-generating procedures. During pregnancy, HCPs may be at even higher risk since pregnancy substantially increases the susceptibility to infectious diseases. OBJECTIVES: Here, we present the posed risks and potential effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal health. Current prevention and management strategies for COVID-19 on pregnant dental and HCPs are also discussed. RESULTS: Significant progress is being made in understanding the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of COVID-19. Pregnant women are affected more adversely with viral illnesses, although evidence of vertical transmission of COVID-19 is controversial. Based on the presence of atypical symptoms, the significant numbers of asymptomatic individuals who are COVID-19 positive, and the high susceptibility to viral diseases observed in pregnant women, recommendations have been put forth to limit the exposure of COVID-19-positive or even suspected cases to pregnant HCPs, and these are likely to evolve as new information becomes available. CONCLUSION: Pregnant HCPs require extra caution: not only are they considered a high-risk population, but their work at the frontline in a pandemic may expose them to additional risks. Complete awareness of the effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal/infant health, as well as prevention and management guidelines for pregnant HCPs, will allow for a safer work environment. Health care institutional policies aimed at protecting pregnant HCPs should consider avoiding their assignment as first responders, especially if equally trained staff are available. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Dental and health care professionals can use the information in this review to improve their awareness of COVID-19 risks, signs, and symptoms and the associated effects on the health of pregnant health care professionals and their unborn/newborn children.","Mann, A; Dahiya, A; Souza, L C; Letra, A",JDR Clin Trans Res,335,24

The emerging viral infections significantly associated with 2019-nCoV have challenged humanity's survival. Further, there is a constant emergence of new resistant viral strains that demand novel antiviral agents with fewer side effects and cell toxicity. Despite significant progress made in immunization and regenerative medicine, numerous viruses still lack prophylactic vaccines and specific antiviral treatments that are so often influenced by the generation of viral escape mutants. Of importance, medicinal herbs offer a wide variety of therapeutic antiviral chemotypes that can inhibit viral replication by preventing viral adsorption, adhering to cell receptors, inhibiting virus penetration in the host cell, and competing for pathways of activation of intracellular signals. The present review will comprehensively summarize the promising antiviral activities of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules. Furthermore, it will elucidate their mechanism of action and possible implications in the treatment/prevention of viral diseases even when their mechanism of action is not fully understood, which could serve as the base for the future development of novel or complementary antiviral treatments.","Ali, Sofi Imtiyaz; Sheikh, Wajid Mohammad; Rather, Muzafar Ahmad; Venkatesalu, Venugopalan; Muzamil Bashir, Showkeen; Nabi, Showkat Ul",Phytother. res,335,29

An Evidence-Based Review,17.013744,5.3353124,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. This study was performed to evaluate a novel rapid antigen detection test (RDT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory samples. METHODS: The fluorescence immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Shenzhen, China) was evaluated using universal transport medium with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from suspected COVID-19 cases. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 real-time (RT)-PCR. RESULTS: A total of 127 samples were included; 82 were RT-PCR-positive. The median patient age was 38 years, 53.5% were male, and 93.7% were from the first week after symptom onset. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (95% confidence interval 86.5-97.4%) and 100% (95% confidence interval 92.1-100%), respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96.1% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9. Sensitivity was significantly higher in samples with high viral loads. CONCLUSIONS: The RDT evaluated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples mainly obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads, despite the use of a non-validated sample material. The assay has the potential to become an important tool for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in situations with limited access to molecular methods.","Porte, Lorena; Legarraga, Paulette; Vollrath, Valeska; Aguilera, Ximena; Munita, José M; Araos, Rafael; Pizarro, Gabriel; Vial, Pablo; Iruretagoyena, Mirentxu; Dittrich, Sabine; Weitzel, Thomas",Int J Infect Dis,335,30

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed here: osf.io/dwf53 We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on 23 April 2020 for case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors (in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group). We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulins. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group regarding data extraction and assessment. To assess bias in included studies, we used the assessment criteria tool for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies (seven case-series, one prospectively planned, single-arm intervention study) with 32 participants, and identified a further 48 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma (47 studies) or hyperimmune immunoglobulin (one study), of which 22 are randomised. Overall risk of bias of the eight included studies was high, due to: study design; small number of participants; poor reporting within studies; and varied type of participants with different severities of disease, comorbidities, and types of previous or concurrent treatments, including antivirals, antifungals or antibiotics, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support. We rated all outcomes as very low certainty, and we were unable to summarise numerical data in any meaningful way. As we identified case-series studies only, we reported results narratively. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge All studies reported mortality. All participants were alive at the end of the reporting period, but not all participants had been discharged from hospital by the end of the study (15 participants discharged, 6 still hospitalised, 11 unclear). Follow-up ranged from 3 days to 37 days post-transfusion. We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support) Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline. All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants. We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence). Time to discharge from hospital Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy. Admission on the intensive care unit (ICU) Six studies included patients who were critically ill. At final follow-up the majority of these patients were no longer on the ICU or no longer required mechanical ventilation. Length of stay on the ICU Only one study (1 participant) reported length of stay on the ICU. The individual was discharged from the ICU 11 days after plasma transfusion. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events The studies did not report the grade of adverse events after convalescent plasma transfusion. Two studies reported data relating to participants who had experienced adverse events, that were presumably grade 3 or 4. One case study reported a participant who had moderate fever (38.9 °C). Another study (3 participants) reported a case of severe anaphylactic shock. Four studies reported the absence of moderate or severe adverse events (19 participants). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events One study (3 participants) reported one serious adverse event. As described above, this individual had severe anaphylactic shock after receiving convalescent plasma. Six studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10). Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions. We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low. No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed. There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We will update this review as a living systematic review, based on monthly searches in the above mentioned databases and registries. These updates are likely to show different results to those reported here.","Valk, Sarah J; Piechotta, Vanessa; Chai, Khai Li; Doree, Carolyn; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail; Kimber, Catherine; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,335,18

Along with the direct health threats of COVID-19, there are disruptions to social relationships and health services resulting from mitigation efforts instituted by public health authorities. This study examined the relationship between trust in the government and trust in COVID-19 health information from the US CDC, state health departments, and social media on the experience of COVID-19 social and health services-related disruptions. METHODS: People living with HIV (N = 459) recruited through social media advertisements and chain referrals completed confidential surveys delivered through an online platform. RESULTS: Participants experienced high-levels of disruptions to social relationships and health services attributable to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. We also observed high-rates of inaccurate information and low-levels of trust in government and sources of COVID-19 information. Greater disruptions to social relationships were predicted by more concern about oneself and others contracting COVID-19, whereas disruptions to health services were predicted by greater concern for oneself contracting COVID-19, greater general medical mistrust, and less trust in information from the CDC. CONCLUSIONS: Findings have implications for the necessity of rebuilding public trust in credible sources of health information and stepping up efforts to counter sources of inaccurate information.","Kalichman, Seth C; Shkembi, Bruno; Kalichman, Moira O; Eaton, Lisa A",BMC Public Health,335,16

Our objective was to describe the novel application and effect of a telemedicine medical screening evaluation (Tele-MSE) at triage on quality metrics in the pediatric emergency department (PED). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study of patients presenting to an urban PED from December 2017 to November 2019 who received a Tele-MSE at triage. We analyzed 4 diagnostic cohorts: gastroenteritis, psychiatry evaluation, burn injury, and extremity fracture. We matched cases with controls who received standard triage, from December 2015 to November 2017, by age, diagnosis, weekday versus weekend, and season of presentation. Outcome measures included door-to-provider time, time-to-intervention order, and PED length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: We included 557 patients who received Tele-MSE during the study period. Compared with controls, patients who received a Tele-MSE at triage had a shorter median door-to-provider time (median difference [MD], 8.4 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-11.0), time-to-medication order (MD, 27.3 minutes; 95% CI, 22.9-35.2), time-to-consult order (MD, 10.0 minutes; 95% CI, 5.3-12.7), and PED LOS (MD, 0.4 hours; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6). CONCLUSIONS: A Tele-MSE is an innovative modality to expedite the initiation of emergency care and reduce PED LOS for children.

We describe a 16-year-old male and a 64-year-old female recently lung transplanted patients with COVID-19 during inpatient rehabilitation. Both patients were receiving triple immunosuppressive therapy and had no signs of allograft dysfunction. Both patients had close contact with a person who developed COVID-19 and were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, both patients underwent systematic screening and SARS-CoV-2 was ultimately detected. Although the 16-year-old boy was completely asymptomatic, the 64-year-old woman developed only mild COVID-19. Immunosuppressive therapy was unchanged and no experimental treatment was initiated. No signs of graft involvement or dysfunction were noticed. In conclusion, our report of patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild COVID-19, respectively, may indicate that lung transplant recipients are not per se at risk for severe COVID-19.

The current study aimed to find predictors of mental health for public health doctors from working experiences at frontline of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: With first-come and first-served manner, 350 public health doctors with experiences of work at COVID-19 frontline participated online survey on August 2020. Mental health was defined using the total scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Stanford Presenteeism Scale-6. Multivariate logistic regression models of mental health with lowest Akaike Information Criterion were determined among all combinations of working environments, perceived threats and satisfaction at frontline, and demographics that were significant (P < 0.05) in the univariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Perceived distress, lowered self-efficacy at work, anxiety, and depressive mood were reported by 45.7, 34.6, 11.4, and 15.1% of respondents, respectively. Predictors of poor mental health found in the multivariate logistic regression analyses were environmental (insufficient personal protective equipment, workplace of screening center, prolonged workhours) and psychosocial (fear of infection and death, social stigma and rejection) aspects of working experiences at frontline. Satisfaction of monetary compensation and proactive coping (acceptance and willingness to volunteer at frontline) were predictive of better mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient supply of personal protective equipment and training on infection prevention at frontline, proper workhours and satisfactory monetary compensation, and psychological supports are required for better mental health of public health doctors at frontline of COVID-19 pandemic.","Han, Sangyoon; Choi, Sejin; Cho, Seung Hyun; Lee, Joonhyuk; Yun, Je-Yeon",BMC Psychiatry,335,24

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may allow secondary fungal disease through a propensity to cause respiratory infection by affecting the immune system leading to dysregulation and reduced numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+T, and CD8+T cells, altering the innate immunity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) in COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: Data for acute invasive rhinosinusitis was obtained from the Otorhinolaryngology departments at our tertiary hospital at the period from January 2017 to December 2020. Then the risk factors of comorbid diseases and fungal types between post-COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups regarding the incidence of AIFRS are compared. RESULTS: Consequently, the incidence of AIFRS showed a more significant difference (P < 0.05) in post-COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 especially in immunocompromised patients, diabetic, renal, and liver dysfunction patients as well as patients with risk factors of AIFRS. The most common organisms affecting patients with AIFRS are Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Absidia mucor. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AIFRS is markedly prominent in post-COVID-19 patients than in those of non-COVID-19, especially in immunocompromised, diabetic, renal, and liver dysfunction patients and patients with risk factors for rhinosinusitis.","Ismaiel, Wael F; Abdelazim, Mohamed H; Eldsoky, Ibrahim; Ibrahim, Ahmed A; Alsobky, Mahmoud E; Zafan, Ebtesam; Hasan, Abdulkarim",Am J Otolaryngol,335,14

OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of mucocutaneous findings, characterize morphologic patterns, and describe relationship to course in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study at 2 tertiary hospitals (Northwell Health) between May 11, 2020 and June 15, 2020. RESULTS: Among 296 hospitalized adults with COVID-19, 35 (11.8%) had at least 1 disease-related eruption. Patterns included ulcer (13/35, 37.1%), purpura (9/35, 25.7%), necrosis (5/35, 14.3%), nonspecific erythema (4/35, 11.4%), morbilliform eruption (4/35, 11.4%), pernio-like lesions (4/35, 11.4%), and vesicles (1/35, 2.9%). Patterns also showed anatomic site specificity.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients' intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. METHODS: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. MEASUREMENTS: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. MAIN RESULTS: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. CONCLUSION: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early. The model may be the basis to simulate stochastic models for bed occupation in intensive care units under different casemix scenarios.","Henzi, Alexander; Kleger, Gian-Reto; Hilty, Matthias P; Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Ziegel, Johanna F",PLoS One,335,22

However, the clinical significance of the LUS score in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of the LUS score in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: The LUS protocol consisted of 12 scanning zones and was performed in 280 consecutive patients with COVID-19. The LUS score based on B-lines, lung consolidation and pleural line abnormalities was evaluated. RESULTS: The median time from admission to LUS examinations was 7 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-10). Patients in the highest LUS score group were more likely to have a lower lymphocyte percentage (LYM%); higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, hypersensitive troponin I and creatine kinase muscle-brain; more invasive mechanical ventilation therapy; higher incidence of ARDS; and higher mortality than patients in the lowest LUS score group. After a median follow-up of 14 days [IQR, 10-20 days], 37 patients developed ARDS, and 13 died. Patients with adverse outcomes presented a higher rate of bilateral involvement; more involved zones and B-lines, pleural line abnormalities and consolidation; and a higher LUS score than event-free survivors. The Cox models adding the LUS score as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.02 ~ 1.08; P < 0.001; Akaike information criterion [AIC] = 272; C-index = 0.903) or as a categorical variable (HR 10.76, 95% CI 2.75 ~ 42.05; P = 0.001; AIC = 272; C-index = 0.902) were found to predict poor outcomes more accurately than the basic model (AIC = 286; C-index = 0.866). An LUS score cut-off > 12 predicted adverse outcomes with a specificity and sensitivity of 90.5% and 91.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The LUS score devised by our group performs well at predicting adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and is important for risk stratification in COVID-19 patients.","Ji, Li; Cao, Chunyan; Gao, Ying; Zhang, Wen; Xie, Yuji; Duan, Yilian; Kong, Shuangshuang; You, Manjie; Ma, Rong; Jiang, Lili; Liu, Jie; Sun, Zhenxing; Zhang, Ziming; Wang, Jing; Yang, Yali; Lv, Qing; Zhang, Li; Li, Yuman; Zhang, Jinxiang; Xie, Mingxing",Crit Care,335,16

Rightly, there is a global response for recognition and planning on how to deal with mental health problems for everyone impacted by the global pandemic. This does not just include COVID-19 patients but the general public and health care workers as well. There is also a need to understand the role of the virus itself in the pathophysiology of mental health disorders and longer-term mental health sequelae. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients develop neurological symptoms such as headache, altered consciousness, and paraesthesia. Brain tissue oedema and partial neurodegeneration have also been observed in an autopsy. In addition, there are reports that the virus has the potential to cause nervous system damage. Together, these findings point to a possible role of the virus in the development of acute psychiatric symptoms and long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19. The brain pathologies associated with COVID-19 infection is likely to have a long-term impact on cognitive processes. Evidence from other viral respiratory infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), suggests a potential development of psychiatric disorders, long-term neuropsychiatric disorders, and cognitive problems. In this paper, we will review and evaluate the available evidence of acute and possible long-term neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19. We will discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms and the implications this will have on preparing a long-term strategy to monitor and manage such patients.","Kumar, Sanjay; Veldhuis, Alfred; Malhotra, Tina",Front Psychol,335,28

Our results showed that the RT-LAMP amplified the N gene with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity at isothermal condition. The optimal reaction condition was achieved at 60°C for 30 min. The RT-LAMP assay was more sensitive than gel-based RT-PCR and PCR. It had a higher sensitivity than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the equal virus templates. In addition, the established RT-LAMP differentiated TGEV from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine rotavirus, porcine pseudorabies virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and avian infectious bronchitis virus.

The query protein sequence is dissected into overlapping short sequence segments. Ten different physicochemical features describe each amino acid; therefore nine residues long segment is represented as a point in a 90 dimensional space. The database of sequence segments with confirmed by experiments post-translational modification sites are used for training a set of ANNs. RESULTS: The efficiency of the classification for each type of modification and the prediction power of the method is estimated here using recall (sensitivity), precision values, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and leave-one-out tests (LOOCV). The significant differences in the performance for differently optimized neural networks are observed, yet the AMS 3.0 tool integrates those heterogeneous classification schemes into the single consensus scheme, and it is able to boost the precision and recall values independent of a PTM type in comparison with the currently available state-of-the art methods.

However, people without experience in analysis have difficulty understanding its conditions and methods, and as a result it takes longer to establish countermeasures. It must be noted that understanding conditions by simply aligning occurrences in the accident in a chronological order is difficult. PURPOSE: A workflow chart that considers time was proposed so that individuals without adequate experience in analysis could easily carry out root cause analysis. METHODS: In the ‘workflow chart (WFC)’, the time sequence was described horizontally. On the vertical axis, the business manual, the occurrence of the accident, and the time of the occurrence are displayed. In the bottom column of patient event, information regarding damage to patients was written in accordance with time axis. Regarding the degree of damage, the time of error until the accident was identified was connected using a straight line (when the patient was not affected, a dotted line was used) in order to show the overall picture of the accident. RESULTS: According to the time flow chart, hints to identify potential risks were proposed. Focus was placed not only on the error event, but also on keywords such as manual inadequacy, time gap, degree of error and so on to easily lead to the question ‘why?’ To visualise this, I proposed an operation flow chart. By using time-WFC, even beginners can easily develop accident countermeasure strategies. CONCLUSION: Using a WFC that considers time, time of error and the occurrence of accident could be visualised.

METHODS: Fifty HCWs performed a personal or causal glove removal method (pretest) and a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-recommended glove removal method (posttest) at distances of 2 feet and 3 feet from the rubbish bin after the application of fluorescent solution (the simulated contaminant) onto their gloved hands. RESULTS: The incidence of the small patch of fluorescent stain (<1 cm(2)) on the front of the doffed gloves was significantly lower in the posttest than in the pretest. The incidence of small and large patches (>1 cm(2)) on the front of the doffed gloves and on the cover of the rubbish bin was significantly lower at 3 feet than at 2 feet. Health care assistants had significantly higher levels of contamination than other HCWs in the pretest but not in the posttest. There was no significant difference in hand contamination rate between pretest and posttest based on distance from the rubbish bin and type of HCW.

Its diagnosis is based on immunotherapeutic histories, clinical symptoms, and the computed tomography (CT) imaging. The radiological features were typically ground-glass opacities, similar to CT presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. Thus, clinicians are cautious in differential diagnosis especially in COVID-19 epidemic areas. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a 67-year-old Han Chinese male patient presenting with dyspnea and normal body temperature on the 15th day of close contact with his son, who returned from Wuhan. He was diagnosed as advanced non-small cell lung cancer and developed pneumonitis post Sintilimab injection during COIVD-19 pandemic period. The chest CT indicated peripherally subpleural lattice opacities at the inferior right lung lobe and bilateral thoracic effusion. The swab samples were taken twice within 72 hours and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) results were COVID-19 negative. The patient was thereafter treated with prednisolone and antibiotics for over 2 weeks. The suspicious lesion has almost absorbed according to CT imaging, consistent with prominently falling CRP level. The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis mixed with bacterial infection was clinically diagnosed based on the laboratory and radiological evidences and good response to the prednisolone and antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia possess similar clinical presentations and CT imaging features. Therefore, differential diagnosis depends on the epidemiological and immunotherapy histories, RT-PCR tests.

A growing body of evidence supports central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Methods We conducted a review of the literature for articles concerning COVID-19 pathophysiology, neurological manifestations, and neuroscience provider recommendations and guidelines. Results CNS manifestations range from vague non-focal complaints to severe neurologic impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether neurological dysfunction is due to direct viral injury or systemic disease. The virus may affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction in addition to direct pulmonary injury. Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of ongoing scientific and clinical findings. Conclusions This review consolidates the current body of literature regarding the neurological impact of coronaviruses, discusses the reported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, and highlights recommendations for patient management. Specific recommendations pertaining to clinical practice for neurologists and neurosurgeons are provided.","Werner, Cassidy; Scullen, Tyler; Mathkour, Mansour; Zeoli, Tyler; Beighley, Adam; Kilgore, Mitchell D.; Carr, Christopher; Zweifler, Richard M.; Aysenne, Aimee; Maulucci, Christopher M.; Dumont, Aaron S.; Bui, Cuong J.; Keen, Joseph R.",World Neurosurg,335,1

CD4 T cells, as a key component of the immune system, are central in orchestrating adaptive immune responses. After decades of investigation, five major CD4 T helper cell (Th) subsets have been identified: Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg (T regulatory), and Tfh (follicular T helper) cells. Th1 cells, defined by the expression of lineage cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ and the master transcription factor T-bet, participate in type 1 immune responses to intracellular pathogens such as mycobacterial species and viruses; Th2 cells, defined by the expression of lineage cytokines interleukin (IL)-4/IL-5/IL-13 and the master transcription factor GAΤA3, participate in type 2 immune responses to larger extracellular pathogens such as helminths; Th17 cells, defined by the expression of lineage cytokines IL-17/IL-22 and the master transcription factor RORγt, participate in type 3 immune responses to extracellular pathogens including some bacteria and fungi; Tfh cells, by producing IL-21 and expressing Bcl6, help B cells produce corresponding antibodies; whereas Foxp3-expressing Treg cells, unlike Th1/Th2/Th17/Tfh exerting their effector functions, regulate immune responses to maintain immune cell homeostasis and prevent immunopathology. Interestingly, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have been found to mimic the functions of three major effector CD4 T helper subsets (Th1, Th2, and Th17) and thus can also be divided into three major subsets: ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s. In this review, we will discuss the differentiation and functions of each CD4 T helper cell subset in the context of ILCs and human diseases associated with the dysregulation of these lymphocyte subsets particularly caused by monogenic mutations.","Zhu, Xiaoliang; Zhu, Jinfang",Int J Mol Sci,335,16

As the number of infections soared, and capabilities for testing lagged behind, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging became more relevant in the early diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In a few weeks, proposed new methods for lung screening using deep learning rapidly appeared, while quality assurance discussions lagged behind. This paper proposes a set of protocols to validate deep learning algorithms, including our ROI Hide-and-Seek protocol, which emphasizes or hides key regions of interest from CXR data. Our protocol allows assessing the classification performance for anomaly detection and its correlation to radiological signatures, an important issue overlooked in several deep learning approaches proposed so far. By running a set of systematic tests over CXR representations using public image datasets, we demonstrate the weaknesses of current techniques and offer perspectives on the advantages and limitations of automated radiography analysis when using heterogeneous data sources.","Sadre, Robbie; Sundaram, Baskaran; Majumdar, Sharmila; Ushizima, Daniela",Sci Rep,335,3

Specifically, as shoppers experience more crowding, their shopping basket contains (a) relatively more affect-rich (“hedonic”) products, and (b) relatively more national brands. We offer a plausible dual-process explanation for this phenomenon: Crowding induced distraction limits cognitive capacity, increasing the relative impact of affective responses in purchase decisions. As we are the first to show that level of crowding relates to what shoppers buy (at both product and brand level), the implications of these effects for retailers are discussed.","Aydinli, Aylin; Lamey, Lien; Millet, Kobe; ter Braak, Anne; Vuegen, Maya",,335,16

This was a retrospective case-control study. The participants were 88 older adults with mild cognitive decline who participated in a class designed to help prevent cognitive decline. The class was suspended from early-March to end of May 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and resumed in June 2020. We collected demographic and cognitive function test data (Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale [TDAS]) before and after class suspension and questionnaire data on their lifestyle and thoughts during the suspension. Change in TDAS scores from before and after the suspension was used to divide the participants into decline (2 or more points worsening) and non-decline (all other participants) groups, with 16 (18.2%) and 72 (81.8%) participants in each group, respectively. A logistic regression model showed that the odds ratio (OR) for cognitive decline was lower in participants whose responses were ""engaged in hobbies"" (OR = 0.07, p = 0.015), ""worked on a worksheet about cognitive training provided by the town hall"" (OR = 0.19, p = 0.026), and ""had conversations over the phone"" (OR = 0.28, p = 0.0495). There was a significant improvement in TDAS scores after class was resumed (p < 0.01). A proactive approach to intellectual activities and social ties may be important for the prevention of cognitive decline during periods of restrictions due to COVID-19. We found that cognitive function test scores before class suspension significantly improved after resuming classes. We speculate that continued participation in the class led to positive behavioral changes in daily life during periods of restriction due to COVID-19.","Kouzuki, M.; Furukawa, S.; Mitani, K.; Urakami, K.",,335,24

The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers. METHODS: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, self-questionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: 669 patients and 325 caregivers agreed to participate. 70 % of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement. The proportions of subjects with a stress level ≥ 6 linked to the epidemic, confinement, fear of contracting COVID-19 and fear of infecting a loved one were respectively 23.9%, 26.2%, 33.4% and 42%. 39.2% presented with certain (13.7%) or doubtful (19.2%) anxious symptoms. 21.2% presented a certain (7.9%) or doubtful (13.3%) depressive symptomatology. Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, in France, the majority of hemodialysis patients and caregivers found it beneficial to come to dialysis.

We aimed to determine the association between the levels of serum heavy metals, hs-CRP, vitamins, and curry intake and to predict risks of MetS based on marginal effects. A data set of 60,256 Koreans aged ≥ 15 years between 2009 and 2017 was used to obtain information on sociodemographic, lifestyle, family history characteristics, MetS, food intake survey, and serum heavy metals. Daily intake of vitamins was measured by a one-day 24 h recall, and curry consumption was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. Serum heavy metal levels were quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and using a mercury analyzer. We found that vitamin B1, B2, B3, C, and A intakes were significantly lower in subjects with than without MetS. In contrast, serum levels of Pb, Hg, Cd, vitamin A, E, and hs-CRP were significantly higher in subjects with MetS. The risk of MetS was significantly lower for high curry consumers than low curry consumers (adjusted odds ratio 0.85, 95%CI 0.74–0.98). The risks of MetS were reduced by 12% and 1%, when vitamin B1 and C intakes increased by one mg, respectively, but were increased by 14%, 3%, and 9%, when serum levels of Pb, Hg, and hs-CRP increased by one unit. These results show that the potential health benefits resulting from vitamin and curry intakes could protect the public against the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Further studies are required to reduce risk factors associated with serum heavy metal levels and to determine whether interactions between vitamin and curry consumption influence the presence of MetS.","Duc, Hai Nguyen; Oh, Hojin; Kim, Min-Sun",Antioxidants (Basel),335,15

Other studies have assessed SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies in HCW, with disparate findings regarding risk based on role and demographics. METHODS: We screened 3,904 employees and clinicians for SARS-CoV-2 virus positivity and serum IgG at a major New Jersey hospital from April 28-June 30, 2020. We assessed positive tests in relation to demographic and occupational characteristics and prior COVID-19 symptoms using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (0.3%) tested positive for virus and 374 (9.6%) tested positive for IgG (total positive: 381 [9.8%]). Compared to participants with no patient care duties, the odds of positive testing (virus or antibodies) were higher for those with direct patient contact: below-median patient contact, adjusted OR (aOR): 1.71, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.48); above-median patient contact aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.91. The proportion of participants testing positive was highest for phlebotomists (23.9%), maintenance/housekeeping (17.3%), dining/food services (16.9%), and interpersonal/support roles (13.7%) despite lower levels of direct patient care duties. Positivity rates were lower among doctors (7.2%) and nurses (9.1%), roles with fewer under-represented minorities. After adjusting for job role and patient care responsibilities and other factors, Black and Latinx workers had two-fold increased odds of a positive test compared to White workers. Loss of smell, taste, and fever were associated with positive testing.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG survives gastrointestinal transit in the neonatal calf and does not produce D‐lactate. To determine whether this probiotic reduces gastrointestinal D‐lactate production or severity of diarrhea or both, 48 calves (mean, 11 days old; range, 2–30 days) admitted to the clinic for treatment of diarrhea were randomly allocated to 2 groups. The experimental group was given Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (1×10(11) cfu/d) PO, dissolved in milk or oral electrolyte solution, in addition to clinic treatment protocols; the other group served as a control. Serum and fecal samples were obtained at admission and at 24 and 48 hours after initial administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.

The DlEPV is introduced into the tephritid fruit fly larval host along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of the DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to poxvirus putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly (A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms such as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae and lambda phage integrase ([Formula: see text]-Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for early (TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and of a concatenate of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from the ancestral node between the fowlpox virus and the genus B, lepidopteran and orthopteran EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV, respectively, belong. The DlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A, and [Formula: see text]-Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be involved in either viral pathogenicity or enhancing parasitism via the gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or via the integration of a portion of the viral genome into the wasp and/or parasitized fly.","Hashimoto, Y.; Lawrence, P.O.",J Insect Physiol,335,1

As the 10th most populated country in the world, Mexico is on a major threat by COVID-19 due to the limitations of intensive care capacities, and a total of about 1.5 hospital beds for every 1000 citizens. In this paper, we projected different scenarios to evaluate sharp or gradual quarantine lifting strategies, however, even in the hypothetical scenario that Mexico would continue with full confinement, hospitals would be reaching the maximum capacity of hospital bed occupancy. Mexican government is planning to relax the strict social distancing regulations on 1 June 2020, however, epidemic rebound risks are latent. Our results suggest that lifting social confinement needs to be gradually sparse while maintaining a decentralized region strategy among the Mexican states. To substantially lower the number of infections, predictions highlight that the elderly should remain in social confinement (approximately 11.3% of the population); the confined working class (roughly 27% of the population) must gradually return in at least four parts in consecutive months; and to the last the return of students to schools (about 21.7%). As the epidemic progresses, de-confinement strategies need to be continuously re-adjusting with the new pandemic data. Assuming the most optimistic scenario by our predictions, the smallest number of new COVID-19 cases, Mexico would require at least a 3 fold increase in hospital capacities dedicated for COVID-19. Furthermore, to observe the real dimension of the epidemic, Mexico would need to increase to at least 18 samples per 1000 people, currently is only 0.6 per 1000. All mathematical models, including ours, are only a possibility of many of the future, however, the different scenarios that were developed here highlight that a gradual decentralized region de-confinement with a significant increase in healthcare capacities is paramount to avoid a high death toll in Mexico.","Azanza Ricardo, C.

The lack of unified guidelines on what constitutes elective surgery left plastic surgeons without a clear framework to guide their practices. More urgently, the ambiguity in defining elective surgery leaves plastic surgeons without clear guidance as states begin to phase in these procedures. METHODS: Recommendations issued by state governing bodies as of April 28, 2020, were reviewed. National society and federal guidelines pertaining to postponement and resumption of elective surgeries affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak were also reviewed. Recommendations based on the above are collated for plastic surgeons. RESULTS: Thirty-six states and the District of Columbia provide recommendations regarding elective surgery. Cosmetic surgery is considered an elective surgery and should be postponed; this may be among the first elective surgeries to safely resume. Societal guidelines provide disease-specific recommendations for cancer-related surgery and breast reconstruction. Trauma, other cancer-related reconstruction, and hand surgeries are considered nonelective if postponement threatens life or limb or if a patient is highly symptomatic. Postponement and resumption of oncology, trauma, and hand surgery cases depend on disease stage and complexity of reconstruction. Pediatric craniofacial surgery presents unique challenges due to the time-sensitive nature of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Guidance on elective surgery is vague for plastic surgeons. Government recommendations and societal guidelines provide a framework for plastic surgeons to assess the elective nature of a surgical intervention and safety of resumption; however, a nuanced assessment must be made on local disease transmission, supply availability, and hospital capacity.","Schoenbrunner, Anna R.; Sarac, Benjamin A.; Janis, Jeffrey E.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

The present research aimed to assess the level of misconceptions and the factors associated with it among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: A selected Rohingya camp situated in Cox’s Bazar, a southeastern district of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Information was collected from 416 conveniently selected FDMNs who were aged 60 years and above. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was misconceptions related to the spread, prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Information on 14 different locally relevant misconceptions was gathered, each was scored as one, and obtained a cumulative score, ranging from 0 to 14, with a higher score indicating a higher level of misconceptions. A multiple linear regression model explored the factors associated with misconceptions. RESULTS: The participants had an average of five misconceptions. The most prevalent misconceptions were: everyone should wear personal protective equipment when outside (84.6%) and its prevention by nutritious food (62.5%) and drinking water (59.3%). Other notable misconceptions included the spread of COVID-19 through mosquito bites (42%) and its transmissions only to the non/less religious person (31.4%). In regression analyses, memory or concentration problems, communication frequency with social networks, pre-existing conditions and receiving information from health workers were significantly associated with higher COVID-19 misconceptions. These misconceptions were less likely among those overwhelmed by COVID-19, having COVID-19 diagnosed friends or family members and receiving information from friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that misconceptions were prevalent among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. The associations have important implications for programmes to prevent and manage COVID-19 in these settings.

While doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages such as better human to human transmissibility potential might get naturally selected. This short communication demonstrates how the mutation frequency patterns are evolving in 2,457 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 19 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of seven months. Out of these, 14 variants are showing increasing mutational probabilities suggesting their propagation with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. Whereas mutational probabilities of five variants have significantly decreased in June onwards as compared to March/April, suggesting their termination with time. Further in-depth investigation of these identified variants will provide valuable knowledge about the evolution, infection strategies, transmission rates, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Hudson B., Shenu; Kolte, Vaishnavi; Khan, Azra; Sharma, Gaurav",bioRxiv,335,20

Here we show that quantification of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible in a clinical setting, using a duplex RT-qPCR assay which targets both the E gene (Charité assay) and a human RNA transcript, RNase P (CDC assay) as an internal sample sufficiency control. Samples in which RNase P is not amplified indicate that sample degradation has occurred, PCR inhibitors are present, RNA extraction has failed or swabbing technique was insufficient. This important internal control reveals that 2.4% of nasopharyngeal swabs (15/618 samples) are inadequate for SARS-CoV-2 testing which, if not identified, could result in false negative results. We show that our assay is linear across at least 7 logs and is highly reproducible, enabling the conversion of Cq values to viral copy numbers using a standard curve. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 copy number was independent of the RNase P copy number indicating that the per-swab viral copy number is not dependent on sampling- further allowing comparisons between samples. The ability to quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number will provide an important opportunity for viral burden-guided public health and clinical decision making.","Rowan, Aileen G.; May, Philippa; Badhan, Anjna; Herrera, Carolina; Watber, Patricia; Penn, Rebecca; Crone, Michael A.; Storch, Marko; Garson, Jeremy A.; McClure, Myra; Freemont, Paul S.; Madona, Pinglawathee; Randell, Paul; Taylor, Graham P.",J Virol Methods,335,2

This disease is one of the most important infectious diseases in cats, and it is associated with high mortality, particularly among younger cats. In this study, we isolated a wild-type FIPV HRB-17 epidemic strain from the blood sample of household pet cat exhibiting the characteristic wet-form FIP symptoms, which has been confirmed further by animal infection. Further, we developed an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay for the accurate detection of FCoV based on the amplification of the highly conserved FIPV N gene. Then, using a combination of the real-time RT-PCR approach and a serum chemistry assay, we performed an epidemiological survey of FIPV infection in cats living in Harbin City, Northeast China. The results indicated that the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats at an analytical detection limit of 8.2 × 10(1) viral genome copies/μL, but could not effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. Additionally, the results of the epidemiological survey investigating feline blood samples (n = 1523) collected between July 2017 to July 2019 revealed an FIPV prevalence of approximately 12% (189/1523). Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Nevertheless, it still highlighted the severity of the FIP epidemic in cats and reiterated the urgent need to develop effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents and anti-FIPV vaccines. As pet cats are household animals, risk communication and continuous region-extended surveillance cat programs are recommended.","Guan, Xueting; Li, Hua; Han, Meijing; Jia, Shuo; Feng, Baohua; Gao, Xuwen; Wang, Zhuo; Jiang, Yanping; Cui, Wen; Wang, Li; Xu, Yigang",Mol Cell Probes,335,2

For several years DPP-4 inhibitors in addition to GLP-1 analogues are of major importance in the clinical management of obesity and type 2 diabetes. DPP-4 is also known as CD26 and represents a membrane bound protease on the surface of several eukaryotic cell types. Of interest, DPP-4, like ACE2, has been shown to serve as a binding partner for corona-like viruses to enter host immune cells. Since metabolic diseases are major risk factors for the present COVID-19 pandemic, we examined circulating soluble DPP-4 serum concentrations in patients suffering from severe COVID-19 infection and in healthy human subjects in a case control design. In this analysis sDPP-4 levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (242.70 ± 202.12 ng/mL versus 497.70 ± 188.13 ng/mL, p = 0.02). We also examined sDPP-4 serum concentrations in patients suffering from sepsis not due to corona-like viruses. In these subjects, sDPP-4 levels were not different compared to healthy case controls (p = 0.14), which might suggest the decrease of sDPP-4 to be specific for corona-like virus infections. Currently, most data point towards membrane bound ACE2 in contrast to DPP-4 as the major binding partner for COVID-19 internalization into host immune cells. However, the finding that the circulating soluble form of DPP-4 is reduced in hospitalized patients might suggest a regulatory role for both, ACE and DPP-4, in COVID-19 infections, especially since obesity and type 2 diabetes are major risk factor for a severe course of the disease","Schlicht, Kristina; Rohmann, Nathalie; Geisler, Corinna; Hollstein, Tim; Knappe, Carina; Hartmann, Katharina; Schwarz, Jeanette; Tran, Florian; Schunk, Domagoj; Junker, Ralf; Bahmer, Thomas; Rosenstiel, Philip; Schulte, Dominik; Türk, Kathrin; Franke, Andre; Schreiber, Stefan; Laudes, Matthias",Int J Obes (Lond),335,29

Yet bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a serious and unresolved public health problem that kills hundreds of thousands of people annually, being an insidious and silent pandemic. To contain the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, populations confined and tightened hygiene measures. We performed this study with computer simulations and by using mobility data of mobile phones from Google in the region of Lisbon, Portugal, comprising 3.7 million people during two different lockdown periods, scenarios of 40 and 60% mobility reduction. In the simulations, we assumed that the network of physical contact between people is that of a small world and computed the antibiotic resistance in human microbiomes after 180 days in the simulation. Our simulations show that reducing human contacts drives a reduction in the diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in human microbiomes. Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s pairwise tests show very strong evidence (p < 0.000, adjusted using the Bonferroni correction) of a difference between the four confinement regimes. The proportion of variability in the ranked dependent variable accounted for by the confinement variable was η(2) = 0.148, indicating a large effect of confinement on the diversity of antibiotic resistance. We have shown that confinement and hygienic measures, in addition to reducing the spread of pathogenic bacteria in a human network, also reduce resistance and the need to use antibiotics.","Rebelo, João S.; Domingues, Célia P.

We directly exposed air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term CS and then infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after CS exposure with a lack of ABSC proliferation. Single cell profiling of the cultures showed that the normal interferon response was reduced after CS exposure with infection. Treatment of CS-exposed ALI cultures with Interferon β-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting one potential mechanism for more severe viral infection.

In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, research groups have shared viral genome sequence data through the GISAID initiative. We collected and computationally profiled ∼223,000 full SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences from GISAID over one year for emergent nonsynonymous mutations. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at substantially different rates, with most viral proteins exhibiting little mutational variability. As anticipated, our calculations capture previously reported mutations occurred in the first period of the pandemic, such as D614G (Spike), P323L (NSP12), and R203K/G204R (Nucleocapsid), but also identify recent mutations like A222V and L18F (Spike) and A220V (Nucleocapsid). Our comprehensive temporal and geographical analyses show two periods with different mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome: December 2019 to June 2020 and July to November 2020. Some mutation rates differ also by geography; the main mutations in the second period occurred in Europe. Furthermore, our structure-based molecular analysis provides an exhaustive assessment of mutations in the context of 3D protein structure.

Here, we updated the meta-analysis with more studies and additional assessments that include adults and children within the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Sixteen articles (22 studies) were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using three genetic models (allele, recessive and dominant), in which ARDS patients were compared with non-ARDS patients (A1) and healthy controls (A2). Mortality outcomes were also assessed (A3). The influence of covariates was examined by meta-regression. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple pooled associations. Subgroup analyses based on ethnicity (Asians, Caucasians) and life stage (adults, children) were conducted. Heterogeneity was addressed with outlier treatment. RESULTS: This meta-analysis generated 68 comparisons, 21 of which were significant. Of the 21, four A1 and three A3 highly significant (P(a) = 0.00001–0.0008) outcomes withstood Bonferroni correction. For A1, allele and recessive associations were found in overall (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39–0.61), Caucasians (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35–0.61) and children (ORs 0.49–0.66, 95% CI 0.33–0.84) analyses.

These outcomes were either robust, or statistically powered or both and uninfluenced by covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations of the ACE I/D polymorphism with the risk of ALI/ARDS were indicated in Caucasians and children as well as in Asians in mortality analysis.

METHODS: Between November 2020 and January 2021, 6217 employees in the German healthcare system were questioned about their vaccination willingness, sociodemographic, occupational, COVID-19-specific, and psychosocial characteristics using the online VOICE survey within the framework of the University Medicine Network (NUM). RESULTS: The vaccination willingness of the sample group was 65.3%. A higher vaccination willingness was associated with male gender; age > 40 years; having no children or no migration background; not working in direct patient care; belonging to a COVID-19 risk group or professional group of physicians and psychologists in comparison with nursing staff; feeling sufficiently informed about COVID-19 and protected by the measures of the national or local authorities and the employer; fear of infection; and lack of signs of depression. Physicians showed the highest willingness to get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, an overall moderate vaccination willingness against COVID-19 in the health sector was described.

The objectives of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interferon alfa-2b and LPV/r plus interferon alfa-2b for SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 123 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR on nasopharyngeal swab and symptoms between Jan. 13 and Apr. 23, 2020. All patients received standard supportive care and regular clinical monitoring. Patients were assigned to standard care group (n = 12), interferon alfa-2b group (n = 44), and combination LPV/r plus interferon alfa-2b group (n = 67). The primary endpoints were duration of required oxygen support and virus clearance time. Associations between therapies and these outcomes were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics were not significantly different among the three groups (P > 0.05). No significant associations were observed between LPV/r/interferon alfa-2b and faster SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance (HR, 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45–1.61]; P = 0.61 in interferon alfa-2b group vs HR, 0.59 [95% CI 0.32–1.11]; P = 0.10 in LPV/r plus interferon alfa-2b group). Individual therapy groups also showed no significant association with duration of required oxygen support. There were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidence of adverse events (P > 0.05).

The mechanisms and pathways of local complement activation remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the deposition of complement components in the lungs, kidneys, and liver in patients with COVID-19 patients and to determine the pathway/s of complement activation. We performed immunofluorescence analyses of autopsy specimens of lungs, kidney, and liver from 12 COVID-19 patients who died of acute respiratory failure. Snap-frozen samples embedded in OCT were stained with antibodies against complement components and activation products, IgG, and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Lung deposits of C1q, C4, C3, and C5b-9 were localized in the capillaries of the interalveolar septa and on alveolar cells. IgG displayed a similar even distribution, suggesting classical pathway activation. The spike protein is a potential target of IgG, but its uneven distribution suggests that other viral and tissue molecules may be targeted by IgG. FB deposits were also seen in COVID-19 lungs and are consistent with activation of the alternative pathway, whereas MBL and MASP-2 were hardly detectable. Analysis of kidney and liver specimens mirrored findings observed in the lung. Complement deposits were seen on tubules and vessels of the kidney with only mild C5b-9 staining in glomeruli, and on the hepatic artery and portal vein of the liver. Complement deposits in different organs of deceased COVID-19 patients caused by activation of the classical and alternative pathways support the multi-organ nature of the disease and the contribution of the complement system to inflammation and tissue damage.","Macor, Paolo; Durigutto, Paolo; Mangogna, Alessandro; Bussani, Rossana; De Maso, Luca; D’Errico, Stefano; Zanon, Martina; Pozzi, Nicola; Meroni, Pier Luigi; Tedesco, Francesco",Biomedicines,335,16

Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a tool for surveillance and mitigation of potential viral outbreaks, circumventing biases introduced by clinical patient testing. Due to the situation urgency, protocols followed for isolating viral RNA from sewage were not adapted for such sample matrices. In parallel to their implementation for fast collection of data to sustain surveillance and mitigation decisions, molecular protocols need to be harmonized to deliver accurate, reproducible, and comparable analytical outputs. Here we studied analytical variabilities linked to viral RNA isolation methods from sewage. Three different influent wastewater volumes were used to assess the effects of filtered volumes (50, 100 or 500 mL) for capturing viral particles. Three different concentration strategies were tested: electronegative membranes, polyethersulfone membranes, and anion-exchange diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns. To compare the number of viral particles, different RNA isolation methods (column-based vs. magnetic beads) were compared. The effect of extra RNA purification steps and different RT-qPCR strategies (one step vs. two-step) were also evaluated. Results showed that the combination of 500 mL filtration volume through electronegative membranes and without multiple RNA purification steps (using column-based RNA purification) using two-step RT-qPCR avoided false negatives when basal viral load in sewage are present and yielded more consistent results during the surveillance done during the second-wave in Delft (The Hague area, The Netherlands). By paving the way for standardization of methods for the sampling, concentration and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from sewage, these findings can help water and health surveillance authorities to use and trust results coming from wastewater based epidemiology studies in order to anticipate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Calderón-Franco, David; Orschler, Laura; Lackner, Susanne; Agrawal, Shelesh; Weissbrodt, David G.",Sci Total Environ,335,30

We consistently find that participants with a lower perceived socio-economic status, social conservatives, individualists, and participants who are less worried about COVID-19 are significantly more likely to support individuals who ignore the goverment's, scientists’, medical professionals’ COVID-19 advice. Regarding race, Black participants consistently (and Hispanics to a lesser degree) were more likely to support individuals who ignore the three expert groups relative to Whites. All these findings generalized to weaker trust towards public policy decision experts. Asian and other racial groups’ trust was consistently lower than Whites, but primarily numerically, not statistically. Age and gender showed weak or inconsistent results respectively. We provide an enhanced understanding of the demographic factors that can result in individuals/groups ignoring COVID-19 experts. Lack of compliance could increase the transmission risks of the virus. Therefore, non-partisan campaigns that target individuals/groups who distrust COVID-19 experts will likely reduce COVID-19 related deaths.

The ORF7b from the peritoneal/pleural effusions of FIP cats and from the rectal swabs of healthy cats was amplified. Of the 40 FCoVs analysed, 32 were found to have an intact 7b gene whereas eight showed deletions of either three or 12 nucleotides.

Secondary outcomes were mortality, admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation requirement, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine, calcium, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. Results: Of 240 randomized patients (mean age, 56 years; 56% men), 232 (96.7%) were included in the primary analysis. Log-rank test showed that hospital length of stay was comparable between the vitamin D3 supplementation and placebo groups (7.0 days [95% CI, 6.1 to 7.9] and 7.0 days [95% CI, 6.2 to 7.8 days]; hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5]; P = .379; respectively). The rate of mortality (7.0% vs 5.1%; P = .590), admission to ICU (15.8% vs 21.2%; P = .314), and mechanical ventilation requirement (7.0% vs 14.4%; P = .090) did not significantly differ between groups. Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels compared to placebo (difference, 24.0 ng/mL [95% CI, 21.0% to 26.9%]; P = .001). No adverse events were observed. Conclusions and Relevance: Among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, vitamin D3 supplementation was safe and increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, but did not reduce hospital length of stay or any other relevant outcomes vs placebo. This trial does not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation as an adjuvant treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Murai, I. H.; Fernandes, A. L.; Sales, L. P.; Pinto, A. J.; Goessler, K.

Apart from the pandemic virus that was responsible for most ILI cases, incidence rates of other viruses have varied among geographical areas. In general, human rhinovirus was the most frequent among individuals from the community, and respiratory syncytial virus among hospitalized patients. Detection rates of other respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, adenovirus or parainfluenza viruses have been much lower. On the basis of an interference mechanism, human rhinovirus may contribute to modulate the pandemic wave, although available data are not conclusive to support this hypothesis. In contrast, the epidemic wave of respiratory syncytial virus during 2009–2010 was similar to previous seasons. Overall, incidence rates of respiratory viruses other than influenza did not change significantly during the pandemic season compared to other seasons. No association has been found between coinfection of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses with the prognosis of patients with influenza. The involvement of clinical virology laboratories in the etiological diagnosis of ILI cases has improved and has optimized diagnostic procedures.","Navarro-Marí, José María; Pérez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Galán Montemayor, Juan Carlos; Marcos Maeso, María Ángeles; Reina, Jordi; de Oña Navarro, María; Cilla Eguiluz, Carlos Gustavo",Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología Clínica,335,1

This leads to faster recovery times, fewer post-surgical wound infections and shorter hospital stays. For these reasons, laparoscopy could be particularly advantageous to patients in low to middle income countries (LMICs). Unfortunately, sterile processing departments in LMIC hospitals are faced with limited access to equipment and trained staff which poses an obstacle to safe surgical care. The reprocessing of laparoscopic devices requires specialised equipment and training. Therefore, when LMIC hospitals invest in laparoscopy, an update of the standard operating procedure in sterile processing is required. Currently, it is unclear whether LMIC hospitals, that already perform laparoscopy, have managed to introduce updated reprocessing methods that minimally invasive equipment requires. The aim of this study was to identify the laparoscopic sterile reprocessing procedures in rural India and to test the effectiveness of the sterilisation equipment. METHODS: We assessed laparoscopic instrument sterilisation capacity in four rural hospitals in different states in India using a mixed-methods approach. As the main form of data collection, we developed a standardised observational checklist based on reprocessing guidelines from several sources. Steam autoclave performance was measured by monitoring the autoclave cycles in two hospitals. Finally, the findings from the checklist data was supported by an interview survey with surgeons and nurses. RESULTS: The checklist data revealed the reprocessing methods the hospitals used in the reprocessing of laparoscopic instruments. It showed that the standard operating procedures had not been updated since the introduction of laparoscopy and the same reprocessing methods for regular surgical instruments were still applied. The interviews confirmed that staff had not received additional training and that they were unaware of the hazardous effects of reprocessing detergents and disinfectants. CONCLUSION: As laparoscopy is becoming more prevalent in LMICs, updated policy is needed to incorporate minimally invasive instrument reprocessing in medical practitioner and staff training programmes. While reprocessing standards improve, it is essential to develop instruments and reprocessing equipment that is more suitable for resource-constrained rural surgical environments.

The COVID-19 virus is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. However, the fecal-oral transmission of the virus has not been ruled out and it is important to ascertain how acidic condition in the stomach affects the infectivity of the virus. Besides, it is unclear how stable the COVID-19 virus is under dry and wet conditions. In the present study, we have shown that the COVID-19 virus is extremely infectious as manifested by the infection of Vero-E6 cells by one PFU (Plaque Forming Unit) of the virus. We then investigated the stability of the COVID-19 virus in wet, dry and acidic (pH2.2) environments at room temperature. Results showed that the COVID-19 virus could survive for three days in wet and dry environments, but the dry condition is less favorable for the survival of the virus. Our study also demonstrated that the COVID-19 virus at a relative high titer (1.2 x 103 PFU) exhibits a certain degree of tolerance to acidic environment at least for 60 minutes. When the virus titer was [â¤]1.0 x 103 PFU, acid treatment (pH2.2) for 30 or 60 minute resulted in virus inactivation. It suggests that the virus at a high concentration may survive in the acidic environment of the stomach.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of the registered COVID-19 trials has been performed on platforms including ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (CHiCTR), Australian Clinical Trials Registry, Britain’s National Research Register (BNRR), Current Control Trials (CCT), and Glaxo Smith Kline Register. Trials registered at the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak are included, without language restrictions. For each study, the registration information, study design, and administrator information are collected and summarized. RESULTS: A total of 220 registered trials were evaluated as of February 27, 2020. Hospital-initiated trials were the majority and account for 80% of the sample. Among the trials, pilot studies and phase 4 trials are more common and represent 35% and 19.1% of the sample, respectively. The median sample size of the registered trials is 100, with interquartile range 60–240. Further, 45.9% of the trials mentioned information on a data monitoring committee. 54.5% of the trials did not specify the disease severity among patients they intend to recruit. Four types of interventions are most common in the experimental groups across the registered studies: antiviral drugs, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), biological agents, and hormone drugs. Among them, the TCM and biological agents are frequently used in pilot study and correspond to a variety of primary endpoints. In contrast, trials with antiviral drugs have more targeted primary outcomes such as “COVID-19 nucleic acid test” and “28-day mortality.” CONCLUSIONS: We provide an evidence mapping and analysis of registered COVID-19 clinical trials in China. In particular, it is critical for ongoing and future studies to refine their research hypothesis and better identify their intervention therapies and the corresponding primary outcomes. It is also imperative for multiple public health divisions and research institutions to work together for integrative clinical data capture and sharing, with a common objective of improving future studies that evaluate COVID-19 interventions.","Lu, Liming; Li, Fan; Wen, Hao; Ge, Shuqi; Zeng, Jingchun; Luo, Wen; Wang, Lai; Tang, Chunzhi; Xu, Nenggui",BMC Med,335,21

Prior research on this topic has been inconclusive. Identifying key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impact on transmission we study this question using one of the largest assembled databases of COVID-19 infections and weather. Methods: We assemble a dataset that includes virus transmission and weather data across 3,739 locations from December 12, 2019 to April 22, 2020. Using simulation, we identify key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impacts on transmission, design a statistical method to overcome these challenges, and validate it in a blinded simulation study. Using this method and controlling for location-specific response trends we estimate how different weather variables are associated with the reproduction number for COVID-19. We then use the estimates to project the relative weather-related risk of COVID-19 transmission across the world and in large cities. Results: We show that the delay between exposure and detection of infection complicates the estimation of weather impact on COVID-19 transmission, potentially explaining significant variability in results to-date. Correcting for that distributed delay and offering conservative estimates, we find a negative relationship between temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius and estimated reproduction number ([R]), with each degree Celsius associated with a 3.1% (95% CI, 1.5% to 4.8%) reduction in [R]. Higher levels of relative humidity strengthen the negative effect of temperature above 25 degrees. Moreover, one millibar of additional pressure increases [R] by approximately 0.8 percent (95% CI, 0.6% to 1%) at the median pressure (1016 millibars) in our sample. We also find significant positive effects for wind speed, precipitation, and diurnal temperature on [R]. Sensitivity analysis and simulations show that results are robust to multiple assumptions. Despite conservative estimates, weather effects are associated with a 43% change in [R] between the 5th and 95th percentile of weather conditions in our sample. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for the relationship between several weather variables and the spread of COVID-19. However, the (conservatively) estimated relationships are not strong enough to seasonally control the epidemic in most locations.","Xu, R.; Rahmandad, H.; Gupta, M.; DiGennaro, C.; Ghaffarzadegan, N.; Jalali, M.

To estimate all-cause excess deaths in Mexico City (MXC) and New York City (NYC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. We estimated expected deaths among residents of both cities between March 1 and August 29, 2020, using log-linked negative binomial regression and compared these deaths with observed deaths during the same period. We calculated total and age-specific excess deaths and 95% prediction intervals (PIs). Results. There were 259 excess deaths per 100 000 (95% PI = 249, 269) in MXC and 311 (95% PI = 305, 318) in NYC during the study period. The number of excess deaths among individuals 25 to 44 years old was much higher in MXC (77 per 100 000; 95% PI = 69, 80) than in NYC (34 per 100 000; 95% PI = 30, 38).

OBJECTIVE: We examined transmission within hemodialysis facilities, with a specific focus on the possibility of indirect patient-to-patient transmission through shared dialysis chairs. DESIGN: We used real-world data from hemodialysis patients treated between February 1(st) and June 8(th), 2020 to perform a case-control study matching each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient (case) to a non-SARS-CoV-2 patient (control) in the same dialysis shift and traced back 14 days to capture possible exposure from chairs sat in by SARS-CoV-2 patients. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, race, facility, shift date, and treatment count. SETTING: 2,600 hemodialysis facilities in the United States. PATIENTS: Adult (age ≥18 years) hemodialysis patients. MEASUREMENTS: Conditional logistic regression models tested whether chair exposure after a positive patient conferred a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the immediate subsequent patient. RESULTS: Among 170,234 hemodialysis patients, 4,782 (2.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean age 64 years, 44% female). Most facilities (68.5%) had 0 to 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 patient. We matched 2,379 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases to 2,379 non-SARS-CoV-2 controls; 1.30% (95%CI 0.90%, 1.87%) of cases and 1.39% (95%CI 0.97%, 1.97%) of controls were exposed to a chair previously sat in by a shedding SARS-CoV-2 patient.

Dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan crucial for wound healing, has unique affinity for autoantigens (autoAgs) from apoptotic cells. DS-autoAg complexes are capable of stimulating autoreactive B cells and autoantibody production. Using DS affinity, we identified an autoantigenome of 408 proteins from human fetal lung fibroblast HFL11 cells, at least 231 of which are known autoAgs. Comparing with available COVID data, 352 proteins of the autoantigenome have thus far been found to be altered at protein or RNA levels in SARS-Cov-2 infection, 210 of which are known autoAgs. The COVID-altered proteins are significantly associated with RNA metabolism, translation, vesicles and vesicle transport, cell death, supramolecular fibrils, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and interleukin signaling. They offer clues to neurological problems, fibrosis, smooth muscle dysfunction, and thrombosis. In particular, 150 altered proteins are related to the nervous system, including axon, myelin sheath, neuron projection, neuronal cell body, and olfactory bulb. An association with the melanosome is also identified. The findings from our study illustrate a strong connection between viral infection and autoimmunity. The vast number of COVID-altered proteins with propensity to become autoAgs offers an explanation for the diverse autoimmune complications in COVID patients. The variety of autoAgs related to mRNA metabolism, translation, and vesicles raises concerns about potential adverse effects of mRNA vaccines.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Urban tertiary care center in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: 302 patients admitted in an inpatient setting, ≥18 years old, with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via nasal PCR swab were randomly selected. Patients were separated into two cohorts based on their body mass index and hemoglobin A1c. 150 patients were placed in the non-obese, non-diabetic cohort and 152 patients were placed in the corresponding cohort (obesity alone, obesity and diabetes, and diabetes alone). MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were development of acute kidney injury, commencement of renal replacement therapy, aminotransferase elevation, troponin elevation, lactic acidosis, development of septic shock, use of vasopressors, presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and intubation. The secondary outcomes were length of stay in days and mortality. RESULTS: Patients with obesity and/or diabetes were more likely to develop ARDS (79 patients vs 57 patients, p<0.0001) and to be intubated (71 patients vs 45 patients, p=0.0031). Patients with obesity and/or diabetes were more likely to require vasopressors (60 patients vs 41 patients, p=0.0284) and to develop lactic acidosis (median 3.15 mmol/L, IQR 1.8 to 5.2 mmol/L, p=0.0432). When comparing patients with diabetes with and without obesity against patients with obesity alone, they were more likely to develop ARDS (87.5%, p=0.0305). Despite these findings, there was no difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, those with obesity and/or diabetes were more likely to suffer severe complications, but had negligible differences in mortality. This highlights the importance of close monitoring of patients with these conditions and additional areas of research needed to explain the mortality findings.","Randhawa, Gurchetan; Syed, Kunzah A; Singh, Kavish; Kundal, Sanchit V; Oli, Sharad; Silver, Michael; Syed, Sumrah A; Suban Na Ayutthaya, Thanunthorn; Williams, Shanado; Lodato, Zachary L; Rozvadovskiy, Vladimir; Kamholz, Stephan; Wolf, Lawrence",BMJ Open,335,1

Ideally, the vaccine would prevent virus infection and transmission as well as preventing COVID-19 disease. We previously developed an oral adenovirus-based vaccine technology that induces both mucosal and systemic immunity in humans. Here we investigate the immunogenicity of a range of candidate adenovirusbased vaccines, expressing full or partial sequences of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, in mice. We demonstrate that, compared to expression of the S1 domain or a stabilized spike antigen, the full length, wild-type spike antigen induces significantly higher neutralizing antibodies in the periphery and in the lungs, when the vaccine is administered mucosally. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced by this leading vaccine candidate at low and high doses. This fulllength spike antigen plus nucleocapsid adenovirus construct has been prioritized for further clinical development.","Moore, Anne C.; Dora, Emery G.; Peinovich, Nadine; Tucker, Kiersten P.; Lin, Karen; Cortese, Mario; Tucker, Sean N.",bioRxiv,335,16

We reviewed the case epidemiology and the various public health measures implemented from January to May 2020. METHOD: We described and compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases recorded in different phases of the epidemic and reviewed the effectiveness of the public health measures implemented using the changes in the daily number of confirmed cases and the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission. RESULTS: Between January and May 2020, 1084 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, about 70% of which had travel history during the incubation period. The case fatality ratio was 0.4%. The local epidemic progressed through four phases: (i) preparedness and imported infection from mainland China, (ii) local transmission, (iii) imported infection from overseas countries associated with local transmission, and (iv) controlled imported infection with limited local transmission, with an eventual reduction of daily case number and minimization of onset-to-admission interval. Various public health measures, including enhanced surveillance, border control and social distancing, were introduced in phases in response to the prevailing local and global situations. DISCUSSION: Hong Kong’s overall containment strategy has led to a stabilization of number of cases and absence of community-wide outbreak in the 4.5 months since the reporting of the first case. Hong Kong’s strategy of containment might serve as an example for future planning of preparedness and response against novel infectious agents.","Lam, Ho Yeung; Lam, Tsz Sum; Wong, Chi Hong; Lam, Wing Hang; Leung, Chi Mei Emily; Au, Ka Wing Albert; Lam, Chau Kuen Yonnie; Lau, Tin Wai Winnie; Chan, Yung Wai Desmond; Wong, Ka Hing; Chuang, Shuk Kwan",Int J Infect Dis,335,0

Statistical significance of difference at two time points was done to determine how restrictive epidemiological measures and exposure of children to COVID-19 infection affect this prevalence in different age groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the first time point (13th to 29th May 2020), 240 samples and in second time point (24th October to 23rd November 2020), 308 serum samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Confirmation of results and titre determination was done using virus micro-neutralization test. Subjects were divided according to gender, age and epidemiological history. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differs significantly in two time points (P = 0.010). In first time point 2.9% of seropositive children were determined and in second time point 8.4%. Statistically significant difference (P = 0.007) of seroprevalence between two time points was found only in a group of children aged 11-19 years. At the first time point, all seropositive children were asymptomatic with titre < 8. At the second time point, 69.2% seropositive children were asymptomatic with titre ≥ 8. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly lower at the first time point than at the second time point.

We examined whether older adults were vulnerable to COVID infection during the early pandemic if they were food insecure versus food secure. Study design Cross-sectional study using a nationally representative population-based survey of US older adults. Methods We used a random subsample of Health and Retirement Study (HRS) drawn in June 2020 (N = 3,212). We compared the odds of reporting COVID infection in a household, COVID infection and mortality among acquaintances, and respondent’s perceived fair or poor health across household food insecurity status resulted from financial or nonfinancial barriers. Baseline health and socioeconomic circumstances were adjusted in the models. Results Results showed higher COVID infection rate among food-insecure households than among their food-secure counterparts during the pandemic. Food insecurity due to nonfinancial obstacles was associated with greater likelihood of COVID infection both within respondents’ households (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03–2.90) and among their acquaintances (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05–1.65). Food insecurity caused by both nonfinancial and financial constraints was associated with twice the likelihood of knowing someone who died from COVID than their food-secure counterparts (aOR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.27–3.61). Conclusions Food insecurity driven by nonfinancial constraints played an important role in the ongoing pandemic among US older adults. Policies addressing COVID need to recognize the vulnerability of food-insecure older adults beyond lack of monetary resources.","Choi, Shinae L.; Men, Fei",Public Health,335,1

The psychic pain associated with longing to return home had been considered a mental disorder for centuries, especially in Europe, where it was a sign of moral weakness between nations. Nostalgia's effects on American Civil War soldiers-anxiety, depression, and sleep and appetite disturbances, for example-were described by clinicians and linked to significant morbidity and mortality. Since then, although these effects of combat have been of interest, focus has shifted to psychic trauma, relegating the concept of nostalgia to an unclassified but commonly encountered condition. Besides wartime trauma, symptomatic conditions related to nostalgia have been described among displaced persons and refugees living in the diaspora longing for their homelands (e.g., social displacement syndrome). More recently, nostalgia has pervaded culture as a benign pastime, with no implications for psychopathology. Finally, the longing for return to an idyllic or imagined lifestyle has returned amid worldwide quarantining and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this new sense, nostalgia has become a remedy rather than a disease. We identify four major iterations of nostalgia: the medical condition of homesickness, the condition studied in wartime, the application to migration and social displacement, and as a remedy for existential anxiety. We conclude that nostalgia per se is neither pathological nor normative, but a consistent phenomenon in human existence that should not be overlooked in cultural assessment and psychotherapy.","Weiss, Kenneth J; Dube, Anish Ranjan",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,335,1

Most of the previous researchers trained their classifiers with respiratory sounds such as breathing or coughs, and they achieved promising results. We claim that using special voice patterns besides other respiratory sounds can achieve better performance. In this study, we used the Coswara dataset where each user has recorded 9 different types of sounds as cough, breathing, and speech labeled with COVID-19 status. A combination of models trained on different sounds can diagnose COVID-19 more accurately than a single model trained on cough or breathing only.

Currently, no proper medicine or effective treatment strategies are available; therefore, repurposing of FDA approved drugs may play an important role in overcoming the situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for 2-O-methyltransferase (2′OMTase), which plays a key role in methylation of viral RNA for evading host immune system. In the present study, the protein sequence of 2′OMTase of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed, and its structure was modeled by a comparative modeling approach and validated. The library of 3000 drugs was screened against the active site of 2′OMTase followed by re-docking analysis. The apo and ligand-bound 2′OMTase were further validated and analyzed by using molecular dynamics simulation. KEY FINDINGS: The modeled structure displayed the conserved characteristic fold of class I MTase family. The quality assessment analysis by SAVES server reveals that the modeled structure follows protein folding rules and of excellent quality. The docking analysis displayed that the active site of 2′OMTase accommodates an array of drugs, which includes alkaloids, antivirals, cardiac glycosides, anticancer, steroids, and other drugs. The redocking and MD simulation analysis of the best 5 FDA approved drugs reveals that these drugs form a stable conformation with the 2′OMTase. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggested that these drugs may be used as potential inhibitors for 2′OMTase for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sharma, Kedar; Morla, Sudhir; Goyal, Arun; Kumar, Sachin",Life Sci,335,16

There is a lack of evidence related to the prevalence of mental disorder symptoms as well as their heterogeneities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America, a continent across the equators. The current study aims to provide meta-analytical evidence on mental disorder symptoms during COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers, general healthcare workers, the general population, and university students in Latin America. Methods. Bibliographical databases, such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, PsycINFO, and medRxiv, were systematically searched to identify pertinent studies up to Februry 6, 2021. Two coders performed the screening using predefined eligibility criteria. Studies were assigned quality scores using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.

However, on March 26th the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), along with other leading medical organizations, released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, several hospitals around the United States and abroad are turning to this technique out of desperation (e.g. New York), but little data exists to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (Vt). Methods: We developed a single compartment computational model of four patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient. Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical/clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient tidal volumes.","Kheyfets, V.

Methods: The variable number of deaths due to respiratory diseases in Chile was analyzed considering the monthly records of meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and humidity) in each Region of Chile and severity of COVID-19, to evaluate the mortality trend before and after the pandemic. For this, different Non-Observable Heterogeneity Models for Panel Data were used. Results: Our findings show that among the variables that affect the mortality rate from respiratory diseases, there are the number of deaths from COVID-19 that has a negative effect, the number of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU) that has a positive effect and the minimum temperature with a negative effect. These results are supported by the application of the panel regression with one-way random-effects models. Conclusion: This study revealed that there is an unexpected reduction in deaths from respiratory diseases in Chile in the post-pandemic period. Therefore, it can be concluded that this variable decreased with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Barria Sandoval, C.; Mendez, A.; Ferreia, G.; Toffoletto, M. C.",,335,3

We investigated associations between lockdown stringency and objective sleep and resting-heart rate measures in ~ 113,000 users of a consumer sleep tracker across 20 countries from Jan to Jul 2020, compared to an equivalent period in 2019. With stricter lockdown measures, midsleep times were universally delayed, particularly on weekdays, while midsleep variability and resting heart rate declined. These shifts (midsleep: + 0.09 to + 0.58 h; midsleep variability: − 0.12 to − 0.26 h; resting heart rate: − 0.35 to − 2.08 bpm) correlated with the severity of lockdown across different countries (all Ps < 0.001) and highlight the graded influence of stringency lockdowns on human physiology.","Ong, Ju Lynn; Lau, TeYang; Karsikas, Mari; Kinnunen, Hannu; Chee, Michael W.

D-limonene was selected as a model essential oil, well known for its pleasant odor and its enhanced antimicrobial properties. The synthesized particles were assessed for their morphology and geometric characteristics by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), which revealed the formation of particles with mean diameters at the nanoscale (D[3,2] = 0.135 μm), with a spherical shape, while the dried particles formed larger clusters of several microns (D[3,2] = 80.69 μm). The percentage of the loaded D-limonene was quantified by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), complemented by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis coupled with a pyrolysis unit (Py/GC-MS). The results showed that the volatiles emitted by the nanoparticles were composed mainly of D-limonene (10% w/w of dry particles). Particles subjected to higher temperatures tended to decompose. The mechanism that governs the release of D-limonene from the as-synthesized particles was studied by fitting mathematical models to the release data obtained by isothermal TGA analysis of the dry particles subjected to accelerated conditions. The analysis revealed a two-stage release of the volatiles, one governed by D-limonene release and the other governed by TEGDMA release. Finally, the antimicrobial potency of the D-limonene-loaded particles was demonstrated, indicating the successful synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles loaded with D-limonene, owing to enhanced antimicrobial properties. The overall performance of these nanoparticles renders them a promising candidate material for the formation of self-sterilized surfaces with enhanced antimicrobial activity and potential application in food packaging.","Andriotis, Eleftherios G.; Papi, Rigini M.; Paraskevopoulou, Adamantini; Achilias, Dimitris S.",Nanomaterials (Basel),335,5

Neurotoxins are the main components of scorpion venom that are known to be responsible for the pathological manifestations of envenoming. Besides neurotoxins, a wide range of other bioactive molecules can be found in scorpion venoms. Advances in separation, characterization, and biotechnological approaches have enabled not only the development of more effective treatments against scorpion envenomings, but have also led to the discovery of several scorpion venom peptides with interesting therapeutic properties. Thus, scorpion venom may not only be a medical threat to human health, but could prove to be a valuable source of bioactive molecules that may serve as leads for the development of new therapies against current and emerging diseases. This review presents both the detrimental and beneficial properties of scorpion venom toxins and discusses the newest advances within the development of novel therapies against scorpion envenoming and the therapeutic perspectives for scorpion toxins in drug discovery.","Ahmadi, Shirin; Knerr, Julius M.; Argemi, Lídia; Bordon, Karla C.

The paper aims to improve the radiological diagnosis in the case of coronavirus disease COVID-19 pneumonia on forms of noninvasive approaches with conventional and high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) scan images upon chest CT images of patients confirmed with mild to severe findings. The preliminary study is to compare the radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in conventional chest CT images with images processed by a new tool and reviewed by expert radiologists. The researchers used a new filter called Golden Key Tool (GK-Tool) which has confirmed the improvement in the quality and diagnostic efficacy of images acquired using our modified images. Further, Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) architecture called VGG face was used to classify chest CT images. The classification has been performed by using VGG face on various datasets which are considered as a protocol to diagnose COVID-19, Non-COVID-19 (other lung diseases), and normal cases (no findings on chest CT). Accordingly, the performance evaluation of the GK-Tool was fairly good as shown in the first set of results, where 80–95% of participants show a good to excellent assessment of the new images view in the case of COVID-19 patients. The results, in general, illustrate good recognition rates in the diagnosis and, therefore, would be significantly higher in normal cases with COVID-19. These results could reduce the radiologist's workload burden and play a major role in the decision-making process.","Salem Salamh, Ahmed B.; Salamah, Abdulrauf A.; Akyüz, Halil Ibrahim",Radiol Res Pract,335,24

This study was designed to explore whether free thyroxin (FT4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels affected the mortality of patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 complicated with NTI who were treated at our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low TSH and normal TSH groups, as well as low and normal-high FT4 group, according to the reference range of TSH or FT4 levels. The 90-day mortality and critical illness rates were compared among patients with low and normal TSH levels, as well as among patients with low FT4 levels and normal-high FT4 levels; in addition, differences in demographic and laboratory data were compared. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations of TSH and FT4 levels with mortality. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients with low FT3 levels and without a history of thyroid disease were included, 68% of whom had normal FT4 and TSH levels. Critical illness rates (74.07% VS 37.40%, P = 0.001) and mortality rates (51.85% VS 22.76%, P = 0.002) were significantly higher in the low TSH group than in the normal TSH group. Although no significant difference in the critical illness rate was found (P = 0.296), the mortality rate was significantly higher in the low FT4 group (P = 0.038). Low TSH levels were independently related to 90-day mortality (hazard ratio = 2.78, 95% CI:1.42–5.552, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Low FT4 and TSH concentrations were associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI; moreover, low TSH levels were an independent risk factor for mortality in these patients.","Gong, Jing; Wang, Ding-kun; Dong, Hui; Xia, Qing-song; Huang, Zhao-yi; Zhao, Yan; Chen, Xing; Yuan, Fen; Li, Jing-bin; Lu, Fu-er",BMC Endocr Disord,335,1

This paper proposes functional data analysis (FDA) to improve the prediction of temporal patterns of influenza. METHODS: We illustrate FDA methods using the weekly Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity level data from the U.S. We propose to use the Fourier basis function for transforming discrete weekly data to the smoothed functional ILI activities. Functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) is used to examine the regional differences in temporal patterns and the impact of state's political orientation. RESULTS: The ILI activity has a very distinct peak at the beginning and end of the year. There are significant differences in average level of ILI activities among geographic regions. However, the temporal patterns in terms of the peak and flat time are quite consistent across regions. The geographic and temporal patterns of ILI activities also depend on the political make-up of states. The states affiliated with Republicans had higher ILI activities than those affiliated with Democrats across the whole year. The influence of political party affiliation on temporal pattern is quite different among geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Functional data analysis can help us to reveal the temporal variability in average ILI levels, rate of change in ILI levels, and the effect of geographical regions. Consideration should be given to wider application of FDA to generate more accurate estimates in public health and biomedical research.","Rahman, Azizur; Jiang, Depeng",Infect Dis Model,335,16

Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB). METHODS: We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. RESULTS: From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n = 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2. CONCLUSION: Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Gupta, Ritesh; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,335,24

BACKGROUND: Over 42,600 healthcare professionals took care of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan in the initial months between 23 January 2020 and 8 April 2020. Many used to write online diaries on Sina Microblog and still wrote about their experiences in the front line on this site. However, there has been little research on frontline nurses' experiences in the initial months of the pandemic through analyzing their narratives. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis was used to analyze online diaries written by frontline nurses in Wuhan. A total of 205 entries in online diaries were collected from 12 frontline nurses, as accessible to those who subscribed to Sina Microblog social media site, between 23 January 2020 and 8 April 2020. NVivo12 was used to help analyze the data, and COREQ reporting guidelines were also used in this study. RESULTS: Two themes were identified: constructing a better self and constructing a strong support network. A better self was constructed in describing positive emotions, commitment to care, pride and achievements, and whole-person growth. A strong support network was constructed through social support via different sources and gaining self-support via narrating their personal experiences in diaries. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline nurses demonstrated personal growth, psychological well-being, and professionalism in the process of constructing a better self and a strong support network. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings indicate that frontline nurses can use narratives as debriefing opportunities and a way of gaining self-support. We suggest that online communities of professional support be used as an essential platform for sharing narratives and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of frontline nurses in the COVID-19 pandemic and other global public health events.","Chen, Hua; Wang, Ying; Liu, Zengmei",J. clin. nurs,335,16

Since then, surgeries were halted in a bid to prevent transmission. However, since such a long halt is infeasible, a general protocol of screening the carriers, especially asymptomatic carries, is a dire need of time. The objective of our study is to propose an economically feasible protocol of COVID 19 screening. Simple but effective screening strategies can help to restore the workings of hospital surgical departments. Methods We analyzed the clinical data of patients turning up for elective surgeries at the Rawal General Hospital (RGH), Islamabad from the 24th of March to the 15th of May, 2020. Asymptomatic patients with negative COVID 19 contact and travel histories were screened with COVID 19 Immunochromatography (ICT) IgM / IgG Ab Test. Complete blood count (CBC) was done and interpreted in conjunction with the ICT results. Results 39 patients with a mean age of 49 years were studied. The result of ICT for COVID-19 was positive in 9 cases (23%). The entire positive ICT patients population expressed significantly lower lymphocyte count (p<0.01); 8 patients had high monocyte count (p<0.05) whereas only 4 patients had a combined high neutrophil and monocyte count (P<0.05). All of these four patients with high neutrophil count were females. The combined interpretation of CBC and ICT IgM / IgG Ab Test had a high accuracy in diagnosing asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers that were later confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Conclusion We propose that joint CBC-ICT interpretation should be adopted on a large scale to help in the diagnoses of asymptomatic carriers as both tests are simple and inexpensive and thus suit the developing countries limited health budget. Future research projects should be adopted in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed protocol on a large scale.

Recent guidelines encourage immediate empiric antibiotic treatment once a diagnosis of CAP is made. Concerns about treatment recommendations, on the one hand, and antibiotic stewardship, on the other, motivated this review of the medical literature on the etiology of CAP. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature on the etiology of CAP using methods defined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed using a combination of the keywords ‘pneumonia’, ‘CAP’, ‘etiology’, ‘microbiology’, ‘bacteriology’, and ‘pathogen’. We examined articles on antibiotics that were develop to treat pneumonia. We reviewed all ‘related articles’ as well as studies referenced by those that came up in the search. After we excluded articles that did not give sufficient microbiological data or failed to meet other predetermined criteria, 146 studies remained. Data were stratified into diagnostic categories according to the microbiologic studies that were done; results are presented as the percentage in each category of all cases in which an etiology was established. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP although declining in incidence; this decline has been greater in the US than elsewhere. Haemophilus influenzae is the second most common cause of CAP, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli. The incidence of all bacteria as causes of CAP has declined because, with routine use of PCR for viruses, the denominator, cases with an established etiology, has increased. Viruses were reported on average in about 10% of cases, but recent PCR-based studies identified a respiratory virus in about 30% of cases of CAP, with substantial rates of viral/bacterial coinfection. CONCLUSION: The results of this study justify current guidelines for initial empiric treatment of CAP. With pneumococcus and Haemophilus continuing to predominate, efforts at antibiotic stewardship might be enhanced by greater attention to the routine use of sputum Gram stain and culture. Because viral/bacterial coinfection is relatively common, the identification of a virus by PCR does not, by itself, allow for discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy.","Shoar, Saeed; Musher, Daniel M.",Pneumonia (Nathan),335,1

This project seeks to analyse community attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination, vaccine access and information needs. We also study how government incorporates research findings into the vaccination programme. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Coronavax protocol employs an analytical social media study, and a qualitative study using in-depth interviews with purposively selected community groups.

SAB-139 was characterized by several in vitro production, research, and clinical level assays using wild-type Makona-C05 or recombinant virus/antigens from different Ebola virus variants. SAB-139 potently activates natural killer cells, monocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has high-binding avidity demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance.

METHODS: Patients with MS with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and available anti–SARS-CoV-2 serology were included. The primary endpoint was the anti–SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) index. The multivariate analysis was adjusted for COVID-19 severity, SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, and the time between COVID-19 onset and the serology. RESULTS: We included 61 patients with available IgG index. The IgG index was lower in patients with fingolimod or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies compared with patients without treatment (p < 0.01), patients with interferon β-1a or glatiramer (p < 0.01), and patients with another DMT (p = 0.01). The IgG index was correlated with the time between COVID-19 onset and serology (r = −0.296 [−0.510; −0.0477], p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral response after COVID-19 was lower in patients with MS with fingolimod or anti-CD20 mAb. These patients could therefore be at risk of recurrent infection and could benefit from anti–SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The humoral response after vaccination and the delay before vaccination need to be evaluated.

The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive. METHODS: Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. RESULTS: A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1–17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5–23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13–0.54) times of that among the elderly (≥60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39–0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51–0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission.

Through case studies and questionnaire surveys, the characteristics of Japanese travel multinationals are compared to those of manufacturing companies. An “Ethnic Model” is developed which explains the unique behavior of these companies. It concludes that they are ethnically characterized in target markets, management styles in foreign subsidiaries, emphases on service, and competitors. Though this study focuses on the Japanese tourism industry, the result is potentially generalizable and applicable to other countries and other non-manufacturing industries.","Imanishi, Tamami",Annals of Tourism Research,335,1

METHOD: A retrospective, single centre, observational cohort study of all patients undergoing surgery between 17 March 2020 and 3May 2020 was performed. Outcomes were stratified by British Orthopaedic Association COVID-19 Patient Risk Assessment Tool. Patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of surgery were excluded. RESULTS: Overall, 96 patients assessed as negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of surgery underwent 100 emergency or urgent orthopaedic procedures during the study period. Within 30 days of surgery 9.4% of patients (n = 9) were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by nasopharyngeal swab. The overall 30 day mortality rate across the whole cohort of patients during this period was 3% (n = 3). Of those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 66% (n = 6) developed significant COVID-19 related complications and there was a 33% 30-day mortality rate (n = 3). Overall, the 30-day mortality in patients classified as BOA low or medium risk (n = 69) was 0%, whereas in those classified as high or very high risk (n = 27) it was 11.1%. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic surgery in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients who transition to positive within 30 days of surgery carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. In lower risk groups, the overall risk of becoming SARS-CoV-2 positive, and subsequently developing a significant postoperative related complication, was low even during the peak of the pandemic. In addition to ensuring patients are SARS-CoV-2 negative at the time of surgery it is important that the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is minimized through their recovery.

According to the World Health Organization third-most comprehensive cause of death in the world till 2030 would be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dominating viruses of respiratory infections are influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Antibiotics are mostly used to treat bacterial infections, and they do not effectively manage viral infections like sinusitis, sore throats, bronchitis, influenza, and common respiratory infections. Presently no medication is available only symptomatic interventions is an option in our hand. However, a lot of research is going on the vaccine and drugs-based approaches against respiratory viruses worldwide. Traditional medicines are getting the attraction to treat many diseases. It is vital to screen the medicinal plants to find the potential of new compounds for treatment against antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Licorice) pharmacological actions modulate the immune system, inhibit virus growth, produce anti-inflammatory activity, and inactivate viruses. This comprehensive review mainly focuses on the role of licorice in managing respiratory infections caused by viruses and bacteria, including complications associated with its excess intake. There has been limited human research's exhibited licorice effectiveness in respiratory infections; therefore, there is a need for uncompromising and long-term research. This paper will be a valuable reference for biologists and physicians looking for a medication for respiratory infections. Glycyrrhiza glabra could open the door to novel agents in drug discovery and development.","Wahab, Shadma; Ahmad, Irfan; Irfan, Safia; Siddiqua, Ayesha; Usmani, Shazia; Ahmad, Md Parwez",Mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry (Online),335,17

However, modern, busy lives leave limiting time for relaxation. Virtual reality (VR) experiences of pleasant and calming virtual environments, accessed with a head-mounted display (HMD), appear to promote relaxation. This study aimed to provide a systematic review of feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of studies that use VR to promote relaxation in the general population (PROSPERO 195,804). METHODS: Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched until 29th June 2020. Studies were included in the review if they used HMD technology to present virtual environments that aimed to promote or measure relaxation, or relaxation-related variables. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool was used to assess methodological quality of studies. RESULTS: 6403 articles were identified through database searching. Nineteen studies published between 2007 and 2020, with 1278 participants, were included in the review. Of these, thirteen were controlled studies. Studies predominantly used natural audio-visual stimuli to promote relaxation. Findings indicate feasibility, acceptability, and short-term effectiveness of VR to increase relaxation and reduce stress. Six studies received an EPHPP rating of ‘strong’, seven were ‘moderate’, and six were ‘weak’. CONCLUSIONS: VR may be a useful tool to promote relaxation in the general population, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when stress is increasing worldwide. However, methodological limitations, such as limited randomised controlled trials and longer-term evidence, mean that these conclusions should be drawn with caution. More robust studies are needed to support this promising area of VR relaxation.

BACKGROUND: Even though the risks faced by nurses while performing a dangerous task during the epidemic are similar, their experiences may differ. METHOD: This qualitative study was carried out with 17 nurses. The interviews were carried out individually and online. The data were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. RESULTS: From the analyses of the data, four key themes have emerged as follows: ‘needs’, ‘anger’, ‘questioning’ and ‘decision’. Needs include visibility, support, adaptation and sleep/rest. Nurses were angry because of their unmet expectations, feelings of injustice, and selfish and insensitive behaviours they faced. They questioned their profession and decided to either alienate from the profession or continue with the gains they had made. CONCLUSION: This study found that nurses perceived an imbalance between their efforts and their achievements. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: This study provides evidence for nursing managers to anticipate problems that may arise both during and after the outbreak. Nurses should be made to feel that they are valued members of the health care institution, and effective strategies should be implemented to improve their perceptions of organisational justice.","Yıldırım, Nazmiye; Aydoğan, Arzu; Bulut, Melisa",J Nurs Manag,335,3

To prevent its spread, many governments implemented strict lockdown measures, including the closure of factories and limitations on travel. These measures led to a decrease in human activity, affecting air pollutant emissions. This study evaluates air quality during the partial lockdown of Shanghai, the largest city in China, and the broader Yangtze River Delta region. It was found that daily concentrations of PM(2.5,) PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), and CO during the lockdown period were reduced by 9%, 77%, 31.3%, 60.4%, and 3% respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Even with decreasing concentrations of PM(2.5) and PM(10), the overall values are still more than four times higher for the lockdown period than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends for safe concentrations (10 μg/m(3) and 20 μg/m(3)). This indicates the existence of other background sources that continue to make a significant contribution to air pollution in the region even with severe reductions in human activity. This study may be used to guide environmental policy, as it demonstrates to what extent the control of pollution sources can improve air quality.","Filonchyk, Mikalai; Peterson, Michael",J geovis spat anal,335,20

This report describes the process of producing Cleveland Clinic UltraPure Solution (CCUPS), quality and safety monitoring, economic costs, and clinical outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: CVVHD experience at Cleveland Clinic, focusing on dialysate production, institutional factors, and patients requiring continuous kidney replacement therapy. Production is shown at www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGQgephMEwA. OUTCOMES: Feasibility, safety , and cost. RESULTS: Of 6,426 patients treated between 2011 and 2019 with continuous kidney replacement therapy, 59% were men, 71% were White, 40% had diabetes mellitus, and 74% presented with acute kidney injury. 98% of patients were treated with CVVHD using CCUPS, while the remaining 2% were treated with either continuous venovenous hemofiltration or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration using commercial solution. The prescribed and delivered effluent doses were 24.8 (IQR) versus 20.7 mL/kg/h (IQR), respectively. CCUPS was as effective in restoring electrolyte and serum bicarbonate levels and reducing phosphate, creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen levels as compared with packaged commercial solution over a 3-day period following initiation of dialysis, with a comparable effluent dose. Among those with acute kidney injury, mortality was similar to that predicted with the 60-day acute kidney injury predicted mortality score (r = 0.997; CI: 0.989-0.999). At our institution, the cost of production for 1 L of CCUPS is $0.67, which is considerably less than the cost of commercially purchased fluid. LIMITATIONS: Observational design without a rigorous control group. CONCLUSIONS: CVVHD using locally generated dialysate is safe and cost-effective.","Taliercio, Jonathan J.; Nakhoul, Georges; Vachharajani, Tushar J.; Layne, Matthew; Sedor, John; Thomas, George; Mehdi, Ali; Heyka, Robert; Demirjian, Sevag",Kidney Med,335,6

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of noncoding RNA molecules, participate in the progression of viral infectious diseases. Although the function of circRNAs has been a heavily researched topic, their role in CV-A16 infection is still unclear. In this study, the viral effects of CV-A16 on the cellular circRNA transcriptome were investigated using next-generation sequencing technology. The results showed that a total of 8726, 8611, and 6826 circRNAs were identified at 0, 12, and 24 h postinfection, respectively. Moreover, it was found that 1769 and 1192 circRNAs were differentially expressed in at 12 and 24 h postinfection, respectively. The common differentially expressed circRNAs were used for functional annotation analysis, and it was found that the parent genes of differentially expressed circRNAs might be associated with the viral infection process, especially the “Immune system process” in GO analysis and the “Inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway” in KEGG analysis. Subsequently, circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed, and the hsa_circ_0004447/hsa-miR-942-5p/MMP2, hsa_circ_0078617/hsa-miR-6780b-5p/MMP2 and hsa_circ_0078617/hsa-miR-5196-5p/MMP2 regulatory axes were identified by enrichment analysis as important networks during the progression of CV-A16 infection. Finally, six dysregulated circRNAs were selected for validation and were verified to be consistent with the sequencing results. Considering all of these results, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to present a comprehensive overview of circRNAs induced by CV-A16 infection, and this research demonstrated that a network of enriched circRNAs and circRNA-associated competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) is involved in the regulation of CV-A16 infection, thereby helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying CV-A16-host interactions.

Beginning in August, 2014, increases in severe respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 were reported across the USA. We aimed to describe the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory features of this outbreak, and to better understand the role of EV-D68 in severe respiratory illness. METHODS: We collected regional syndromic surveillance data for epidemiological weeks 23 to 44, 2014, (June 1 to Nov 1, 2014) and hospital admissions data for epidemiological weeks 27 to 44, 2014, (June 29 to Nov 1, 2014) from three states: Missouri, Illinois and Colorado. Data were also collected for the same time period of 2013 and 2012. Respiratory specimens from severely ill patients nationwide, who were rhinovirus-positive or enterovirus-positive in hospital testing, were submitted between Aug 1, and Oct 31, 2014, and typed by molecular sequencing. We collected basic clinical and epidemiological characteristics of EV-D68 cases with a standard data collection form submitted with each specimen. We compared patients requiring intensive care with those who did not, and patients requiring ventilator support with those who did not. Mantel-Haenszel χ(2) tests were used to test for statistical significance. FINDINGS: Regional and hospital-level data from Missouri, Illinois, and Colorado showed increases in respiratory illness between August and September, 2014, compared with in 2013 and 2012. Nationwide, 699 (46%) of 1529 patients tested were confirmed as EV-D68. Among the 614 EV-D68-positive patients admitted to hospital, age ranged from 3 days to 92 years (median 5 years). Common symptoms included dyspnoea (n=513 [84%]), cough (n=500 [81%]), and wheezing (n=427 [70%]); 294 (48%) patients had fever. 338 [59%] of 574 were admitted to intensive care units, and 145 (28%) of 511 received ventilator support; 322 (52%) of 614 had a history of asthma or reactive airway disease; 200 (66%) of 304 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required intensive care compared with 138 (51%) of 270 with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0·0004). Similarly, 89 (32%) of 276 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required ventilator support compared with 56 (24%) of 235 patients with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0·039). INTERPRETATION: In 2014, EV-D68 caused widespread severe respiratory illness across the USA, disproportionately affecting those with asthma. This unexpected event underscores the need for robust surveillance of enterovirus types, enabling improved understanding of virus circulation and disease burden.

The article draws on recent advances in data visualisation and analytics with the aim of informing upcoming international policy debates on the governance of synthetic biology by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. We use mapping techniques to identify how synthetic biology can best be understood and the range of institutions, researchers and funding agencies involved. Debates under the Convention are likely to focus on a possible moratorium on the field release of synthetic organisms, cells or genomes. Based on the empirical evidence we propose that guidance could be provided to funding agencies to respect the letter and spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity in making research investments. Building on the recommendations of the United States Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues we demonstrate that it is possible to promote independent and transparent monitoring of developments in synthetic biology using modern information tools. In particular, public and policy understanding and engagement with synthetic biology can be enhanced through the use of online interactive tools. As a step forward in this process we make existing data on the scientific literature on synthetic biology available in an online interactive workbook so that researchers, policy makers and civil society can explore the data and draw conclusions for themselves.","Oldham, Paul; Hall, Stephen; Burton, Geoff",PLoS One,335,2

When projections extrapolate from recent histories and adopt a ‘business as usual’ approach they risk failing to take account of shocks or unpredictable events that can have dramatic consequences for the status quo as seen with the global Covid-19 pandemic. This study used an explorative stakeholder process and shock centred narratives to discuss the potential impact of a diversity of shocks, examining system characteristics and trends that may amplify their impact. Through the development of scenarios, stakeholders revealed concerns about the stability of the food system and the social, economic and environmental consequence of food related shocks. Increasing connectivity served as a mechanism to heighten volatility and vulnerability within all scenarios, with reliance on singular crops and technologies (i.e. low diversity) throughout systems highlighted as another potential source of vulnerability. The growing role of social media in shaping attitudes and behaviours towards food, and the increasing role of automation emerged as contemporary areas of concern, which have thus far been little explored within the literature.","Hamilton, Hannah; Henry, Roslyn; Rounsevell, Mark; Moran, Dominic; Cossar, Frances; Allen, Kathleen; Boden, Lisa; Alexander, Peter",Futures,335,16

One such vulnerable group constitutes university students. The aim of this study is to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality among different groups of university students (medical, psychology, and other). METHODS: Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, we collected survey data among a large sample of 7228 university students from Poland (mean age = 22.78, s.d. = 4.40; 81% female). Data were collected in five waves, during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe (March and April 2020). RESULTS: The results demonstrate a significant increase in depression levels as the pandemic was progressing. We also found that female students scored significantly higher than male students on depression, anxiety, and stress. Psychology students recorded the lowest scores on depression and anxiety. Young adult students (aged 18–24 years) had more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality than adult students (⩾25 years). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insights into stress and mental health among university students during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to longitudinally assess the prevalence of exposure to the virus and social distancing practices in the local population. Methods: A randomized selection of households stratified by region was created. From June 15 to August 7, 2020, a dweller was randomized in each household, answered a questionnaire, and performed a test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The prevalence of positive tests was calculated for each week and adjusted for the test's sensitivity and specificity. Results: The adjusted proportion of positive results increased from 1.4% in the first week (margin of error [ME] 0% to 2.87%) to 13.38% in the eighth week (ME 10.22% to 16.54%). Among the 213 participants that tested positive, 55 (25.82%) were asymptomatic. Only 37 (17.37%) sought medical consultation for any symptom. Among the 77 (36.15%) that were leaving home to work or study, only 18 (23.38%) stopped due to any symptom. The proportion that referred going to bars, restaurants, or making non-essential shopping decreased from 20.56% in the first week to 8.61% during the peak of diagnoses. Conclusion: The low proportion of participants that sought medical consultation or stopped leaving home indicates strategies directed to isolate only those symptomatic reach a low proportion of infected patients.","Diegoli, H.; Conzatti, V.

However, an emergent strain of ZIKV has become widespread, causing severe pre- and post-natal neurological defects. There is now an urgent need for prophylactic and therapeutic agents. To address this, we investigated six human monoclonal antibodies with ZIKV epitope specificity and neutralizing activity in mouse models of ZIKV infection and microcephaly. A single intraperitoneal injection of these antibodies conveyed distinct levels of adult and in utero protection from ZIKV infection, which closely mirrored their respective in vitro neutralizing activities. One antibody, ZK2B10, showed the most potent neutralization activity, completely protected uninfected mice, and markedly reduced tissue pathology in infected mice. Thus, ZK2B10 is a promising candidate for the development of antibody-based interventions and informs the rational design of ZIKV vaccine.","Li, Cui; Gao, Fei; Yu, Lei; Wang, Ruoke; Jiang, Yisheng; Shi, Xuanling; Yin, Chibiao; Tang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Fuchun; Xu, Zhiheng; Zhang, Linqi",Cell Rep,335,20

Peak flow can be measured during inspiration or expiration. Of these measurements, nasal inspiratory peak flow is the best validated technique for home monitoring in clinical trials. The equipment is portable, relatively inexpensive, and simple to use. One disadvantage, however, is that nasal inspiratory peak flow is influenced by lower airway as well as upper airway function. Rhinomanometry is a more sensitive technique that is specific for nasal measurements. The equipment, however, requires an operator, is more expensive, and is not portable. Thus, it is applicable only for clinic visit measures in clinical trials. Measurements require patient cooperation and coordination, and not all can achieve repeatable results. Thus, this objective measure is best suited to laboratory challenge studies involving smaller numbers of selected volunteers. A nonphysiological measure of nasal patency is acoustic rhinometry. This sonic echo technique measures internal nasal luminal volume and the minimum cross-sectional area. The derivation of these measures from the reflected sound waves requires complex mathematical transformation and makes several theoretical assumptions. Despite this, however, such measures correlate well with the nasal physiological measures, and the nasal volume measures have been shown to relate well to results obtained by imaging techniques such as computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging. Like rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry is not suitable for home monitoring and can be applied only to clinic visit measures or for laboratory nasal challenge monitoring. It has advantages in being easy to use, in requiring little patient cooperation, and in providing repeatable results. In addition to nasal obstruction, allergic rhinitis is recognized to be associated with impaired mucociliary clearance and altered nasal responsiveness. Measures exist for the monitoring of these aspects of nasal dysfunction. Although measures of mucociliary clearance are simple to perform, they have a poor record of reproducibility. Their incorporation into clinical trials is thus questionable, although positive outcomes from therapeutic intervention have been reported. Measures of nasal responsiveness are at present largely confined to research studies investigating disease mechanisms in allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. The techniques are insufficiently standardized to be applied to multicenter clinical trials but could be used in limited-center studies to gain insight into the regulatory effects of different therapeutic modalities.","Nathan, Robert A.; Eccles, Ron; Howarth, Peter H.; Steinsvåg, Sverre K.; Togias, Alkis",J Allergy Clin Immunol,335,28

The purpose of this retrospective cross‐sectional study was to test the hypothesis that clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics for dogs and cats with MRLN mass lesions would differ for inflammatory vs. neoplastic etiologies. Dogs and cats with MRLN mass lesions that had undergone MRI and had a confirmed cytological or histopathological diagnosis were recruited from medical record archives. Clinical findings were recorded by one observer and MRI characteristics were recorded by two other observers who were unaware of clinical findings. A total of 31 patients were sampled, with 15 in the inflammatory lymphadenitis group and 16 in the neoplasia group. Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were more likely to be younger and present with lethargy (P = 0.001), pyrexia (P = 0.000), and neck pain (P = 0.006). Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were also more likely to have a leukocystosis (P = 0.02) and segmental neutrophilia (P = 0.001). Inflammatory masses were more likely to have moderate or marked MRI perinodal contrast enhancement (P = 0.021) and local muscle contrast enhancement (P = 0.03) whereas the neoplastic masses were more likely to have greater MRI width (P = 0.002) and height (P = 0.009). In conclusion, findings indicated that some clinical and MRI characteristics differed for dogs and cats with inflammatory vs. neoplastic medial retropharyngeal lymph node masses. Although histopathological or cytological diagnosis remains necessary for confirmation, these findings may help with the ranking of differential diagnoses of future cases.","Johnson, Philippa J.; Elders, Richard; Pey, Pascaline; Dennis, Ruth",Vet Radiol Ultrasound,335,18

Evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that local inflammation of the olfactory epithelium is linked to olfactory dysfunction. However, whether systemic inflammation causes olfactory dysfunction is yet to be determined. In the present behavioral study, we set out to test whether acute systemic inflammation impairs olfactory identification performance by inducing a transient and controlled state of systemic inflammation using an experimental endotoxemia model. We treated young healthy participants (N = 20) with a relatively high dose (2.0 ng/kg) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a placebo treatment in a double-blind within-subject design, and assessed participants’ ability to identify odors using the MONEX-40, a reliable method for experimental assessment of odor identification ability in healthy and young individuals. Our results show that olfactory identification performance was not affected by the acute systemic inflammation triggered by the injection of LPS. Moreover, odor identification performance following the LPS injection was not associated with levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α). Because experimental LPS-induced systemic inflammation does not affect olfactory identification performance, our findings suggest that chronic, rather than transient, systemic inflammation is a more likely mechanism to explore in order to explain the olfactory deficits observed in inflammatory diseases.","Tognetti, Arnaud; Sarolidou, Georgia; Lasselin, Julie; Lekander, Mats; Olsson, Mats J; Lundström, Johan N",Chem Senses,335,1

This prompted many countries, including Saudi Arabia, to suspend students' attendance at schools and to start distance education. This sudden shift in the educational system has affected students' learning, particularly for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing (d/Dhh) students, who have unique language and communication needs. AIM This study explores the challenges and support methods for d/Dhh students during their distance education in Saudi Arabia. METHODS A qualitative research study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 37 parents of d/Dhh students to answer the research questions. RESULTS Three themes emerged from the parents' responses: (1) the challenges faced by d/Dhh students in distance education; (2) the specific needs of d/Dhh students in distance education; and (3) the supports provided to d/Dhh students in distance education. CONCLUSIONS Distance education is a strategic choice, and parents must be informed about how to use the Madrasati e-learning platform effectively by providing solutions and supports.

Without appropriate regulation, infection-induced inflammatory pathology can be deadly. The innate immune system recognizes the microbial molecules conserved in many pathogens and engages a rapid response by producing inflammatory mediators and activating programmed cell death pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Activation of pattern recognition receptors, in combination with inflammatory cytokine-induced signaling through death domain-containing receptors, initiates a highly interconnected cell death process called PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis). Broadly speaking, PANoptosis is critical for restricting a wide range of pathogens (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites), which we describe in this review. We propose that re-examining the role of cell death and inflammatory cytokines through the lens of PANoptosis will advance our understanding of host–pathogen evolution and may reveal new treatment strategies for controlling a wide range of infectious diseases.","Place, David E; Lee, SangJoon; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Curr Opin Microbiol,335,17

In June 2020, when the national quarantine ended, 53 patients were in the program (28 FD, 19 GD, 5 HD), and about 14% of the domiciliary infusions not administrated (from March to May). 74% of the suspensions were due to COVID-related reasons: Fear about infection (mainly among FD), and in 3 cases COVID-suggestive symptoms, microbiologically unconfirmed. The first Spanish national program of enzymes HA in lysosomal diseases shows a very slow but continuous implementation in the last years.

According to initial reports, the lungs were thought to be the primary target, but recent case studies have shown its reach can extend to other organs including the heart and blood vessels. The severity of cardiac complications of COVID-19 depends on multiple underlying factors, with air pollutant exposure being one of them as reported by several recent studies. Airborne particulate matter attracts heightened attention due to its implication in various diseases, especially respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Inhaled particulate matter not only carries microorganisms inside the body but also elicits local and systemic inflammatory responses resulting in altering host’s immunity and increasing susceptibility to infection. Previous as well as recent studies have documented that particulate matter acts as a “carrier” for the virus and aids in spreading viral infections. This review presents the mechanisms and effects of viral entry and how pollution can potentially modulate pathophysiological processes in the heart.

At disease diagnosis, 37 of the 94 (39%) patients (group 1) were managed on an outpatient basis whereas the remaining 57 (61%) (group 2) required hospitalization. Choices regarding management strategy were made based on disease severity. In group 1, 41% received antivirals and 76% hydroxychloroquine. Eight percent died and 5% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In group 2, 79% received antivirals and 77% hydroxychloroquine. Forty two percent died and 79% developed ARDS. Overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was 29%. History of ischemic cardiac disease, fever, older age (over age 70) and dyspnea at presentation were associated with the risk of developing ARDS whereas fever, cough and a C-reactive protein higher than 50 mg/l at disease presentation were associated with the risk of death. Thus, in our population of hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we documented a wide range of disease severity.

The use of advance care planning (ACP) for people with progressive MS (pwPMS) remains limited. The ConCure-SM project aims to assess the effectiveness of a structured ACP intervention for pwPMS. The intervention consists of a training programme on ACP for healthcare professionals caring for pwPMS, and a booklet to be used during the ACP conversation. Herein, we describe the first two project phases. METHODS: In phase 1 we translated and adapted, to the Italian legislation and MS context, the ACP booklet of the National ACP Programme for New Zealand. Acceptability, comprehensibility and usefulness of the booklet were assessed via 13 personal cognitive interviews with pwPMS and significant others (SOs), and one health professional focus group. Based on these findings, we will revise the booklet. In phase 2 we will conduct a single-arm pilot/feasibility trial with nested qualitative study. Participants will be 40 pwPMS, their SOs, health professionals from six MS and rehabilitation centres in Italy. In the 6 months following the ACP conversation, we will assess completion of an advance care plan document (primary outcome), as well as safety of the intervention. Secondary outcomes will be a range of measures to capture the full process of ACP; patient-carer congruence in treatment preferences; quality of patient-clinician communication and caregiver burden. A qualitative process evaluation will help understand the factors likely to influence future implementation and scalability of the intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project is coleaded by a neurologist and a bioethicist. Phase 1 has received ethical approvals from each participating centre, while phase 2 will be submitted to the centres in May 2021. Findings from both phases will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and workshops.

This was not observed for any of the other tested carbohydrate epitopes, including anti-αGal antibodies used as a negative control since the epitope cannot be synthesized by humans. Owing to structural homologies with blood groups A and B antigens, we also observed that anti-Tn and anti-αGal antibodies levels were lower in blood group A and B, respectively. Analyses of correlations between anti-Tn and the other anti-carbohydrates tested revealed divergent patterns of correlations between patients and controls, suggesting qualitative differences in addition to the quantitative difference. Furthermore, anti-Tn levels correlated with anti-S protein levels in the patients’ group, suggesting that anti-Tn might contribute to the development of the specific antiviral response. Overall, this first analysis allows to hypothesize that natural anti-Tn antibodies might be protective against COVID-19.","Breiman, Adrien; Ruvoën-Clouet, Nathalie; Deleers, Marie; Beauvais, Tiffany; Jouand, Nicolas; Rocher, Jézabel; Bovin, Nicolai; Labarrière, Nathalie; El Kenz, Hanane; Le Pendu, Jacques",Front Microbiol,335,10

METHODS: A cross-sectional online questionnaire design was used Data were collected from March 14, 2020, to March 16, 2020, in Wuhan, China. Descriptive statistics and χ square analyses testing were used. RESULTS: Standard nosocomial infection training could significantly decrease the occurrence of infection (3.6% vs 13.0%, χ(2) = 4.47, P < 0.05). Discomfort can be classified into 7 categories. Female sex (66.0% vs 50.5%, χ(2) = 6.37), occupation (62.7% vs 30.8%, χ(2) = 5.33), working at designated hospitals (44.8% vs 26.7%, χ(2) = 5.17) or in intensive care units (70.4% vs 57.9%, χ(2) = 3.88), and working in personal protective equipment for > 4 hours (62.2% vs 39.2%, χ(2) = 9.17) led to more complaints about physical discomfort or increased occurrence of pressure sores (all P < 0.05). Psychologically, health care workers at designated hospitals (60.0% vs 42.1%, χ(2) = 4.97) or intensive care units (55.9% vs 41.5%, χ(2) = 4.40) (all P < 0.05) expressed more pride. DISCUSSION: Active training on infection and protective equipment could reduce the infection risk. Working for long hours increased the occurrence of discomfort and skin erosion. Reducing the working hours and having adequate protective products and proper psychological interventions may be beneficial to relieve discomfort.","Xia, Wei; Fu, Lin; Liao, Haihan; Yang, Chan; Guo, Haipeng; Bian, Zhouyan",J Emerg Nurs,335,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between mask wearing practice and the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic among teachers in Henan province, China. METHODS: : We enrolled 88611 teachers in an online cross-sectional survey across three cities of Henan Province in China. A total of 94.75% of study participants completed an online questionnaire between February 4, 2020 and February 12, 2020. Mask wearing practice was defined according to its type, how it is worn, and the behavior exhibited in relation to wearing a mask. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7) to assess anxiety levels among study participants. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the association between mask wearing practice and anxiety by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: : A total of 67357 registered teachers (25.91% men) were included in this study. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants who knew the wrong type of mask had 17% increased odds of having anxiety compared to those who knew the proper type (aOR=1.17; 95%CI: 1.11-1.24). Odds for anxiety were higher for teachers who did not know the proper way of wearing mask compared to those who knew it properly (aOR=1.18; 95%CI: 1.07-1.30). Not adhering to proper behavior of mask wearing was associated with 39% increased odds for anxiety (aOR=1.39; 95%CI: 1.18-1.64). The odds for anxiety for teachers who did not adhere to all the three parameters of proper mask wearing was about 2.55 times as much compared to those who reported full compliance to the parameters (aOR=2.55; 95%CI: 1.22-5.35). We observed similar ORs on stratified analyses across gender and age groups. CONCLUSION: : Our findings suggest that improper mask wearing is another important attribute that play a significant role in increasing the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic situation. However, these results should be considered as exploratory and hence interpreted with caution.","Li, Quanman; Tarimo, Clifford Silver; Miao, Yudong; Zeng, Xin; Wu, Cuiping; Wu, Jian",J Affect Disord,335,10

Astrocytes are the major target for MHV persistence. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive MHV infection and permit viral persistence are not known. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte DBT cells by MHV infection and found that the mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased following MHV infection. This finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and BNip3-promoter-luciferase reporter system. Interestingly, infection with live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses equally repressed BNip3 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry. Furthermore, treatment of cells with chloroquine, which blocks the acidification of endosomes, significantly inhibited the repression of the BNip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588-base-pair BNip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the BNip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for MHV-induced down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells. These results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes.","Cai, Yingyun; Liu, Yin; Yu, Dongdong; Zhang, Xuming",Virology,335,24

There are some oncological indications that have special priority and studies are still being carried out despite the current situation. In these studies we have found suspicious findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients. The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV2 infection. RESULTS: During the specified period, a total of 129 PET-CT studies were performed. Of these, 11 (8.5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process. These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62.2). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID 19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET-CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET-CT studies.","Rasilla, Jorge Mucientes; Pernett, Rafael Jimeno; Arboniés, Jorge Cardona",Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol,335,24

Management of this disease has been hampered by difficulties identifying the infection and determining the immunological status of affected cats and by high variability in the clinical, pathological, and immunological characteristics of affected cats. Neurological FIP, which is much more homogeneous than systemic effusive or noneffusive FIP, appears to be a good model for establishing the basic features of FIP immunopathogenesis. Very little information is available about the immunopathogenesis of neurologic FIP, and it is reasonable to use research from the well‐characterized mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) immune‐mediated encephalitis system, as a template for FIP investigation, and to contrast findings from the MHV model with those of FIP. It is expected that the immunopathogenic mechanisms will have important similarities. Such comparative research may lead to better understanding of FIP immunopathogenesis and rational prospects for management of this frustrating disease.","Foley, Janet E.; Leutenegger, Christian",J Vet Intern Med,335,20

Within the first 24 h of life, 36 calves were experimentally challenged with C. parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure (1 × 10(3), 1 × 10(4), 1 × 10(5), and 1 × 10(6) oocysts), and 7 control calves were sham dosed. Fecal shedding occurred in 33 (91.7 %) experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves. There was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups; calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure (1 × 10(3) oocysts) shed less than the other three groups. At higher magnitudes of exposure, there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding. There was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf, i.e., the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding, the fewer oocysts that were shed. The pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear; the number of oocysts increased with time, reached a peak, and declined. Therefore, the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding.","Zambriski, Jennifer A.; Nydam, Daryl V.; Bowman, Dwight D.; Bellosa, Mary L.; Burton, Alexandra J.; Linden, Thomas C.; Liotta, Janice L.; Ollivett, Theresa L.; Tondello-Martins, Leonardo; Mohammed, Hussni O.",Parasitol Res,335,13

This is compounded by the significant heterogeneity observed in patients with ARDS. With an aging population worldwide, a better understanding of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of therapies to improve outcomes in this population. In this review, the current clinical evidence of age as a risk factor and prognostic indicator in ARDS and the potential underlying mechanisms that may contribute to these factors are outlined.

Facemask use has been qualitatively associated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but no study has quantitatively assessed the impact of government mask mandates (MM) on new COVID-19 cases across multiple US States. Data and Methods: We utilized a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm to test the a priori hypothesis that MM were associated with reductions in new COVID-19 cases. Publicly available data were used to analyze new COVID-19 cases from 37 States and the District of Columbia (i.e., ""38 States""). We conducted confirmatory All-States and State-Wise analyses, validity analyses [e.g., leave-one-out (LOO) and bootstrap resampling], and covariate analyses. Results: No statistically significant difference in the daily number of new COVID-19 infections was discernible in the All-States analysis. In State-Wise LOO validity analysis, 11 States exhibited reductions in new COVID-19 and the reductions in four of these States (AK, MA, MN, VA) were significant in bootstrap resampling. Only the Social Capital Index predicted MM success (training p<0.028 and LOO p<0.013). Conclusion: Results obtained when studying the impact of MM on COVID-19 cases varies as a function of the heterogeneity of the sample being considered, providing clear evidence of Simpson's Paradox and thus of confounded findings. As such, studies of MM effectiveness should be conducted on disaggregated data. Since transmissions occur at the individual rather than at the collective level, additional work is needed to identify optimal social, psychological, environmental, and educational factors which will reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate MM effectiveness across diverse settings.","Maloney, M.

Grounded in the SCRes theory, this study provides insights into the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the automobile and airline supply chain. Both the short and long-term response strategies adopted by the two supply chains are assessed, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques in three distinct phases. In phase one, we use a sequential mixed-method for resilience evaluation, integrating Time-to-Recovery (TTR) and Financial Impact (FI) analysis. In phase two, we conduct an empirical survey involving 145 firms to evaluate the short-term SCRes response strategies. In the third phase, we conduct semi-structured interviews with supply chain executives both from the automobile and airline industries to understand the long-term SCRes response strategies. Our findings indicate that: (i) the automobile industry perceived that the best strategies to mitigate risks related to COVID-19, were to develop localized supply sources and use advanced industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. (ii) The airline industry on the other hand, perceived that the immediate need was to get ready for business continuity challenges posed by COVID-19, by defining their operations both at the airports and within the flights. (iii) Importantly, both the sectors perceived Big Data Analytics (BDA) to play a significant role by providing real-time information on various supply chain activities to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19.

Only three variables, at day one, distinguished patients with negative outcome: PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (OR 0.99 [0.98–0.99], p = 0.02), esophageal pressure swing (OR 1.13 [1.01–1.27], p = 0.032) and total stress (OR 1.17 [1.06–1.31], p = 0.004). When these three variables were evaluated together in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the total stress was independently associated with negative outcome (OR 1.16 [1.01–1.33], p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: In early COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxemia is not linked to computed tomography (CT) pathoanatomy, differently from typical ARDS. High lung stress was independently associated with the failure of non-invasive respiratory support.

The Programa Mais Médicos (PMM) (More Doctors Programme) provided 17,000 doctors, predominantly from Cuba, to work in Brazilian primary care. This study assesses whether PMM doctor allocation to municipalities was consistent with programme criteria and associated impacts on amenable mortality. METHODS: Difference-in-differences regression analysis, exploiting variation in PMM introduction across 5565 municipalities over the period 2008–2017, was employed to examine programme impacts on doctor density and mortality amenable to healthcare. Heterogeneity in effects was explored with respect to doctor allocation criteria and municipal doctor density prior to PMM introduction. RESULTS: After starting in 2013, PMM was associated with an increase in PMM-contracted primary care doctors of 15.1 per 100,000 population. However, largescale substitution of existing primary care doctors resulting in a net increase of only 5.7 per 100,000. Increases in both PMM and total primary care doctors were lower in priority municipalities due to lower allocation of PMM doctors and greater substitution effects. The PMM led to amenable mortality reductions of − 1.06 per 100,000 (95%CI: − 1.78 to − 0.34) annually – with greater benefits in municipalities prioritised for doctor allocation and where doctor density was low before programme implementation. CONCLUSIONS: PMM potential health benefits were undermined due to widespread allocation of doctors to non-priority areas and local substitution effects. Policies seeking to strengthen HRH should develop and implement needs-based criteria for resource allocation.","Hone, Thomas; Powell-Jackson, Timothy; Santos, Leonor Maria Pacheco; de Sousa Soares, Ricardo; de Oliveira, Felipe Proenço; Sanchez, Mauro Niskier; Harris, Matthew; de Oliveira de Souza Santos, Felipe; Millett, Christopher",BMC Health Serv Res,335,24

Although the viruses share a completely homologous repertoire of proteins and use the same cellular entry receptor, their transmission efficiencies and pathogenetic traits differ. We aimed to compare interferon antagonism by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: For this functional study, we infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells with strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We studied differences in cell line-specific replication (Vero E6 vs Calu-3 cells) and analysed these differences in relation to TMPRSS2-dependent cell entry based on inhibition with the drug camostat mesilate. We evaluated viral sensitivity towards type I interferon treatment and assessed cytokine induction and type I interferon signalling in the host cells by RT-PCR and analysis of transcription factor activation and nuclear translocation. Based on reverse genetic engineering of SARS-CoV, we investigated the contribution of open reading frame 6 (ORF6) to the observed phenotypic differences in interferon signalling, because ORF6 encodes an interferon signalling antagonist. We did a luciferase-based interferon-stimulated response element promotor activation assay to evaluate the antagonistic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type ORF6 constructs and three mutants (Gln51Glu, Gln56Glu, or both) that represent amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 protein 6 in the carboxy-terminal domain. FINDINGS: Overall, replication was higher for SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells and for SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells. SARS-CoV-2 was reliant on TMPRSS2, found only in Calu-3 cells, for more efficient entry. SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to interferon treatment, less efficient in suppressing cytokine induction via IRF3 nuclear translocation, and permissive of a higher level of induction of interferon-stimulated genes MX1 and ISG56. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 expressed in the context of a fully replicating SARS-CoV backbone suppressed MX1 gene induction, but this suppression was less efficient than that by SARS-CoV ORF6. Mutagenesis showed that charged amino acids in residues 51 and 56 shift the phenotype towards more efficient interferon antagonism, as seen in SARS-CoV. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interferes less efficiently with human interferon induction and interferon signalling than SARS-CoV ORF6. Because of the homology of the genes, onward selection for fitness could involve functional optimisation of interferon antagonism. Charged amino acids at positions 51 and 56 in ORF6 should be monitored for potential adaptive changes.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: From 12 to 21 May 2020, an online survey was sent to all undergraduate health students and interns in the KSA. This included questions on demographics, volunteering status, risk perception of COVID-19, as well as motivations and barriers towards volunteering. RESULTS: In a convenience sample of 6016 students and interns across KSA, 1824 (30.31%) have volunteered with the MOH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Volunteering was more likely among older participants, from the College of Medicine, those with self-perceived at risk of COVID-19 infection and those with self-perceived healthy participants. Females, those who did not think that students had moral duties to volunteer, those who were at risk of seasonal influenza and those with self-perceived at risk of hospitalisation from COVID-19 were less likely to volunteer. Patriotism, gaining experience, assisting when able and religious rewards all were reported as major motivators to volunteer. Non-volunteering participants reported that lack of interest, protocol and knowledge, as well as issues related to their personal health and transportation were the main barriers to volunteering. CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of undergraduate health students and interns volunteered during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in KSA. Moral values were the most important motivations among volunteers. Efforts to encourage heath students and interns to volunteer and providing those with appropriate educational programmes are recommended.","AlOmar, Reem S; AlShamlan, Nouf A; AlAmer, Naheel A; Aldulijan, Fajar; AlMuhaidib, Seereen; Almukhadhib, Omar; Algarni, Saad A; Alshaibani, Askar; Darwish, Magdy; Al Shammari, Malak",BMJ Open,335,6

Due to asymptomatic or mild courses of COVID-19, many infections remain undetected. Reported case fatality rates - COVID-19-associated deaths divided by number of detected infections - are therefore poor estimates of the IFR. Endogenous changes of the population at risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, changing test practices and an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 further exacerbate the estimation of the IFR. Here, we propose a strategy to estimate the IFR of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany that combines official data on reported cases and fatalities supplied by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) with data from seroepidemiological studies in two infection hotspots, the Austrian town Ischgl and the German municipality Gangelt, respectively. For this purpose, we use the law of total probability to derive an approximate formula for the IFR that is based on a set of assumptions regarding data quality and test specificity and sensitivity. The resulting estimate of the IFR in Germany of 0.83% (95% CI: [0.69%; 0.98%]) that is based on a combination of the RKI and Ischgl data is notably higher than the IFR estimate reported in the Gangelt study (0.36% [0.29%; 0.45%]). It is closer to the consolidated estimate based on a meta-analysis (0.68% [0.53%; 0.82%]), where the difference can be explained by Germany's disadvantageous age structure. Virus mutations, vaccination strategies, and improved therapy will necessitate a re-estimation of the IFR. The proposed method is able to account for such developments.","Dimpfl, T.; SoÌnksen, J.; Bechmann, I.; Grammig, J.",,335,1

However, there are concerns with treatment recommendations given the extent of conflicting results with suggested treatments and misinformation, some of which has resulted in increased prices and shortages alongside increasing use and prices of personal protective equipment (PPE). This is a concern in countries such as India where there have been high patient co-payments and an appreciable number of families going into poverty when members become ill. However, balanced against pricing controls. Community pharmacists play a significant role in disease management in India, and this will remain. Consequently, there is a need to review prices and availability of pertinent medicines during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in India to provide future direction. Objective: Assess current utilisation and price changes as well as shortages of pertinent medicines and equipment during the early stages of the pandemic. Our Approach: Multiple approach involving a review of treatments and ongoing activities across India to reduce the spread of the virus alongside questioning pharmacies in selected cities from early March to end May 2020. Our Activities: 111 pharmacies took part, giving a response rate of 80%. Encouragingly, no change in utilisation of antimalarial medicines in 45% of pharmacies despite endorsements and for antibiotics in 57.7% of pharmacies, helped by increasing need for a prescription for dispensing. In addition, increased purchasing of PPE (over 98%). No price increases were seen for antimalarials and antibiotics in 83.8 and 91.9% of pharmacies respectively although shortages were seen for antimalarials in 70.3% of pharmacies, lower for antibiotics (9.9% of pharmacies). However, price increases were typically seen for PPE (over 90% of stores) as well as for analgesics (over 50% of pharmacies). Shortages were also seen for PPE (88.3%). Conclusion: The pandemic has impacted on utilisation and prices of pertinent medicines and PPE in India but moderated by increased scrutiny. Key stakeholder groups can play a role with enhancing evidenced-based approaches and reducing inappropriate purchasing in the future.","Haque, Mainul; Kumar, Santosh; Charan, Jaykaran; Bhatt, Rohan; Islam, Salequl; Dutta, Siddhartha; Abhayanand, Jha Pallavi; Sharma, Yesh; Sefah, Israel; Kurdi, Amanj; Wale, Janney; Godman, Brian",Front Pharmacol,335,1

Then, cl‐2 invades the ventricle and ventricular wall along the newly assembled ERfibs after infection, using them as a pathway from the meninges, the initial site of infection. In the lymph nodes and spleen, ERag is mainly produced by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), which play a key role in nursing the ERfibs to form a fibroblastic reticular network (FRN). The FRN functions as a conduit system to transfer antigens, cytokines or leukocytes in the lymphoid organs. In the brain parenchyma, astrocytes were found to produce the main components of mature ERfibs, such as collagen, laminin and ERag, which have been identified in the lymphoid organs. The producibility of these extracellular matrices (ECMs) by astrocytes was further confirmed by primary brain cultures, which disclosed the dissociation of laminin and ERag production, and the close association of ERag production with that of collagen, forming a fibrous structure. The pattern of ECM production in vitro indicated the process of forming mature ERfibs in the brain, that is, fibers made of collagen fibers and ERag are wrapped by laminin prepared as a sheet structure. In addition, the brain parenchymal cells that produce interferon β after infection in spite of their residence away from the sites of viral invasion were surrounded by ERfibs, which were closely associated with astrocytic fibers. These findings indicate that astrocytes play a central role in forming the astrocytic reticular network (ARN) in the brain parenchyma, as FRCs do to form FRN in the lymphoid organs.","Watanabe, Rihito; Kakizaki, Masatoshi",Neuropathology,335,24

However, the prevalence of hyponatremia in PWS has rarely been reported. Our aim was to describe the prevalence and severity of hyponatremia in PWS. In October 2020, we performed a retrospective study based on the medical records of a large cohort of children and adults with PWS from seven countries. Among 1326 patients (68% adults), 34 (2.6%) had at least one episode of mild or moderate hyponatremia (125 ≤ Na < 135 mmol/L). The causes of non-severe hyponatremia were often multi-factorial, including psychotropic medication in 32%, EFI in 24% and hyperglycemia in 12%. No obvious cause was found in 29%. Seven (0.5%) adults experienced severe hyponatremia (Na < 125 mmol/L). Among these, five recovered completely, but two died. The causes of severe hyponatremia were desmopressin treatment for nocturnal enuresis (n = 2), EFI (n = 2), adrenal insufficiency (n = 1), diuretic treatment (n = 1) and unknown (n = 1). In conclusion, severe hyponatremia was very rare but potentially fatal in PWS. Desmopressin treatment for nocturnal enuresis should be avoided.

In Almaty, a city-scale quarantine came into force on March 19, 2020, which was a week after the first COVID-19 case was registered in Kazakhstan. This study aims to analyze the effect of the lockdown from March 19 to April 14, 2020 (27 days), on the concentrations of air pollutants in Almaty. Daily concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and BTEX were compared between the periods before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, the PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 21% with spatial variations of 6–34% compared to the average on the same days in 2018–2019, and still, it exceeded WHO daily limit values for 18 days. There were also substantial reductions in CO and NO2 concentrations by 49% and 35%, respectively, but an increase in O3 levels by 15% compared to the prior 17 days before the lockdown. The concentrations of benzene and toluene were 2–3 times higher than those during in the same seasons of 2015–2019. The temporal reductions may not be directly attributed to the lockdown due to favorable meteorological variations during the period, but the spatial effects of the quarantine on the pollution levels are evidenced. The results demonstrate the impact of traffic on the complex nature of air pollution in Almaty, which is substantially contributed by various nontraffic related sources, mainly coal-fired combined heat and power plants and household heating systems, as well as possible small irregular sources such as garbage burning and bathhouses.","Kerimray, Aiymgul; Baimatova, Nassiba; Ibragimova, Olga P.; Bukenov, Bauyrzhan; Kenessov, Bulat; Plotitsyn, Pavel; Karaca, Ferhat",Sci Total Environ,335,20

This mechanism is primarily composed of three transmembrane proteins serving as stress sensors: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). These three proteins’ synergic action elicits translation and transcriptional downstream pathways, leading to less protein production and activating genes that encode important proteins in folding processes, including chaperones. Previous reports showed that viruses have evolved mechanisms to curtail or customize this UPR signaling for their own benefit. However, HIV infection’s effect on the UPR has scarcely been investigated. METHODS: This work investigated UPR modulation by HIV infection by assessing UPR-related protein expression under in vitro and in vivo conditions via Western blotting. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs’ influence on this stress response was also considered. RESULTS: In in vitro and in vivo analyses, our results confirm that HIV infection activates stress-response components and that ARV therapy contributes to changes in the UPR’s activation profile. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing UPR-related protein expression in HIV target cells derived directly from HIV-infected patients receiving different ARV therapies. Thus, two mechanisms may occur simultaneously: interference by HIV itself and the ARV drugs’ pharmacological effects as UPR activators. New evidence of how HIV modulates the UPR to enhance its own replication and secure infection success is also presented.

In the first six months of the global outbreak, the US reported more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. Effective modeling of the course of the pandemic can help assist with public health resource planning, intervention efforts, and vaccine clinical trials. However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR model. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model and show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top 2 models out of 10 submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.","GIBSON, GRAHAM C.; REICH, NICHOLAS G.; SHELDON, DANIEL",medRxiv,335,5

However, previous studies do not analyze the long-term precipitation changes before and after the impoundment, and the variation characteristics of local precipitation remain elusive. In this study, we use precipitation anomaly data derived from the CN05.1 precipitation dataset between 1988 and 2017 to trace the changes of precipitation before and after the construction of the TGD (i.e., 1988-2002 and 2003-2017), in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA). Results showed that the annual and dry season precipitation anomaly in the TGRA presented an increasing trend, and the precipitation anomaly showed a slight decrease during the flood season. After the impoundment of TGD, the precipitation concentration degree in the TGRA decreased, indicating that the precipitation became increasingly uniform, and the precipitation concentration period insignificantly increased. A resonance phenomenon between the monthly average water level and precipitation anomaly occurred in the TGRA after 2011 and showed a positive correlation. Our findings revealed the change of local precipitation characteristics before and after the impoundment of TGD and showed strong evidence that this change had a close relationship with the water level.","Li, Qin; Liu, Xiuguo; Zhong, Yulong; Wang, Mengmeng; Shi, Manxing",Sensors (Basel),335,1

Reallocation of resources for managing the outbreak might have caused a disruption in stroke care. This study analyses the impact on stroke care of reorganising the healthcare system in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak peak in Spain and the strategies adopted by Spanish stroke units to deal with this impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from a structured survey sent to the responsible of stroke units across the country. We recorded the number of strokes, stroke code activations, intravenous thrombolysis treatments and mechanical thrombectomies during February and March 2019 and 2020. We also collected information on the impact on workflow metrics and on the availability of specialised neurological care and rehabilitation treatments, the characteristics of stroke care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on human resources. We compared the activity data between 2019 and 2020 and the information on activity and impact on stroke care between regions classified according to the disease incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (75%) of all stroke units in Spain responded to the survey. There was an overall reduction in admissions for all stroke types during the outbreak’s peak and in the number of stroke code activations and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, results that were independent of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Participants reported a delay in workflow metrics and a reduction of admissions to stroke units, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapies. Specific pathways and protocols for managing stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has jeopardised all phases of stroke care. As a consequence, some patients with stroke did not receive adequate treatment.","Alonso de Leciñana, María; Castellanos, Mar; Ayo-Martín, Óscar; Morales, Ana",Stroke Vasc Neurol,335,1

The aim of this study was to describe national, 60-day all-cause mortality associated with COVID-19, and to identify risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, we explored risk factors for admission to ICU. RESULTS: Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28–43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8–68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022–1.061 per year increase; P < 0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964–9.744; P < 0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050–2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596–8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027–1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively younger national cohort with a low co-morbidity burden, COVID-19 was associated with low all-cause mortality. Independent risk factors for ICU admission included older age, male sex, higher BMI, and co-existing diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

Both the innate sensor RIG-I and the interferon-induced IFIT proteins bind to 5′-triphosphate viral RNAs. RIG-I signals for induction of interferons during RNA virus infection while IFITs sequester viral RNAs to exert an anti-viral effect. Notably, the structures of these proteins reveal both similarities and differences, which are suggestive of independent evolution towards ligand binding. 5′-triphosphates, which are absent from most RNAs in the cytosol of uninfected cells, are thus a marker of virus infection that is targeted by the innate immune system for both induction and execution of the anti-viral response.","Rehwinkel, Jan; Reis e Sousa, Caetano",Curr Opin Microbiol,335,22

For atrial fibrillation/flutter, select according to the Cardiovascular National Treatment Guide (NBV): Calcium antagonist, Beta blocker, direct current (DC) conversion or amiodarone. In case of urgent need for digoxin treatment (contraindication for the aforementioned equal alternatives), the test drug should be paused, and ECG should be taken daily. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Control group: The control group will receive the standard treatment + placebo for both types of intervention medication at all times. If part or all the intervention therapy being investigated becomes standard treatment during the study, this may also be offered to the control group. Intervention group: The patients in the intervention group will also receive standard care. Immediately after randomisation to the intervention group, the patient will begin treatment with: Azithromycin: Day 1-3: 500 mg x 1 Day 4-15: 250 mg x 1 If the patient is unable to take the medication orally by themselves, the medication will, if possible, be administered by either stomach-feeding tube, or alternatively, temporary be changed to clarithromycin 500 mg x 2 (this only in agreement with either study coordinator Pradeesh Sivapalan or principal investigator Jens-Ulrik Stæhr Jensen). This will also be done in the control group if necessary. The patient will switch back to azithromycin when possible. Hydroxychloroquine: Furthermore, the patient will be treated with hydroxychloroquine as follows: Day 1-15: 200 mg x 2 MAIN OUTCOMES: • Number of days alive and discharged from hospital within 14 days (summarises both whether the patient is alive and discharged from hospital) (""Days alive and out of hospital"") RANDOMISATION: The sponsor (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Trial Network, COP:TRIN) generates a randomisation sequence.

Therefore, its application in medicine and disease treatment has not been actively developed. This perspective begins by reviewing the principles, advantages, and limitations of the three existing drug delivery strategies: non-covalent interaction, cavity loading, and covalent conjugation. Then, we discussed the principle of capillary action in drug delivery and the influencing factors that determine its performance. To illustrate the advantages of capillary action over existing drug delivery strategies and how the capillary action could potentially address the shortcomings of the existing drug delivery strategies, we described five examples of using capillary action to design drug delivery platforms for disease treatment: marker pen for topical and transdermal drug delivery, microneedle patch with a sponge container for pulsatile drug delivery, core-shell scaffold for sustained release of growth factors, oral bolus for insulin delivery to the esophagus, and semi-hollow floating ball for intravesical and gastroprotective drug delivery. Each of the five drug delivery platforms exhibits certain unique functions that existing drug delivery technologies cannot easily achieve, hence expected to solve specific practical medical problems that are not satisfactorily resolved. As people pay more attention to capillary action and develop more drug delivery platforms, more unique functions and characteristics of capillary action in drug delivery will be explored. Thus, capillary action could become an important choice for drug delivery systems to improve therapeutic drug efficacy, treat diseases, and improve human health.","Li, Xiaosi; Zhao, Yue; Zhao, Chao",iScience,335,17

Given a sequence of observations, the diagnosis task generates a set of diagnoses, or candidates, each candidate complying with the observations. What all the approaches in the literature have in common is that a candidate is invariably a set of faulty elements (components, events, or otherwise). In this paper, we consider a posteriori diagnosis of discrete-event systems (DESs), which are described by networks of components that are modeled as communicating automata. The diagnosis problem consists in generating the candidates involved in the trajectories of the DES that conform with a given temporal observation. Oddly, in the literature on diagnosis of DESs, a candidate is still a set of faulty events, despite the temporal dimension of trajectories. In our view, when dealing with critical domains, such as power networks or nuclear plants, set-oriented diagnosis may be less than optimal in explaining the supposedly abnormal behavior of the DES, owing to the lack of any temporal information relevant to faults, along with the inability to discriminate between single and multiple occurrences of the same fault. Embedding temporal information in candidates may be essential for critical-decision making. This is why a temporal-oriented approach is proposed for diagnosis of DESs, where candidates are sequences of faults. This novel perspective comes with the burden of unbounded candidates and infinite collections of candidates, though. To cope with, a notation based on regular expressions on faults is adopted. The diagnosis task is supported by a temporal diagnoser, a flexible data structure that can grow over time based on new observations and domain-dependent scenarios.","Bertoglio, Nicola; Lamperti, Gianfranco; Zanella, Marina; Zhao, Xiangfu",Procedia Computer Science,335,1

We investigate private psychiatrists’ uptake of (1) video- and telephone-telehealth consultations for Quarter-2 (April–June) of 2020 and (2) total telehealth and face-to-face consultations in Quarter-2, 2020 in comparison to Quarter-2, 2019 for Australia. METHODS: MBS item service data were extracted for COVID-19-psychiatrist-video- and telephone-telehealth item numbers and compared with a baseline of the Quarter-2, 2019 (April–June 2019) of face-to-face consultations for the whole of Australia. RESULTS: Combined telehealth and face-to-face psychiatry consultations rose during the first wave of the pandemic in Quarter-2, 2020 by 14% compared to Quarter-2, 2019 and telehealth was approximately half of this total. Face-to-face consultations in 2020 comprised only 56% of the comparative Quarter-2, 2019 consultations. Most telehealth provision was by telephone for short consultations of ⩽15–30 min. Video consultations comprised 38% of the total telehealth provision (for new patient assessments and longer consultations). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a flexible, rapid response to patient demand by private psychiatrists using the new COVID-19-MBS-telehealth items for Quarter-2, 2020, and in the context of decreased face-to-face consultations, ongoing telehealth is essential.","Looi, Jeffrey CL; Allison, Stephen; Bastiampillai, Tarun; Pring, William; Reay, Rebecca",Australas Psychiatry,335,1

Identification of additional components of the RAS and associated vasoactive pathways, as well as new structural and functional insights into established targets, have led to novel therapeutic approaches with the potential to provide improved cardiovascular protection and better blood pressure control and/or reduced adverse side effects. The simultaneous modulation of several neurohumoral mediators in key interconnected blood pressure–regulating pathways has been an attractive approach to improve treatment efficacy, and several novel approaches involve combination therapy or dual-acting agents. In addition, increased understanding of the complexity of the RAS has led to novel approaches aimed at upregulating the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas axis to counter-regulate the harmful effects of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin III/AT(1)R axis. These advances have opened new avenues for the development of novel drugs targeting the RAS to better treat hypertension and heart failure. Here we focus on new therapies in preclinical and early clinical stages of development, including novel small molecule inhibitors and receptor agonists/antagonists, less conventional strategies such as gene therapy to suppress angiotensinogen at the RNA level, recombinant ACE2 protein, and novel bispecific designer peptides.","Arendse, Lauren B.; Danser, A.

Patient characteristics and outcomes were collected by reviewing their electronic medical records. Fourteen patients had a systemic arterial thrombotic event, which represents a 1% incidence in relation to the total number of hospitalized patients. Three patients suffered an acute coronary syndrome, two with persistent ST-segment elevation, one of whom was treated invasively, and one with transient ST-segment elevation. Eight patients had a cerebrovascular event. Six suffered an acute ischemic stroke and two a transient ischemic attack, 50% of them had a Rankin score ≥ 3 at discharge.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perspective of Hispanic persons with Parkinson disease (PWP) regarding awareness, interest, and barriers to participation in research. METHODS: We developed and administered a survey and qualitative interview in English and Spanish. For the survey, 62 Hispanic and 38 non-Hispanic PWP linked to a tertiary center were recruited in Arizona. For interviews, 20 Hispanic PWP, 20 caregivers, and six physicians providing service to Hispanic PWP in the community were recruited in California. Survey responses of Hispanic and non-Hispanic PWP were compared. Major survey themes were identified by applying grounded theory and open coding. RESULTS: The survey found roughly half (Q1 54%, Q2 55%) of Hispanic PWP linked to a tertiary center knew about research; there was unawareness among community Hispanic PWP. Most preferred having physician recommendations for research participation and were willing to participate. Hispanics preferred teams who speak their native language and include family. Research engagement, PD knowledge, role of family, living with PD, PD care, pre-diagnosis/diagnosis emerged as themes from the interview. CONCLUSION: Barriers exist for participation of Hispanic PWP in research, primarily lack of awareness of PD research opportunities. Educating physicians of the need to encourage research participation of Hispanic PWP can address this. Physicians need to be aware of ongoing research and should not assume PWP disinterest. Including family members and providing research opportunities in their native language can increase research recruitment.","Damron, Lisa; Litvan, Irene; Bayram, Ece; Berk, Sarah; Siddiqi, Bernadette; Shill, Holly",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,335,16

Methods: From January 25 to March 31, 2020, 581 callers with COVID-19 related psychological problems (COVID-19 callers) and 695 callers without COVID-19 related psychological problems (non-COVID-19 callers) to the Beijing Psychological Support Hotline were recruited. The demographic characteristics, primary concerns, suicidal ideation, depression and other psychological problems were compared between the two groups of callers. Results: Both groups of the callers were predominantly female and highly educated. The primary concerns reported by the COVID-19 callers were depression (38.4%) and family relationship problems (26.0%). As compared to the non-COVID-19 callers, COVID-19 callers reported more financial (7.4%) and work related problems (4.1%), but revealed lower prevalence of suicidal ideation (47.9% v 71.3%), lower degrees of psychological distress (74.3 v 79.1), intensity of suicidal ideation (0 v 50), severity of depression (57.9 v 65.1), and higher degree of hopefulness (41.1 v 33.6) (all p values < 0.01). Additionally, a lower proportion of COVID-19 callers met the criteria of depressed mood (51.6% v 61.4%) and other 4 symptoms than the non-COVID-19 callers (p values < 0.01). Conclusions: Based on the content of the primary concerns and the relatively low level of depression of the COVID-19 callers, the psychological intervention for them during the pandemic should focus on “psychological supports.” Coping strategies for daily life stressors and promotion of scientific knowledge about the pandemic should also be included in the hotline-related interventions.","Zhao, Liting; Li, Ziyang; Tong, Yongsheng; Wu, Mengjie; Wang, Cuiling; Wang, Yuehua; Liu, Nancy H.",Front Psychiatry,335,16

There is limited data describing pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) preparedness and their health worker protections. AIM: To describe the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) preparedness efforts among a set of PICUs within a simulation-based network nationwide. METHODS: A cross-sectional multi-center national survey of PICU medical director(s) from children’s hospitals across the United States. The questionnaire was developed and reviewed by physicians with expertise in pediatric critical care, disaster readiness, human factors, and survey development. Thirty-five children’s hospitals were identified for recruitment through a long-established national research network. The questions focused on six themes: (1) PICU and medical director demographics; (2) Pediatric patient flow during the pandemic; (3) Changes to the staffing models related to the pandemic; (4) Use of personal protective equipment (PPE); (5) Changes in clinical practice and innovations; and (6) Current modalities of training including simulation. RESULTS: We report on survey responses from 22 of 35 PICUs (63%). The majority of PICUs were located within children’s hospitals (87%). All PICUs cared for pediatric patients with COVID-19 at the time of the survey. The majority of PICUs (83.4%) witnessed decreases in non-COVID-19 patients, 43% had COVID-19 dedicated units, and 74.6% pivoted to accept adult COVID-19 patients. All PICUs implemented changes to their staffing models with the most common changes being changes in COVID-19 patient room assignment in 50% of surveyed PICUs and introducing remote patient monitoring in 36% of the PICU units. Ninety-five percent of PICUs conducted training for donning and doffing of enhanced PPE. Even 6 months into the pandemic, one-third of PICUs across the United States reported shortages in PPE. The most common training formats for PPE were hands-on training (73%) and video-based content (82%). The most common concerns related to COVID-19 practice were changes in clinical protocols and guidelines (50%). The majority of PICUs implemented significant changes in their airway management (82%) and cardiac arrest management protocols in COVID-19 patients (68%). Simulation-based training was the most commonly utilized training modality (82%), whereas team training (73%) and team dynamics (77%) were the most common training objectives. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of surveyed PICUs reported on large changes in their preparedness and training efforts before and during the pandemic.

The paths of discovery and innovation often result from the interdisciplinarity of scientific areas that are a priori disconnected from each other. In the 1970s, fundamental discoveries in cell biology led to unexpected advances in galenic pharmacy with the emergence of nanotechnologies for the intracellular delivery of non diffusing molecules. As well, fluorescein-loaded polyacrylamide nanocapsules were shown to deliver this fluorescent agent precisely into cellular lysosomes which represented a seminal observation. However, due to the lack of biodegradability of this carrier polymer, this approach was still far from therapeutic application. The use of cyanoacrylates as surgical glue inspired us to use this material in the design of the first biodegradable nanoparticles for human use. Capable of transporting compounds with anti-tumor activity, these polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles demonstrated the unexpected property of overcoming multi-drug resistance. This discovery led to the development of a nanomedicine that has completed phase III clinical trials for the treatment of resistant hepatocarcinoma. Going beyond the state-of-the art, a step ahead in the nanomedicine field was the drug « squalenoylation ¼ technology, which represents a shift from the « physical ¼ to the « chemical ¼ encapsulation paradigm.

Symptoms of ITP include bleeding usually from nose or gums, easy bruising, petechiae commonly of lower extremities, menorrhagia, hematuria, hematemesis, hematochezia and most dreadful, intra cranial hemorrhage. Molecular mimicry between viral antigens and host platelet antigens forming cross-reactive anti-platelet autoantibodies may lead to increased platelet clearance in ITP associated with viral infections. One of the many viruses associated with this is the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It has caused a devastating pandemic. It can activate innate and adaptive immune responses. It has numerous signs and symptoms including but not limited to dyspnea, fever, cough, fatigue, myalgias, loss of taste and smell. It leads to diseases such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thrombosis and cardiomyopathy. Hematologic manifestations include thrombocytopenia and more commonly lymphopenia. Treatment includes steroids, immune globulin, romiplostim, eltrombopag, rituximab or splenectomy. Contact sports should be avoided due to risk of intra cranial bleeding with head impact. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin should be used with caution since they impair platelet function. We discuss a patient with COVID-19 who developed thrombocytopenia thought to be due to ITP. Not much is known about the association between the two. It is important to keep this differential in mind when taking care of patients with COVID-19 who develop thrombocytopenia.","Ashraf, S.; Alsharedi, M.",Stem Cell Investigation,335,6
643849,643849,643849,Menstrual changes after covid-19 vaccination,16.922955,5.62404,2021,"Background: Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, it has rapidly spread in more than 200 countries or territories with over 8 million confirmed cases and 440,000 deaths by June 17, 2020. Recently, three randomized clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments were completed, one for lopinavir-ritonavir and two for remdesivir. One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. However, several statistical issues in the original design and analysis of the three trials are identified, which might shed doubts on their findings and the conclusions should be evaluated with cautions. Objective: From statistical perspectives, we identify several issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. Methods: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al. failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) in this context to analyze the reconstructed data due to the existence of death as competing risk and a terminal event. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al. reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We reanalyzed the data to report other percentiles of the time to recovery and adopted the bootstrap method and permutation test to construct the confidence intervals as well as the P values. The restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) was also computed as a global and robust measure for efficacy. Results: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of terminal rates was -8.74% (95% CI [-21.04, 3.55]; P=.16) and the hazards ratio (HR) adjusted for terminal rates was 1.05 (95% CI [0.78, 1.42]; P=.74), indicating no significant difference. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was -1.67 days (95% CI [-3.62, 0.28]; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al., the difference of terminal rates was -0.89% (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.19) and the HR adjusted for terminal rates was 0.92 (95% CI [0.63, 1.35]; P=.67). The difference of RMTIs at day 28 was -0.89 day (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the HR estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained, and both conditional and unconditional prediction delivered significant HR results if the trial had continued to double the target sample size. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al., the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups up to day 30 was -2.7 days (95% CI [-4.0, -1.2]; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI [-3, 0]; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences manifested to be statistically significant at larger percentiles. Conclusions: Based on the statistical issues and lessons learned from the recent three clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments, we suggest more appropriate approaches for the design and analysis for ongoing and future COVID-19 trials.","Yin, G.; Zhang, C.; Jin, H.",,335,5

The effects of certain systemic viral and bacterial infections on morbidity and mortality are considered as examples of recent emerging infections. Here we will focus on three examples of infections that are important in pregnancy and early childhood: SARS-CoV-2 virus, Zika virus, and Mycoplasma species. The basic structural characteristics of these infectious agents will be examined, along with their general pathogenic mechanisms. Coronavirus infections, such as caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, likely evolved from zoonotic bat viruses to infect humans and cause a pandemic that has been the biggest challenge for humanity since the Spanish Flu pandemic of the early 20(th) century. In contrast, Zika Virus infections represent an expanding infectious threat in the context of global climate change. The relationship of these infections to pregnancy, the vertical transmission and neurological sequels make these viruses highly relevant to the topics of this special issue. Finally, mycoplasmal infections have been present before mankind evolved, but they were rarely identified as human pathogens until recently, and they are now recognized as important coinfections that are able to modify the course and prognosis of various infectious diseases and other chronic illnesses. The infectious processes caused by these intracellular microorganisms are examined as well as some general aspects of their pathogeneses, clinical presentations, and diagnoses. We will finally consider examples of treatments that have been used to reduce morbidity and mortality of these infections and discuss briefly the current status of vaccines, in particular, against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is important to understand some of the basic features of these emerging infectious diseases and the pathogens involved in order to better appreciate the contributions of this special issue on how infectious diseases can affect human pregnancy, fetuses and neonates.","Ferreira, Gonzalo; Santander, Axel; Savio, Florencia; Guirado, Mariana; Sobrevia, Luis; Nicolson, Garth L.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,335,16

Here we determined the cryo-EM structures of the spikes from bat (RaTG13) and pangolin (PCoV_GX) coronaviruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2. All three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of these two spike trimers are in the “down” conformation, indicating they are more prone to adopt this receptor-binding inactive state. However, we found that the PCoV_GX, but not the RaTG13, spike is comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 spike in binding the human ACE2 receptor and supporting pseudovirus cell entry. Through structure and sequence comparisons, we identified critical residues in the RBD that underlie the different activities of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX/SARS-CoV-2 spikes and propose that N-linked glycans serve as conformational control elements of the RBD. These results collectively indicate that strong RBD-ACE2 binding and efficient RBD conformational sampling are required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to gain highly efficient infection.","Zhang, Shuyuan; Qiao, Shuyuan; Yu, Jinfang; Zeng, Jianwei; Shan, Sisi; Lan, Jun; Tian, Long; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan",bioRxiv,335,23

In spite of the enormous clinical burden caused by RSV infections, there remains no efficacious RSV vaccine. CD8 T cells mediate viral clearance as well as provide protection against a secondary RSV infection. However, RSV-specific CD8 T cells may also induce immunopathology leading to exacerbated morbidity and mortality. Many of the crucial functions performed by CD8 T cells are mediated by the cytokines they produce. IFN-γ and TNF are produced by CD8 T cells following RSV infection and contribute to both the acceleration of viral clearance and the induction of immunopathology. To prevent immunopathology, regulatory mechanisms are in place within the immune system to inhibit CD8 T cell effector functions after the infection has been cleared. The actions of a variety of cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-4, play a critical role in the regulation of CD8 T cell effector activity. Herein, we review the current literature on CD8 T cell responses and the functions of the cytokines they produce following RSV infection.

The present study isolated and identified two novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) from convalescent COVID-19 patients. These two nAbs (XG81 and XG83) were then systemically compared with nine nAbs that were reconstructed by using published data, and revealed that, even though these two nAbs shared targeting epitopes on spike protein, they were different from any of the nine nAbs. Compared with XG81, XG83 exhibited a higher RBD binding affinity and neutralization potency against wild-typed pseudovirus, variant pseudoviruses with mutated spike proteins, such as D614G, E484Q, and A475V, as well as the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. To explore potential broadly neutralizing antibodies, heavy and light chains from all 18 nAbs (16 published nAbs, XG81 and XG83) were cross-recombined, and some of the functional antibodies were screened and studied for RBD binding affinity, and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results demonstrated that several recombined antibodies had a more potent neutralization activity against variant pseudoviruses compared with the originally paired Abs.

CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV, ubiquitously expressed in tissues and blood, removes NH(2)‐terminal dipeptides from proteins with a penultimate Pro or Ala. A large number of human chemokines, including CXCL2, CXCL6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, CCL3L1, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL14, and CCL22, are cleaved by CD26; however, the efficiency is clearly influenced by the amino acids surrounding the cleavage site and although not yet proven, potentially affected by the chemokine concentration and interactions with third molecules. NH(2)‐terminal cleavage of chemokines by CD26 has prominent effects on their receptor binding, signaling, and hence, in vitro and in vivo biologic activities. However, rather than having a similar result, the outcome of NH(2)‐terminal truncation is highly diverse. Either no difference in activity or drastic alterations in receptor recognition/specificity and hence, chemotactic activity are observed. Analogously, chemokine‐dependent inhibition of HIV infection is enhanced (for CCL3L1 and CCL5) or decreased (for CXCL12) by CD26 cleavage. The occurrence of CD26‐processed chemokine isoforms in plasma underscores the importance of the in vitro‐observed CD26 cleavages. Through modulation of chemokine activity, CD26 regulates leukocyte/tumor cell migration and progenitor cell release from the bone marrow, as shown by use of mice treated with CD26 inhibitors or CD26 knockout mice. As chemokine processing by CD26 has a significant impact on physiologic and pathologic processes, application of CD26 inhibitors to affect chemokine function is currently explored, e.g., as add‐on therapy in viral infection and cancer.","Mortier, Anneleen; Gouwy, Mieke; Van Damme, Jo; Proost, Paul; Struyf, Sofie",J Leukoc Biol,335,16

This frail patient group requires specialist care, and disruption to services is likely to result in increases in morbidity, mortality and long-term healthcare costs. AIMS To assess disruption to hip fracture services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A questionnaire was designed for completion by a senior clinician or service manager in each participating unit between April-September 2020. The survey was incorporated into existing national-level audits in Germany (n=71), Scotland (n=16), and Ireland (n=16). Responses from a further 81 units were obtained via online survey. RESULTS There were 185 units from 14 countries that returned the survey. 102/160 (63.7%) units reported a worsening of overall service quality, which was attributed predominantly to staff redistribution, reallocation of inpatient areas, and reduced access to surgical facilities. There was a high rate of redeployment of staff to other services, with two thirds having lost specialist orthopaedic nurses, a third orthogeriatrics services, and a quarter physiotherapists. Reallocation of inpatient areas resulted in patients being managed by non-specialised teams in generic wards, which increased the patients and staff transit between clinical areas. There was reduced operating department access, with 74/160 (46.2%) centres reporting a >50% reduction. Reduced theatre efficiency was reported by 135/160 (84.4%) and was attributed to staff and resource redistribution, longer anaesthetic and transfer times, and delays for preoperative COVID-19 testing and using personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION Hip fracture services were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic and this may have a sustained impact on health and social care. Protection of hip fracture services is essential to ensure satisfactory outcomes for this vulnerable patient group.","Hall, Andrew J.; Clement, Nicholas D.; MacLullich, Alasdair MJ.; Ojeda-Thies, Cristina; Hoefer, Christine; Brent, Louise; White, Timothy O.; Duckworth, Andrew D.",Surgeon,335,3

As a secondary analysis from the multicenter INSPIRE study (NCT01602211), we examined baseline data from relapse-free HCT adult survivors (2-10 years after allogeneic or autologous HCT) to investigate the association between driving distances and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of distress and physical function. We analyzed predictors of elevated distress and impaired physical function using logistic regression models that operationalized driving distance first as a continuous variable and separately as a dichotomous variable (<100 vs. 100+ miles). Of 1136 patients available for analysis from 6 US centers, median driving distance was 82 miles and 44% resided 100+ miles away from their HCT centers. Elevated distress was reported by 32% of patients, impaired physical function by 19%, and both by 12%. Driving distance, whether operationalized as a continuous or dichotomous variable, had no impact on distress or physical function in linear regression modeling (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.00 for both PROs with driving distance as a continuous variable). In contrast, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, lower income, and lack of Internet access independently predicted both elevated distress and impaired physical function. In summary, we found no impact of driving distance on distress and physical function among HCT survivors. Our results have implications for how long-term follow-up care is delivered after HCT, both with regard to the negligible impact of driving distances on PROs and also the risk of a ‘digital divide’ worsening outcomes among HCT survivors without Internet access.","Banerjee, Rahul; Yi, Jean C.; Majhail, Navneet S.; Jim, Heather S.L.; Uberti, Joseph; Whalen, Victoria; Loren, Alison W.; Syrjala, Karen L.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,335,22

Clot in transit (CIT) is considered a rare entity and the most severe form of venous thromboembolism (VTE), carrying a higher mortality than isolated pulmonary embolism (PE). The incidence of this phenomenon in patients with COVID-19 infection is unknown and likely under-recognized. CASE SUMMARY : During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, a 70-year-old Hispanic female presented with syncope due to a saddle PE further complicated by a highly mobile CIT. Polymerase chain reaction was positive for COVID-19 infection, however, there was no evidence of lung parenchymal involvement or hyper-inflammation. Based on consensus from a multidisciplinary team, aspiration thrombectomy was attempted to treat this extreme case of VTE, however, the patient died during the procedure. DISCUSSION : This case raises awareness to the most catastrophic form of VTE, presenting in an early phase of COVID-19 infection without the typical hyper-inflammation and severe lung injury associated with development of COVID-related coagulopathy. It also serves to inform on the critical role echocardiography has in the comprehensive evaluation and re-evaluation of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the importance of a multidisciplinary organized approach in clinical decision-making for this complex and poorly understood disease and its sequelae.","Aoi, Shunsuke; Kakkar, Amit M; Golowa, Yosef; Grushko, Michael; Coyle, Christina M; Elrafei, Tarek; Langston, Matthew D; Faillace, Robert T; Bangalore, Sripal; Sokol, Seth I",Eur Heart J Case Rep,335,3

Quantitative analysis showed that the severe the coronavirus infection, the higher the level of AST, ALT, TB, ALP, GGT and the lower the level of ALB. The changing trend of the appeal index was similar in ICU patients and dead patients. Conclusion: There is a certain risk of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, and the risk and degree of liver injury are related to the severity of COVID-19.","Zhao, X.; Lei, Z.",,335,16

In this study, we present a bioinformatics analysis of eukaryotic −1 frameshifting, in order to model this event. Results: A consensus model has already been established for −1 frameshifting sites. Our purpose here is to provide new constraints which make the model more precise. We show how a machine learning approach can be used to refine the current model. We identify new properties that may be involved in frameshifting. Each of the properties found was experimentally validated. Initially, we identify features of the overall model that are to be simultaneously satisfied. We then focus on the following two components: the spacer and the slippery sequence. As a main result, we point out that the identity of the primary structure of the so-called spacer is of great importance.

This figure is by far greater than the WHO prediction which indicates the rapid spread of this disease posing a growing threat to the economy and a major challenge to clinicians and health care services across the globe particularly in the affected areas. This article aims at bringing to light the current epidemiological and clinical status of the dengue fever. The relationship between genetic mutations, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the pathophysiology of disease progression will be put into perspective. It will also highlight the recent advances in dengue vaccine development. Thus far, a significant progress has been made in unraveling the risk factors and understanding the molecular pathogenesis associated with the disease. However, further insights in molecular features of the disease and the development of animal models will enormously help improving the therapeutic interventions and potentially contribute to finding new preventive measures for population at risk.","Nedjadi, Taoufik; El-Kafrawy, Sherif; Sohrab, Sayed S.; Desprès, Philippe; Damanhouri, Ghazi; Azhar, Esam",Virol J,335,16

This study aimed to compare the evaluation by 2 attending physicians and 2 resident physicians of the quality of videos on YouTube on neck dissection, a key indicator case in head and neck surgery. The authors aimed to assess the quality and quantity of YouTube videos available for development of a virtual surgical educational curriculum for trainees in otolaryngology. METHODS: Using the YouTube search feature, the top 10 videos by relevance and view count were compiled using the following search terms: radical neck dissection, selective neck dissection, modified radical neck dissection, lateral neck dissection, levels I-III neck dissection, levels II-IV, left neck dissection, right neck dissection, cervical nodal dissection, and supraomohyoid neck dissection. A total of 37 videos on neck dissection were identified and analyzed using the LAP-VEGaS criteria as well as author-specific modified LAP-VEGaS criteria. RESULTS: The mean comprehensive LAP-VEGaS score was 8.74 (SD 3.10). The majority of videos (24/37) were designated as medium quality; 10 of 37 videos were low quality and 3 of 37 videos were high quality. In the total group analysis, there was excellent inter-rater reliability between attending physicians (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.84) and good inter-rater reliability between resident physicians (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.58). There was no correlation between total view count, video age, or number of likes/dislikes and the overall LAP-VEGaS score. The presence of audio or written commentary had a moderate positive correlation with LAP-VEGaS score (adjusted R(2) of 0.36). There was no statistically significant difference in video quality between videos posted by US and non-US based physicians (95% confidence interval −0.10 to 4.10; p = 0.06). However, videos made by an otolaryngology-trained physician had a LAP-VEGaS score that was 3.93 points higher (95% confidence interval 2.34-5.52; p < 0.001) than that of videos made by a nonotolaryngology-trained physician. CONCLUSIONS: Online videos of neck dissection represent an increasingly ubiquitous and appropriate resource for trainees in learning otolaryngology key indicator cases. While free-to-access video repositories, such as YouTube, have become increasingly popular among trainees as a primary resource for learning and preparing for surgical cases, they lack consistent quality and as such, global efforts should be taken to improve the breadth and depth of educational video content in otolaryngology.

This study details the findings from 39 in-depth interviews with community members, community leaders, and fish traders in five communities in Kenya about their experiences since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The interviews were conducted by mobile phone between late August and early October 2020. In each community, people were greatly impacted by curfews, rules about gathering, closed travel routes, and bans on certain activities. Fish trade and fisheries livelihoods were greatly disrupted. Respondents from all communities emphasized how COVID-19 had disrupted relationships between fishers, traders, and customers; changed market demand; and ultimately made fishing and fish trading livelihoods very difficult to sustain. While COVID-19 impacted different groups in the communities—i.e., fishers, female fish traders, and male fish traders—all experienced a loss of income and livelihoods, reduced cash flow, declining food security, and impacts on wellbeing. As such, although small-scale fisheries can act as a crucial safety net in times of stress, the extent of COVID-19 disruptions to alternative and informal livelihoods stemmed cash flow across communities, and meant that fishing was unable to fulfil a safety net function as it may have done during past disruptions. As the pandemic continues to unfold, ensuring that COVID-19 safe policies and protocols support continued fishing or diversification into other informal livelihoods, and that COVID-19 support reaches the most vulnerable, will be critical in safeguarding the wellbeing of families in these coastal communities.","Lau, Jacqueline; Sutcliffe, Sarah; Barnes, Michele; Mbaru, Emmanuel; Muly, Innocent; Muthiga, Nyawira; Wanyonyi, Stephen; Cinner, Joshua E.",Mar Policy,335,20

DEAD-box helicase 1 (DDX1) plays a critical role in the innate immune system against viral infection. However, the role of duck DDX1 (duDDX1) in anti-RNA virus infection, especially in the anti-NDRV infection, has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of duDDX1 (2223 bp encode 740 amino acids) was firstly cloned from the spleen of healthy Cherry valley ducks, and the phylogenetic tree indicated that the duDDX1 has the closest relationship with Anas platyrhynchos in the bird branch. The duDDX1 mRNA was widely distributed in all tested tissues, especially in the duodenum, liver, and spleen. Overexpression of duDDX1 in primary duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells triggered the activation of transcription factors IRF-7 and NF-κB, as well as IFN-β expression, and the expression of the Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4) was significantly increased. Importantly, after overexpressing or knocking down duDDX1 and infecting NDRV in DEF cells, duDDX1 inhibits the replication of NDRV virus and also regulates the expression of pattern recognition receptors and cytokines. This indicates that duDDX1 may play an important role in the innate immune response of ducks to NDRV. Collectively, we first cloned DDX1 from ducks and analyzed its biological functions. Secondly, we proved that duck DDX1 participates in anti-NDRV infection, and innovated new ideas for the prevention and control of duck virus infection.","Zhang, Huihui; Song, Xingdong; Li, Tianxu; Wang, Jinchao; Xing, Bin; Zhai, Xinyu; Luo, Jinjian; Hu, Xiaofang; Hou, Xiaolan; Wei, Liangmeng",Vet Res,335,16

However, advanced therapy medicinal products, and in particular cell therapy and cell-based gene therapy substances, cannot be defined by such chemical nomenclature. Instead, they are published together with a textual definition paragraph to unambiguously describe their characteristics. These definitions are an integral part of the INN nomenclature system, and their presence contributes to pharmacovigilance and patient safety, as they help to distinguish regulated substances from cell-based interventions that have no INN and are marketed without regulatory oversight. Particular attention is therefore allocated to these descriptive paragraphs, as they form the basis for defining the uniqueness of a particular cell substance.

Until herd immunity is achieved with vaccines, the only available mechanisms for controlling the pandemic are quarantines, perimeter closures and social distancing with the aim of reducing mobility. Governments only apply these measures for a reduced period, since they involve the closure of economic activities such as tourism, cultural activities, or nightlife. The main criterion for establishing these measures and planning socioeconomic subsidies is the evolution of infections. However, the collapse of the health system and the unpredictability of human behavior, among others, make it difficult to predict this evolution in the short to medium term. This article evaluates different models for the early prediction of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic to create a decision support system for policy-makers. We consider a wide branch of models including artificial neural networks such as LSTM and GRU and statistically based models such as autoregressive (AR) or ARIMA. Moreover, several consensus strategies to ensemble all models into one system are proposed to obtain better results in this uncertain environment. Finally, a multivariate model that includes mobility data provided by Google is proposed to better forecast trend changes in the 14-day CI.

To date, several studies have investigated why certain people experience discomfort when looking at clustered patterns. Recently, “involuntary protection against dermatosis” (IPAD) hypothesis was proposed to explain the causes of trypophobia. The IPAD hypothesis suggests that involuntary aversive responses to skin diseases cause discomfort in response to image clusters. However, this idea has not been fully investigated empirically. Therefore, the present study used a modified version of the priming procedure and tested whether the activation of the concept of skin-related diseases affected the evaluation of trypophobic images. In Experiment 1, participants engaged in a lexical decision task in which words related to skin problems, negative events, or neutral events were presented. Then, they evaluated the discomfort of trypophobic, negative, and neutral images. The results indicated that participants evaluated trypophobic images as more discomforting after they were exposed to skin-problem-related words, whereas the exposure to words related to skin-problems did not enhance the discomfort of negative images. These findings demonstrate that the association with skin-related problems increases the discomfort of trypophobic images. In Experiment 2, we further tested the reproducibility of the priming effect observed in Experiment 1 and investigated the effect of priming with words related to COVID-19 in the context of a spreading infection. Contrary to predictions, no priming effect was produced by either skin-related words or COVID-19-related words. Future studies should further explore the causal relationship of the association between skin disease and trypophobia.","Shirai, Risako; Ogawa, Hirokazu",Sci Rep,335,24

The PRRSV genome is a positive-stranded polyadenylated RNA of about 15 kb. In infected cells, a 3′ coterminal nested set of six major subgenomic mRNAs could be demonstrated. Within the 3′ terminal 3.5 kb of the PRRSV genome, six overlapping reading frames (ORFs) were identified, each most likely expressed by one of the subgenomic mRNAs. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that the most 3′ terminal ORF (ORF7) encodes the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 14 kDa. It displays 44.8% amino acid identity with the capsid protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and 23.6% with that of equine arteritis virus (EAV). The product of ORF6, the second 3′ terminal ORF, represents a putative membrane protein and exhibits 53.2 and 27.2% amino acid identity with the corresponding LDV and EAV polypeptides, respectively. Similar to EAV, ORFs 2 through 5 might encode glycosylated viral proteins. The polypeptide deduced from the most 5′ ORF (ORF1b) contains two conserved domains common to EAV and coronavirus polymerases. Genome organization, strategy of gene expression, and the sequence of deduced proteins show that PRRSV belongs to the Arterivirus group of viruses.","Conzelmann, Karl-Klaus; Visser, Nico; Van Woensel, Peter; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen",Virology,335,22

Here we investigated the potential of using pooling of samples followed by one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. METHODS: We first evaluated different sample pooling (1:5, 1:10 and 1:15) prior to RNA extractions followed by standard RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The pool size achieving reproducible results in independent tests was then used for assessing nasopharyngeal samples in a tertiary hospital during August 2020. RESULTS: We found that pool size of five samples achieved the highest sensitivity compared to pool sizes of 10 and 15, showing a mean (± SD) Ct shift of 3.5 ± 2.2 between the pooled test and positive samples in the pool. We then used a pool size of five to test a total of 895 pools (4,475 prospective samples) using two different RT-qPCR kits available at that time. The Real Accurate Quadruplex corona-plus PCR Kit (PathoFinder) reported the lowest mean Ct (± SD) shift (2.2 ± 2.4) among the pool and the individual samples. The strategy allows detecting individual samples in the positive pools with Cts in the range of 16.7-39.4. CONCLUSIONS: We found that pools of five samples combined with RT-qPCR solutions helped to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity with minimal loss of sensitivity compared to that resulting from testing the samples independently.","Alcoba-Florez, Julia; Gil-Campesino, Helena; García-Martínez de Artola, Diego; Díez-Gil, Oscar; Valenzuela-Fernández, Agustín; González-Montelongo, Rafaela; Ciuffreda, Laura; Flores, Carlos",Int J Infect Dis,335,4

Previously, self-GMPylation/UMPylation activities were reported for an arterivirus NiRAN-RdRp nsp and suggested to generate a transient state primed for transferring nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) to (currently unknown) viral and/or cellular biopolymers. Here, we show that the coronavirus (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) nsp12 (NiRAN-RdRp) has Mn(2+)-dependent NMPylation activity that catalyzes the transfer of a single NMP to the cognate nsp9 by forming a phosphoramidate bond with the primary amine at the nsp9 N terminus (N3825) following M(pro)-mediated proteolytic release of nsp9 from N-terminally flanking nsps. Uridine triphosphate was the preferred nucleotide in this reaction, but also adenosine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and cytidine triphosphate were suitable cosubstrates. Mutational studies using recombinant coronavirus nsp9 and nsp12 proteins and genetically engineered HCoV-229E mutants identified residues essential for NiRAN-mediated nsp9 NMPylation and virus replication in cell culture. The data corroborate predictions on NiRAN active-site residues and establish an essential role for the nsp9 N3826 residue in both nsp9 NMPylation in vitro and virus replication. This residue is part of a conserved N-terminal NNE tripeptide sequence and shown to be the only invariant residue in nsp9 and its homologs in viruses of the family Coronaviridae.

Constraints, such as the age limit on Medicare, losing employer-provided health insurance, or the bureaucracy involved in filing for disability often require people to wait to follow recommendations for medical treatments. In 2016-2017, we conducted 52 narrative interviews in St. Louis, a city with significant racial and economic health disparities and without Medicaid expansion. We interviewed people with one or more chronic illnesses for which they were prescribed medication and who identified as having difficulties affording their prescriptions. Throughout the interviews, participants frequently recounted 1) experiences of waiting for care, along with other services, and 2) the range of strategies they utilized to manage the waiting. In this article, we develop the concept of active waiting to describe both the lived experiences of waiting for care and the responses that people devise to navigate, shorten, or otherwise endure waiting. Waiting is structured into healthcare and other social services at various scales in ways that reinforce feelings of marginalization, and also that require work on the part of those who wait. While much medical and public health research focuses on issues of diagnostic or treatment delay, we conclude that this conceptualization of active waiting provides a far more productive frame for accurately understanding the emotional and physical experiences of individuals who are disproportionately poor and made to wait for their care. Only with such understanding can we hope to build more just and compassionate social systems.","Lee, Amanda A.; James, Aimee S.; Hunleth, Jean M.",Soc Sci Med,335,33

It is evident that the SARS-CoV-2 variants pose an international health risk, the mutations of E484K and N501Y are the two most implicated mutations. E484K being the most concerning as it aids in immune evasion and drastically causes the efficacy of the current vaccines to be reduced by large margins. The most worrisome variant is the South African or B.1.351 which harbors the above mutations. It is of the upmost importance that targeted vaccines are synthesized to ensure that immunized individuals have effective protection against these variants. Until these specific targeted vaccines are synthesized the current vaccines offer little long-term protection, however do confer a level of immunity to stop severe infections.

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people. METHODS: UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37–73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99–0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998–1.01; p = 0.208).

Many other EDs both in and outside of California have requested access to the details of how we operationalised our ACUs to facilitate their own planning. This demonstrates the urgent need to disseminate this information to our colleagues. Below we describe the process of developing and launching our ACUs as a potential model for other EDs around the country.","Noble, Jeanne; Degesys, Nida Felicija; Kwan, Elizabeth; Grom, Edward; Brown, Cortlyn; Fahimi, Jahan; Raven, Maria",Emerg Med J,335,20

Our goals are to (1) to observe the correlation between the strictness of social distancing policies and the spread of disease and (2) to determine the optimal adoption level of social distancing policies. The earliest instances of the virus were found in China, and the virus has reached the United States with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, the United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Although it is impossible to stop it, it is possible to slow down its spread to reduce its impact on the society and economy. Governments around the world have deployed various policies to reduce the virus spread in response to the pandemic. To assess the effectiveness of these policies, the system’s dynamics of the society needs to be analyzed, which is generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with continuous feedback loops. Because of the challenges with the other methods, we chose agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise in assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis by applying policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, emergency hospitalization, and travel prevention to reduce infection rates. Based on modeling studies conducted in Imperial College, increasing levels of interventions could slow the spread of disease and infection. We ran the model with six different percentages of social distancing while keeping the other parameters constant. The results show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, in turn decreasing the spread of disease and infection rates when implemented at higher levels. We also validated these results by using the behavior space tool with ten experiments with varying social distancing levels. We conclude that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels leads to a significant reduction in infection spread and the number of deaths. Both experiments show that infection rates are reduced drastically when social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.","Daghriri, Talal; Ozmen, Ozlem",Int J Environ Res Public Health,335,1

The causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic of unprecedented magnitude. To date, several clinically safe and efficient vaccines (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines) as well as drugs for emergency use have been approved. However, increasing numbers of SARS-Cov-2 variants make it imminent to identify an alternative way to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. A well-known strategy to identify molecules with inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 proteins is repurposing clinically developed drugs, e.g., antiparasitic drugs. The results described in this study demonstrated the inhibitory potential of quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL(pro)). Quinacrine and suramin molecules presented a competitive and noncompetitive inhibition mode, respectively, with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrated that quinacrine and suramin alone possessed a moderate or weak affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) but suramin binding increased quinacrine interaction by around a factor of eight. Using docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we identified a possible binding mode and the amino acids involved in these interactions. Our results suggested that suramin, in combination with quinacrine, showed promising synergistic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro). We suppose that the identification of effective, synergistic drug combinations could lead to the design of better treatments for the COVID-19 disease and repurposable drug candidates offer fast therapeutic breakthroughs, mainly in a pandemic moment.","Eberle, Raphael J.; Olivier, Danilo S.; Amaral, Marcos S.; Gering, Ian; Willbold, Dieter; Arni, Raghuvir K.; Coronado, Monika A.",Viruses,335,12

These emergences has promoted research on coronaviruses in wildlife. We started the first eco-epidemiological study to screen the presence of coronaviruses circulating in mice and rats of four Canary Islands. Between 2015 and 2019, we obtained fecal samples of three rodent species (150 Mus musculus, 109 Rattus rattus and 1 Rattus norvegicus) captured in urban and rural areas. Fecal samples were analyzed by nRT-PCR and the resulting sequences were compared to known diversity using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We only found coronavirus RNA in house mice from El Hierro (10.53%), Tenerife (7.02%) and Lanzarote (5.26%) islands. All coronaviruses detected belong to the species Murine coronavirus belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus and subgenus Embecovirus, being all positive house mice captured in anthropogenic environment. The phylogenetic analysis shows that murine coronaviruses from the Canary Islands are related to European murine coronaviruses. Albeit data are still scarce in the region, the most probable origin of M. coronavirus present in the Canary Islands is continental Europe. According to temporal Bayesian phylogenetics, the differentiation between Canary and continental viruses seems to be quite recent. Moreover, murine coronaviruses from El Hierro, Tenerife and Lanzarote islands tend to segregate in different clades. This enlightens the potential role of rodents or other possibly invasive species in disseminating infectious diseases to remote places through exchanges with the continent. It is important to consider these aspects in the sanitary control of islands, for health and biodiversity preservation concerns.","Monastiri, Abir; Martín-Carrillo, Natalia; Foronda, Pilar; Izquierdo-Rodríguez, Elena; Feliu, Carles; López-Roig, Marc; Miquel, Jordi; Ar Gouilh, Meriadeg; Serra-Cobo, Jordi",Front Vet Sci,335,16

Using a signaling games approach, simulations show that invasion by Batesian mimics will make Mullerian mimicry unstable, in a coevolutionary chase. We use these results to better understand the deceptive strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and their key role in the COVID-19 pandemic. At the biomolecular level, we explain how cellularization promotes Mullerian molecular mimicry, and discourages Batesian molecular mimicry. A wide range of processes analogous to cellularization are presented; these might represent a manner of reducing oscillatory instabilities. Lastly, we identify examples of mimicry in human society, that might be addressed using a signaling game approach.","Casey, William; Massey, Steven; Mishra, Bud",Res Sq,335,26

Whereas the conformation of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) UreG was solved by crystallography when it is in complex with two other chaperones, in solution the protein was found in a disordered and flexible form, defining it as an intrinsically disordered enzyme and indicating that the well-folded structure found in the crystal state does not fully reflect the behavior of the protein in solution. Here, isothermal titration calorimetry and site-directed spin labeling coupled to electron paramagnetic spectroscopy were successfully combined to investigate HpUreG structural dynamics in solution and the effect of Ni(II) and GTP on protein mobility. The results demonstrate that, although the protein maintains a flexible behavior in the metal and nucleotide bound forms, concomitant addition of Ni(II) and GTP exerts a structural change through the crosstalk of different protein regions.","Pierro, Annalisa; Etienne, Emilien; Gerbaud, Guillaume; Guigliarelli, Bruno; Ciurli, Stefano; Belle, Valérie; Zambelli, Barbara; Mileo, Elisabetta",Biomolecules,335,1

We sought to quantify the impact of bamlanivimab monotherapy on hospitalizations and mortality, as well as Emergency Department (ED) visits without hospitalization, among outpatients at high risk of COVID-19 complications. Methods: We compared patients receiving mAb to patients who met criteria but did not receive mAb from December 2020 through March 2021. The study population selection used propensity scores to match 1:1 by likelihood to receive mAb. The primary outcome was hospitalization or all-cause mortality within 28 days; the secondary outcome was hospitalization or ED visit without hospitalization within 28 days. Odds ratios (OR) calculation used logistic regression modeling including propensity score and mAb receipt predictors. Results: The study population included 234 patients receiving mAb and 234 matched comparator patients not receiving mAb. Patients receiving mAb were less likely to experience hospitalization or mortality (OR 0.31, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.17-0.56, p=0.00001) and hospitalization or ED visit without hospitalization (OR 0.50, 95%CI 0.43-0.83, p=0.007). The impact of mAb was more pronounced in prevention of hospitalization (among all age groups, OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.19-0.66, p=0.001) than mortality or ED visit without hospitalization, and most strongly associated with patients age 65 years and older (primary outcome OR 0.28, 95%CI 0.14-0.56, p=0.0003).

Methods We collected records of SARS-CoV-2 school outbreaks globally published from January 2020 to January 2021 and compiled information on hypothesized risk factors. We utilized the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to conceptualize the risk mechanisms, used logistic regression to examine each risk-factor group, and further built multiple variable models based on the marginal analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results From 17 relevant articles, 26 school clusters were included for analysis. The best-fit model showed that the intensity of community transmission (aOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.22 - 1.30, for each increase of 10 cases per 100,000 persons per week), social distancing (aOR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.37), mask-wearing (aOR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.78) were associated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mandala colouring on the anxiety of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 were randomly divided between the intervention and control groups. Standard care was provided for both groups. The intervention group spent 30 min/day for six consecutive days performing mandala colouring. Patient anxiety was measured prior and subsequent to the intervention in both groups using the Spielberger State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory. Data were analysed using SPSS software version 25. The mean anxiety score was not significantly different between the two groups before the intervention (P = 0.08). Subsequent to the intervention, the mean anxiety score in the intervention and control groups was 44.05 ± 4.67 and 67.85 ± 6.25, respectively, indicating a statistically significant (P = 0.0001) decrease in the anxiety measured among the intervention group as compared with that of the control group. The results of this study show that 30 min of mandala colouring daily is an effective strategy for reducing anxiety in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. Mandala colouring can complement routine treatment and provides a non‐pharmaceutical option for decreasing patient anxiety.","Khademi, Fatemeh; Rassouli, Maryam; Rafiei, Fatemeh; Moayedi, Siamak; Torres, Mercedes; Marzban, Negin; Haji, Ensieh; Golitaleb, Mohamad",Int J Ment Health Nurs,335,26

To effectively battle COVID-19, categorized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), materials scientists and biotechnologists need to combine their knowledge to develop efficient antiviral nanomaterials. By design, nanostructured materials (spherical, two-dimensional, hybrid) can express a diverse bioactivity and unique combination of specific, nonspecific, and mixed mechanisms of antiviral action. It can be related to the material’s specific features and their multiple functionalization strategies. This is a complex guiding approach in which an interaction target is constantly moving and quickly changing. On the other hand, in such a rush, sustainability may be put aside. Therefore, to elucidate the most promising nanotechnological solutions, we critically review available data within the frame of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other types of viruses. We highlight solutions that are, or could be, more sustainable and less toxic. In this regard, reduction of the number of synthetic routes, organic solvents, byproducts, and residues is highly recommended. Such efficient, green solutions may be further used for the prevention of virion–host interactions, treatment of the already developed infection, reducing inflammation, and finally, protecting healthcare professionals with masks, fabrics, equipment, and in other associated areas.

This study aims to investigate the presence of burnout amongst neurosurgical trainees in the UK and Ireland as well as investigating potential exacerbating and protective factors. METHOD: An online survey was sent to all neurosurgical trainees in the UK and Ireland via the British Neurosurgical Trainees’ Association (BNTA) mailing list. Responding participants anonymously completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and answered questions about known risk factors for burnout including workplace environment, workplace bullying, time spent on leisure activities and sleep and reported likelihood of leaving neurosurgery. We also collated data on responders’ demographics. We compared CBI scores for participants with and without risk factors to determine correlation with CBI. RESULTS: There were 75 respondents (response rate 42%) from a range of ages and all training grades, 72% of whom were male. The median CBI score was 38.85 (IQR 17.76). Participants showed a higher degree of personal and workplace burnout (median CBIs of 47.02, IQR 25.00; and 49.14, IQR 19.64, respectively) compared with patient-related burnout (median CBI 18.67, IQR 25.00). Participants with the following self-reported risk factors were significantly more likely to have higher CBIs: workplace bullying (p = 0.01), getting on less well with colleagues (p < 0.05), working longer hours (p < 0.05) and insufficient sleep, exercise and leisure time (all p < 0.01). Those with higher CBI scores were more likely to consider leaving neurosurgical training (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: We identified a high burnout incidence in a cohort representative of UK neurosurgical trainees, although our results may have been skewed somewhat by selection bias. We determined potential risk factors for burnout related to specific workplace stressors and time for non-work activities. In the future, changes to training curricula should address these issues, aiming to improve training, enhance patient care and reduce attrition rates.

At each time, every susceptible individual chooses whether to wear a mask or not in the next time step, which depends on an evaluation of the potential costs and perceived risk of infection. When the cost of infection is high, the majority of the population choose to wear masks, where global awareness plays a significant role. However, if the mask source is limited, global awareness may give rise to a negative result. In this case, more mask source should be allocated to the individuals with high risk of infection.","Li, Weiqiang; Zhou, Jin; Lu, Jun-an",Nonlinear Dyn,335,13

Retreated patients had the highest odds of RR-TB but a lower likelihood of concurrent EPTB compared to new patients. Patients between 21 and 40 years of age had a higher likelihood of RR-TB compared to those 20 years and younger. Female patients and patients from Bijie city as well as the Miao ethnic minority had higher odds of concurrent EPTB.

The animals were gavage treated 5 d per week with up to 1000 ng of PCB126 per kilogram of body weight per day or up to 100 ng of TCDD per kilogram of body weight per day for up to 2 yr. The control animals received only a corn oil/acetone vehicle (99:1 mixture). The corresponding stop-study groups received the highest doses for 31 wk and then received only the vehicle for the remainder of the study. After a full necropsy of all animals, a complete set of tissues was examined microscopically.

Cardiomyopathy and chronic active arteritis increased in a dose-related manner in all groups treated with PCB126 or with TCDD. Increased incidences were also observed in the stop-study groups, indicating that a shorter term exposure may produce some effects. The average severity of cardiomyopathy was minimal or slightly greater in all dose groups, including the controls. Chronic active arteritis occurred primarily in the mesentery and pancreas, although the rectum, liver, heart, ovary, uterus, and glandular stomach in the PCB126 study and the liver and ovary in the TCDD study were affected in a few of the dosed animals.

For this reason, several intracellular factors, including the redox state, might directly or indirectly affect the progression and outcome of viral infection. In physiological conditions, the redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant species is maintained by enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, and it finely regulates several cell functions. Different viruses break this equilibrium and induce an oxidative stress that in turn facilitates specific steps of the virus lifecycle and activates an inflammatory response. In this context, many studies highlighted the importance of redox-sensitive pathways as novel cell-based targets for therapies aimed at blocking both viral replication and virus-induced inflammation. In the review, we discuss the most recent findings in this field. In particular, we describe the effects of natural or synthetic redox-modulating molecules in inhibiting DNA or RNA virus replication as well as inflammatory pathways. The importance of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 is also discussed. Most of the data reported here are on influenza virus infection.

Therefore, this paper uses a structured analysis that focuses on the preferred reporting items for a systematic review of ethical issues regarding the use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma must meet the ethical principles of autonomy; such as voluntary, informed consent, and confidentiality. Consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for potential donor recipients also needs to be considered in order to meet the beneficence and non-maleficence principles. The principle of justice also needs to be applied both to donors, donor recipients and health workers, such as determining the priority of donor recipients, due to the increasing demand for convalescent plasma amid the limited circumstances of patients who have recovered from Covid-19 who voluntarily donate.","Munir, Muhammad Ardi; Tandiabang, Pascal Adventra; Setyawati, Tri; Basry, Amirah; Cyio, Asep Dwitama; Rahman, Nurulhuda",Transfus Clin Biol,335,16

Only early detection can aid in the prevention of personal transmission of the disease. Recent scientific research reports indicate that computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients exhibit acute infections and lung abnormalities. However, analyzing these CT scan images is very difficult because of the presence of noise and low-resolution. Therefore, this study suggests the development of a new early detection method to detect abnormalities in chest CT scan images of COVID-19 patients. By this motivation, a novel image clustering algorithm, called ambiguous D-means fusion clustering algorithm (ADMFCA), is introduced in this study. This algorithm is based on the newly proposed ambiguous set theory and associated concepts. The ambiguous set is used in the proposed technique to characterize the ambiguity associated with grayscale values of pixels as true, false, true-ambiguous and false-ambiguous. The proposed algorithm performs the clustering operation on the CT scan images based on the entropies of different grayscale values. Finally, a final outcome image is obtained from the clustered images by image fusion operation. The experiment is carried out on 40 different CT scan images of COVID-19 patients. The clustered images obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared to five well-known clustering methods. The comparative study based on statistical metrics shows that the proposed ADMFCA is more efficient than the five existing clustering methods.","Singh, Pritpal; Bose, Surya Sekhar",Knowl Based Syst,335,29

One thousand, five hundred and seventy-seven individuals participated in this study, of which 1396 (88.5%) self-identified as heterosexual, 95 (6.0%) as gay or lesbian, and 87 (5.5%) as bisexual. Participants responded to the “Work-Related Quality of Life” scale, the “Fear of COVID-19” scale, and the “Negative Impact of COVID-19” scale. Bisexuals scored higher on “Fear of COVID-19” and “Negative Impact of COVID-19” than heterosexual, and gay, or lesbian participants. Differences between sexual orientations for all dimensions of WRQoL were found: heterosexual participants scored higher on general well-being, home–work interface, career satisfaction, working conditions, and lower on stress at work, compared to bisexual, and gay, or lesbian participants. Gay or lesbian participants scored lower than heterosexual and bisexual participants on career satisfaction and working conditions. Sexual orientation, the fear of COVID-19, and the negative impact of COVID-19 were significant predictors of overall WRQoL (explaining 13% of variance). Moderation analysis also showed that sexual orientation is a significant moderator of the association between the fear of COVID-19, the negative impact of COVID-19, and WRQoL. LGB people (especially bisexuals) suffer more severe impacts of COVID-19 and have lower WRQoL than heterosexual people. Inevitably, this has consequences in terms of mental health and overall quality of life for sexual minorities, thus reinforcing the need to adopt inclusive policies in organizations and companies to improve their WRQoL.","Mendes, Cindy; Pereira, Henrique",Behav Sci (Basel),335,14

Many Pelecaniformes, Gaviiformes, Podicipediformes, and Procellariiformes are pelagic species that congregate periodically in nesting colonies or during migration. For free-ranging pelagic species, information derives from infrequent opportunistic screening as sentinels of ocean health and pathogen circulation, and mass mortality events. Birds in captive populations, whose life history differs dramatically, are sparsely represented. Nutritional stress, infectious disease, and toxins contribute to morbidity in congregating birds. Adverse anthropogenic influences (population growth, climate change, environmental pollution, and intensive fishing) pose conservation threats.","Stidworthy, Mark F.; Denk, Daniela",Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals,335,16

Here, we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations to study the interaction of some of the known metabolites and natural products (NPs) produced by commensal microbiota with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS‐CoV‐2. The results predict that NPs of commensal microbiota such as bile acids and non‐ribosomal peptides (NRPs), of which some are siderophores, bind to the wild‐type RBD and interfere with its binding to the ACE2 receptor. N501Y mutation, which is present in many of the emerging variants of the virus, abolishes the predicted binding pocket of bile acids and NRPs. Based on these findings, available experimental data showing that bile acids reduce the binding affinity of wild‐type RBD to the ACE2 receptor, and the data suggesting that the respiratory tract microbiota affect viral infection we put forward the following proposal: mutations such as N501Y enable the RBD to bind to the ACE2 receptor more effectively in the presence of NPs produced by the respiratory tract bacteria thereby, increasing the infectivity rate of the virus. We hope our data stimulate future works to better understand the interactions of NPs produced by commensal microbiota with respiratory viruses like SARS‐CoV‐2.","Dragelj, Jovan; Mroginski, Maria Andrea; Ebrahimi, Kourosh H.",Chembiochem,335,13

COVID-19 identification is a difficult assignment that constantly demands a careful analysis of a patient’s clinical images, as COVID-19 is found to be very alike to pneumonic viral lung infection. In this paper, a transfer learning model to accelerate prediction processes and to assist medical professionals is proposed. Finally, the main purpose is to do an accurate classification between Covid-19, pneumonia and, healthy lungs using CXR and CT images. METHODS: Learning transfer gives the possibility to find out about this new illness COVID-19, using the knowledge we have about the pneumonia virus. This demonstrates the apprehensiveness achieved from a new architecture trained to detect virus-related pneumonia that must be transferred for COVID-19 detection. Transfer learning presents a considerable dissimilarity in results when compared to the result of traditional groupings. It is not necessary to create a separate model for the classification of COVID-19. This simplifies complicated issues by adopting the available model for COVID-19 determination. Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 using Haralick texture features is focused on segmented lung images and problematic lung patches. Lung patches are necessary for the augmentation of COVID-19 image data. RESULTS: The obtained outcomes are quite reliable for all distinctive processes as the proposed architecture can distinguish healthy lungs, pneumonia, COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the implemented model is improved considering other existing models because the obtained classification accuracy is over the recently obtained results. It is a belief that the new architecture that is implemented in this study, delivers a petite step in building refined Coronavirus 2019 diagnosis architecture using CXR and CT bio-images.","Lascu, Mihaela-Ruxandra",J Med Biol Eng,335,20

Our aim in this study was to evaluate death and intubation outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19, and treatment options focusing on diabetes patients and the use of metformin pre-admission and during hospitalization. METHODS: In this Brazilian single-center study we evaluated 1170 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Diabetes patients (n = 188) were divided based on their use of pre-hospital and in-hospital metformin (non-met-group and met-group). RESULTS: In the total cohort most comorbidities were risk factors for orotracheal intubation and death. The use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine was significantly associated with increased death and intubation risk in uni- and multivariate analysis. Diabetes patients showed worst clinical feature compared with non-diabetes patients. In-hospital non-met-group had increased mortality (20.5%) compared to met-group (3.5%) (p = 0.0002) and univariable cox proportion hazard regression indicated in-hospital metformin reduced mortality (HR = 0.325, p = 0.035). Patients that used pre-hospital metformin showed lower severity parameters at hospital admission. (met-group: 2.45 ± 2.5; non-met-group: 4.25 ± 3.4). In all the groups older patients showed more severe clinical conditions and high risk of death and intubation. CONCLUSION: Even though this is a single-center study, results from other reports have shown a similar trend, indicating that patients that used metformin during hospitalization have a better prognosis and reduced risk of death.

It is found that as of 8 February 2021, Korea has recorded 15.8 patients per 10,000 people, and this is used to calculate ratio to compare with other countries. On average, the number of Coronavirus patients in the world is 136.2 that is 8.6 times more than in Korea. The number of Covid-19 patients recorded in Korea is relatively smaller than other countries. There was no clear evidence on the atmospheric transport of Coronaviruses over 1 km to cause infection to other people. The infection of Coronaviruses appeared to occur mainly by close contact with an infected person or by airborne droplets in confined indoor environments, as noted earlier (Lancet, Respir Med 8(12):1159, 2020). To reduce the transmission of Coronavirus and related infections, the wearing of a pollution filter (mask) covering the nose and mouth is mandatory for Coronavirus patients. For the general public, however, we have invented a filter which covers only the nose. When there is no need for conversation and deep breathing, the nose band would be sufficient to filter out Coronavirus and air pollutants. Meanwhile, air and sea port activities including ground transport continued and strict policy on people mingle was not tightly enforced, and control measures to reduce infection were not so effective. However, it is believed that consuming fermented Korean spicy Kimchee and hot peppery soup plus warm rice tea helps in washing Coronaviruses around the throat deep down to the stomach. We find that cleansing the mouth and throat deeply including pathway is better than doing shallow gargling. A possible mechanism for cleansing the mouth and throat of Coronaviruses is here explored. This could have contributed to the relatively small number of Coronavirus patients observed in Korea.","Chung, Y. S.",Air Qual Atmos Health,335,18

This reality is more accentuated especially in Ecuador, where, although many healthcare workers have been called to help in the regions most affected; the shortage of them combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors have led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation on the front line of the last year medical students are indispensable. For that reason, appropriate training on COVID-19 to last year medical students is an urgent need that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices in Ecuadorian last year medical students in order to identify the knowledge gaps, perceptions and behavior patterns, which could guide the design of better medical educational curricula on COVID-19. Methods: This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 20 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian last year medical students. It was sent by email and by Facebook and WhatsApp. Results: A total of 309 students answered the survey. 88% (274/309) of students scored high about knowledge of the disease (more than 16 points). The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of the COVID-19 in Ecuador and volunteering during the outbreak in 77% (238/309) and 58% (179/309) of the students, respectively. Moreover 91% (280/309) of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment, neither training in their health facilities (49%, 152/309). Conclusions: The high level of students knowledge is an important opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training toward COVID-19. Creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways for all students to be trained. Hopefully with this, negative attitudes will change and students will be better qualified.

Overall number, intensity and time trend of conversations related to reactions during the 4 weeks of observation related to the crucial events which occurred between 24 February and 28 March, 2020 2020 are included. A sentiment analysis of conversations was also carried out. RESULTS: We report 956 conversations among 19 medical oncology units related to reactions to the crucial events, such as epidemic spread, Government ordinances and guidelines during the 4 weeks of observation. Data show significant awareness of problems linked to the COVID-19 spread among oncologists and rapid diffusion of countermeasures. Actions taken were correlated time wise to crucial events. A correlation between conversations and the volume of activity of oncology units was found. By analysing the sentiment analysis of raw data, positive emotions were reduced in percentage over the weeks. A significant increase in negative emotions was observed as the outbreak impacted on the healthcare system.

It is therefore important that high-containment labs coordinate and communicate globally to share their experiences and lessons to improve their capacity to respond to threats. The National Biosafety (Level 4) Laboratory in Wuhan, CAS, which is the first Level 4 biosafety laboratory (BSL-4) in China, has been certified recently and it is expected to play an important role in the prevention and control of highly infectious agents in future. Trained and experienced staff in such organizations is the most important factor contributing to safety and security. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a standard training program. Accordingly, in the present study, we developed an improved training program and assessment system based on policies and practices developed by BSL-3/4s in other countries. It included the following three components: (1) A flexible modularized theoretical training: This training comprised 14 modularized theoretical topics such that staffs with different backgrounds could take this theoretical training with different topic combinations according to their knowledge and skill levels; (2) A standardized practical training assessment: This comprehensive assessment, which could be used with biosafety laboratory staff before, during, and after training, included standard operation procedures to meet the special requirements of trainees with different scores; and (3) An applicable documentation system: A certification system was established to evaluate the ability of all staff working inside or outside the laboratory, implemented by a special committee. This certification was approved and authorized by the director of the laboratory and was classified into three grades with corresponding minimal requirements. Further, the present study examined the importance of and need for networking for training BSL-3/4 staff. The establishment of rigorous standards for training BSL-3/4 staff will instill confidence in the public, policy makers, and security officials. Additionally, the expanded international network of BSL-3/4s will continue to be operated safely and will pose no risk to scientific staff, local communities, surrounding environment, and host nations. The clarification and coordination of training standards will help develop a highly-qualified biocontainment workforce and will result in a series of programs that will enable scientists to develop measures to deal with existing threat agents and new diseases that emerge.","Huang, Yi; Huang, Jicheng; Xia, Han; Shi, Yongxia; Ma, Haixia; Yuan, Zhiming",Journal of Biosafety and Biosecurity,335,16

Many universities turned to e-learning to provide educational continuity, but they now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. This is difficult to achieve without methods for measuring the impact of school policies on student physical interactions. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. The numbers and locations of 24,000 students on campus were measured over a 17-week period by analysing >24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network. We show that daily population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results suggest that converting a small number of classes to e-learning can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimising disruption to university operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational continuity during periods of low community disease transmission.","Yeo, Sing Chen; Lai, Clin K.

Blinded observers subjectively evaluated ferret distress. Prefilling the cage or filling it at a rate of 50% volume per min resulted in less time to recumbency and to last breath than did filling the cage at a slower displacement rate. Slower carbon dioxide displacement rates also caused an increase in ferret blood glucose concentrations, which may indicate distress.

For many diseases, Syrian golden hamsters have emerged as an ideal animal model due to their low cost, small size, ease of handling, and ability to accurately reflect disease progression in humans. Despite the increasing use and popularity of hamsters, there remains a lack of available reagents for studying hamster immune responses. Without suitable reagents for assessing immune responses, researchers are left to examine clinical signs and disease pathology. This becomes an issue for the development of vaccine and treatment options where characterizing the type of immune response generated is critical for understanding protection from disease. Despite the relative lack of reagents for use in hamsters, significant advances have been made recently with several hamster specific immunologic methods being developed. Here we discuss the progress of this development, with focus on classical methods used as well as more recent molecular methods. We outline what methods are currently available for use in hamsters and what is readily used as well as what limitations still exist and future perspectives of reagent and assay development for hamsters.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is another high prevalent pathogen in swine in many regions of the world. PCV2 and HEV are both highly prevalent in pig farms in China. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, we characterized the HEV and PCV2 co-infection in 2–3 month-old piglets, based on pathogen identification and the pathological changes observed, in Hebei Province, China. The pathological changes were severe, and general hyperemia, hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrosis were evident in the tissues of dead swine. PCR was used to identify the pathogen and we tested for eight viruses (HEV, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, PCV2, Classical swine fever virus, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, Porcine parvovirus and Pseudorabies virus) that are prevalent in Chinese pig farms. The livers, kidneys, spleens, and other organs of the necropsied swine were positive for HEV and/or PCV2. Immunohistochemical staining showed HEV- and PCV2-antigen-positive signals in the livers, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, and intestine. CONCLUSION: HEV and PCV2 co-infection in piglets was detected in four out of seven dead pigs from two pig farms in Hebei, China, producing severe pathological changes. The natural co-infection of HEV and PCV2 in pigs in China has rarely been reported. We speculate that co-infection with PCV2 and HEV may bring some negative effect on pig production and recommend that more attention should be paid to this phenomenon.","Yang, Yifei; Shi, Ruihan; She, Ruiping; Mao, Jingjing; Zhao, Yue; Du, Fang; Liu, Can; Liu, Jianchai; Cheng, Minheng; Zhu, Rining; Li, Wei; Wang, Xiaoyang; Soomro, Majid Hussain",BMC Vet Res,335,20

According to previous deletion analyses, M self-assembly involves multiple M sequence regions. To identify important M amino acid residues for VLP assembly, we coexpressed N with multiple M mutants containing substitution mutations at the amino-terminal ectodomain, carboxyl-terminal endodomain, or transmembrane segments. Our results indicate that a dileucine motif in the endodomain tail (218LL219) is required for efficient N packaging into VLPs. Results from cross-linking VLP analyses suggest that the cysteine residues 63, 85 and 158 are not in close proximity to the M dimer interface. We noted a significant reduction in M secretion due to serine replacement for C158, but not for C63 or C85. Further analysis suggests that C158 is involved in M-N interaction. In addition to mutations of the highly conserved 107-SWWSFNPE-114 motif, substitutions at codons W19, W57, P58, W91, Y94 or F95 all resulted in significantly reduced VLP yields, largely due to defective M secretion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study the relationship between health and economic impact of COVID-19, we conducted a secondary research on Italian regions, combining official data (mortality due to COVID-19 and contractions in value added of production for a month of lockdown). Then, we added the tertiles of the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those of health aids to evaluate the correspondence with the outcome measures. RESULTS: Five regions out of 20, the most industrialized northern regions, which were affected both earlier and more severely by the outbreak, registered both mortality and economic value loss above the overall medians. The southern regions, which were affected later and less severely, had low mortality and less economic impact. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that considering health and economic outcomes in the assessment of response to pandemics offers a bigger picture perspective of the outbreak and could allow policymakers and health managers to choose systemic, ‘personalized’ strategies, in case of a feared second epidemic wave.","Seghieri, Chiara; La Regina, Micaela; Tanzini, Michela; Tartaglia, Riccardo",Int J Qual Health Care,335,16

The target audiences are non-specialists in paediatric musculoskeletal medicine. Our study aimed to evaluate impact on learning and clinical practice. METHODS: Mixed methods (analytics, online survey, interviews) were used with PMM and ELM registered users and purposive sampling of users using international contacts within paediatrics and paediatric rheumatology. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative techniques. A Paired T-Test compared self-rated confidence before and after use of the PMM Portfolio. RESULTS: There has been wide reach for all the e-resources; PMM website (662,827 hits, 262,476 users, 214 countries, data 31st July 2020); pGALS app (12,670 downloads, 70 countries, data 31st July 2020); ELM (150 users, 30 countries, data 30th May 2019). There were 164 responses (students, trainees and health care professionals) to the survey from 25 countries.

The most popular PMM website pages related to clinical assessment techniques (especially pGALS). There was high uptake of the pGALS app and pGALS ELM especially from trainees and allied health professionals. Many clinicians reported the PMM Portfolio to be useful when used to teach others. User feedback reported that easy navigation, open access, clinical images and cases were the most valued features. User feedback highlighted need to increase awareness of the e-resources through training programmes. CONCLUSIONS: The PMM Portfolio was developed to aid learning for clinicians who are not specialists in paediatric MSK medicine. Our evaluation demonstrates wide international reach and positive feedback on learning. The PMM Portfolio is a highly useful e-resource for paediatric rheumatologists in their teaching of others to raise awareness, facilitate early diagnosis and referral of children with suspected disease. The wide user engagement informed future PMM Portfolio development and the mixed method of evaluation is transferable to other e-resources.

ACE2 has been shown to protect against lung injury. However, the mechanisms of its protective effects on ARDS are largely unknown. Here, we report that ACE2 prevents LPS-induced ARDS by inhibiting MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathway. Lentiviral packaged Ace2 cDNA or Ace2 shRNA was intratracheally administrated into the lungs of male SD rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received LPS (7.5 mg/Kg) injection alone or in combination with Mas receptor antagonist A779 (10 μg/Kg) or ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (1 mg/Kg) pretreatment. LPS-induced lung injury and inflammatory response were significantly prevented by ACE2 overexpression and deteriorated by Ace2 shRNA. A779 or MLN-4760 pretreatment abolished the protective effects of ACE2. Moreover, overexpression of ACE2 significantly reduced the Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio in BALF and up-regulated Mas mRNA expression in lung, which was reversed by A779. Importantly, the blockade of ACE2 on LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and p50/p65 was also abolished by A779. Whereas, only the ERK1/2 inhibitor significantly attenuated lung injury in ACE2 overexpressing rats pretreated with A779. Our observation suggests that AEC2 attenuates LPS-induced ARDS via the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway by inhibiting ERK/NF-κB activation.","Li, Yingchuan; Zeng, Zhen; Cao, Yongmei; Liu, Yujing; Ping, Feng; Liang, Mengfan; Xue, Ying; Xi, Caihua; Zhou, Ming; Jiang, Wei",Sci Rep,335,26

With seed-borne, mechanical transmission and resistant breaking traits, tobamoviruses pose serious threat to vegetable production worldwide. With the absence of a commercial resistant cultivar, growers are encouraged to take preventative measures to manage those highly contagious viral diseases. However, there is no information available on which disinfectants are effective to deactivate the virus infectivity on contaminated hands, tools and equipment for these emerging tobamoviruses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a collection of 16 chemical disinfectants for their effectiveness against mechanical transmission of two emerging tobamoviruses, ToBRFV and CGMMV. METHODS: Bioassay was used to evaluate the efficacy of each disinfectant based on virus infectivity remaining in a prepared virus inoculum after three short exposure times (10 s, 30 s and 60 s) to the disinfectant and inoculated mechanically on three respective test plants (ToBRFV on tomato and CGMMV on watermelon). Percent infection of plants was measured through symptom observation on the test plants and the presence of the virus was confirmed through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with appropriate antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA based on data collected from three independent experiments. RESULTS: Through comparative analysis of percent infection of test plants, a similar trend of efficacy among 16 disinfectants was observed between the two pathosystems. Four common disinfectants with broad spectrum activities against two different tobamoviruses were identified. Those effective disinfectants with 90–100% efficacy against both tobamoviruses were 0.5% Lactoferrin, 2% Virocid, and 10% Clorox, plus 2% Virkon against CGMMV and 3% Virkon against ToBRFV. In addition, SP2700 generated a significant effect against CGMMV, but poorly against ToBRFV. CONCLUSION: Identification of common disinfectants against ToBRFV and CGMMV, two emerging tobamoviruses in two different pathosystems suggest their potential broader effects against other tobamoviruses or even other viruses.","Chanda, Bidisha; Shamimuzzaman, Md; Gilliard, Andrea; Ling, Kai-Shu",Virol J,335,20

However, even with this increased potence of fire, MM still remains an incurable condition, due to clonal selection and evolution of neoplastic clone. This concept underlines the importance of immunotherapy as one of the most relevant tools to try to eradicate the disease. In line with this concept, active and passive immunotherapies represent the most attractive approach to this aim. Antibody-drug conjugate(s) (ADCs) and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) include two innovative tools in order to limit neoplastic plasma cell growth or even, if used at the time of the best response, to potentially eradicate the tumoral clone. Following their promising results as single agent for advanced disease, at the recent 62nd ASH meeting, encouraging data of several combinations, particularly of ADC(s) with PI or IMiDs, have been reported, suggesting even better results for patients treated earlier.

A qualitative study of COVID-19 symptom recognition and attitudes towards testing in the UK,17.143898,5.5752416,2021-06-02,"Background The reported crude case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 varies considerably across countries. Crude CFRs could by biased by larger proportions of older COVID-19 cases in population data, who are also at increased mortality risk. Such distorted age case structures are a common feature of selective COVID 19 testing strategies in many countries, and they potentially mask underlying differences arising from other important factors such as health system burden. Methods We used the method of direct case-age standardisation to evaluate the effects of age variations on CFRs. Data on cases and death by age from Italy, Spain, China, Australia and South Korea were analysed to derive standardised CFRs. Findings were compared across different case age distribution references as standards. Results Using the South Korean case age distribution as a standard, the fivefold higher crude CFR for Italy is reduced to less than two-fold after adjustment, while the crude CFR difference for Spain is virtually eliminated. The adjusted CFR for Australia is the lowest among all countries. Discussion Mortality differences based on crude CFRs are exaggerated by age structures, which are effectively controlled by case age standardization. Residual CFR differences could be attributed to health and health system factors. The South Korean case age distribution is an appropriate reference standard, given its robust case detection and contact tracing program. Till reliable population level indicators of incidence and mortality are available, the age-standardized CFR could be a viable option for international comparison of the impact of the COVID 19 epidemic.","Rao, Chalapati; Doi, Suhail; Williams, Gail",,335,33

While the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 resolve their infection with few complications, some individuals experience prolonged symptoms lasting for weeks after initial diagnosis. Persistent viral infections are commonly accompanied by immunologic dysregulation, but it is unclear if persistent COVID-19 impacts the development of virus-specific cellular immunity. To this end, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity in convalescent COVID-19 patients who experienced eight days or fewer of COVID-19 symptoms or symptoms persisting for 18 days or more. We observed that persistent COVID-19 symptoms were not associated with the development of an overtly dysregulated cellular immune response. Furthermore, we observed that reactivity against the N protein from SARS-CoV-2 correlates with the amount of reactivity against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. These results provide insight into the processes that regulate the development of cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and related human coronaviruses.","Fang, Hengsheng; Wegman, Adam D.; Ripich, Kianna; Friberg, Heather; Currier, Jeffrey R.; Thomas, Stephen J.; Endy, Timothy P.; Waickman, Adam T.",Viruses,335,33

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We categorized 81 eligible patients into bacterial infection, viral infection, coinfection, and non-infectious groups. The respiratory virus examination was determined by a liquid bead array xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel in pharyngeal swabs, while bacterial infection was studied by conventional sputum culture. LOS and CAT as well as demographic information were recorded. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 38 subjects, bacteria in 17, and of these, seven had both. Influenza virus was the most frequently isolated virus, followed by enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4, and respiratory syncytial virus. Bacteriologic analyses of sputum showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacteria, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The longest LOS and the highest CAT score were detected in coinfection group. CAT score was positively correlated with LOS. CONCLUSION: Respiratory infection is a common causative agent of exacerbations in COPD. Respiratory coinfection is likely to be a determinant of more severe acute exacerbations with longer LOS. CAT score may be a predictor of longer LOS in AECOPD.","Dai, Meng-Yuan; Qiao, Jin-Ping; Xu, Yuan-Hong; Fei, Guang-He",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,335,16

The aim of this study is to assess lung perfusion changes with sCTA seen in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate them with clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out with 45 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients that required hospitalization at three different hospitals, between April and May 2020. In all cases, a basic clinical and demographic profile was obtained. Lung perfusion was assessed using sCTA. Evaluated imaging features included: Pattern predominance of injured lung parenchyma in both lungs (ground-glass opacities, consolidation and mixed pattern) and anatomical extension; predominant type of perfusion abnormality (increased perfusion or hypoperfusion), perfusion abnormality distribution (focal or diffuse), extension of perfusion abnormalities (mild, moderate and severe involvement); presence of vascular dilatation and vascular tortuosity. All participants were followed-up until hospital discharge searching for the development of any of the study endpoints. These endpoints included intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (55.2 ± 16.5 years, 22 men) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and an interpretable iodine map were included. Patients with perfusion anomalies on sCTA in morphologically normal lung parenchyma showed lower Pa/Fi values (294 ± 111.3 vs. 397 ± 37.7, p = 0.035), and higher D-dimer levels (1156 ± 1018 vs. 378 ± 60.2, p < 0.01). The main common patterns seen in lung CT scans were ground-glass opacities, mixed pattern with predominant ground-glass opacities and mixed pattern with predominant consolidation in 56.1%, 24.4% and 19.5% respectively. Perfusion abnormalities were common (36 patients, 87.8%), mainly hypoperfusion in areas of apparently healthy lung. Patients with severe hypoperfusion in areas of apparently healthy lung parenchyma had an increased probability of being admitted to ICU and to initiate IMV (HR of 11.9 (95% CI 1.55–91.9) and HR 7.8 (95% CI 1.05–61.1), respectively). CONCLUSION: Perfusion abnormalities evidenced in iodine maps obtained by sCTA are associated with increased admission to ICU and initiation of IMV in COVID-19 patients.

To test the hypothesis that the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit the perforin expression, we determined the kinetics of immune responses of CD8+ T cells to low dose (LD) or high dose (HD) of S1 stimulation through an in vitro dendritic cell (DC)-T cell model over seven days of incubation. The cytotoxic activity and intracellular perforin expression of CD8+ T cells induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were aberrantly lower than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day three of incubation. Discrepantly, the levels of lymphoproliferation and cytokine (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α) production induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were significantly higher than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day four. The dose-related responses between doses of S1 and intracellular perforin expression showed a significant linear correlation with a negative slope. In conclusion, the S1 subunit may suppress the perforin expression in CD8+ T cells to decrease the cytotoxic capacity to kill spike-presenting cells in a dose-dependent manner; the persistence of antigen presentation may result in an overproduction of interferon-γ and subsequent proinflammatory cytokines. That may help explain the insufficient cytotoxicity against high quantities of viruses or highly replicated strains of SARS-CoV-2 in severe cases of COVID-19.","Huang, Chun-Fu; Hsieh, Szu-Min; Pan, Sung-Ching; Huang, Yu-Shang; Chang, Shan-Chwen",Microorganisms,335,29

A significant number of elderly and frail people and those with underlying serious illness will continue to develop severe forms of the COVID-19 infection. Most of them are not eligible for intensive care treatment but can still expect palliative care — in many cases provided by a Hospital Palliative Care Team (HPCT). Several teams have already gained experience in caring for these patients and their families, others are preparing for it. METHOD: We report on a COVID-19 patient with pre-existing acute myeloid leukemia who was looked after by a HPCT until death. We discuss the challenges and difficulties while caring for COVID-19-positive palliative patients in a non-ICU setting. RESULTS: Hospitalization of the patient in an isolation ward caused an enormous burden for the dying patient and his family. Symptom control was particularly difficult because of rapid deteriorating dyspnea and the scarce presence of medical staff in the patient's room. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for ICU treatment may have a particularly high need for palliative care. Since beds in specialist palliative care units are limited, the HPCT should be prepared to care for these patients. They may offer support in decision-making, optimize symptom control, and provide psychosocial care for patients and their families. Visiting restrictions aimed to protect the general public must be weighted against the patient's and family's suffering.","Anneser, Johanna",Palliative & supportive care,335,1

In the field of sleep-disordered breathing, the novel eHealth methods already do offer smart solutions for currently insufficiently addressed problems. RECENT FINDINGS: In general, the potential of telemedicine tools can be focused on three basic aspects: interaction between clinicians, interaction between clinician and patient, and interaction between patient and the mobile health technology. The pandemic situation resulted in a rapid development of reimbursement for telehealth services. In recent years, evidence on the positive benefits of using telemedicine-based support as part of respiratory therapy follow-up is increasing. It is important to consider patient groups, telemedicine methodology, type of intervention, and targeting criteria in all studies conducted. SUMMARY: Given the scarcity of resources for leading common diseases, we must keep an eye on the new digitization concepts in respiratory medicine care. It must be implemented precisely, cost-effectively, and also more connecting between sectors and disciplines and at eye level with our patients. By means of patient engagement systems, an important part of modern precision medicine can be established. Digital support systems are valuable for supporting medical staff.

Data were grouped into weeks in 3 study periods: prepandemic (January 1, 2018–January 27, 2020), peripandemic (January 28, 2020–March 10, 2020), and early pandemic (March 11, 2020–April 30, 2020). These periods were compared with the same time intervals in the 2 preceding calendar years. Primary outcomes were number of ED visits per week. The secondary outcomes were triage acuity, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, length of hospital stay, ED revisits, and visits for trauma and mental health concerns. RESULTS: There were 577,807 ED visits (median age, 4.5 years; 52.9% male). Relative to the prepandemic period, there was a reduction [−58%; 95% confidence interval (CI), −63% to −51%] in the number of ED visits during the early-pandemic period, with concomitant higher acuity. There was a concurrent increase in the proportion of ward [odds ratio (OR), 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32–1.45] and intensive care unit (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.42) admissions, and trauma-related ED visits among children less than 10 years (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.45–1.56). Mental health–related visits in children declined in the early-pandemic period (in <10 years, −60%; 95% CI, −67% to −51%; in children ≥10 years: −56%; 95% CI, −63% to −47%) relative to the pre–COVID-19 period. There were no differences in mortality or length of stay; however, ED revisits within 72 hours were reduced during the early-pandemic period (percent change: −55%; 95% CI, −61% to −49%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, dramatic reductions in pediatric ED visits occurred across Canada. Children seeking ED care were sicker, and there was an increase in trauma-related visits among children more than 10 years of age, whereas mental health visits declined during the early-pandemic period. When faced with a future pandemic, public health officials must consider the impact of the illness and the measures implemented on children's health and acute care needs.","Finkelstein, Yaron; Maguire, Bryan; Zemek, Roger; Osmanlliu, Esli; Kam, April J.; Dixon, Andrew; Desai, Neil; Sawyer, Scott; Emsley, Jason; Lynch, Tim; Mater, Ahmed; Schuh, Suzanne; Rumantir, Maggie; Freedman, Stephen B.",Pediatr Emerg Care,335,26

Here, we demonstrate the utility of volumetric three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging using tissue optical clearing and light sheet microscopy to investigate host-pathogen interactions of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets at a mesoscopic scale. The superior spatial context of large, intact samples (> 150 mm3) allowed detailed quantification of interrelated parameters like focus-to-focus distance or SARS-CoV-2-infected area, facilitating an in-depth description of SARS-CoV-2 infection foci. Accordingly, we could confirm a preferential infection of the ferret upper respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 and emphasize a distinct focal infection pattern in nasal turbinates.

The lipid pathophysiology in COVID-19 is unknown. Methods In this retrospective longitudinal study, we monitored the serum lipids in 17 surviving and 4 non-surviving COVID-19 cases prior to their viral infections and duration the entire disease courses. Results In surviving cases, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels decreased significantly on admission as compared with the levels before infection; the LDL levels remained constantly low during the disease progression and resumed to the original levels when patients recovered (pre-infection: 3.5 (3.0–4.4); on admission: 2.8 (2.3–3.1), p < .01; progression: 2.5 (2.3–3.0); discharge: 3.6 (2.7–4.1); median (IQR), in mmol/L). In non-surviving patients, LDL levels showed an irreversible and continuous decrease until death (1.1 (0.9–1.2), p = .02 versus the levels on admission). The ratio changes of LDL levels inversely correlated with ratio changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Logistic regression analysis showed increasing odds of lowered LDL levels associated with disease progression (odds ratio: 4.48, 95% IC: 1.55–12.92, p = .006) and in-hospital death (odds ratio: 21.72, 95% IC: 1.40–337.54, p = .028). Conclusions LDL levels inversely correlated to disease severities, which could be a predictor for disease progress and poor prognosis.","Fan, Junli; Wang, Hui; Ye, Guangming; Cao, Xiaoling; Xu, Xianqun; Tan, Wenbin; Zhang, Yongxi",Metabolism,335,24

However, concerns about the risk of expedited science have been raised. We aimed at reviewing and categorizing COVID-19-related medical research and to critically appraise peer-reviewed original articles. METHODS: The data sources were Pubmed, Cochrane COVID-19 register study, arXiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv, from 01/11/2019 to 01/05/2020. Peer-reviewed and preprints publications related to COVID-19 were included, written in English or Chinese. No limitations were placed on study design. Reviewers screened and categorized studies according to i) publication type, ii) country of publication, and iii) topics covered. Original articles were critically appraised using validated quality assessment tools. RESULTS: Among the 11,452 publications identified, 10,516 met the inclusion criteria, among which 7468 (71.0%) were peer-reviewed articles. Among these, 4190 publications (56.1%) did not include any data or analytics (comprising expert opinion pieces). Overall, the most represented topics were infectious disease (n = 2326, 22.1%), epidemiology (n = 1802, 17.1%), and global health (n = 1602, 15.2%). The top five publishing countries were China (25.8%), United States (22.3%), United Kingdom (8.8%), Italy (8.1%) and India (3.4%). The dynamic of publication showed that the exponential growth of COVID-19 peer-reviewed articles was mainly driven by publications without original data (mean 261.5 articles ± 51.1 per week) as compared with original articles (mean of 69.3 ± 22.3 articles per week). Original articles including patient data accounted for 713 (9.5%) of peer-reviewed studies. A total of 576 original articles (80.8%) showed intermediate to high risk of bias. Last, except for simulation studies that mainly used large-scale open data, the median number of patients enrolled was of 102 (IQR = 37–337). CONCLUSIONS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of research is composed by publications without original data. Peer-reviewed original articles with data showed a high risk of bias and included a limited number of patients. Together, these findings underscore the urgent need to strike a balance between the velocity and quality of research, and to cautiously consider medical information and clinical applicability in a pressing, pandemic context.

In particular, vaccinations have contributed to this development. In recent years newly occurring bacterial infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens and viral infections, such as the chikungunya virus, influenza epidemics and currently the COVID-19 pandemic, are endangering the world population. This specifically affects patients with rheumatological diseases, who often require immunosuppressive therapy and are thus at risk for infections. Vaccinations can protect those affected, both individually and by generating herd immunity, and are thus an important instrument to reduce morbidity and mortality from infections.

This revealed severely condensed, almost airless, firm lungs, and the cause of death was severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 was detected with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in cerebrospinal fluid, lung tissue, and tracheal sample and specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Subsequent sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus showed variation in nucleotides at 3 sites between SARS-CoV-2 isolates recovered from the tracheal sample, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissues from both lungs, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the spinal fluid sample differed the most from the other 3 samples.

Firstly rGO FET functionalized with SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Then the rGO FET characteristic response is observed to detect the antibody-antigen reaction of SARS-CoV-2 with different molar ranges. The developed GFET shows better performance towards the drain current and limit-of-detection (LoD) up to 2E-18 M.

Available evidence suggests it has therapeutic and predictive value in the management of adhesional small bowel obstruction (ASBO). Thus, we investigated the use of GGF amongst patients who had a small bowel obstruction and audited the practice in University Hospital, Ayr. Methods Initial retrospective data of patients who had gastrografin for small bowel obstruction were extracted from April 2015 to August 2019 and analysed. After our local presentation and on implementing a GGF protocol, we prospectively collected data from February to June 2020 to close our audit. Results GGF showed a comparable therapeutic effect on ASBO in both audit cycles (72.2%-66.7%). Approximately 50% of unresolved cases were operated within 24 hours of GGF administration in both cycles. GGF consistently demonstrated a therapeutic benefit in refractory faecal impaction (100% in both cycles) and postoperative ileus (≥ 80%). Early use of computed tomography (CT) (less than 24 hrs) did not confer any added advantage (82.5% v 61.5%), however, it helped in making an appropriate diagnosis and the subsequent early gastrografin usage (78.3% v 92.3%) in ASBO. Conclusion GGF serves a very good therapeutic purpose in resolving ASBO, refractory constipation, and in rare non-resolving cases of postoperative ileus. Early CT diagnosis of ASBO is advocated before the administration of gastrografin. Unsuccessful resolution after 24 hrs of GGF is an indication for operative intervention.","Almafreji, Ibrahim; Chinaka, Ugochukwu; Hussain, Amir; Lynch, Mark; Cottrell, Richard",Cureus,335,24

Therefore, it is potentially one of the most important vehicles for promoting peace among the peoples of the world. Although previous South Korean governments have historically proposed a variety of actions to contribute to peace on the Korean Peninsula, there has been little success. However, the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, the hallmark of the Sunshine Policy of former president of South Korea, Dae Jung Kim, is different from previous tourism initiatives as it has had more tangible and practical outcomes that have contributed to the promotion of peace on the divided Peninsula. To this end, the South Korean government has applied the insights of neofunctionalism to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. This is an approach to integration theory from the perspective of liberalism that has been heralded in international politics. According to this approach, it is expected that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development can be used as a tool to maintain peaceful circumstances, which results in spill-over effects, enlargement of activity scopes, and a heightened level of commitment on the Korean Peninsula. The purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. To test this hypothesis, this study proposes a Peace Index and investigates the spill-over effects by utilizing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development as a test case. The results of this study indicate that the view that tourism contributes to peace is valid but tenuous since the impact of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development in the promotion of peace was less significant than expected. Consequently, the results of this study also indicate that neofunctionalism, which has been developed for western political systems, needs to be re-examined when applied to the unique, dynamic, and complex political circumstances on the Korean Peninsula.","Cho, Minho",Tour Manag,335,29

METHODS: The clinical and CT data of 16 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Dynamic CTs were performed continuously after admission. RESULTS: Of the patients, 14 were moderate cases, and 2 were severe. Twelve patients underwent CT at the early onset stage. Single nodules or ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were found in 2 patients and multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions in 8 (consolidation-like opacities with or without small nodules in five and large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in three). Ten had lesion growth and enlargement on the second CT. Fourteen patients underwent CT during the progressive stage, which revealed GGOs and focal consolidation in 6 of them, lung consolidation opacities in 5, and simple, large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in 3. In both severe cases, the lesions continued to enlarge and grow, and the extent of consolidation continued to expand. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chest CT can clearly reflect the morphology, density, and extent of COVID-19 nodules, and is beneficial for observing dynamic nodule changes and disease screening and monitoring.","Zhao, Yue; Wang, Yue; Duan, Wenshuai; Du, Wei; Wu, Xinhua; Yang, Bin",Radiol Infect Dis,335,11

We compared the extent of oxidative injury in MS lesions with that in experimental models driven by different inflammatory mechanisms. It was only in a model of coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis that we detected an accumulation of oxidised phospholipids, which was comparable in extent to that in MS. In both, MS and coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis, this was associated with massive microglial and macrophage activation, accompanied by the expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox but only sparse expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Acute and chronic CD4(+) T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions showed transient expression of p22phox and iNOS associated with inflammation. Macrophages in chronic lesions of antibody-mediated demyelinating encephalomyelitis showed lysosomal activity but very little p22phox or iNOS expressions. Active inflammatory demyelinating lesions induced by CD8(+) T cells or by innate immunity showed macrophage and microglial activation together with the expression of p22phox, but low or absent iNOS reactivity. We corroborated the differences between acute CD4(+) T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and acute MS lesions via gene expression studies. Furthermore, age-dependent iron accumulation and lesion-associated iron liberation, as occurring in the human brain, were only minor in rodent brains. Our study shows that oxidative injury and its triggering mechanisms diverge in different models of rodent central nervous system inflammation. The amplification of oxidative injury, which has been suggested in MS, is only reflected to a limited degree in the studied rodent models.

Interactions between allergy-related inflammatory and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been documented. Therefore, those who have pre-existing allergic conditions may have an increased psychiatric reaction to the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), respectively in allergic patients. Results A total of 4,106 surveys were evaluated; 1,656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2,450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI .99 - 1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = -8.76. The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = -7.774). The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = -1.539. There was no significant difference on intrusion (p=0.061, z=-1.873) and avoidance (p=0.767, z=-0.297), but in the hyperarousal subscale, patients with respiratory allergy had higher scores (mean 1.15 vs. 0.99) p = 0.013 z = -2.486.

METHODS: This is a retrospective single center study for patients who were admitted with COVID‐19 infection. Data collection was from March 1 through April 24,2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were presented using descriptive statistics and frequencies. Chi‐square test and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine association of risk factors and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 242 inpatients were included with a mean age of 66 ±14.75 (±SD). 50% were female and 70% were African American. Comorbidities included hypertension (74%), diabetes mellitus (49%), and 19% had either COPD or asthma. Older age was associated with higher risk of inpatient death OR 1.056 [95% CI 1.023 to 1.090; p=0.001].

Acyclic PIs asunaprevir and faldaprevir had EC(50)s of 72 and 23 μM, respectively. ACH-806, inhibiting the HCV NS4A protease cofactor, had an EC(50) of 46 μM. Similar and slightly increased PI potencies were found in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells and human lung carcinoma A549-hACE2 cells, respectively. Selectivity indexes based on antiviral and cell viability assays were highest for linear PIs. In short-term treatments, combination of macrocyclic but not linear PIs with remdesivir showed synergism in Vero E6 and A549-hACE2 cells. Longer-term treatment of infected Vero E6 and A549-hACE2 cells with 1-fold EC(50) PI revealed minor differences in the barrier to SARS-CoV-2 escape. Viral suppression was achieved with 3- to 8-fold EC(50) boceprevir or 1-fold EC(50) simeprevir or grazoprevir, but not boceprevir, in combination with 0.4- to 0.8-fold EC(50) remdesivir; these concentrations did not lead to viral suppression in single treatments. This study could inform the development and application of protease inhibitors for optimized antiviral treatments of COVID-19.","Gammeltoft, Karen A.; Zhou, Yuyong; Duarte Hernandez, Carlos R.; Galli, Andrea; Offersgaard, Anna; Costa, Rui; Pham, Long V.; Fahnøe, Ulrik; Feng, Shan; Scheel, Troels K.

Recently, coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and the second wave is rebounding strongly now with the coming winter that has a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. To make pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 as soon as possible, and reduce the work pressure of medical staff, making use of deep learning networks to detect positive CXR images of infected patients is a critical step. However, there are complex edge structures and rich texture details in the CXR images susceptible to noise that can interfere with the diagnosis of the machines and the doctors. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel multi-resolution parallel residual CNN (named MPR-CNN) for CXR images denoising and special application for COVID-19 which can improve the image quality. The core of MPR-CNN consists of several essential modules. (a) Multi-resolution parallel convolution streams are utilized for extracting more reliable spatial and semantic information in multi-scale features. (b) Efficient channel and spatial attention can let the network focus more on texture details in CXR images with fewer parameters. (c) The adaptive multi-resolution feature fusion method based on attention is utilized to improve the expression of the network. On the whole, MPR-CNN can simultaneously retain spatial information in the shallow layers with high resolution and semantic information in the deep layers with low resolution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MPR-CNN can better retain the texture structure details in CXR images. Additionally, extensive experiments show that our MPR-CNN has a positive impact on CXR images classification and detection of COVID-19 cases from denoised CXR images.","Jiang, Xiaoben; Zhu, Yu; Zheng, Bingbing; Yang, Dawei",Mach Vis Appl,335,26

AREAS COVERED: Data from observational studies suggest similar incidence attacks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people living with HIV (PLWH) and HIV-uninfected populations. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is similar in both populations too. The authors discuss the role of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in preventing infection or reducing COVID-19 severity. They also discuss the pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 in PLWH. EXPERT OPINION: Management of COVID-19 in PLWH is no different from the general population. It should be based on careful supportive care, emphasizing lung-protective ventilation, and wise pharmacological interventions. The antiviral drug remdesivir and dexamethasone are the only pharmacological interventions with clinical benefit for COVID-19, whereas anticoagulation may prevent thrombotic complications. The experience with using these drugs in PLWH is limited, which prevents from rendering well-founded conclusions. Until more data on COVID-19 in PLWH become available, the best weapons within our reach are sound supportive care and sensible use of RDV and dexamethasone, bearing in mind the potential for drug–drug interactions of most corticosteroids and antiretroviral drugs.","Gutierrez, María Del Mar; Mur, Isabel; Mateo, María Gracia; Vidal, Francesc; Domingo, Pere",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,335,1

We investigated whether the two families represent the tip of the iceberg of a subset of COVID-19 male patients. METHODS: This is a nested case-control study in which we compared male participants with extreme phenotype selected from the Italian GEN-COVID cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected participants (<60 y, 79 severe cases versus 77 control cases). We applied the LASSO Logistic Regression analysis, considering only rare variants on young male subsets with extreme phenotype, picking up TLR7 as the most important susceptibility gene. RESULTS: Overall, we found TLR7 deleterious variants in 2.1% of severely affected males and in none of the asymptomatic participants. The functional gene expression profile analysis demonstrated a reduction in TLR7-related gene expression in patients compared with controls demonstrating an impairment in type I and II IFN responses. CONCLUSIONS: Young males with TLR7 loss-of-function variants and severe COVID-19 represent a subset of male patients contributing to disease susceptibility in up to 2% of severe COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes various structural and non-structural proteins, which are necessary for viral entry and replication. Among these proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, a serine protease, and spike protein are potential targets of herbal remedies and phytocompounds for inhibition of viral infection and replication. There is at present no confirmed cure for the COVID-19. Various plants and their components have been introduced against SARS-Co-2. A number of review articles have also been published on them. This article is focusing on the mechanistic aspects of these plants and their derivatives on SARS-CV-2. METHOD: The material in this review article was prepared from significant scientific databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Different medicinal plants and their phytocompounds interact with important structural and non-structural of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Natural compounds form strong bonds with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 protease and make large conformational changes. These phytochemicals are potential inhibitors of structural and non-structural of SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Spike protein, PLpro, and 3CLpro. Some important anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions of medicinal plants and their metabolites are inhibition of the virus replication or entry, blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and ""Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)"" regulation of inflammatory mediators, inhibition of endothelial activation, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Some of these important natural immune boosters that are helpful for prevention and curing various symptoms related to COVID-19 include Allium sativum, Nigella sativa, Glycyrrhiza glabra Zingiber officinalis, Ocimum sanctum, Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, and Scutellaria baicalensis. Also, Kaempferol, Quercetin, Baicalin, Scutellarin, Glycyrrhizin, Curcumin, Apigenin, Ursolic acid, and Chloroquine are the best candidates for treating the symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Medicinal plants and/or their bioactive compounds with inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 support the human immune system and help in fighting against COVID-19 and rejuvenating the immune system.","Malekmohammad, Khojasteh; Rafieian-Kopaei, Mahmoud",Curr. pharm. des,335,22

There are no effective pharmacologic therapies for ARDS. Colchicine is a low-cost, widely available drug, effective in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. We studied the effects of colchicine pre-treatment on oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats. Rats were treated with colchicine (1 mg/kg) or placebo for three days prior to intravenous oleic acid-induced ALI (150 mg/kg). Four hours later they were studied and compared to a sham group. Colchicine reduced the area of histological lung injury by 61%, reduced lung edema, and markedly improved oxygenation by increasing PaO(2)/FiO(2) from 66 ± 13 mmHg (mean ± SEM) to 246 ± 45 mmHg compared to 380 ± 18 mmHg in sham animals. Colchicine also reduced PaCO(2) and respiratory acidosis. Lung neutrophil recruitment, assessed by myeloperoxidase immunostaining, was greatly increased after injury from 1.16 ± 0.19% to 8.86 ± 0.66% and significantly reduced by colchicine to 5.95 ± 1.13%. Increased lung NETosis was also reduced by therapy. Circulating leukocytosis after ALI was not reduced by colchicine therapy, but neutrophils reactivity and CD4 and CD8 cell surface expression on lymphocyte populations were restored. Colchicine reduces ALI and respiratory failure in experimental ARDS in relation with reduced lung neutrophil recruitment and reduced circulating leukocyte activation. This study supports the clinical development of colchicine for the prevention of ARDS in conditions causing ALI.","Dupuis, Jocelyn; Sirois, Martin G.; Rhéaume, Eric; Nguyen, Quang T.; Clavet-Lanthier, Marie-Élaine; Brand, Genevieve; Mihalache-Avram, Teodora; Théberge-Julien, Gabriel; Charpentier, Daniel; Rhainds, David; Neagoe, Paul-Eduard; Tardif, Jean-Claude",PLoS One,335,16

In our sample of 45 NTG patients, mean intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased from 13.7 to 12.3 mmHg at 2.5 years, and mean medication burden decreased from 2.0 to 1.1 at 1.5 years. For success defined as IOP reduction ≥ 30% from baseline IOP with medication burden reduction from preoperative levels, success probability was 5.4% at 1.5 years. For success defined as medication burden reduction with an IOP reaching goal IOP as determined by the glaucoma specialist, success probabilities were 67.2% at 1.5 years and 29.4% at 2.5 years. At the last follow-up visit, eyes with two MIGS procedures with different mechanisms of action achieved successful medication reduction 68.8% of the time versus 35.7% achieved by a single MIGS procedure (p = 0.052). At their last visit, visual acuity was unchanged or improved in all eyes (100%). MIGS with cataract surgery results in modest reductions in IOP and medication burden in NTG patients, which may lead to lower costs and better therapeutic compliance. A combination of two MIGS procedures with different mechanisms of action may potentially be more effective in reducing medication burden than a single MIGS procedure in NTG patients. Further research is necessary to ascertain whether MIGS for NTG patients may help decrease medication burden while helping achieve goal IOP.","Chang, Enchi Kristina; Gupta, Sanchay; Chachanidze, Marika; Hall, Nathan; Chang, Ta Chen; Solá-Del Valle, David",Sci Rep,335,33

METHODS: Patients with pathological stage II-IIIB (except T1) gastric cancer receiving adjuvant UFT or S-1 monotherapy after D2 gastrectomy were included. Usage of UFT or S-1 was based on reimbursement policy of the Taiwanese healthcare system. The characteristics, chemotherapy completion rates, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2016, 86 eligible patients were included.

This approach has the potential to protect the most vulnerable from disease and provide society an incalculable economic benefit. Allo-priming healthy elderly adults is proposed to provide universal protection from progression of any type of viral infection, including protection against progression of the current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, and any future variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus or the next ‘Disease X’. Allo-priming is an alternative approach for the COVID-19 pandemic that provides a back-up in case vaccination strategies to elicit neutralizing antibody protection fails or fails to protect the vulnerable elderly population. The allo-priming is performed using activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo differentiated and expanded living Th1-like cells (AlloStim(®)) derived from healthy donors currently in clinical use as an experimental cancer vaccine. Multiple intradermal injections of AlloStim(®) creates a dominate titer of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells in circulation, replacing the dominance of exhausted memory cells of the aged immune system. Upon viral encounter, by-stander activation of the allo-specific memory cells causes an immediate release of IFN-ϒ, leading to development of an “anti-viral state”, by-stander activation of innate cellular effector cells and activation of cross-reactive allo-specific CTL. In this manner, the non-specific activation of allo-specific Th1/CTL initiates a cascade of spatial and temporal immune events which act to limit the early viral titer. The release of endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP) and DAMP from lysed viral-infected cells, in the context of IFN-ϒ, creates of conditions for in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL immunity. These viral-specific Th1/CTL provide sterilizing immunity and memory for protection from disease recurrence, while increasing the pool of Th1/CTL in circulation capable of responding to the next viral encounter. CONCLUSION: Allo-priming has potential to provide universal protection from viral disease and is a strategy to reverse immunosenescence and counter-regulate chronic inflammation (inflammaging). Allo-priming can be used as an adjuvant for anti-viral vaccines and as a counter-measure for unknown biological threats and bio-economic terrorism.","Har-Noy, Michael; Or, Reuven",J Transl Med,335,23

Therefore, health authorities further recommend screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed or high-risk HWs. Nevertheless, to date, the best/optimal method to screen HWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under debate, and data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs are still scarce. The present study aims to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate amongst HWs in a teaching hospital in Central Italy and the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology (index test) in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR assay (reference standard). (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study on the retrospective data of HWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and by an IgM/IgG serology assay on venous blood samples, irrespective of exposure and/or symptoms, was carried out. (3) Results: A total of 2057 HWs (median age 46, 19–69 years, females 60.2%) were assessed by the RNA RT-PCR assay and 58 (2.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with negative HWs, SARS-CoV-2-positives were younger (mean age 41.7 versus 45.2, p < 0.01; 50% versus 31% under or equal to 40 years old, p < 0.002) and had a shorter duration of employment (64 versus 125 months, p = 0.02). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in positive HWs than in negatives (55.2% versus 27.5%, p < 0.0001). In 44.8% of positive HWs, no exposure was traced. None of the positive HWs had a fatal outcome, none of them had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only one required hospitalization for mild/moderate pneumonia. In 1084 (51.2%) HWs, nasopharyngeal swabs and an IgM/IgG serology assay were performed. With regard to IgM serology, sensitivity was 0% at a specificity of 98.99% (positive predictive value, PPV 0%, negative predictive value, NPV 99.2%). Concerning IgG serology and irrespective of the time interval between nasopharyngeal swab and serology, sensitivity was 50% at a specificity of 99.1% (PPV 28.6%, NPV 99.6%). IgG serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive at the RNA RT-PCR assay by a nasopharyngeal swab. (4) Conclusions: Our experience in Central Italy demonstrated a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HWs, but higher than in the general population. Nearly half of the positive HWs reported no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy implemented. IgG serology seems useful when performed at least two weeks after an RNA RT-PCR assay. IgM serology does not seem to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Resilin is a native elastic insect protein, which features intrinsically disordered structure, unusual multi-stimuli responsiveness and outstanding resilience. Advances in computational techniques, polypeptide synthesis methods and modular protein engineering routines have led to the development of novel resilin-like polypeptides (RLPs) including modular RLPs, expanding their applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, bioimaging, biosensors, catalysis and bioelectronics. However, how the responsive behaviour of RLPs is encoded in the amino acid sequence level remains elusive. This review summarises the milestones of RLPs, and discusses the development of modular RLP-based biomaterials, their current applications, challenges and future perspectives. A perspective of future research is that sequence and responsiveness profiling of RLPs can provide a new platform for the design and development of new modular RLP-based biomaterials with programmable structure, properties and functions.","Balu, Rajkamal; Dutta, Naba K.; Dutta, Ankit K.; Choudhury, Namita Roy",Nat Commun,335,24

However, the promotion of LH for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 remains controversial. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Lianhuaqingwen (LH) in treating patients with COVID-19 by a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted the literature search using six electronic databases from December 1, 2019, to June 2, 2020. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool has been used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale has been used to assess the quality of case control studies. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist has been used to assess the quality of case series. All analyses were conducted by RevMan 5.3. For outcomes that could not be meta-analyzed were performed a descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Eight studies with 924 patients were included. Three studies are RCTs, three are case control studies, and two are case series. The quality of the included studies was poor. Compared with patients treated by conventional treatment, patients treated by LH combined with conventional treatment have a higher overall effective rate (RR = 1.16, 95%CIs: 1.04∼1.30, P = 0.01) and CT recovery rate (RR=1.21, 95%CIs: 1.02∼1.43, P = 0.03). Patients of LH groups have a lower incidence of diarrhea (5.6% vs.13.4%), and have statistically significant (P = 0.026). But the rate of abnormal liver function in the combined medication group is higher than that in the single LH group. CONCLUSION: LH combined with conventional treatment seems to be more effective for patients with mild or ordinary COVID-19.","Liu, Ming; Ya, Gao; Yuan, Yuan; Yang, Kelu; Shi, Shuzhen; Tian, Jinhui; Zhang, Junhua",Integr Med Res,335,16

A multivariate logistic regression analysis of symptoms of COVID-19 at presentation,17.139929,5.3672385,2021,"Over the two last decades, coronaviruses have affected human life in different ways, especially in terms of health and economy. Due to the profound effects of novel coronaviruses, growing tides of research are emerging in various research fields. This paper employs a co-word analysis approach to map the intellectual structure of the coronavirus literature for a better understanding of how coronavirus research and the disease itself have developed during the target timeframe. A strategic diagram has been drawn to depict the coronavirus domain’s structure and development. A detailed picture of coronavirus literature has been extracted from a huge number of papers to provide a quick overview of the coronavirus literature. The main themes of past coronavirus-related publications are (a) “Antibody-Virus Interactions,” (b) “Emerging Infectious Diseases,” (c) “Protein Structure-based Drug Design and Antiviral Drug Discovery,” (d) “Coronavirus Detection Methods,” (e) “Viral Pathogenesis and Immunity,” and (f) “Animal Coronaviruses.” The emerging infectious diseases are mostly related to fatal diseases (such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19) and animal coronaviruses (including porcine, turkey, feline, canine, equine, and bovine coronaviruses and infectious bronchitis virus), which are capable of placing animal-dependent industries such as the swine and poultry industries under strong economic pressure. Although considerable research into coronavirus has been done, this unique field has not yet matured sufficiently. Therefore, “Antibody-virus Interactions,” “Emerging Infectious Diseases,” and “Coronavirus Detection Methods” hold interesting, promising research gaps to be both explored and filled in the future.","Pourhatami, Aliakbar; Kaviyani-Charati, Mohammad; Kargar, Bahareh; Baziyad, Hamed; Kargar, Maryam; Olmeda-Gómez, Carlos",Scientometrics,335,1

The mortality of GF is nearly 100% without an effective salvage method. A second transplantation is usually necessary to save the patient's life. However, there is no standardized regimen, and the outcome is usually disappointing. We report on a prospective single-center study using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with different haploidentical donors (HIDs). Patients with GF after the first transplantation were enrolled in a prospective single-arm clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.Gov ID: NCT03717545) at the Peking University Institute of Hematology. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)) (days−6 to−2) and cyclophosphamide (1,000 mg/m(2)/day) (days−5 to−4). Patients underwent a second transplant from a different HID using a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor primed bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells. The primary outcome was neutrophil engraftment at day 28. The secondary outcomes included platelet engraftment at day 100, transplant-related mortality (TRM) at day 30, TRM at day 100, and overall survival (OS) at 1 year. From March 2018 to June 2020, 13 patients were enrolled in this clinical trial. Of the 13 patients, five had acute myeloid leukemia, five had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, two had myelodysplastic syndromes, and one had a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The median age at first transplantation was 38 years (range, 8–55 years). As for the first transplantation, 11 patients underwent haploidentical transplantations and two underwent unrelated donor transplantations. At the time of GF, three patients had complete donor chimerism, five had mixed chimerism, and five had complete recipient chimerism. The median time from the first transplantation to the second transplantation was 49 (range 35–120) days. The medians of infused cell doses were as follows: mononuclear cells 7.93 (5.95–12.51) × 10(8)/kg and CD34 + cells 2.28 (0.75–5.57) × 10(6)/kg. All 13 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment after the second transplantation, with a median engraftment time of 11 (range 10–20) days after transplantation. The platelet engraftment rate on day 100 after transplantation was 76.9%. The TRMs at day 30, day 100, and 1-year were 0, 0, and 23.1%, respectively. The OS and disease-free survival at 1-year were 56.6 and 48.4%, respectively. For patients with GF after first transplantation, a second transplantation using a fludarabine/cyclophosphamide regimen from a different HID was a promising salvage option. Further investigation is needed to confirm the suitability of this method.","Sun, Yu-Qian; Wang, Yu; Wang, Feng-Rong; Yan, Chen-Hua; Cheng, Yi-Fei; Chen, Yu-Hong; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Han, Ting-Ting; Han, Wei; Suo, Pan; Xu, Lan-Ping; Zhang, Xiao-Hui; Liu, Kai-Yan; Huang, Xiao-Jun",Front Med (Lausanne),335,21

METHODS: We use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma. RESULTS: We identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of 1. We find that when the basic reproduction number is <1, no significant delays in disease control will be caused. However, when the basic reproduction number is >1, significant delays can occur. In most districts, 1 y of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease. CONCLUSIONS: If the pandemic can motivate judicious, community-specific implementation of control strategies, global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem could be accelerated.","Blumberg, Seth; Borlase, Anna; Prada, Joaquin M; Solomon, Anthony W; Emerson, Paul; Hooper, Pamela J; Deiner, Michael S; Amoah, Benjamin; Hollingsworth, Deirdre; Porco, Travis C; Lietman, Thomas M",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,335,16

SAMPLES AND METHODS: Serial HRCT scans in 39 patients with pneumonia complicating novel influenza A (H1N1) were reviewed for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities as well as distribution and extent of involvement. Longitudinal changes were assessed at different time points. RESULTS: In the early stage, the most common HRCT finding was patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) (n = 4, 54.7%). In the progressive stage, bilaterally distributed GGO mixed with consolidation was the most commonly observed feature (n = 28, 71.8%). The diffuse pattern deteriorated to a peak (n = 17, 43.6%) at this stage. In the convalescent stage, the most common finding was fibrosis (n = 25, 64.1%). Averagely, fibrosis was observed at d 18.5 ± 6.4 after the onset of symptoms. Three patterns of longitudinal changes of the lesions were observed, including: type 1, improvement after deterioration; type 2, concurrent improvement and deterioration followed by improvement; and type 3, gradual improvement. Type 1 was the more common pattern (n = 27, 69.2%). Complete serial HRCT scans from initial and final scan were obtained in 24 patients, and the mean CT score peaked at d 8–14 of the illness. CONCLUSION: HRCT may play a role in detecting and characterizing pulmonary lesions for the cases of pneumonia complicating influenza A. In addition, it may contribute to monitoring longitudinal changes of pneumonia and assessing therapeutic response.","Feng, Feng; Xia, Ganlin; Shi, Yuxin; Zhang, Zhiyong",Radiol Infect Dis,335,1

However, exuberant immune response with features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) lead detrimental consequences in COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-18 is one of the leading cytokines in MAS which has not been studied in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of IL-18 with the other inflammatory markers and disease severity in COVID-19 for predicting disease prognosis. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 who had confirmed diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR were enrolled into the study. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory values of CRP, ferritin, d-dimer and procalcitonin were measured on admission. Patients were followed up prospectively with a standardized approach until hospital discharge or death. Individuals were classified as asymptomatic, mild and severe pneumonia according to their clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Worse outcome was defined as requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Blood samples were collected at enrollment and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-18 were determined by ELISA. Association between IL-18 and other inflammatory markers and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 58 COVID-19 patients (50% male) with a median age of 43 (min 22-max 81) years. Twenty age and sex matched healthy subjects were served as control group. The study population was divided into three groups according to disease severity: asymptomatic (n = 20), mild pneumonia group (n = 27) and a severe group (n = 11). During follow up nine (15.5%) patients required ICU admission and three of them were died eventually. Serum IL-18 were correlated with other inflammatory markers and biochemical markers of organ injury; creatinine, liver enzymes and troponin. Serum IL-18 levels were remarkably higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects with being highest in severe pneumonia group (p < 0.001). IL-18 serum concentrations were almost four-fold higher in patients with worse outcome compared to good outcome (p < 0.001). Serum IL-18 above the cut off value of 576 pg/mL on admission was associated with 11.7 fold increased risk of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The serum concentrations of IL-18 correlate with other inflammatory markers and reflect disease severity. Results of the present study shed light on role of IL-18 on COVID-19 pathogenesis and might provide an evidence for the clinical trials on IL-18 antagonists for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","Satış, Hasan; Özger, Hasan Selçuk; Aysert Yıldız, Pınar; Hızel, Kenan; Gulbahar, Özlem; Erbaş, Gonca; Aygencel, Gülbin; Guzel Tunccan, Ozlem; Öztürk, Mehmet Akif; Dizbay, Murat; Tufan, Abdurrahman",Cytokine,335,24

In this study, the role of the plasma membrane cholesterol in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of MARC-145 cells was investigated. Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a drug used to deplete cholesterol from cellular membrane, significantly reduced PRRSV infection in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was partially reversed by supplementing exogenous cholesterol following MβCD treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of PRRSV infection was specifically mediated by removal of cellular cholesterol. Further detailed studies showed that depletion of cellular membrane cholesterol significantly inhibited virus entry, especially virus attachment and release. These results indicate that the presence of cholesterol in the cellular membrane is a key component of PRRSV infection.","Sun, Ying; Xiao, ShaoBo; Wang, Dang; Luo, Rui; Li, Bin; Chen, HuanChun; Fang, LiuRong",Sci China Life Sci,335,20

METHODS: The study recruited 200 volunteers aged 18 years or older of both sexes diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 200 volunteers initially selected, the 135 individuals who underwent serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on the first visit to the laboratory, were invited to return, after 90 days, and provide a new blood sample for a second assessment of the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Disease severity and longevity of symptoms were evaluated for each individual and associated with the serological profile. RESULTS: Among the 135 individuals who underwent a previous serological test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 125 showed reactivity to IgG (92.6%). Of the 125 individuals with detectable IgG in the first test, 87 (69.6%) showed persistence of this antibody after 90 days and 38 (30.4%) lost IgG reactivity in the second evaluation.

METHODS: Ninety patients were enrolled into the study: 56 had SARS‐CoV‐2 3–9 months prior to enrolment; 34 served as a clinically healthy control group. All patients underwent an mpUS evaluation of the liver (elastography, dispersion and attenuation imaging). Seventy‐six patients had abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) and noncontrast enhanced thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans performed at the same day. All patients were screened for biochemical markers of liver injury. RESULTS: Liver elasticity, viscosity, and steatosis values were significantly altered in patients after COVID‐19, with particularly higher fibrosis scores compared to the control group (P < .001). Increased biochemical markers of liver injury correlated with changes in mpUS (P < .05), but not with findings on CT or MR findings. Seventeen of 34 hospitalized patients had a moderate or severe course of the disease course with more pronounced changes in mpUS. Increased body mass index was found to influence liver injury and correlated with more severe forms of COVID‐19 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19 can cause liver injury observable using mpUS. More severe forms of COVID‐19 and patient obesity are related to increased values of liver damage observed. In comparison to MRI and CT, mpUS appears to be more sensitive to involvement of liver parenchyma. Further research is warranted to establish this promising method for evaluating post‐COVID‐19 liver involvement in the aftermath of the pandemic.","Radzina, Maija; Putrins, Davis Simanis; Micena, Arta; Vanaga, Ieva; Kolesova, Oksana; Platkajis, Ardis; Viksna, Ludmila",J Ultrasound Med,335,24

In the present paper we discuss four pillars to face a pandemic: surgical and outpatients service, tele-medicine and tele-education. In the face of unprecedented risks in providing adequate health care to our patients during this current, evolving public health crisis of COVID-19, alternative patient management tools such as telemedicine services, allow clinicians to maintain necessary patient rapport with their healthcare provider when required. As a subspecialty, urology should take full advantage of telehealth and teleeducation at this juncture. As tele-urology and tele-education can obviate the potential drawbacks of “social distancing” as it pertains to healthcare, the platform can also reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, without compromising quality urological care and educational efforts.

Greater than 92% homology was found among the six strains by pair-wise comparison at the nucleotide level. The genes encoded proteins of 451 to 455 residues and the deduced amino acid sequences were more than 91% homologous. A unique deletion of twelve nucleotides was found at the carboxy terminus of MHV-Y and a three nucleotide deletion was found in MHV-RI, which corresponded to the one previously reported in MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Two internal open reading frames were found within the coding region of the nucleoprotein, the smaller one was specific for the enterotropic strains. It could potentially encode a truncated version of the hypothetical protein described for MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Sequence relationship of the N gene showed no correlation with tissue tropism and no sequence or even single amino acid change unique to either tropism group was found.

METHODS: Between 18 January 2020 and 20 May 2020, 110 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 108 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were retrospectively recruited from three hospitals based on the inclusion criteria. Manual segmentation of pneumonia lesions on CT scans was performed by four radiologists. The latest version of Pyradiomics was used for feature extraction. Four classifiers (linear classifier, k-nearest neighbour, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], and random forest) were used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Comparison of the performance of the classifiers and radiologists was evaluated by ROC curve and Kappa score. RESULTS: We manually segmented 16,053 CT slices, comprising 32,625 pneumonia lesions, from the CT scans of all patients. Using Pyradiomics, 120 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The key radiomic features screened by different classifiers varied and lead to significant differences in classification accuracy. The LASSO achieved the best performance (sensitivity:72.2 %, specificity:75.1 %, and AUC:0.81) on the external validation dataset and attained excellent agreement (Kappa score:0.89) with radiologists (average sensitivity:75.6 %, specificity:78.2 %, and AUC:0.81). All classifiers indicated that ""Original_Firstorder_RootMeanSquared"" and ""Original_Firstorder_Uniformity"" were significant features for this task.

We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the “closed” prefusion S structure, but is accessible in “open” conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.","Joyce, M.
