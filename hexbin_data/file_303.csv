1508,Recombinant factor VIIa for uncontrollable bleeding in patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: report on 15 cases and literature review,2013-03-25,"INTRODUCTION: Bleeding is the most frequent complication in patients receiving venoarterial or venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been used in these patients with conflicting results. We describe our experience with rFVIIa for refractory bleeding in this setting and review the cases reported in the literature. METHODS: Clinical characteristics, demographics, bleeding, thrombotic complications, mortality, and rFVIIa administration were retrospectively collected for analysis from the electronic charts of the 15 patients in our intensive care unit who received rFVIIa while being given ECMO from January 2006 to March 2011. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received rFVIIa for persistent bleeding under venoarterial (n = 11) or venovenous (n = 4) ECMO. Bleeding dramatically decreased in 14 patients, without a major thrombotic event, except in one patient in whom a major stroke could not be ruled out. Two circuits were changed within the 48 hours after rFVIIa administration for clots in the membrane and decreased oxygenation but without massive clotting. The mortality rate was 60%. CONCLUSIONS: rFVIIa use for intractable hemorrhaging in patients receiving ECMO controlled bleeding, without major thrombotic events, and with 60% dying. Hence, its use warrants discussion, and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of potentially life-threatening systemic thrombosis, emboli, or circuit clotting. Whether rFVIIa can save the lives of such patients remains to be determined.","Repessé, Xavier; Au, Siu Ming; Bréchot, Nicolas; Trouillet, Jean-Louis; Leprince, Pascal; Chastre, Jean; Combes, Alain; Luyt, Charles-Edouard",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057417/,303

10334,Avian Influenza A Viruses: Evolution and Zoonotic Infection,2016-08-11,"Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses of the Paramyoviridaie family. There are four serotypes which cause respiratory illnesses in children and adults. HPIVs bind and replicate in the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract and the extent of the infection correlates with the location involved. Seasonal HPIV epidemics result in a significant burden of disease in children and account for 40% of pediatric hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) and 75% of croup cases. Parainfluenza viruses are associated with a wide spectrum of illnesses which include otitis media, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, croup, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. Uncommon respiratory manifestations include apnea, bradycardia, parotitis, and respiratory distress syndrome and rarely disseminated infection. Immunity resulting from disease in childhood is incomplete and reinfection with HPIV accounts for 15% of respiratory illnesses in adults. Severe disease and fatal pneumonia may occur in elderly and immunocompromised adults. HPIV pneumonia in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is associated with 50% acute mortality and 75% mortality at 6 months. Though sensitive molecular diagnostics are available to rapidly diagnose HPIV infection, effective antiviral therapies are not available. Currently, treatment for HPIV infection is supportive with the exception of croup where the use of corticosteroids has been found to be beneficial. Several novel drugs including DAS181 appear promising in efforts to treat severe disease in immunocompromised patients, and vaccines to decrease the burden of disease in young children are in development.","Branche, Angela R.; Falsey, Ann R.",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171724/,303

Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6, -7, and -8 all establish latency after infection and can reactivate during periods of immunosuppression, leading to both direct and indirect adverse effects on the host including severe organ dysfunction as well as allograft rejection and loss after transplantation. While not all herpesviruses are primary respiratory pathogens, many of their manifestations include involvement of the respiratory tract.

10337,Parainfluenza Virus Infection,2016-08-11,"BACKGROUND: In endemic areas of zoonotic leishmaniosis caused by L. infantum, early detection of Leishmania infection in dogs is essential to control the dissemination of the parasite to humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serological and/or molecular diagnostic performance of minimally and non-invasive samples (conjunctiva cells (CS) and peripheral blood (PB)) for monitoring Leishmania infection/exposure to Phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antigens in dogs at the beginning and the end of sand fly seasonal activity (May and October, respectively) and to assess associated risks factors. METHODS: A total of 208 sheltered dogs from endemic areas of leishmaniosis were screened. Leishmania DNA detection in PB on filter paper and CS was performed by nested-PCR (nPCR), while the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies was performed using IFAT and ELISA. The exposure to P. perniciosus salivary antigens (SGH, rSP01 and rSP03B + rSP01) was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Ninety-seven (46.6%) and 116 (55.8%) of the 208 dogs were positive to Leishmania antibodies or DNA by at least one test at the beginning and end of the sand fly season, respectively. IFAT and ELISA presented a substantial agreement in the serodiagnosis of leishmaniosis. Discrepant PB nPCR results were obtained between sampling points. Leishmania DNA was detected in CS of 72 dogs at the end of the phlebotomine season. The presence of antibodies to the parasite measured by ELISA was significantly higher in dogs presenting clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis at both sampling points. Phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antibodies were detected in 179 (86.1%) and 198 (95.2%) of the screened dogs at the beginning and end of the phlebotomine season, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The association between ELISA positivity and clinical signs suggests its usefulness to confirm a clinical suspicion. CS nPCR seems to be an effective and non-invasive method for assessing early exposure to the parasite. PB nPCR should not be used as the sole diagnostic tool to monitor Leishmania infection. The correlation between the levels of antibodies to P. perniciosus saliva and Leishmania antibodies suggests the use of a humoral response to sand fly salivary antigens as biomarkers of L. infantum infection.

11123,Sepsis and ECMO,2020-05-14,"Although norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and Astrovirus are considered the most important viral agents transmitted by food and water, in recent years other viruses, such as Aichi virus (AiV), have emerged as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with different foods. AiV belongs to the genus Kobuvirus of the family Picornaviridae. It is a virus with icosahedral morphology that presents a single stranded RNA genome with positive sense (8280 nucleotides) and a poly (A) chain. AiV was first detected from clinical samples and in recent years has been involved in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks from different world regions. Furthermore, several studies conducted in Japan, Germany, France, Tunisia and Spain showed a high prevalence of AiV antibodies in adults (between 80% and 99%), which is indicative of a large exposure to this virus. The aim of this review is to bring together all the discovered information about the emerging pathogen human Aichi virus (AiV), discussing the possibles routes of transmission, new detection techniques and future research. Although AiV is responsible for a low percentage of gastroenteritis outbreaks, the high seroprevalence shown by human populations indicates an evident role as an enteric agent. The low percentage of AiV detection could be explained by the fact that the pathogen is more associated to subclinical infections. Further studies will be needed to clarify the real impact of AiV in human health and its importance as a causative gastroenteritis agent worldwide.","Rivadulla, Enrique; Romalde, Jesús L.",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223127/,303
11314,Vascular compression of the left bronchus in a patient with funnel chest,2020-03-24,"Influenza A virus (IAV) depends on the metabolism of its cellular host to provide energy and essential factors, including lipids, for viral replication. Previous studies have shown that fatty acids (FAs) play an important role in IAV replication and that inhibition of FA biosynthesis can diminish viral replication. However, cellular lipids can either be synthesized intracellularly or be imported from the extracellular environment. Interfering with FA import mechanisms may reduce the cellular lipid content and inhibit IAV replication. To test this hypothesis, MDCK and Detroit 562 cells were infected with IAV followed by exposure to palmitic acid and inhibitors of FA import. Replication of IAV significantly increased when infected cells were supplied with palmitic acid. This enhancement could be reduced by adding an FA import inhibitor. The addition of palmitic acid significantly increased the cellular lipid content, and this increased level was reduced by treatment with an FA import inhibitor. These results show that reducing the cellular lipid level might be an approach for IAV therapy.","Limsuwat, Nattavatchara; Boonarkart, Chompunuch; Phakaratsakul, Supinya; Suptawiwat, Ornpreya; Auewarakul, Prasert",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223680/,303

Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (SMAD) family members are important cytokines in the transforming growth factor-beta family. They jointly regulate the processes of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the expression of SMAD family genes in pan-cancers and their impact on prognosis have not been elucidated. Perl software and R software were used to perform expression analysis and survival curve analysis on the data collected by TCGA, GTEx, and GEO, and the potential regulatory pathways were determined through gene ontology enrichment and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis. It was found that SMAD7 and SMAD9 expression decreased in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and their expression was positively correlated with survival time. Additionally, SMAD7 could be used as an independent prognostic factor for LUAD. In general, SMAD7 and SMAD9 can be used as prognostic markers of LUAD. Further, SMAD7 is expected to become a therapeutic target for LUAD.","Dai, Zhou-Tong; Wang, Jun; Zhao, Kai; Xiang, Yuan; Li, Jia Peng; Zhang, Hui-Min; Peng, Zi-Tan; Liao, Xing Hua",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7598801/,303

16601,ECMO: an evolving chapter,2021-04-05,"This study aims to assess the effect of obesity as an underlying cause of death in association with four main noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) as contributing causes of mortality on the age of death in White, Black, and Hispanic individuals in the USA. To estimate mortality hazard ratios, we ran a Cox regression on the US National Center for Health Statistics mortality integrated datasets from 1999 to 2017, which included almost 48 million cases. The variable in the model was the age of death in years as a proxy for time to death. The cause-of-death variable allowed for the derivation of predictor variables of obesity and the four main NCDs. The overall highest obesity mortality HR when associated with NCD contributing conditions for the year 1999–2017 was diabetes (2.15; 95% CI: 2.11–2.18), while Whites had the highest HR (2.46; 95% CI: 2.41–2.51) when compared with Black (1.32; 95% CI: 1.27–1.38) and Hispanics (1.25; 95% CI: 1.18–1.33). Hispanics had lower mortality HR for CVD (1.21; 95% CI: 1.15–1.27) and diabetes (1.25; 95% CI: 1.18–1.33) of the three studied groups. The obesity death mean was 57.3 years for all groups. People who die from obesity are, on average, 15.4 years younger than those without obesity. Although Hispanics in the USA have a higher prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), they also have the lowest mortality HR for obesity as an underlying cause of death when associated with CVD and cancer. While there is no obvious solution for obesity and its complications, continued efforts to address obesity are needed.","de Cosio, Federico Gerardo; Diaz-Apodaca, Beatriz; Baker, Amanda; Cifuentes, Miriam Patricia; Ojeda-Casares, Hector; Constandce, Daniel; Becerra, Francisco",SN Compr Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020827/,303

To characterize the role of apoptotic cell contraction, ROCK1 was rendered caspase non-cleavable (ROCK1nc) by mutating aspartate 1113, which revealed that ROCK1 cleavage was necessary for forceful contraction and membrane blebbing. When homozygous ROCK1nc mice were treated with the liver-selective apoptotic stimulus of diethylnitrosamine, ROCK1nc mice had more profound liver damage with greater neutrophil infiltration than wild-type mice. Inhibition of the damage-associated molecular pattern protein HMGB1 or signalling by its cognate receptor TLR4 lowered neutrophil infiltration and reduced liver damage. ROCK1nc mice also developed fewer diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumours, while HMGB1 inhibition increased HCC tumour numbers. Thus, ROCK1 activation and consequent cell contraction are required to limit sterile inflammation and damage amplification following tissue-scale cell death. Additionally, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for acute sterile inflammation as an efficient tumour-suppressive mechanism.","Julian, Linda; Naylor, Gregory; Wickman, Grant R; Rath, Nicola; Castino, Giovanni; Stevenson, David; Bryson, Sheila; Munro, June; McGarry, Lynn; Mullin, Margaret; Rice, Alistair; Del Río Hernández, Armandodel; Olson, Michael F",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8087448/,303

31370,Commentary: The Very Real Generation Gap: Times Are A-Changing,2020-04-21,"The interaction with adhesion molecules expressed by vascular endothelium is the first step in lymphocyte infiltration into tissues. At both cutaneous and mucosal sites interleukin‐10 (IL‐10), IL‐12 and transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β are important regulators of chronic inflammatory disease, where cutaneous lymphocyte‐associated antigen (CLA) and αE integrin (CD103) may be expressed. Unlike CLA, CD103 is not believed to play a role in tissue‐specific homing but may help to retain T cells within epithelial layers. We have previously shown that IL‐12 alone can together with an unknown cofactor increase the expression of CLA. Stimulation with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SpeC) increased the expression of CD103 by CD8(+) but not CD4(+) T cells. While IL‐12 increased superantigen‐stimulated expression of CLA, this cytokine strongly inhibited the CD103 expression, and a combination of IL‐12 and TGF‐β completely abrogated the induced CD103 expression. Conversely, IL‐10 suppressed CLA but increased CD103 expression. These findings indicate that, in addition to suppressing the development of Th1‐mediated inflammatory responses, IL‐10 may also inhibit the migration of CD8(+) T cells into the skin while IL‐12 promotes such migration. Thus, the expression of CLA and CD103 may be antagonistically regulated by IL‐10 and IL‐12, and the balance between these cytokines could influence the T‐cell migration of inflammatory cells into epithelial tissues.","Sigmundsdóttir, H.; Johnston, A.; Gudjónsson, J.

Despite their success, CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight changes to their inputs may lead to sharp changes in their output in even well-trained networks. Set-based analysis methods can detect or prove the absence of bounded adversarial attacks, which can then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of neural network training methodology. Unfortunately, existing verification approaches have limited scalability in terms of the size of networks that can be analyzed. In this paper, we describe a set-based framework that successfully deals with real-world CNNs, such as VGG16 and VGG19, that have high accuracy on ImageNet. Our approach is based on a new set representation called the ImageStar, which enables efficient exact and over-approximative analysis of CNNs. ImageStars perform efficient set-based analysis by combining operations on concrete images with linear programming (LP). Our approach is implemented in a tool called NNV, and can verify the robustness of VGG networks with respect to a small set of input states, derived from adversarial attacks, such as the DeepFool attack. The experimental results show that our approach is less conservative and faster than existing zonotope and polytope methods.","Tran, Hoang-Dung; Bak, Stanley; Xiang, Weiming; Johnson, Taylor T.",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363231/,303

In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, apart from providing structural stability and cell division, microtubules also facilitate important biological activities crucial for parasite survival in hosts, such as egression and motility. Hence, parasite structures and processes involving microtubules are among the most important drug targets for discovering much-needed novel Plasmodium inhibitors. The current study aims to construct reliable and high-quality 3D models of α-, β-, and γ-tubulins using various modeling techniques. We identified a common binding pocket specific to Plasmodium α-, β-, and γ-tubulins. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of the Plasmodium tubulin 3D structures.

69040,Ebola in West Africa.,2015,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has generated an explosion of interest both in the mechanisms of infection leading to dissemination and expression of this disease, and in potential risk factors that may have a mechanistic basis for disease propagation or control. Vitamin D has emerged as a factor that may be involved in these two areas. The focus of this article is to apply our current understanding of vitamin D as a facilitator of immunocompetence both with regard to innate and adaptive immunity and to consider how this may relate to COVID-19 disease. There are also intriguing potential links to vitamin D as a factor in the cytokine storm that portends some of the most serious consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Moreover, cardiac and coagulopathic features of COVID-19 disease deserve attention as they may also be related to vitamin D. Finally, we review the current clinical data associating vitamin D with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a putative clinical link that at this time must still be considered hypothetical.","Bilezikian, John P; Bikle, Daniel; Hewison, Martin; Lazaretti-Castro, Marise; Formenti, Anna Maria; Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Nair, Nandini; Babalyan, Varta; Hutchings, Nicholas James; Napoli, Nicola; Accili, Domenico; Binkley, Neil; Landry, Donald W; Giustina, Andrea",European journal of endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-20-0665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32755992/,303
70435,The CypA-netics of Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury.,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND Limited studies are available that investigate the reactions to COVID-19 pandemic by people suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the pandemic and the heightened focus on contamination, cleaning, and social distancing, it is likely that a deterioration of OCD symptoms and severity will be seen. AIMS Our aims were to evaluate (1) self-reported changes in OCD symptom severity of adults with OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, (2) whether the COVID-19 pandemic would trigger self-reported contamination symptoms in persons with no history of such symptoms, (3) self-reported variables associated with OCD symptom severity change, and 4) self-reported changes in quality of life. METHOD A 47-item self-report questionnaire was sent to all members of the Danish OCD Association and the final sample comprised 201 adult participants. The association of OCD severity change with demographic and clinical variables was analyzed using linear regression. RESULTS 61.2% of participants reported an increase in OCD severity, based on the retrospective self-report. Female gender, self-reported contamination symptoms, and self-reported psychiatric comorbidity were found to have a significant association with increasing OCD severity. Five participants reported the emergence of contamination symptoms and two of harm related symptoms. Thirty participants reported a severe reduction in quality of life (≥80). CONCLUSIONS A large group of people suffering from OCD may require special attention and care during a pandemic like COVID-19 in order to lessen the deterioration of OCD symptoms and also to minimize the reduction in quality of life evident in this group.","Højgaard, Davíð R M A; Duholm, Charlotte; Nissen, Judith B; Jensen, Sanne; Thomsen, Per Hove",Nordic journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1912823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928838/,303
72293,The long duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a child with acute severe hypoxic respiratory failure treated in a resource-limited center.,2012,"Study Design A retrospective cohort study. Objective The world was unprecedentedly struck by the new coronavirus in December 2019. Consequently, lockdown measures were imposed by many governments. Health-care services were reserved for emergencies and malignancies. Nevertheless, many patients who urgently needed these services did not present. This study estimates the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on the patients' flow in the outpatient clinic (OPC) and the operations for laryngeal and/or oropharyngeal neoplasms. Methods This study is a retrospective cohort study performed in otolaryngology department of a tertiary care hospital which is a major referral center. All patients who attended the OPC and all operations performed for laryngeal and/or oropharyngeal neoplasms were counted from February 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 and compared with the previous year as a reference. Results In 2020, the number of patients attending the otolaryngology OPC and the laryngeal and/or oropharyngeal surgeries showed a major drop, especially after imposing the lockdown measures. The total number of these operations in April and May 2019 dropped by 79% for the same period in 2020. Conclusion An estimate of 79% of patients, who had been presenting for laryngeal and/or oropharyngeal neoplasms, did not show up due to indirect COVID-19 effect.","Sabaa, Mohamed Abd Elmottaleb; Algarf, T M",Craniomaxillofacial trauma & reconstruction,https://doi.org/10.1177/1943387520963823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995837/,303

74851,Netrin-1 dampens pulmonary inflammation during acute lung injury.,2010,"PURPOSE This study aimed to determine the pattern of neuromuscular fatigability that manifests during repeated-sprint running exercise. METHODS Twelve male participants (mean ± SD: age, 25 ± 6 yr; stature, 180 ± 7 cm; body mass, 77 ± 7 kg), currently training and competing in intermittent sprint sports, performed a repeated maximal sprint running protocol (12 × 30 m, 30-s rest periods). Pre- and postexercise twitch responses to transcutaneous motor point stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained to assess knee extensor neuromuscular and corticospinal function, respectively. Throughout the protocol, during alternate rest periods, blood lactate samples were taken and a single knee extensor maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensors was performed, with motor point stimulation delivered during and 2 s after, to determine voluntary activation (VA) and peripheral fatigue. RESULTS The repeated-sprint protocol induced significant increases in sprint time and blood [lactate] from the third sprint onwards (P < 0.001). Furthermore, knee extensor MVC, resting twitch amplitude, and VA were all significantly reduced after two sprints and reached their nadir after sprint 10 (Δ12%, Δ24%, Δ8%, P < 0.01, respectively). In line with a reduction in motor point-derived VA, there was also a reduction in VA measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (Δ9%, P < 0.05) immediately after exercise. CONCLUSIONS These data are the first to demonstrate the development of neuromuscular fatigability of the knee extensors during and immediately after repeated-sprint exercise. Peripheral and central factors contributing to muscle fatigability were evident after two maximal sprints, and over half of the drop in postexercise MVC was due to supraspinal fatigue. Thus, peripheral, central, and supraspinal factors all contribute to the performance decrement and fatigability of the knee extensors after maximal repeated-sprint activity.","Goodall, Stuart; Charlton, Kayleigh; Howatson, Glyn; Thomas, Kevin",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000000443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010404/,303

In the absence of a vaccine or a specific therapy, detecting the disease at an early stage and isolating confirmed cases from the rest of the healthy population was soon considered to be essential. The RT-PCR technique was the gold standard method for testing for infection with the virus. It has high specificity but moderate sensitivity. It was difficult to access it during the first weeks of the pandemic. On the basis of the observations of the Chinese and Italian scientific community in particular, the recommendation was to combine use of the RT-PCR with a low-dose thoracic CT scan. In the absence of easy access to the RT-PCR, the use of the lung CT scan for a rapid triage of patients within emergency departments proved effective.","Loukoul, Wassim Abou; Schaer, Cédric; Christ, Florian; Cinquetti, Gaël; Naulet, Pierre",Soins; la revue de reference infirmiere,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0814(20)30244-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357618/,303

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective single-center study included 69 tumors in 55 patients treated by RF ablation and 136 tumors in 99 patients treated by MW ablation between 2001 and 2013. RF and MW ablation devices included straight 17-gauge applicators. Overall survival and rates of local tumor progression (LTP) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier techniques with Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models and competing risk regression of LTP. RESULTS RF and MW cohorts were similar in age (P = .22), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (P = .24), and tumor size (mean 2.4 cm [range, 0.6-4.5 cm] and 2.2 cm [0.5-4.2 cm], P = .09). Median length of follow-up was 31 months for RF and 24 months for MW. Rate of LTP was 17.7% with RF and 8.8% with MW. Corresponding HR from Cox and competing risk models was 2.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-4.50; P = 0.04) and 2.01 (95% CI, 0.95-4.26; P = .07), respectively. There was improved survival for patients treated with MW ablation, although this was not statistically significant (Cox HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 0.91-2.77; P = .103]). There were few major (≥ grade C) complications (2 for RF, 1 for MW; P = .28).

93700,Update in Interstitial Lung Disease 2020.,2021-04-09,"Blood flow partially determines specific climbing endurance (SCE) as it mediates oxygen bio-availability in the finger flexors. Blood flow is related to occlusion threshold (OT), which is defined as the contraction intensity at which intramuscular pressure exceeds perfusion blood pressure resulting in the cessation of local blood flow. The OT is represented as an inflection point on a force-time graph when isometric force is registered and applied through maximal and continuous tests. Endurance time (ET) to exhaustion is influenced by the relative isometric applied force and is different for each climber. The aim of this study was to explore whether an approximation of the finger flexoŕs OT in sport climbers through records of ET to exhaustion at different isometric relative intensities was possible. We measured maximum finger hang ETs at 6 intensities ranging from 85% to 35% maximal force in 34 sport climbers of advanced and elite level. The values obtained were analyzed by two different methods in an attempt to determine a change in the shape of the curve in the intensity-ET relationship graphs that approximated the OT for each climber. The results suggest that the finger flexoŕs OT could be different among climbers, regardless of their strength and ability level. The presented methods do not accurately reflect the OT, but could indicate the intensity at which blood flow is restored in the active muscles. This is the first study to indirectly approximate the finger flexors OT in sport-climbers, a parameter that could be essential to assess SCE.","Gómez, Pedro Bergua; Montero-Marin, Jesús; Gomez-Bruton, Alejandro; A Casajús, José",European journal of sport science,https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2020.1827047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962556/,303

Thirty-four adult ASA I-III patients were enrolled in a double-blinded randomized pilot study to receive remifentanil (REM) or dexmedetomidine (DEX) for sedation during AFOI (nasal and oral). Thirty patients completed the study and received 2 mg midazolam IV and topical anesthesia. The REM group received a loading dose of 0.75 mcg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.075 mcg/kg/min. The DEX group received a loading dose of 0.4 mcg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. Time to sedation, number of intubation attempts, Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) score, bispectral index (BIS), and memory recall were recorded. All thirty patients were successfully intubated by AFOI (22 oral intubations/8 nasal). First attempt success rate with AFOI was higher in the REM group than the DEX group, 72% and 38% (P = 0.02), respectively. The DEX group took longer to attain RSS of ≥3 and to achieve BIS <80, as compared to the REM group. Postloading dose verbal recall was poorer in the DEX group. Dexmedetomidine seems a useful adjunct for patients undergoing AFOI but is dependent on dosage and time.

The purpose of this review is to bring our discussion to a wider audience. The meeting could not have been more timely. Six weeks later, the COVID-19 emergency emerged in China and within 12 months it had swept the world. This paper, the contents of which were presented at that meeting in December recommended that future healthcare would be guided more by public health perspectives and informed by an understanding of health economics, population health and the lessons learned by psychiatry in the 20th century. Ultimately two issues are at stake in 21st century healthcare: the sustainability of our healthcare systems and the maintenance of public support for population health. We must plan for the next generation of healthcare.

103728,Evidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Spread by Aerosol. Time to Revisit Infection Control Strategies?,2016,"Background: During a pandemic, women may be especially vulnerable to secondary health problems driven by its social and economic effects. We examined the relationship between changes in health-related socioeconomic risks (HRSRs) and mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 3,200 women aged 18-90 years was conducted in April 2020 using a quota-based sample from a national panel (88% cooperation rate). Patterns of change in HRSRs (food insecurity, housing instability, interpersonal violence, and difficulties with utilities and transportation) were described. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms among those with and without incident or worsening HRSRs. Results: More than 40% of women had one or more prepandemic HRSRs. In the early pandemic phase, 49% of all women, including 29% with no prepandemic HRSRs, had experienced incident or worsening HRSRs. By April 2020, the rates of depression and anxiety were twice that of prepandemic benchmarks (29%); 17% of women had symptoms of traumatic stress. The odds of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were two to three times higher among women who reported at least one incident or worsening HRSR; this finding was similar for women with and without prepandemic HRSRs. Conclusions: Increased health-related socioeconomic vulnerability among U.S. women early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was prevalent and associated with alarmingly high rates of mental health problems. Pandemic-related mental health needs are likely to be much greater than currently available resources, especially for vulnerable women.","Lindau, Stacy Tessler; Makelarski, Jennifer A; Boyd, Kelly; Doyle, Kate E; Haider, Sadia; Kumar, Shivani; Lee, Nita Karnik; Pinkerton, El; Tobin, Marie; Vu, Milkie; Wroblewski, Kristen E; Lengyel, Ernst",Journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818123/,303

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of 425 patients who underwent lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer without preoperative radiation therapy between November 2012 and October 2017. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) in the IIP area except the lung cancer site was measured in each patient. RESULTS Thirty-one of the 425 patients (7.3%) showed findings of IIP in chest CT. Five of the 31 patients (16.1%) developed acute exacerbation (AE) after lung resection (AE+ group). Twenty-six of the 31 patients (83.9%) did not develop AE (AE- group). In the AE+ group, 18F-FDG SUVmax in the IIP area was significantly higher (1.9 ± 0.6 vs. 2.7 ± 0.7, p = 0.02) compared with that in the AE- group. The receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an SUVmax threshold score of 2.55 (p = 0.02) for AE. There was no 90-day mortality in the patients with SUVmax < 2.55 (n = 25). On the other hand, the 90-day mortality rate in patients with SUVmax ≥ 2.55 (n = 6) was 33.3% (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS 18F-FDG PET/CT may predict AE after lung resection and could be related to short-term survival in lung cancer patients with IIP.

Scoping review methods were applied to objectively assess the relative interest by the scientific community in infectious diseases at interfaces between wildlife and livestock, to characterize animal species and regions involved, as well as to identify trends over time. An extensive literature search combining wildlife, livestock, disease, and geographical search terms yielded 78,861 publications, of which 15,998 were included in the analysis. Publications dated from 1912 to 2013 and showed a continuous increasing trend, including a shift from parasitic to viral diseases over time. In particular there was a significant increase in publications on the artiodactyls-cattle and bird-poultry interface after 2002 and 2003, respectively. These trends could be traced to key disease events that stimulated public interest and research funding. Among the top 10 diseases identified by this review, the majority were zoonoses. Prominent wildlife-livestock interfaces resulted largely from interaction between phylogenetically closely related and/or sympatric species. The bird-poultry interface was the most frequently cited wildlife-livestock interface worldwide with other interfaces reflecting regional circumstances. This review provides the most comprehensive overview of research on infectious diseases at the wildlife-livestock interface to date.","Wiethoelter, Anke K; Beltrán-Alcrudo, Daniel; Kock, Richard; Mor, Siobhan M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1422741112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26195733/,303

METHODS We used Hospital Discharge Records and number of residents in Italy to calculate number and rate of hospitalization for Chagas disease, dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, Taenia solium taeniasis, and cysticercosis by sex, citizenship group, and region in the period 2011-2016. RESULTS 7195 hospitalizations for NTDs were retrieved, accounting for 7375 diagnoses, 60% in Italians and 40% in foreigners. Male-to-female ratio was 2; the age group more commonly affected was 25-44 years (32.5%). The most common diagnoses were leishmaniasis (34%), schistosomiasis (29%), strongyloidiasis (12%), Chagas disease (8%), and dengue (8%). Average yearly hospitalization rate per 100,000 residents for all NTDs was 2.05, 1.33, and 10.39 in general population, Italians, and foreign citizens, respectively. Hospitalization rates higher than 100 per 100,000 subjects were found in citizens from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Bolivia. CONCLUSIONS NTDs have a not negligible burden in Italy. The most clinically relevant NTDs in Italy are leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis, followed by strongyloidiasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. Cystic echinococcosis, that was not included in the analysis since a similar study on this disease was recently published, should also be listed among the leading NTD in Italy. While schistosomiasis has its highest burden on population coming from highly endemic areas such as SSA, leishmaniasis is especially relevant in Italian-born residents of southern regions. Education at university and post-graduate levels, to increase the awareness of healthcare professionals on these topics, as well as targeted public health interventions (such as screening or presumptive treatment in high-risk groups), are an asset to improve clinical management and control of these diseases.","Tilli, Marta; Botta, Annarita; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Corti, Giampaolo; Zammarchi, Lorenzo",Infection,https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-020-01443-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418191/,303

We describe a patient with no hormonal abnormalities who developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion after CCF embolisation. The patient had bilateral indirect CCFs, which were completely embolised via a transvenous approach, and was neurologically stable postoperatively and discharged. In the subsequent 2 weeks the patient was readmitted twice for acute hyponatraemia and a tonic-clonic seizure. Laboratory studies revealed severe SIADH. Clinical status and sodium levels improved after treatment. One year later the patient was weaned off all medications and remained neurologically stable. SIADH may be a delayed phenomenon after CCF embolisation. Given the proximity of embolised vessels to the pituitary's vascular supply, CCF treatment may result in flow disturbance, ischaemia and hormonal abnormalities.","Chen, Tsinsue; Kalani, M Yashar S; Ducruet, Andrew F; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012104.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013230/,303

METHODS Utilizing results from independent core laboratory angiographic imaging analysis, quantitative assessment of the restenotic tissue burden was evaluated in 33 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal ISR, including 20 lesions in 19 patients (mean age 71.5±8.1 years; 11 men) treated with DES and 14 lesions in 14 patients (mean age 70.6±9.2 years; 9 men) treated with BMS. RESULTS The average time to target lesion revascularization was similar (8.7 months) for the DES and BMS groups. The DES group had significantly less recurrent disease burden (17.1%) compared with the BMS group (27.8%, p=0.03), representing a 39% relative reduction. CONCLUSION Reduced restenotic tissue after endovascular intervention is associated with improved hemodynamics and fewer clinical symptoms and may explain the reduced need for reintervention in restenotic lesions initially treated with DES as compared with BMS.

We report a structure-driven degradation mechanism for NMC811 (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2), in which a proportion of the material exhibits a lowered accessible state of charge at the end of charging after repetitive cycling and becomes fatigued. Operando synchrotron long-duration X-ray diffraction enabled by a laser-thinned coin cell shows the emergence and growth in the concentration of this fatigued phase with cycle number. This degradation is structure driven and is not solely due to kinetic limitations or intergranular cracking: no bulk phase transformations, no increase in Li/Ni antisite mixing and no notable changes in the local structure or Li-ion mobility of the bulk are seen in aged NMCs. Instead, we propose that this degradation stems from the high interfacial lattice strain between the reconstructed surface and the bulk layered structure that develops when the latter is at states of charge above a distinct threshold of approximately 75%. This mechanism is expected to be universal in Ni-rich layered cathodes. Our findings provide fundamental insights into strategies to help mitigate this degradation process.","Xu, Chao; Märker, Katharina; Lee, Juhan; Mahadevegowda, Amoghavarsha; Reeves, Philip J; Day, Sarah J; Groh, Matthias F; Emge, Steffen P; Ducati, Caterina; Layla Mehdi, B; Tang, Chiu C; Grey, Clare P",Nature materials,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-020-0767-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839589/,303

Still a confusion exists in relation to the real effects of the female hormones on the perception of pain. The existing data refer mainly to experimental studies and have provided results not always useful in the clinical practice. DATA SOURCE This study was designed to detect whether there are differences in the perception of the postoperative pain in women, during two clearly defined phases of hormonal asset: luteal and follicular phases. CONCLUSION The results of this study have demonstrated that in postoperative female patients pain is perceived significantly more in the luteal phase of the menstrual period, than in the follicular phase. This could suggest that female in child-bearing age should be scheduled for elective surgery preferentially during the follicular phase, unless differently necessary. It would guarantee a more comfortable postoperative period, with reduced necessity of analgesics.","Piroli, Alba; Mattei, Antonella; Carta, Gaspare; D'Alfonso, Angela; Palermo, Patrizia; Marinangeli, Franco; Alfonsi, Benedetta; Testa, Ambra; Pasquale, Chiara; Varrassi, Giustino; Paladini, Antonella",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269411/,303

One crucial aspect relates to the allocation of life-saving resources in situations where there is an imbalance between need and availability and the associated questions of ethical and legal liability. This work looks at the implications of the criteria applied to rationing under extraordinary conditions and the issue of their legitimacy. Considering the European scenario, we describe the approach taken by Italy in proposing criteria for pandemic triage of intensive treatment and highlight certain problems and critical issues. We emphasise that the decision, based on a comparative assessment, to deny treatment to a patient in critical condition, compromising that patient's right to care, exceeds the scope of decision-making autonomy of the professional concerned and requires a theoretical and procedural definition shared at multiple levels of society.","Gambino, Francesco; Petrini, Carlo; Riva, Luciana",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,https://doi.org/10.4415/ann_21_02_01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132207/,303

This study sought to evaluate faculty/preceptor and student perceptions regarding preferences and timeliness of communication on professionalism and value.Methods. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to faculty/preceptors and students evaluating preferred method of communication, response time expectations, impact on professionalism, and perception of being valued. The University of Mississippi Institutional Review Board granted expedited approval.Results. A total of 253/924 responses were received (27% response rate). Responses came from 27 (11%) full-time faculty, 94 (37%) preceptors, and 132 (52%) students. Overall, email was the preferred communication method for non-time sensitive information (98%) with a majority of faculty/preceptors and students indicating 48hrs was a reasonable response time. Participants largely felt <24 hours to be a reasonable response time for text or phone call communication. Most students indicated response time to be somewhat or not impactful (58%) on their view of professionalism, while faculty and preceptors indicated response time to be neutral or somewhat impactful (60%). The majority of students (77%) felt that the response time from faculty/preceptors impacted their perceptions of feeling valued and important.Conclusion. Communication preferences among faculty/preceptors and students differ. Professionalism related to communication is important for all groups, and timeliness in communication between faculty, preceptors, and students impacts perception of value and self-worth.","Pate, Adam N; Fleming, Laurie; Jones-Bodie, Ashley; Wagner, Jamie L; Fleming, Joshua W; Davis, Courtney; Brown, Meagan A",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301533/,303

We aimed to synthesize evidence concerning the effects of CHC interventions in people with diabetes. To do this, four electronic databases were searched, including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus, and hand searches of reference collections were undertaken to identify intervention trials published in English. We screened 892 unique titles and abstracts. Two reviewers then independently evaluated 221 full-text articles. We discovered 29 articles met our eligibility criteria for inclusion. We found 27 unique studies with two companion articles. Seventeen studies were randomized controlled trials and the majority had a higher proportion of female and racial/ethnic minorities in the study sample. CHC interventions often involved either one-on-one or group education sessions supplemented by a phone follow-up that were delivered by health providers, nutritionists, or community health workers. CHC interventions using education sessions combined with follow up via phone generally resulted in significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, while sole telephone-based education studies showed no significant improvements. CHC interventions had no significant effects on physical activity in all six studies that examined the outcome. Overall, we found that CHC interventions were in general effective in improving glucose control when using face-to-face interactions in low-income, underserved, and racial and ethnic minority patients with diabetes.

METHODS We searched Ovid Medline and Ovid EMBASE from inception until June 1, 2018, for peer-reviewed publications describing clinical outcomes after SRS for ≥10 people with CCM in cohorts with or without a comparison group treated with neurosurgical excision or conservative management. Two reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies to quantify cohort characteristics and the incidence of the primary outcome (death attributable to CCM or its treatment) and secondary outcomes (incident nonfatal symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH] and incident nonhemorrhagic persistent focal neurologic deficit [FND]). We assessed whether comparative studies showed a dramatic association (meaning the conventionally calculated probability comparing 2 differently managed patient groups from the same population was <0.01 with a rate ratio greater than 10). RESULTS We included 30 cohort studies involving a total of 1,576 patients undergoing SRS for CCM. Four nonrandomized studies compared SRS to other treatment strategies, but did not demonstrate dramatic associations. During a median follow-up of 48 (interquartile range 35-62) months after SRS, the annual incidences (95% confidence interval) of outcomes were death 0.18% (0.10-0.31), ICH 2.40% (2.05-2.80), FND 0.71% (0.53-0.96), and the composite of death, ICH, or FND 3.63% (3.17-4.16). Outcomes did not differ by CCM location or type of SRS. CONCLUSION After SRS for CCM, the annual incidences of death, ICH, and FND are <5% and seem comparable to outcomes without SRS.

141808,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Concern.,2015,"BACKGROUND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the second most frequently performed bariatric procedure worldwide. While pouch migration is a common phenomenon after sleeve gastrectomy, it has hardly been documented after RYGB so far. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to correlate the diagnostic performance of gastroscopy of the gastroesophageal junction with 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) during postoperative care of patients revised due to weight regain after RYGB, with particular attention to intrathoracic pouch migration (ITM) and pouch volume. SETTING University Hospital Setting, Austria. METHODS Thirty RYGB patients that were revised owing to weight regain (median age 37.5 yr) before December 2017 were included in this prospective study. CT findings were correlated with gastroscopy regarding pouch size and ITM. Pouch distention was achieved with both oral contrast and effervescent granules. All patients had CT and gastroscopy on the same day. In addition, patients were evaluated for reflux disease based on clinical history. RESULTS ITM was found in 20 of 30 (66.7%) patients in CT, whereas gastroscopy did not correctly identify any herniation. In 16 of 28 (57.1%) patients pouch measurements at gastroscopy and CT showed a difference <40%. In 2 patients, pouch distention was not sufficient for CT volumetry. The intraclass correlation coefficient proved to be .594. Symptomatic reflux was present in 10 of 30 (33.3%) patients, 5 of whom had ITM. CONCLUSION ITM is an underreported finding after revised RYGB and missed in gastroscopy. In terms of pouch volume, 3-dimensional-CT volumetry demonstrated only moderate agreement with gastroscopy.","Arnoldner, Michael A; Felsenreich, Daniel M; Langer, Felix B; Weber, Michael; Mang, Thomas; Kulinna-Cosentini, Christiane; Prager, Gerhard",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2020.07.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917519/,303

METHODS 375 participants were recruited for this study, of which 125 were medical students (preclinical studies, 59; clinical studies, 66), 125 were health personnel (COVID-19 frontline personnel, 59; personnel not related with COVID-19, 66), and 125 belonged to the general population. The PHQ-9, GAD-7, and CPDI scales were used to assess the emotional impact. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to measure differences between groups, considering potential confounding factors. RESULTS Regarding CPDI values, all other groups showed reduced values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. However, the general population, preclinical and clinical medical students showed increased PHQ-9 values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. Finally, confounding factors, gender and age correlated negatively with higher CPDI and PHQ-9 scores. CONCLUSIONS Being frontline personnel is associated with increased COVID-19-related stress. Depression is associated, however, with other groups not directly involved with the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Induced hypothermia is beneficial in other conditions with global cerebral hypoxia. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that induced hypothermia improves outcome in patients with severe bacterial meningitis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS An open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in 49 intensive care units in France, February 2009-November 2011. In total, 130 patients were assessed for eligibility and 98 comatose adults (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of ≤8 for <12 hours) with community-acquired bacterial meningitis were randomized. INTERVENTIONS Hypothermia group received a loading dose of 4°C cold saline and were cooled to 32°C to 34°C for 48 hours. The rewarming phase was passive. Controls received standard care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome measure was the Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 3 months (a score of 5 [favorable outcome] vs a score of 1-4 [unfavorable outcome]). All patients received appropriate antimicrobial therapy and vital support. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed severe adverse events and mortality rate every 50 enrolled patients. RESULTS After inclusion of 98 comatose patients, the trial was stopped early at the request of the DSMB because of concerns over excess mortality in the hypothermia group (25 of 49 patients [51%]) vs the control group (15 of 49 patients [31%]; relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.05-3.77; P = .04). Pneumococcal meningitis was diagnosed in 77% of patients. Mean (SD) temperatures achieved 24 hours after randomization were 33.3°C (0.9°C) and 37.0°C (0.9°C) in the hypothermia and control group, respectively. At 3 months, 86% in the hypothermia group compared with 74% of controls had an unfavorable outcome (RR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.78-6.01; P = .13). After adjustment for age, score on GCS at inclusion, and the presence of septic shock at inclusion, mortality remained higher, although not significantly, in the hypothermia group (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.89-3.45; P = .10). Subgroup analysis on patients with pneumococcal meningitis showed similar results. Post hoc analysis showed a low probability to reach statistically significant difference in favor of hypothermia at the end of the 3 planned sequential analyses (probability to conclude in favor of futility, 0.977). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Moderate hypothermia did not improve outcome in patients with severe bacterial meningitis and may even be harmful. Careful evaluation of safety issues in future trials on hypothermia are needed and may have important implications in patients presenting with septic shock or stroke.

These intrinsically disordered proteins/regions do not possess unique structures and possess functions that complement the functional repertoire of ""normal"" ordered proteins and domains, with many protein functional classes being heavily dependent on the intrinsic disorder. Viruses commonly use these highly flexible regions to invade the host organisms and to hijack various host systems. These disordered regions also help viruses in adapting to their hostile habitats and to manage their economic usage of genetic material. In this article, we focus on the structural peculiarities of proteins from human hepatitis C virus (HCV) and use a wide spectrum of bioinformatics techniques to evaluate the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the completed proteomes of several human HCV genotypes, to analyze the peculiarities of disorder distribution within the individual HCV proteins, and to establish potential roles of the structural disorder in functions of ten HCV proteins. We show that the intrinsic disorder or increased flexibility is not only abundant in these proteins, but is also absolutely necessary for their functions, playing a crucial role in the proteolytic processing of the HCV polyprotein, the maturation of the individual HCV proteins, and being related to the posttranslational modifications of these proteins and their interactions with DNA, RNA, and various host proteins.","Fan, Xiao; Xue, Bin; Dolan, Patrick T; LaCount, Douglas J; Kurgan, Lukasz; Uversky, Vladimir N",Molecular bioSystems,https://doi.org/10.1039/c4mb00027g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752801/,303

One of the high needs for disinfectants can be overcome by using natural disinfectants or those made from natural ingredients, such as the use of eco-enzymes. The problem is that it takes 3 months to produce eco-enzyme, so it needs innovation to be able to produce it quickly. This research is an experimental study with independent variables, namely the composition of organic waste (rambutan fruit skin, corn cobs, chayote skin) as a substrate in varied eco-enzyme raw materials. Each treatment added 10% frangipani sandalwood extract. Control variables include fermentation time, water composition, brown sugar, yeast (Saccharomyches cerevisiae) with a fixed amount. The experimental results showed that the longer of fermentation time, the alcohol concentration increased, while the pH value decreased. The optimum time to produce eco-enzymes according to standard requirements for disinfecting purposes is 8-10 days, wherein the fermentation has produced an alcohol content of 60-70% and the pH of eco-enzymes has been reached below 4.0. The content of compounds in frangipani flower extract through phytochemical and GC-MS tests include terpenoids (linalool, geraniol, terpineol), quercetin from the flavonoid and citrulline groups of alkaloids and tannins which have various activities that support their role as a natural disinfectant including antibacterial, anti-fungi, and antivirals.

197160,Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS): a critical care perspective.,2003,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a 31-kb positive-strand RNA virus that is replicated in the cytoplasm of infected cells by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, termed the replicase. The replicase is encoded in the 5'-most 22 kb of the genomic RNA, which is translated to produce a polyprotein of >800 kDa. The replicase polyprotein is extensively processed by viral and perhaps cellular proteinases to give rise to a functional replicase complex. To date, two of the MHV replicase-encoded proteinases, papain-like proteinase 1 (PLP1) and the poliovirus 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), have been shown to process the replicase polyprotein. In this report, we describe the cloning, expression, and activity of the third MHV proteinase domain, PLP2. We show that PLP2 cleaves a substrate encoding the first predicted membrane-spanning domain (MP1) of the replicase polyprotein. Cleavage of MP1 and release of a 150-kDa intermediate, p150, are likely to be important for embedding the replicase complex in cellular membranes. Using an antiserum (anti-D11) directed against the C terminus of the MP1 domain, we verified that p150 encompasses the MP1 domain and identified a 44-kDa protein (p44) as a processed product of p150. Pulse-chase experiments showed that p150 is rapidly generated in MHV-infected cells and that p44 is processed from the p150 precursor. Protease inhibitor studies revealed that unlike 3CLpro activity, PLP2 activity is not sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitor E64d. Furthermore, coexpression studies using the PLP2 domain and a substrate encoding the MP1 cleavage site showed that PLP2 acts efficiently in trans. Site-directed mutagenesis studies confirmed the identification of cysteine 1715 as a catalytic residue of PLP2. This study is the first to report enzymatic activity of the PLP2 domain and to demonstrate that three distinct viral proteinase activities process the MHV replicase polyprotein.","Kanjanahaluethai, A; Baker, S C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10933699/,303
198762,When isn't the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome important?,2006,"Despite spending more on health care than any other country, the United States has the worst maternal mortality rate among all developed nations. African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women have the worst outcomes by race, representing a stark health disparity within the country. Contributing factors disproportionately experienced by these minority populations include challenges of access to consistent and high-quality prenatal care, prevalence of underlying conditions, toxic stress due to systemic racism, and unconscious bias in health care. While many of these factors lie upstream in the lives of women, and seemingly beyond the scope of the clinical walls, the downstream health care delivery system can serve as a vital part of the solution via innovative practices, community-based collaborations, and by serving as advocates for the communities served. Such alignments between clinicians, community leaders, policymakers, and patients that extend beyond the health system can serve as the missing piece needed within the clinic to reverse the trajectory of maternal mortality for American women, especially those from traditionally underserved populations.","Reddy, Swapna; Patel, Nina; Saxon, Mary; Amin, Nina; Biviji, Rizwana",Journal of patient-centered research and reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898647/,303
203453,d-dimer and Death in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"IMPORTANCE: A surge in severe cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in children would present unique challenges for hospitals and public health preparedness efforts in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.","Pathak, Elizabeth Barnett; Salemi, Jason L; Sobers, Natasha; Menard, Janelle; Hambleton, Ian R",J Public Health Manag Pract,,303

In this study we identified which areas in the country were the most vulnerable for COVID-19, both in terms of the risk of arrival of cases, the risk of sustained transmission and their social vulnerability. Probabilistic models were used to calculate the probability of COVID-19 spread from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the initial hotspots, using mobility data from the pre-epidemic period, while multivariate cluster analysis of socio-economic indices was done to identify areas with similar social vulnerability. The results consist of a series of maps of effective distance, outbreak probability, hospital capacity and social vulnerability. They show areas in the North and Northeast with high risk of COVID-19 outbreak that are also highly socially vulnerable. Later, these areas would be found the most severely affected. The maps produced were sent to health authorities to aid in their efforts to prioritize actions such as resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. In the discussion, we address how predictions compared to the observed dynamics of the disease.","Coelho, Flávio C; Lana, Raquel M; Cruz, Oswaldo G; Villela, Daniel A M; Bastos, Leonardo S; Pastore Y Piontti, Ana; Davis, Jessica T; Vespignani, Alessandro; Codeço, Claudia T; Gomes, Marcelo F C",PLoS One,,303

Therefore, to prevent injuries, many therapeutic protocols focus on find ways to correct dynamic knee valgus (DKV). METHODS: Thirty-one recreational male cyclists with DKV (26.4â¯±â¯4.5 years, 176.63â¯±â¯7.51â¯cm, 75.81â¯±â¯9.29â¯kg, 23.20â¯±â¯4.15â¯kg/m2) volunteered to participate in this study. A motion analysis system and a surface Electromyography were used to collect ten cycles of three-dimensional kinematics and muscles activity during 2â¯min of pedaling in each of four testing conditions. The paired t-test was used for statistical analysis (pâ¯<â¯0.05). RESULTS: The results indicated significant differences in VM (bandâ¯=â¯0.029, no bandâ¯=â¯0.031) and VL (bandâ¯=â¯0.015, no bandâ¯=â¯0.035) activation between workloads in each condition. Also there were significant differences in Gmed activation (0.5kgâ¯=â¯0.001, 2kgâ¯=â¯0.037), onset of Gmed (0.5kgâ¯=â¯0.048, 2kgâ¯=â¯0.012), offset of Gmed (0.5kgâ¯=â¯0.048, 2kgâ¯=â¯0.015), TFL activation (0.5kgâ¯=â¯0.001, 2kgâ¯=â¯0.041) and offset of TFL (0.5kgâ¯=â¯0.078, 2kgâ¯=â¯0.005) between the band and no band conditions. There was no different significant in VM/VL ratio between in each of four testing conditions (pâ¯>â¯0.05). The Gmed/TFL ratio was significantly greater in band condition than no band at both 0.5 (pâ¯=â¯0.045) and 2â¯kg (pâ¯=â¯0.001) workload. Knee abduction angle was affected by the band loop during the pedaling at two different workloads (0.5â¯kg: pâ¯=â¯0.047, 2â¯kg: pâ¯=â¯0.021) but mean (pâ¯=â¯0.027) and peak (pâ¯=â¯0.033) knee abduction angle significantly increased with increasing workload during the pedaling with band loop. CONCLUSIONS: pedaling with the band loop can be considered as an effective method to increase the Gmed, Gmed/TFL ratio and control of DKV but increasing the workload during pedaling must be done with caution.","Heydarian, Mona; Babakhani, Farideh; Hatefi, Mohamadreza; Balouchi, Ramin; Mohammadian, Mohammadamin",Gait Posture,,303

217415,Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Receiving Prophylactic Anticoagulation,2020,"OBJECTIVE: A vaccine for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could prove critical in establishing herd immunity. While past work has documented the prevalence and correlates of vaccine refusal, I assess how a less explored topic -- properties of vaccines themselves (e.g., national origin, efficacy, risk of side effects) -- might influence vaccination intentions. This information can help public health officials preempt differential intentions to vaccinate, and inform health communication campaigns that encourage vaccine uptake. RATIONALE: Previous research suggests that Americans should be more likely to intend to vaccinate if presented with a US-made vaccine that carries a low risk of minor side effects, is highly effective, is administered in just one dose, and has spent significant time in development. METHODS: I administered a conjoint experiment (N = 5940 trials) in a demographically representative survey (N = 990) of US adults to assess how variation in vaccine properties influence self-reported public vaccination intentions. RESULTS: I find that respondents prefer vaccines that are US-made, over 90% effective, and carry a less than 1% risk of minor side effects. This is potentially problematic, as some leading vaccine candidates are produced outside the US, and/or may be more likely to produce minor side effects than respondents would otherwise prefer. Worryingly, intended vaccine refusal rates exceed 30% for a vaccine meeting these optimal characteristics. Encouragingly, though, Americans show no clear preference for vaccines administered in one dose, or developed in under a year, and do not appear to draw a distinction between weakened viral vs. mRNA-based vaccines. CONCLUSION: Americans' preferences for a novel coronavirus vaccine may be at odds with the vaccine that ultimately hits the market, posing both policy and health communication challenges for vaccination uptake.","Motta, Matt",Soc Sci Med,,303

224205,A Hybrid Model of Pediatric and Adult Critical Care During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Surge: The Experience of Two Tertiary Hospitals in London and New York,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted routine health care services including immunization delivery. The most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States is the human papillomavirus (HPV), and its sequelae may be prevented by vaccination. Sequelae that can develop if one's immune system is not able to clear the infection include warts, precancerous lesions, and cancer. The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG) reports almost everyone who is sexually active will encounter the virus at some time during their life. Most of the estimated 79 million infections occur among people who are in their late teens or early 20s. Since 2006, there has been a vaccine available to prevent HPV infections in both males and females; however, administration of this vaccine has only been about half the rate of other vaccines and vaccine hesitancy may play a role. Public health nurses are vital in providing accurate and nonjudgmental vaccine education to their clients, especially unaccompanied minors seeking care in public health department clinics. This paper will explore the recommendations for providing this vaccine as well as a snapshot of current practice in two health departments in the Southeast region of the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kovar, Cheryl L; Pestaner, Mitzi; Webb Corbett, Robin; Rose, Carol Lynn",Public health nurs,,303

239896,A review on novel coronavirus outbreak: Current scenario of Bangladesh,2020,"Background: Six months since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the pandemic continues to grow worldwide, although the outbreak in Wuhan, the worst-hit area, has been controlled. Thus, based on the clinical experience in Wuhan, we hypothesized that there is a relationship between the patient's CO2 levels and prognosis. Methods: COVID-19 patients' information was retrospectively collected from medical records at the Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between decreased CO2 levels and disease severity or mortality risk. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was coupled with the log-rank test to understand COVID-19 progression in patients with decreased CO2 levels. Curve fitting was used to confirm the correlation between computed tomography scores and CO2 levels. Results: Cox regression analysis showed that the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients correlated with decreased CO2 levels. The adjusted hazard ratios for decreased CO2 levels in COVID-19 patients were 8.710 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.773-27.365, P < 0.001], and 4.754 (95% CI: 1.380-16.370, P = 0.013). The adjusted odds ratio was 0.950 (95% CI: 0.431-2.094, P = 0.900). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with decreased CO2 levels had a higher risk of mortality. Conclusions: Decreased CO2 levels increased the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients, which might be caused by hyperventilation during mechanical ventilation. This finding provides important insights for clinical treatment recommendations.","Hu, Di; Li, Jinpeng; Gao, Rongfen; Wang, Shipei; Li, Qianqian; Chen, Sichao; Huang, Jianglong; Huang, Yihui; Li, Man; Long, Wei; Liu, Zeming; Guo, Liang; Wu, Xiaohui",Front Public Health,,303

254949,Strategies to Optimize ICU Liberation (A to F) Bundle Performance in Critically Ill Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR)-type epidemiologic models, modeling unascertained infections latently, can predict unreported cases and deaths assuming perfect testing. We apply a method we developed to account for the high false negative rates of diagnostic RT-PCR tests for detecting an active SARS-CoV-2 infection in a classic SEIR model. The number of unascertained cases and false negatives being unobservable in a real study, population-based serosurveys can help validate model projections. Applying our method to training data from Delhi, India, during March 15-June 30, 2020, we estimate the underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 (deaths: 8-13) on July 10, 2020, largely consistent with the findings of the first round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during June 27-July 10, 2020) with an estimated 22.86% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding estimated underreporting factors of 30-42 for cases. Together, these imply approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported (July 10, 2020). Updated calculations using training data during March 15-December 31, 2020 yield estimated underreporting factor for cases at 13-22 (deaths: 3-7) on January 23, 2021, which are again consistent with the latest (fifth) round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during January 15-23, 2021) with an estimated 56.13% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding an estimated range for the underreporting factor for cases at 17-21. Together, these updated estimates imply approximately 92-96% cases in Delhi remained unreported (January 23, 2021). Such model-based estimates, updated with latest data, provide a viable alternative to repeated resource-intensive serosurveys for tracking unreported cases and deaths and gauging the true extent of the pandemic.","Bhattacharyya, Rupam; Kundu, Ritoban; Bhaduri, Ritwik; Ray, Debashree; Beesley, Lauren J; Salvatore, Maxwell; Mukherjee, Bhramar",Sci Rep,,303

Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immune-inhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients.

259060,Association of Social and Economic Inequality With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Incidence and Mortality Across US Counties,2021,"BACKGROUND: Self-care interventions offer a solution to support the achievement of three goals of the World Health Organization (WHO): to improve universal health coverage, reach people in humanitarian situations, and improve health and well-being. In light of implementing WHO consolidated guidelines on self-care interventions to strengthen sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists from four different EMR countries discussed the current SRH situation, inequality gaps, barriers to SRH service access and the pharmacist's crucial role as a first-line responder to patients before, during and after COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Self-care interventions for SRH allow health care providers to serve a greater number of patients, improve progress toward universal health coverage, and reach people in humanitarian crises. In fact, these interventions can be significantly enhanced by utilizing community pharmacists as first-line health care providers. This review highlights the important role of community pharmacists in promoting self-care interventions and empowering individuals, families and communities. As a result, well-informed individuals will be authoritative in their health decisions. Exploring self-care interventions in the EMR was done through reviewing selected SRH services delivery through community pharmacists before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, community pharmacists were found to be excluded from both governmental and nongovernmental SRH programmes. During the pandemic, community pharmacists managed to support patients with self-care interventions, whether voluntarily or through their pharmacy associations. This highlights the need for the health care decision-makers to involve and support community pharmacists in influencing policies and promoting self-care interventions. CONCLUSION: Self-care interventions can increase individuals' choice and autonomy over SRH. Supporting community pharmacists will definitely strengthen SRH in the EMR and may help make the health system more efficient and more targeted.","El Bizri, Luna; Jarrar, Laila Ghazi; Ali, Wael K Ali; Omar, Abdifatah H",Health Res Policy Syst,,303

Objectives: The objective was to understand the spatial distribution and trends of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Mumbai during the lockdown period and draw insights for effective actions. Methods: Spatial and trend analysis was conducted to trace the spread of the virus during the lockdown period in April 2020. The administrative divisions of Mumbai, in the form of wards and zones, have been used as units of analysis. Results: Greater Mumbai area occupies only 0.015% of the landmass of India, but is contributing to over 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in India. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have increased over 375 times within 50 days of the lockdown. An analysis of trends across the wards during the 3-week period (April 4 to April 25) shows a skewed pattern, with three zones out of six contributing to the vast majority of cases in Mumbai. The wards with higher formal economic activity are relatively less affected than the other wards. The test positivity rate in Mumbai is much higher than the rest of India. Conclusion: The study suggests that the virus had already spread to the community in Mumbai before the lockdown started.","Mukherjee, Kanchan",Indian J Public Health,,303

Matériels et méthodes Un bilan à distance en hôpital de jour a été proposé systématiquement à tous les soignants ayant présenté une infection à Covid-19 au décours de la V1. Le bilan comportait un bilan somatique systématique et orienté en fonction des symptômes, des ateliers de groupe (chorale, façon ludique de travailler la respiration et jeu Trivial-Covid, façon ludique d’aborder différents domaines de connaissance de l’infection), des scores HAD, anxiété (A) et dépression (D), et un entretien psychologique. Résultats Parmi les 142 soignants concernés, 120 ont accepté le bilan(85%) réalisé entre fin avril et début juillet. Quatre soignants ont été exclus de l’analyse car infection à Covid-19 non prouvée biologiquement. Au total, 100 femmes et 16 hommes, d’âge moyen 43 ans [22–65] ont réalisé le bilan en moyenne 67jours après la PCR+, 54 IDE/cadre, 34 AS, 11 médecins, 8 ASH et 7 administratifs. La plupart (93) n’avait aucune comorbidité, 14 avaient une HTA, 6 un diabète et 7 un asthme. Seuls 8 (7%) étaient fumeurs, dont 5 moins de 5 cig/jour). Cinq avaient été hospitalisés. Presque tous avaient eu un arrêt de travail (111/116), en médiane 18jours. Des scores significatifs HAD-A&gt;8 étaient retrouvés chez 33/111, et HAD-D&gt;8 chez 17/111. À la question : « Par rapport à votre état antérieur, diriez-vous que vous avez complètement récupéré (ou symptômes mineurs qui n’affectent pas leur vie quotidienne) »? 77 (66 %) ont répondu oui. Cependant 64 signalaient une persistance de signes, majoritairement asthénie (25) et dyspnée d’effort (25). Le bilan a dépisté 3 anémies, 2 possibles HTA, un nodule pulmonaire, un nodule surrénalien et une cytolyse hépatique. Nous n’avons pas trouvé de relation significative entre une sévérité de l’infection (hospitalisation, AT&gt;30jours, nombre de signes cliniques&gt;10, scores HAD A et D&gt;8) et les caractéristiques sociodémographiques des soignants (sexe, âge, fonction). Cependant globalement les effectifs étaient faibles, le nombre d’hommes était sous représenté, ainsi que les médecins, 8 ayant refusé le bilan proposé. Une échelle de satisfaction était effectuée à la fin du bilan (0–10), et les soignants ont été très satisfaits du bilan proposé, 9,5 (moyenne), 10 (médiane). Conclusion Dans une série de petite taille mais presque exhaustive de soignants infectés par la Covid-19, un bilan à M2 de l’infection a retrouvé chez 2/3 des personnes des symptômes persistants, même si n’affectant pas forcément leur vie quotidienne. Un niveau d’anxiété significatif était retrouvé chez 1/3 des soignants. Le bilan a été très bien accepté (85 %), et les soignants très satisfaits de cette prise en charge multidisciplinaire à distance.","Khuong-Josses, M.

SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes seasonal outbreaks with a case fatality rate of ~37â%. Here we show that there exists a theoretical possibility of future recombination events between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RNA. Through computational analyses, we have identified homologous genomic regions within the ORF1ab and S genes that could facilitate recombination, and have analysed co-expression patterns of the cellular receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, ACE2 and DPP4, respectively, to identify human anatomical sites that could facilitate co-infection. Furthermore, we have investigated the likely susceptibility of various animal species to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing known virus spike protein-receptor interacting residues. In conclusion, we suggest that a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RNA is possible and urge public health laboratories in high-risk areas to develop diagnostic capability for the detection of recombined coronaviruses in patient samples.","Banerjee, Arinjay; Doxey, Andrew C; Tremblay, Benjamin J-M; Mansfield, Michael J; Subudhi, Sonu; Hirota, Jeremy A; Miller, Matthew S; McArthur, Andrew G; Mubareka, Samira; Mossman, Karen",J. gen. virol,,303

In addition to histones, some HDACs also deacetylate transcription factors and specific cytoplasmic proteins.Monocytes, as part of the innate immune system, maintain tissue homeostasis and help fight infections and cancer. In these cells, HDACs are involved in multiple processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, inflammatory response, infections, and tumorigenesis. Here, a systematic description of the role that most HDACs play in these functions is reviewed. Specifically, some HDACs induce a pro-inflammatory response and play major roles in host defense. Conversely, other HDACs reprogram monocytes and macrophages towards an immunosuppressive phenotype. The right balance between both types helps monocytes to respond correctly to the different physiological/pathological stimuli. However, aberrant expressions or activities of specific HDACs are associated with autoimmune diseases along with other chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, or cancer.This paper critically reviews the interesting and extensive knowledge regarding the role of some HDACs in these pathologies. It also shows that as yet, very little progress has been made toward the goal of finding effective HDAC-targeted therapies. However, given their obvious potential, we conclude that it is worth the effort to develop monocyte-specific drugs that selectively target HDAC subtypes with the aim of finding effective treatments for diseases in which our innate immune system is involved.","Tordera, Rosa María; Cortés-Erice, María",Rev. physiol. biochem. pharmacol,,303

303098,Rapid Transition of a PICU Space and Staff to Adult Coronavirus Disease 2019 ICU Care,2021,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated neurotrophin (NF) levels and their impact on in vitro cell wound healing in eye drops from differently prepared blood sources (cord blood [CB], and peripheral blood [PB]) in the same donor, to avoid intrasubject biological variability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy adult donor PB samples, and twenty CB samples acquired at the time of delivery were processed to obtain serum (S), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-poor plasma (PPP), and S retrieved from PRP after activation with Ca-gluconate (PRP-R). The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were assessed with a Luminex xMAP (Luminex Corporation), and by using multikine kits from R&D system, and were statistically analysed in the eight different preparations. The impact of S, PRP, PPP, PRP-R from both sources on a cell line responding to NF supplementation (MIO-M1, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK) was tested with a scratch wound assay, and analysed by IncuCyte S3 equipment. RESULTS: All the preparations from CB showed higher NF levels, except for BDNF where no difference was found as compared to PB. PRP showed higher NF levels with respect to S, PPP and PRP-R in this decreasing order. Younger donors in PB contributed with higher NF levels. The scratch assay showed different cell migration results, with a complete wound closure only recorded with the supplementation of CB-S, and a progressive reduction by using PRP, PRP-R, and PPP from both sources. DISCUSSION: Protocols of preparation and choice of blood source determine different NF levels in the final products. The therapeutic use of a natural neurotrophin pool from blood sources might have a clinical impact in several different settings. Efforts are needed to standardise the manufacturing and the product content in order to establish and modulate the posology of the final supplementation.","Valente, Sabrina; Curti, Nico; Giampieri, Enrico; Randi, Vanda; Donadei, Chiara; Buzzi, Marina; Versura, Piera","Blood transfus.

Furthermore, obesity is increasingly considered as a yet another risk factor, particularly, because it has been observed that people suffering from excessive body weight may experience a more severe course of COVID-19 infection. On the basis of current research, in our nonsystematic review, we have investigated the extent to which obesity can affect the SARS-CoV-2 course and identify the potential mechanisms of the disease.

Issues discussed in this article include various methods for achieving good translations, the appropriateness of revising instrument components prior to empirical analyses, determining the number of factors to extract in exploratory factor analyses (EFA), and the usefulness of EFA versus confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in determining factorial validity. We also cover methods of analyses that have been infrequently utilised by body image scholars, including exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM), bifactor model analyses, and various methods for establish measurement invariance.

The UK has been particularly affected and has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and well-being in the UK during a period of ‘lockdown’ (15th–21st May 2020) and the specific role of Psychological Flexibility as a potential mitigating process. We observed clinically high levels of distress in our sample (N = 555). However, psychological flexibility was significantly and positively associated with greater wellbeing, and inversely related to anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related distress. Avoidant coping behaviour was positively associated with all indices of distress and negatively associated with wellbeing, while engagement in approach coping only demonstrated weaker associations with outcomes of interest. No relationship between adherence to government guidelines and psychological flexibility was found. In planned regression models, psychological flexibility demonstrated incremental predictive validity for all distress and wellbeing outcomes (over and above both demographic characteristics and COVID-19-specific coping responses). Furthermore, psychological flexibility and COVID-19 outcomes were only part-mediated by coping responses to COVID-19, supporting the position that psychological flexibility can be understood as an overarching response style that is distinct from established conceptualisations of coping. We conclude that psychological flexibility represents a promising candidate process for understanding and predicting how an individual may be affected by, and cope with, both the acute and longer-term challenges of the pandemic.","Dawson, David L.; Golijani-Moghaddam, Nima",J.

Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to identify factors associated with a false-positive test.Results: After first positive PCR in Ugandan samples the sensitivity was: 45% (95% CI 24,68) at 0-7 days; 79% (95%CI 64,91) 8-14 days; and 76% (95%CI 50,93) >15 days.

METHODS: We conducted a survey of 2714 low-income respondents nationwide from June 29, 2020 to July 21, 2020. A proportional odds logit model was employed to estimate the associations between food insecurity and anxiety and between food insecurity and depression. RESULTS: Food insecurity is associated with a 257% higher risk of anxiety and a 253% higher risk of depression. Losing a job during the pandemic is associated with a 32% increase in risk for anxiety and a 27% increase in risk for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity caused by the pandemic was associated with increased risk of mental illness. The relative risk of mental illness from being food insecure is almost three-fold that of losing a job during the pandemic. Public health measures should focus on getting direct subsidies of food purchases to poor families, especially families with children. They should also reduce the stigma and shame that is associated with accepting charitable foods.","Fang, Di; Thomsen, Michael R; Nayga, Rodolfo M",BMC Public Health,,303

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches, due to a lack of diagnostic capacity, and their application to only a small proportion of the population. As in previous pandemics, statistics, particularly the proportion of the population infected, are believed to be widely underestimated. Furthermore, analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers. Threfore, community-scale surveillance, including wastewater-based epidemiology, can bridge the broader community and the clinic, becoming a valuable indirect epidemiological prediction tool for SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic viruses.

Reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed in COVID-19 patients. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between LDL-C levels and the prognosis of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. A total of 211 severe and critical COVID-19 patients were enrolled and divided into four groups according to the LDL-C levels, including 53 patients in Group A (LDL-C &gt;= 2.71 mmol/L), 53 patients in Group B (2.28 &lt;= LDL-C &lt; 2.71 mmol/L), 53 patients in Group C (1.83 &lt;= LDL-C &lt; 2.28 mmol/L) and 52 patients in Group D (LDL-C &lt; 1.83 mmol/L). LDL-C levels were lower in critically ill patients than in severe patients. The main symptoms before admission, characteristics on admission and comorbidities of enrolled patients did not differ among the four groups. Compared with patients with high LDL-C levels, patients with low LDL-C levels were more likely to have immune and inflammation dysfunction, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction on admission. The proportions of patients with shock and acute cardiac injury, of those admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and of those treated with mechanical ventilation were inversely related to LDL-C level. The mortality of COVID-19 patients increased with LDL-C reduction. Serum LDL-C levels of COVID-19 patients was negatively correlated with CRP level, but positively correlated with lymphocyte count, as shown by Pearson correlation analysis. Proportional hazard models showed that low LDL-C levels were associated with increased risk of hospitalization death, cardiac injury and admission to the ICU. Taken together, these results suggest that decreased LDL-C levels indicate poor prognosis of severe and critical COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, M.; Luo, Z.; He, H.; Shen, B.; Liang, J.; Zhang, J.; Ye, J.; Xu, Y.; Wang, Z.; Ye, D.; Wang, M.; Wan, J.",Frontiers in Medicine,,303

371238,Positive end-expiratory pressure in COVID-19-related ARDS: Do not forget the airway closure,2021,"Proteins and their mimics that contain negatively charged sequences are important in natural and biomimetic mineralization. The mechanism by which these sequences affect calcium phosphate mineralization is not well understood. Here, peptides containing different numbers of repeat units of contiguous glutamic acid residues, oligo(l-glutamic acid)n (n = 3, 7, 8, 10), were investigated with regards to the mechanism in delaying the crystallization of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) while holding the amount of carboxylic acid groups in solution constant. Increasing peptide chain length increases the stability of ACP at a certain total amount of carboxylic acid groups in solution. This effect is shown to be due to stronger binding as well as binding to more calcium ions per peptide by the longer oligopeptides compared to the shorter ones. It is proposed that these associations delay the structural rearrangement of calcium ions and the dehydration of ACP, which are required for the crystallization of hydroxyapatite. The initial nucleation and the local structure of ACP, however, do not vary with chain length. This second part of a two-part series provides an improved mechanistic understanding of how organic additives, especially those with contiguous acidic amino acid sequences, modulate the kinetics of calcium phosphate precipitation and phase transformation.","Ustriyana, Putu; Michel, F Marc; Wilson, Michael C; Harmon, Emma; Chen, Jiahui; Liu, Tianbo; Sahai, Nita",J Phys Chem B,,303

The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are two inter-dependent mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i) antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins, and (ii) probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species.","Azgari, Cem; Kilinc, Zeynep; Turhan, Berk; Circi, Defne; Adebali, Ogun",Viruses,,303

375371,Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Critically Ill Children: A Narrative Review of the Literature,2020,"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rampant in the world and is a serious threat to global health. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in various environmental media, which speeds up the pace of the virus becoming a global biological pollutant. Because many engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are capable of inducing anti-microbial activity, ENMs provide excellent solutions to overcome the virus pandemic, for instance by application as protective coatings, biosensors, or nano-agents. To tackle some mechanistic issues related to the impact of ENMs on SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the molecular interactions between carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and a SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment (i.e., a model molecule of frameshift stimulation element from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome) using molecular mechanics simulations. The interaction affinity between the CNPs and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment increased in the order of fullerenes < graphenes < carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, we developed quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to describe the interactions of 17 different types of CNPs from three dimensions with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment. The QSAR models on the interaction energies of CNPs with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment show high goodness-of-fit and robustness. Molecular weight, surface area, and the sum of degrees of every carbon atom were found to be the primary structural descriptors of CNPs determining the interactions. Our research not only offers a theoretical insight into the adsorption/separation and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, but also allows to design novel ENMs which act efficiently on the genetic material RNA of SARS-CoV-2. This contributes to minimizing the challenge of time-consuming and labor-intensive virus experiments under high risk of infection, whilst meeting our precautionary demand for options to handle any new versions of the coronavirus that might emerge in the future.","Zhang, Fan; Wang, Zhuang; Vijver, Martina G; Peijnenburg, Willie J G M",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,303

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a cross-sectional online survey questionnaire. Findings: The mean knowledge score among the 375 respondents was 75.14% (SD ± 19.1), with 195 (55.1%) of the respondents scoring below 80%. Students who believed that COVID-19 education was sufficient were more likely to have lower knowledge levels (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.15;2.94). While most respondents were aware of their vulnerability to the virus, they did not see themselves at risk of becoming infected. The percentage of respondents reported to have some form of mental health issues was 49.7%. The three most important factors in influencing mental health were age, history of mental health issues, and the way news was reported. Education quality was less affected for those who received online schooling (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.94). Practical implications: Education about COVID-19 should be strengthened by capitalizing on existing online and offline learning platforms to frequently update new or changing information.

Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed by internet-based snowball sampling technique. A questionnaire with questions about different content was applied, and then analyzed the following two parameters: participants' Brazilian region and professional's specialty. Results: A total of 413 e-questionnaires from all Brazilian regions were considered valid. There were no significant differences among biosafety measures adopted by participants from different Brazilian regions (p&#8805;0.05), except for those from North region, which have applied less previous oral antisepsis, temperature screening, and specific anamnesis tracking COVID-19 symptoms (p&lt;0.05).

386555,A Shorter Symptom Onset to Remdesivir Treatment (SORT) Interval Is Associated with a Lower Mortality in Moderate to Severe COVID-19: A Real-World Analysis,2021,"Background: The neuropsychiatric disorders due to post-streptococcal autoimmune complications such as Sydenham's chorea (SC) are associated with acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (ARF/RHD). An animal model that exhibits characteristics of both cardiac and neurobehavioral defects in ARF/RHD would be an important adjunct for future studies. Since age, gender, strain differences, and genotypes impact on the development of autoimmunity, we investigated the behavior of male and female Wistar and Lewis rat strains in two age cohorts (<6 weeks and >12 weeks) under normal husbandry conditions and following exposure to group A streptococcus (GAS). Methods: Standard behavioral assessments were performed to determine the impairments in fine motor control (food manipulation test), gait and balance (beam walking test), and obsessive-compulsive behavior (grooming and marble burying tests). Furthermore, electrocardiography, histology, and behavioral assessments were performed on male and female Lewis rats injected with GAS antigens. Results: For control Lewis rats there were no significant age and gender dependent differences in marble burying, food manipulation, beam walking and grooming behaviors. In contrast significant age-dependent differences were observed in Wistar rats in all the behavioral tests except for food manipulation. Therefore, Lewis rats were selected for further experiments to determine the effect of GAS. After exposure to GAS, Lewis rats demonstrated neurobehavioral abnormalities and cardiac pathology akin to SC and ARF/RHD, respectively. Conclusion: We have characterised a new model that provides longitudinal stability of age-dependent behavior, to simultaneously investigate both neurobehavioral and cardiac abnormalities associated with post-streptococcal complications.","Rafeek, Rukshan A M; Lobbe, Catherine M; Wilkinson, Ethan C; Hamlin, Adam S; Andronicos, Nicholas M; McMillan, David J; Sriprakash, Kadaba S; Ketheesan, Natkunam",Animal Model Exp Med,,303

METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey study, 98 PA students completed surveys measuring SES, overinvolved parenting, grit (passion), grit (perseverance), self-reported GPA, and perceived stress. RESULTS: More overinvolved parenting was reported by PA students under the age of 25 years compared to those over the age of 25. Lower SES predicted higher perceived stress. After controlling for SES, grit (perseverance) partially mediated the relationship between overinvolved parenting and perceived stress. Neither parenting style nor grit was associated with GPA. CONCLUSIONS: Younger PA students reported higher levels of overinvolved parenting. The relationship between experiences with overinvolved parenting and current levels of stress in PA school is partially explained by reduced gritty resilience.","Francis, Andrea P; Drake, Nicole; Chen, Matthew; Young, Lauren",J Physician Assist Educ,,303
388580,Commentary: Engineering antibody therapies may be the future of therapeutics,2020,"Unfortunately, there is limited research on coronavirus survival of food products and also food processing. The knowledge of the physical and chemical characteristics of coronaviruses mostly comes from the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV physical (i.e., thermal processing, chilling and freezing, microwave irradiation, ultraviolet light, gamma irradiation, high hydrostatic pressure) and chemical (acidification and use of common disinfectants in the food industry like chlorinated derivatives and ozone) are means which could be used to inactive the coronaviruses or reduce the infection. These methods can be applied individually or in combination to act better performance. Thermal processing is one of the most effective methods for inactive coronavirus. Heating at 75°C (15-60 min) and 65°C (1 min) was the best temperature for inactive SARS-CoV and MERS virus, respectively. Among irradiation methods (microwave, UV, and gamma), the most effective one is UVC rays. Moreover, the use of disinfectant like chlorinated derivatives is appropriate way to disinfect food product surfaces. Novelty impact statement: This review provided updated information on effective strategies for inactive coronavirus that can be used in the food industry. SARS-CoV-2 as a new pandemic coronavirus was initiated from contaminated foods and can be transmitted by close contact, aerosols, and food surfaces. Food preservation (physical and chemical) methods could decrease SARS-CoV-2. Probably, heating and UVC are the most effective approach to inactive SARS-CoV-2. Despite the findings of coronavirus inactivation which were here discussed, much research is still needed for the development of new approaches to overcome the coronavirus.","Farahmandfar, Reza; Asnaashari, Maryam; Hesami, Bakhtiyar",J Food Process Preserv,,303

In addition to those territories on the boundaries of the Empire, Roman military remains and artefacts are recorded in other countries, reflecting the development, expansion and contraction of the Roman Empire as well as trade within and beyond its borders. Since the early 2000s, a project has been on-going to create a series of transnational World Heritage properties for the Frontiers of the Roman Empire, building on existing networking connections established through the International Congress of Roman Frontier Studies and establishing new collaborations and partnerships, from local to international. In recognising the outstanding value to all humanity of our shared cultural heritage, the Limes provide an opportunity to connect communities and countries, as well as engender a sense of local pride in the global importance of remains. This paper is derived from a keynote given at the European Association of Archaeologists virtual conference in 2020, and asks how, when wrestling with global challenges such as Climate Change and the Covid19 pandemic, can World Heritage and Roman Frontiers contribute to our 21st century society?

Here, we present the findings of how expatriates work-day life changed while performing overseas tasks during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and analyze how this new status quo may influence future expatriates' expectations regarding their work-life interface. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 expatriates. Results show that although since the beginning of the quarantine, personal life is interfering in work, causing work-life conflict, the role of the expatriates' family positively impacted their work-life balance, and harmony.

428204,Development of bloodstream infection after tocilizumab treatment for SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has emerged and rapidly spread across the world. The COVID-19 severity is associated to viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary complications. Hyperinflammation, dysfunctional immune response and hypercoagulability state are associated to poor prognosis. Therefore, the repositioning of multi-target drugs to control the hyperinflammation represents an important challenge for the scientific community. Cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase type-3 inhibitor (PDE-3), is an antiplatelet and vasodilator drug, that presents a range of pleiotropic effects, such as antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardioprotective activities. Cilostazol also can inhibit the adenosine uptake, which enhances intracellular cAMP levels. In the lungs, elevated cAMP promotes anti-fibrotic, vasodilator, antiproliferative effects, as well as mitigating inflammatory events. Interestingly, a recent study evaluated antiplatelet FDA-approved drugs through molecular docking-based virtual screening on viral target proteins. This study revealed that cilostazol is a promising drug against COVID-19 by inhibiting both main protease (Mpro) and Spike glycoprotein, reinforcing its use as a promising therapeutic approach for COVID-19. Considering the complexity associated to COVID-19 pathophysiology and observing its main mechanisms, this article raises the hypothesis that cilostazol may act on important targets in development of the disease. This review highlights the importance of drug repurposing to address such an urgent clinical demand safely, effectively and at low cost, reinforcing the main pharmacological actions, to support the hypothesis that a multi-target drug such as cilostazol could play an important role in the treatment of COVID-19.","Motta, Nadia Alice Vieira; Autran, Lis Jappour; Brazão, Stephani Correia; Lopes, Rosane de Oliveira; Scaramello, Christianne Brêtas Vieira; Lima, Gabriel Ferreira; Brito, Fernanda Carla Ferreira de",Int Immunopharmacol,,303

428303,Aerosol Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Inhalation as well as Exhalation Matters for COVID-19,2021,"Background: The risk of cancer patients to develop COVID19 infection is unclear. We aimed to prospectively study cancer patients and oncology healthcare workers for COVID19 serology. In IgG+ cases, immune profile was determined to portray the pattern of immune response to SARS-CoV2. Methods: Cancer patients on active treatment and healthcare workers were enrolled. During the study period (3/2020-6/2020), demographic data and blood were collected at three time points. Expression of IgG, IgM, and IgA were assessed. In SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cases and matched negative cases, we performed mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) analysis on the basis of the expression of surface markers. Results: The study included 164 cancer patients on active intravenous treatment and 107 healthcare workers at the cancer center. No symptomatic cases were reported during the study period. Serology analysis revealed four IgG+ patients (2.4%) and two IgG+ healthcare workers (1.9%)-all were asymptomatic. CyTOF analysis demonstrated substantial reduction in myeloid cells in healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ compared to those who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG-, whereas in cancer patients, the reduction was relatively milder (&#8776;50% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cancer patients compared with &#8776;90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ workers). Conclusion: Our results indicate a similar rate of asymptomatic COVID19 infection in cancer patients and healthcare workers in a longitudinal study throughout the pandemic time. Due to differential immune cell profiles of cancer patients who are treated with immunomodulatory agents, the host response to the SARS-COV2 may play a role in COVID19 course and representation. The immunological perspective of cancer treatments on the risk for COVID19 infection should be further explored.","Goshen-Lago, Tal; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Benguigui, Madeleine; Almog, Ronit; Turgeman, Ilit; Zaltzman, Nelly; Halberthal, Michael; Shaked, Yuval; Ben-Aharon, Irit",,,303

Methods: Data of 615 patients discharged from ASST Ovest Milanese (Milan, Lombardy, Italy) with final diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were retrospectively extracted from electronical medical records from 21 February to 1 May 2020. Patients were descriptively analyzed with respect to the following variables: sex, age, muscular manifestations (myalgia and/or arthralgia), fatigue, respiratory involvement (SARS pneumonia or respiratory failure) and history of falls. Association between patients' characteristics and CK levels was investigated. In addition, the proportion of patients who died following access to the ER was calculated. Finally, the effect of CK levels and other patients' features on mortality was estimated using a logistic regression model. Results: 176 (28.6%) patients had raised serum CK levels. CK levels were significantly associated with history of falls, male gender, SARS pneumonia, respiratory failure and in-hospital death. No correlation was found between hyperckemia and muscular manifestations. Conclusions: Our study provides preliminary evidence that hyperckemia is associated with respiratory failure and fatal outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection.In these patients, among other testing, CK dosage is recommended.","De Rosa, Anna; Verrengia, Elena Pinuccia; Merlo, Ivan; Rea, Federico; Siciliano, Gabriele; Corrao, Giovanni; Prelle, Alessandro",Acta Myol,,303

433112,Commentary: Heroic tales from a national tragedy,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 progresses slowly and negatively affects many people. However, mild to moderate symptoms develop in most infected people, who recover without hospitalization. Therefore, the development of early diagnosis and treatment strategies is essential. One of these methods is proteomic technology based on the blood protein profiling technique. This study aims to classify three COVID-19 positive patient groups (mild, severe, and critical) and a control group based on the blood protein profiling using deep learning (DL), random forest (RF), and gradient boosted trees (GBTs). METHODS: The dataset consists of 93 samples (60 COVID-19 patients, 33 control), and 370 variables obtained from an open-source website. The current dataset contains age, gender, and 368 protein, used to predict the relationship between disease severity and proteins using DL and machine learning approaches (RF, GBTs). An evolutionary algorithm tunes hyperparameters of the models and the predictions are assessed through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, classification error, and kappa performance metrics. RESULTS: The accuracy of RF (96.21%) was higher as compared to DL (94.73%). However, the ensemble classifier GBTs produced the highest accuracy (96.98%). TGB1BP2 in the cardiovascular II panel and MILR1 in the inflammation panel were the two most important proteins associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model (GBTs) achieved the best prediction of disease severity based on the proteins compared to the other algorithms. The results point out that changes in blood proteins associated with the severity of COVID-19 may be used in monitoring and early diagnosis/treatment of the disease.","Yasar, Seyma; Çolak, Cemil; Yologlu, Saim",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,303

Treatments by pharmacological interventions have been reported to impart negative implications on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Therefore, the use of psychotherapeutic interventions to bypass these side-effects and manage depression, anxiety has received a lot of attention. A meta-statistical consensus regarding the intervention is available, but with several limitations. In this study, we attempt to address these limitations and provide the current state of evidence evaluating the influence of psychotherapy on antenatal depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effects of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life during the antenatal stage of pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic identification of literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines on four academic databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. A meta-analysis evaluated the influence of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life as compared to conventional obstetric care. RESULTS: Out of 1146 records, 22 articles including 2146 pregnant women (mean age: 28.6â±â2.8 years) were included in this review. This systematic review presents a 1b level of evidence supporting the use of psychotherapy for reducing depression, anxiety and enhancing maternal quality of life. The meta-analysis reveals the beneficial effects of psychotherapy for reducing depression (Hedgeâg: -0.48), anxiety (-0.47) and enhancing maternal quality of life (0.19) as compared to conventional obstetric care. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic review and meta-analysis recommend the use of psychotherapy as for reducing depression, anxiety and enhancing maternal quality of life during the antenatal stage of pregnancy.","Li, Caixia; Sun, Xiaohua; Li, Qing; Sun, Qian; Wu, Beibei; Duan, Dongyun",Medicine (Baltimore),,303

443590,In Response,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Analytical validation of newly released SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in the clinical laboratory is crucial to ensure sufficient performance in respect to its intended use. We aimed to assess analytical and diagnostic performance of 8 (semi-)quantitative assays detecting anti-nucleocapsid IgG (Euroimmun, Id-Vet) or total Ig (Roche), anti-spike protein IgG (Euroimmun, Theradiag, DiaSorin, Thermo Fisher) or both (Theradiag) and 2 rapid lateral flow assays (LFA) (AAZ-LMB and Theradiag). METHODS: Specificity was evaluated using a cross-reactivity panel of 85 pre-pandemic serum samples. Sensitivity was determined at both the manufacturer's and a 95% specificity cut-off level, using 81 serum samples of patients with a positive rRT-PCR. Sensitivity was determined in function of time post symptoms onset. RESULTS: Specificity for all assays ranged from 92.9% to 100% (Roche and Thermo Fisher) with the exception of the Theradiag IgM LFA (82.4%). Sensitivity in asymptomatic patients ranged between 41.7% and 58.3%. Sensitivity on samples taken <10 days since symptom onset was low (23.3%-66.7%) and increased on samples taken between 10 and 20 days and > 20 days since symptom onset (80%-96% and 92.9%-100%, respectively). From 20 days after symptom onset, the Roche, Id-vet and Thermo Fisher assays all met the sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>97%) targets determined by the WHO. Antibody signal response was significantly higher in the critically ill patient group. CONCLUSION: Antibody detection can complement rRT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially in the later stage, or in asymptomatic patients for epidemiological purposes. Addition of IgM in LFAs did not improve sensitivity.","Mylemans, Marnix; Van Honacker, Eveline; Nevejan, Louis; Van Den Bremt, Stefanie; Hofman, Laura; Poels, Jeroen; Cattoir, Lien; Boel, An; Van Hoovels, Lieve",J Immunol Methods,,303

Cell entry is mediated by the human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). ACE2 and its close homolog angiotensin-converting enzyme I (ACE) are currently discussed candidate genes, in which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could alter binding or entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhance tissue damage in the lung or other organs. This could increase the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genotyping of SNPs in the genes ACE2 and ACE in 297 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 253 SARS-CoV-2-negative tested patients. We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding demographics and clinical characteristics. For ACE2 rs2285666, the GG genotype or G-allele was significantly associated with an almost two-fold increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and a three-fold increased risk to develop serious disease or COVID-19 fatality. In contrast, the ACE polymorphism was not related to infection risk or severity of disease. In a multivariable analysis, the ACE2 rs2285666 G-allele remained as an independent risk factor for serious disease besides the known risk factors male gender and cardiovascular disease.

From the methodological point of view, the study is installed in the interpretive-qualitative perspective, in such a way that 14 semi-structured interviews were carried by physical education teachers from the Maule-Chile region, via team, Zoom, Skype, because of the pandemic, face-to-face contact was impossible. The result of the study shows the impact on the quality of life of teachers and students because of the confinement. The pedagogical reconfiguration that teachers experienced in a matter of days, led them to use different virtual platforms to continue connected with their students, in order to deploy the learning objectives defined by the Chilean Ministry of Education. However, the foregoing shows the scarce possibility of verifying student learning, due to the difficulties of monitoring and feedback.","Almonacid-Fierro, Alejandro Vargas-Vitoria Rodrigo De Carvalho Ricardo Souza Fierro Manuel Almonacid",International Journal of Evaluation and Research in Education,,303

469106,Coronavirus Disease 2019 Intermediate Care Units: Containing Escalation of ICUs,2020,"COVID-19 is a unique disease characterized by extensive pulmonary thrombosis and infected syncytial multinucleated giant cells, relating to extensive tissue damage. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the membrane of infected cells can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation. To study the membrane fusion on S protein, we adopted structural domain search methods to analyze the structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-COV-2 virus in this study. The results showed that the surface glycoprotein (S) had conserved domains of CaMKII: CaMKII_AD, CaATP_NAI, DUF4440, EF-hand, Protein kinase, and SnoaL-like. Comparing to SARS-COV and MERS, only the CaATP_NAI of SARS-COV-2 is in the contact position of the viral membrane and cell membrane. We believed that when the EF-hand domain (“YEQYIKWPWYIWLGF”) of S protein bound to calcium ions, S2 protein had CaMKII protein activities. After the S protein fusion peptide was inserted into the infected cell membrane and fixed the S2 protein on the cell membrane, the CaMKII_AD prompted the S2 protein to form HR1-HR2 six-helix bundles. The HR1-HR2 hexamer had three CaATP_NAI domains (“APAICHDGKAHFPRE”) near the viral membrane (contact position), the CaATPase activated by magnesium ions, and released energy through ATP phosphorylation. The CaATPase drove the HR1-HR2 hexamer fold irreversibly toward the viral membrane. Then the CaATP_NAI and CaMKII_AD domains extended to the outside and combined the viral membrane and the cell membrane so that the contact position formed a thin barrel structure. The hydrated calcium ions are gathered in the barrel structure to create a calcium bridge. The release action of water in contact position caused the instability of the double membrane, triggering lipid mixing and fusion of the membrane. CaATPases disassembled the barrel structure, and HR1-HR2 hexamer is fell into the cytoplasm. The viral membrane fused with the cell membrane on a large scale. The cytoplasmic contents of the virus mixed with the cell. The S protein of the infected cell may bind to the ACE2 receptor of another cell (or also an infected cell) and then achieved membrane fusion through a similar principle, forming cell syncytia, includes syncytial multinucleated giant cells. The membrane fusion could disrupt the calcium homeostasis in human body, and increased the risk of coagulation and vascular calcification.","liu, wenzhong Li hualan",,,303
469491,Uncontrolled Innate and Impaired Adaptive Immune Responses in Patients with COVID-19 ARDS,2020,"Urban mobility needs alternative sustainable travel modes to keep our pandemic cities in motion. Ride-pooling, where a single vehicle is shared by more than one traveller, is not only appealing for mobility platforms and their travellers, but also for promoting the sustainability of urban mobility systems. Yet, the potential of ride-pooling rides to serve as a safe and effective alternative given the personal and public health risks considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is hitherto unknown. To answer this, we combine epidemiological and behavioural shareability models to examine spreading among ride-pooling travellers, with an application for Amsterdam. Findings are at first sight devastating, with only few initially infected travellers needed to spread the virus to hundreds of ride-pooling users. Without intervention, ride-pooling system may substantially contribute to virus spreading. Notwithstanding, we identify an effective control measure allowing to halt the spreading before the outbreaks (at 50 instead of 800 infections) without sacrificing the efficiency achieved by pooling. Fixed matches among co-travellers disconnect the otherwise dense contact network, encapsulating the virus in small communities and preventing the outbreaks.","Kucharski, Rafal; Cats, Oded; Sienkiewicz, Julian",Sci Rep,,303

The N501Y mutation within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of these SARS-CoV-2 variants may enhance binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). However, no molecular explanation for such an enhanced affinity has so far been provided. Here, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Y501 in the mutated RBD can be well-coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, which may increase the overall binding affinity of the RBD for hACE2 by approximately 0.81 kcal·mol-1 .

We think that informing the orthopedic community about the strategy that we adopted both in our hospital and in our Department of Orthopedics could be useful, particularly for those who are facing the pandemic later than Italy. METHODS: Changes were done in our hospital by medical direction to reallocate resources to COVID-19 patients. In the Orthopedic Department, a decrease in the number of beds and surgical activity was stabilized. Since March 13, it has been avoided to perform elective surgery, and since March 16, non-urgent outpatient consultations were abolished. This activity reduction was associated with careful evaluation of staff and patients: extensive periodical swab testing of all healthcare staff and swab testing of all surgical patients were applied. RESULTS: These restrictions determined an overall reduction of all our surgical activities of 30% compared to 2019. We also had a reduction in outpatient clinic activities and admissions to the orthopedic emergency unit. Extensive swab testing has proven successful: of more than 160 people tested in our building, only three COVID-19 positives were found, and of over more than 200 surgical procedures, only two positive patients were found. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive swab test of all people (even if asymptomatic) and proactive tracing and quarantining of potential COVID-19 positive patients may diminish the virus spread.","Ruggieri, P; Trovarelli, G; Angelini, A; Pala, E; Berizzi, A; Donato, D",J Orthop Surg Res,,303

Despite these risks, there have been no consistent statements on surgical guidelines regarding the perioperative screening or management of COVID-19 patients, and we do not have objective global data that describe the current conditions surrounding this issue. This study aimed to clarify the current global surgical practice including COVID-19 screening, preventive measures and in-hospital infection under the COVID-19 pandemic, and to clarify the international gaps on infection control policies among countries worldwide. Methods: During April 2-8, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey on surgical practice was distributed to surgeons worldwide through international surgical societies, social media and personal contacts. Main outcome and measures included preventive measures and screening policies of COVID-19 in surgical practice and centers' experiences of in-hospital COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed by country's cumulative deaths number by April 8, 2020 (high risk, >5000; intermediate risk, 100-5000; low risk, <100). Results: A total of 936 centers in 71 countries responded to the survey (high risk, 330 centers; intermediate risk, 242 centers; low risk, 364 centers). In the majority (71.9%) of the centers, local guidelines recommended preoperative testing based on symptoms or suspicious radiologic findings. Universal testing for every surgical patient was recommended in only 18.4% of the centers. In-hospital COVID-19 infection was reported from 31.5% of the centers, with higher rates in higher risk countries (high risk, 53.6%; intermediate risk, 26.4%; low risk, 14.8%; P < 0.001). Of the 295 centers that experienced in-hospital COVID-19 infection, 122 (41.4%) failed to trace it and 58 (19.7%) reported the infection originating from asymptomatic patients/staff members. Higher risk countries adopted more preventive measures including universal testing, routine testing of hospital staff and use of dedicated personal protective equipment in operation theatres, but there were remarkable discrepancies across the countries. Conclusions: This large international survey captured the global surgical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the insufficient preoperative screening of COVID-19 in the current surgical practice. More intensive screening programs will be necessary particularly in severely affected countries/institutions.

Although the technology to facilitate telemedicine exists and preliminary studies demonstrate promise, multiple technological, financial, and medical barriers may persist in the postpandemic era. SUMMARY: Telemedicine will likely continue to grow and expand within facial plastic surgery moving forward, and we should continue to critically evaluate patient selection, access to care, and strategies for effective implementation to enhance current clinical practices.","Morisada, Megan V; Tollefson, Travis T; Shaye, David A; Steele, Toby O",Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,303

This brief paper introduces a method for estimating $R$ from biased case testing data. Using testing data, rather than hospitalisation or death data, provides a much earlier metric along the symptomatic progression scale. This can be hugely important when fighting the exponential nature of an epidemic. We develop a practical estimator and apply it to Scottish case testing data to infer a current (20 May 2020) $R$ value of $0.74$ with $95\%$ confidence interval $[0.48 - 0.86]$.","Contaldi, Carlo R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12252v1.pdf,303

There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures, including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, which was originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but it strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, which is in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells that were cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of specific sets of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that could be considered for further efficacy testing.","Varghese, Finny S; van Woudenbergh, Esther; Overheul, Gijs J; Eleveld, Marc J; Kurver, Lisa; van Heerbeek, Niels; van Laarhoven, Arjan; Miesen, Pascal; den Hartog, Gerco; de Jonge, Marien I; van Rij, Ronald P",Viruses,,303

Methods: A total of 572 consecutive patients presenting to the ENT clinic and ENT operating theatre, from March 16, 2020 to May 3, 2020, were prospectively included. Demographic and clinical data, admission time, paraclinic testing, management, outcome, and follow-up data were recorded. A retrospective analysis for comparison of findings with the previous year over the same period was conducted. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of strict lockdown guidelines led to a drastic disruption of the ENT service. A decrease in overall practice of 91.1% was observed;compared with the 6,454 patients who had been treated in 2019 over the same period, appointments and medical procedures were restricted to 572 patients in 2020. Mortality rates increased from 0.82% to 4.55%. Certain patients with valid medical issues could not be catered to, while a few patients sought medical services without a valid reason. More than a quarter of admissions (n=157, 27.6%) did not require specific ENT treatment. Patient selection improved when patients presented with a recent ENT problem (odds ratio [OR] 2.39 [1.50-3.81], p=0.0003) or were referred by a physician (OR 5.30 [3.69-7.61], p&lt;0.0001).

Specifically, we analyzed moral decision-making at the microlevel (i.e., individual- and familial-level; Study 1), in decisions with (hypothetical) life-or-death consequences (Study 2), and at the macrolevel (i.e., nationwide virus-mitigation efforts; Study 3). In all studies, participants completed the four individual difference scales and rated their pandemic attitudes on Likert-type agreement scales, and resolved various moral dilemmas in Studies 2 and 3. Consistent with our hypotheses, individuals reported more virus-mitigation efforts in order to protect their families than themselves. In terms of hypothetical life-or-death and nationwide decisions, MHB, BPE, and the DT predicted more confidence and social motivations, whereas BPG predicted more distress.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks of COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality in patients with BP and pemphigus and to delineate determinants of severe COVID-19 illness among these patients. METHODS: A population-based cohort study compared COVID-19 and its complications in patients with BP (n = 1845) and pemphigus (n = 1236) with age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects. RESULTS: The risks of COVID-19 (hazard rate [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.73; P = .691) and COVID-19-associated hospitalization (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.84-2.98; P = .160) was comparable between patients with BP and controls. The risk of COVID-19-associated mortality was higher among patients with BP (HR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.15-6.92; P = .023). The risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44-1.49; P = .496), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.53-3.76; P = .499), and COVID-19-associated mortality (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.15-11.92; P = .789) was similar in patients with pemphigus and their controls. Systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants did not predispose COVID-19-positive BP and pemphigus patients to a more severe illness. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BP experience increased COVID-19-associated mortality and should be monitored closely. Maintaining systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive adjuvant agents during the pandemic is not associated with worse outcomes.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Weinstein, Orly; Schmidt, Enno; Ludwig, Ralf J; Cohen, Arnon D",J.

508303,Findings of serial computed tomography imaging in patients with coronavirus disease-19,2020,"Objective: The COVID-19 lockdown caused unprecedented decline in environmental noise pollution. We aimed to evaluate the impact of aircraft noise exposure decrease during lockdown on blood pressure (BP) and selected hypertensionmediated organ damages. Design and method: As previously reported (J Hypertens. 2019;37) in 2015 (1st observation) we examined group of inhabitants exposed to high (&gt;60 dB) aircraft noise living near Cracow Airport (n=101), and compared them to unexposed group (&lt;55 dB) (n=100). In June 2020, 4 months after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions introduction, we reassessed (2nd observation) 74 and 75 participants from previously exposed and unexposed groups, respectively, using the same study protocol. We collected medical history, office and ambulatory BP, echocardiographic and arterial stiffness data. Results: In exposed to aircraft noise group the prevalence of arterial hypertension increased from 1st to 2nd observation (P&lt;0.05). During lockdown in the noise exposed group office and 24 hour diastolic BP (DBP, P&lt;0.022) decreased signifi-cantly, which was accompanied by a significant drop in annoyance (P=0.006). In this group in 2nd observation DBP was significantly lower than estimated DBP (i.e. calculated as a sum of DBP at 1st observation and parameter estimates of crosssectional association of DBP and age multiplied by 5.5 year-time period between observations) (P=0.047). The obtained decline in DBP from 1st to 2nd observation was grater in noise exposed than unexposed participants, even after adjustment for covariates. The carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), initially higher in noise exposed group, decreased from 1st to 2nd observation in both groups, however this was more pronounced in the exposed than unexposed group (P=0.003). In 1st observation PWV in noise exposed participants did not show any relationship with age (Parameter Estimate (PE)=0.01 m/s/year;P= 0.71), while in 2nd observation, during aircraft noise decline caused by COVID-19 lockdown, the expected positive relation of PWV with age was reinstituted (PE=0.15 m/s/year;P&lt;0.001). Conclusions: As our previous study indicated, aircraft noise exposure may increase BP and accelerate arterial stiffening. The decrease in BP and PWV due to noise intensity diminution, observed during COVID-19 lockdown, in fact provides evidence for this observation.","Wojciechowska, W.; Januszewicz, A.; Drozdz, T.; Rojek, M.; Baczalska, J.; Terlecki, M.; Kurasz, K.; Olszanecka, A.; Smolski, M.; Prejbisz, A.; Dobrowolski, P.; Hryniewiecki, T.; Kreutz, R.; Rajzer, M.",Journal of Hypertension,,303

Unsupervised time series clustering over symptom presentation was performed on data collected from a training dataset of completed cases enlisted early from the COVID Symptom Study Smartphone application, yielding six distinct symptom presentations. Clustering was validated on an independent replication dataset between 1 and 28 May 2020. Using the first 5 days of symptom logging, the ROC-AUC (receiver operating characteristic - area under the curve) of need for respiratory support was 78.8%, substantially outperforming personal characteristics alone (ROC-AUC 69.5%).

512578,Coronavirus Disease 2019 ICU Patients Have Higher-Than-Expected Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-Adjusted Mortality and Length of Stay Than Viral Pneumonia ICU Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Substance use places a substantial burden on our communities, both economically and socially. In light of COVID-19, it is predicted that as many as 75,000 more people will die from alcohol and other substance use and suicide as a result of isolation, new mental health concerns, and various other stressors related to the pandemic. Public awareness campaigns that aim to destigmatize substance use and help individuals have meaningful conversations with friends, coworkers, or family members to address substance use concerns are a timely and cost-effective means of augmenting existing behavioral health efforts related to substance use. These types of interventions can supplement the work being done by existing public health initiatives. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examines the impact of the One Degree: Shift the Influence role play simulation, designed to teach family, friends, and coworkers to effectively manage problem-solving conversations with individuals that they are concerned about regarding substance use. METHODS: Participants recruited for this mixed methods study completed a presurvey, the simulation, and a postsurvey, and were sent a 6-week follow-up survey. The simulation involves practicing a role play conversation with a virtual human coded with emotions, a memory, and a personality. A virtual coach provides feedback in using evidence-based communication strategies such as motivational interviewing. RESULTS: A matched sample analysis of variance revealed significant increases at follow-up in composite attitudinal constructs of preparedness (P<.001) and self-efficacy (P=.01), including starting a conversation with someone regarding substance use, avoiding upsetting someone while bringing up concerns, focusing on observable facts, and problem solving. Qualitative data provided further evidence of the simulation's positive impact on the ability to have meaningful conversations about substance use. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that conversation-based simulations like One Degree: Shift the Influence that use role play practice can teach individuals to use evidence-based communication strategies and can cost-effectively reach geographically dispersed populations to support public health initiatives for primary prevention.","Albright, Glenn; Khalid, Nikita; Shockley, Kristen; Robinson, Kelsey; Hughes, Kevin; Pace-Danley, Bethany",JMIR Form Res,,303
513127,Coronavirus disease-19-associated acute pancreatitis: Report of three cases and review of case reports,2021,"Introduction. The coexistence of two global pandemics, COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been implicated with worse prognosis. The association of diabetes and worse outcome in viral infections stems from the detrimental effect of hyperglycemia to the control of viremia and different components of the host response. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients and establish the association of baseline glycemic status and COVID-19 outcomes among persons with type 2 diabetes. Methodology. A single center, retrospective study among adult persons with type 2 diabetes diagnosed with COVID-19 in Makati Medical Center from March 1 to August 31, 2020. A total of 156 medical records (26%) out of 584 confirmed cases were reviewed. Data were collected on diabetes status, comorbid conditions and laboratory findings. Both Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression models were fitted. To assess the factors associated with mortality as a dichotomous endpoint (died/survived), binary logistic regression was performed. On the other hand, a time-to-mortality analysis was performed using Cox regression. For the effect estimate, we refer to hazard ratios in the Cox proportional hazards model and odds ratios in the logistic regression models. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex and two models were additionally adjusted for any presence of comorbidity. Results. A total of 156 COVID-19 patients with diabetes were analyzed. Upon admission, 13% were in diabetic ketosis, 4% were in a state of DKA, and 2% had hypoglycemia. About 5%, 33%, 26%, and 36% of patients had mild, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19, respectively. Between non-survivors and survivors, the latter group were significantly younger in age (p&lt;.003) and had less ICU admissions (p&lt;.001). Although DKA status upon admission seemed to result in increased odds of non-survival (cOR 5.8 [95% CI 1.1-30.7]), no other feature in the glycemic history was significantly associated with mortality outcome after having adjusted for age and sex. Death in this study was limited to patients with severe or critical disease. Conclusion. The risk of mortality is five times greater among patients admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis. The incidence of complications were also significantly greater and mortality was limited to patients with severe or critical disease.","Sarigumba, M.; Aragon, J.; Kanapi, M.

514457,Reply to: Aerosol Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Inhalation as Well as Exhalation Matters for COVID-19,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS­CoV­2) is a novel ß coronavirus that is the etiological agent of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19) that at the time of writing (June 16, 2020) has infected almost 6 million people with some 450,000 deaths. These numbers are still rising daily. Most (some 80%) cases of COVID­19 infection are asymptomatic, a substantial number of cases (15%) require hospitalization and an additional fraction of patients (5%) need recovery in intensive care units. Mortality for COVID­19 infection appears to occur globally between 0.1 and 0.5% of infected patients although the frequency of lethality is significantly augmented in the elderly and in patients with other comorbidities. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and episodes of thromboembolism that may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) represent the primary causes of lethality during COVID­19 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that thrombotic diathesis is due to multiple derangements of the coagulation system including marked elevation of D­dimer that correlate negatively with survival. We propose here that the thromboembolic events and eventually the development of DIC provoked by SARS­CoV­2 infection may represent a secondary anti­phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We will apply both Baconian inductivism and Cartesian deductivism to prove that secondary APS is likely responsible for coagulopathy during the course of COVID­19 infection. Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this are also discussed.","Cavalli, Eugenio; Bramanti, Alessia; Ciurleo, Rosella; Tchorbanov, Andrey I; Giordano, Antonio; Fagone, Paolo; Belizna, Cristina; Bramanti, Placido; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Nicoletti, Ferdinando",Int J Mol Med,,303
514545,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for a COVID-19 Pediatric Patient: A Successful Outcome,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Genomic Risk Scores (GRS) successfully demonstrated the ability of genetics to identify those individuals at high risk for complex traits including immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). We aimed to test the performance of GRS in the prediction of risk for systemic sclerosis (SSc) for the first time. METHODS: Allelic effects were obtained from the largest SSc Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to date (9 095 SSc and 17 584 healthy controls with European ancestry). The best-fitting GRS was identified under the additive model in an independent cohort that comprised 400 patients with SSc and 571 controls. Additionally, GRS for clinical subtypes (limited cutaneous SSc and diffuse cutaneous SSc) and serological subtypes (anti-topoisomerase positive (ATA+) and anti-centromere positive (ACA+)) were generated. We combined the estimated GRS with demographic and immunological parameters in a multivariate generalised linear model. RESULTS: The best-fitting SSc GRS included 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discriminated between patients with SSc and controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)=0.673). Moreover, the GRS differentiated between SSc and other IMIDs, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome. Finally, the combination of GRS with age and immune cell counts significantly increased the performance of the model (AUC=0.787). While the SSc GRS was not able to discriminate between ATA+ and ACA+ patients (AUC<0.5), the serological subtype GRS, which was based on the allelic effects observed for the comparison between ACA+ and ATA+ patients, reached an AUC=0.693. CONCLUSIONS: GRS was successfully implemented in SSc. The model discriminated between patients with SSc and controls or other IMIDs, confirming the potential of GRS to support early and differential diagnosis for SSc.","Bossini-Castillo, Lara; Villanueva-Martin, Gonzalo; Kerick, Martin; Acosta-Herrera, Marialbert; López-Isac, Elena; Simeón, Carmen P; Ortego-Centeno, Norberto; Assassi, Shervin; Hunzelmann, Nicolas; Gabrielli, Armando; de Vries-Bouwstra, J K; Allanore, Yannick; Fonseca, Carmen; Denton, Christopher P; Radstake, Timothy Rdj; Alarcón-Riquelme, Marta Eugenia; Beretta, Lorenzo; Mayes, Maureen D; Martin, Javier",Ann. rheum. dis,,303
517560,Camostat Mesylate May Reduce Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Sepsis: A First Observation,2020,"PM 2.5and PM 10could increase the risk for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in the general public and severely limit the sustainable development in urban areas. Land use regression models are effective in predicting the spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants, and have been widely used in many cities in Europe, North America and China. To reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM 2.5and PM 10in Xi'an during the heating seasons, the authors established two regression prediction models using PM 2.5and PM 10concentrations from 181 monitoring stations and 87 independent variables. The model results are as follows: for PM 2.5, R 2= 0.713 and RMSE = 8.355 μg/m 3; for PM 10, R 2= 0.681 and RMSE = 14.842 μg/m 3. In addition to the traditional independent variables such as area of green space and road length, the models also include the numbers of pollutant discharging enterprises, restaurants, and bus stations. The prediction results reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM 2.5and PM 10in the heating seasons of Xi'an. These results also indicate that the spatial distribution of pollutants is closely related to the layout of industrial land and the location of enterprises that generate air pollution emissions. Green space can mitigate pollution, and the contribution of traffic emission is less than that of industrial emission. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply land use regression models to the Fenwei Plain, a heavily polluted area in China. It provides a scientific foundation for urban planning, land use regulation, air pollution control, and public health policy making. It also establishes a basic model for population exposure assessment, and promotes the sustainability of urban environments.","Han, Li; Zhao, Jingyuan; Gao, Yuejing; Gu, Zhaolin; Xin, Kai; Zhang, Jianxin",Sustainable Cities Soc.,,303

519941,Gynecologic Cancer: New and Follow-Up Patient Appointments in Botswana During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: This study aim to explore the intentions, motivators and barriers of the general public to vaccinate against COVID-19, using both the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among Israeli adults aged 18 years and older from May 24 to June 24, 2020. The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB predictor variables as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R squared = 0.78). Men (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 1.58-11.93), educated respondents (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.44-8.67) and respondents who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the previous year (OR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.22-9.00) stated higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.79-7.22), of perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.58-3.51) and of cues to action (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.38-2.87), according to HBM, and if they reported higher levels of subjective norms (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 2.15-4.30) and self-efficacy (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.54-2.72) according to TPB. Although half of the respondents reported they had not received influenza vaccine last year, 40% of them intended to receive influenza vaccine in the coming winter and 66% of them intended to receive COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Providing data on the public perspective and predicting intention for COVID-19 vaccination using HBM and TPB is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers and can help better guide compliance as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to the public.","Shmueli, Liora",BMC Public Health,,303

522365,Safety and Outcomes of Prolonged Usual Care Prone Position Mechanical Ventilation to Treat Acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure,2021,"BACKGROUND: This article presents a discussion about the representation of Syrian refugees in Turkish news media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Media play a critical role during pandemics by affecting values, opinions, public knowledge about stigmatized groups. When media ignore and stereotypically represent a social group, the social value of the group decreases, and their problems are trivialized. METHOD: I analyzed data provided by Media Monitoring Center which is an independent media company in Turkey. Sample was selected to reveal news representation of Syrian refugees between March 11, 2020 (the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey) and August 20, 2020 (the time of this research). Mostly watched television evening (prime) news, the most widely circulated newspapers, and the most visited online news platforms were analyzed. By using content analysis method, the news stories about Syrian refugees were examined. RESULTS: It has been revealed that Turkish news media overwhelmingly acclaimed for Turkey's polices on Syrian refugees and the criticized the European Union policies towards refugees in the news stories. Even though almost 4 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey, with the largest refugee population in the world, Turkish news media ignored the plight of Syrian refugees. CONCLUSION: Results of the study demonstrate that Syrian refugees were symbolically annihilated by Turkish news media during the COVID-19 pandemic. The concealment of information and symbolic annihilation of disadvantaged groups could potentially cause health disparities and irreparable harm to public health. Moreover, inequities exacerbate when predicaments of stigmatized groups are ignored in the news media. Further studies are needed to reveal the impact of the media on health disparities among stigmatized groups during the pandemics.","Yücel, Alev",Int J Equity Health,,303

Here, we identified the role of an RNA-binding protein, CUG-BP Elav-like family member 6 (CELF6), in the TNBC development and paclitaxel (PTX) chemoresistance. METHODS: Stable CELF6-overexpressing cell lines were established in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell proliferation was determined using cell counting, two-dimensional colony formation, and MTT assay. Meanwhile, cell migration and cell invasion were detected by Transwell assay. Furthermore, the downstream target gene of CELF6 was identified and the direct interaction was further determined by luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down. Additionally, the PTX resistant cell line was established to determine the role of CELF6 in PTX resistance. RESULTS: CELF6 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell invasion. Mechanistically, Fructose-Bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) was identified as the target gene of CELF6 and stabilized by CELF6 via binding 3'UTR. CELF6 overexpression mediated inhibition in TNBC development was dependent on FBP1. Moreover, CELF6 overexpression increased the sensitivity to PTX treatment. CONCLUSION: CELF6 functions as a tumor suppressor by upregulating FBP 1 expression via stabilizing its mRNA, and thereby inhibits TNBC progression.","Yang, Xiaowei; Zhao, Lu; Pei, Jing; Wang, Zhaorui; Zhang, Jingjie; Wang, Benzhong",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,303

523336,Guillain-barre syndrome related to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection,2021,"The rapid scale-up of research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spawned a large number of potential vaccines and immunotherapies, accompanied by a commensurately large number of in vitro assays and in vivo models to measure their effectiveness. These assays broadly have the same end-goal - to predict the clinical efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in humans. However, the apparent potency of different interventions can vary considerably between assays and animal models, leading to very different predictions of clinical efficacy. Complete harmonization of experimental methods may be intractable at the current pace of research. However, here we analyse a selection of existing assays for measuring antibody-mediated virus neutralization and animal models of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a framework for comparing results between studies and reconciling observed differences in the effects of interventions. Finally, we propose how we might optimize these assays for better comparison of results from in vitro and animal studies to accelerate progress.","Khoury, David S; Wheatley, Adam K; Ramuta, Mitchell D; Reynaldi, Arnold; Cromer, Deborah; Subbarao, Kanta; O039,; Connor, David H; Kent, Stephen J; Davenport, Miles P",Nat Rev Immunol,,303

The mineralization mechanism by which cellulosic, keratinous, and silk tissues fossilize in the vicinity of archaeological metal artifacts offers the most exquisite preservation through a mechanism unexplored on the nanoscale. It is at the center of the vast majority of ancient textiles preserved under nonextreme conditions, known through extremely valuable fragments. Here we show the reconstruction of the nanoscale mechanism leading to the preservation of an exceptional collection of ancient cellulosic textiles recovered in the ancient Near East (4,000 to 5,000 years ago). We demonstrate that even the most mineralized fibers, which contain inorganic compounds throughout their histology, enclose preserved cellulosic remains in place. We evidence a process that combines the three steps of water transport of biocidal metal cations and soil solutes, degradation and loss of crystallinity of cellulosic polysaccharides, and silicification.","Reynaud, Corentin; Thoury, Mathieu; Dazzi, Alexandre; Latour, Gaël; Scheel, Mario; Li, Jiayi; Thomas, Ariane; Moulhérat, Christophe; Didier, Aurore; Bertrand, Loïc",Proc.

The stay-at-home increases sedentary behavior, with unintended adverse outcomes. Since organized recreation and sports facilities were closed, we aimed to study how the crisis of closure affected exercise habits and weight gain among the trainee population in Israel. We examined differences in weight gain among individuals with different PA activities and assessed their ability to adapt to digital media as an alternative training structure. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey consisted of a multiple-choice questionnaire obtained using a web-based survey application. Trainees (1202) who exercised steadily anonymously answered the questionnaire sent by their coaches regarding their activity and weight gain during lockdown times. RESULTS: Results confirmed that 70% of Israelis trained less than their usual routine, 60% used digital media for training, 55% gained weight. Half of the respondents gained more than 2 kg, with an average increase of 1.2 kg. However, those who exhibited a higher physical activity level gained less weight. Using digital media for training was associated with higher physical activity levels. The aged population was less likely to use digital media. CONCLUSIONS: Since increased sedentary behavior could increase the risk for potential worsening of health conditions, health agencies should look for strategies, including digital remote media training to promote physical activity and subsequently, preventing the increased burden of future comorbidities worsening by a sedentary lifestyle.

595636,Commentary: Caution: Falling case volumes,2020-07-11,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as the biggest life-threatening disease of this century. Whilst vaccination should provide a long-term solution, this is pitted against the constant threat of mutations in the virus rendering the current vaccines less effective. Consequently, small molecule antiviral agents would be extremely useful to complement the vaccination program. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which encodes at least nine enzymatic activities that all have drug targeting potential. The papain-like protease (PLpro) contained in the nsp3 protein generates viral non-structural proteins from a polyprotein precursor, and cleaves ubiquitin and ISG protein conjugates. Here we describe the expression and purification of PLpro. We developed a protease assay that was used to screen a custom chemical library from which we identified Dihydrotanshinone I and Ro 08-2750 as compounds that inhibit PLpro in protease and isopeptidase assays and also inhibit viral replication in cell culture-based assays.","Lim, Chew Theng; Tan, Kang Wei; Wu, Mary; Ulferts, Rachel; Armstrong, Lee A.; Ozono, Eiko; Drury, Lucy S.; Milligan, Jennifer C.; Zeisner, Theresa U.; Zeng, Jingkun; Weissmann, Florian; Canal, Berta; Bineva-Todd, Ganka; Howell, Michael; O’Reilly, Nicola; Beale, Rupert; Kulathu, Yogesh; Labib, Karim; Diffley, John F.X",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.438804,303

NO completely effective drugs and treatments are not recognized for this virus. Recently, saffron and its compounds were used to treat different viral diseases. Saffron extract and its major ingredients have shown antiviral effects. In this study, the steered molecular dynamics simulation was used for investigating the effect of four main components of saffron that include: crocin, crocetin, safranal, and picrocrocin as candidate for drug molecules, on COVID-19. The binding energies between drug molecules and spike protein and the main protease of the virus were evaluated. The obtained results based on Lennard-Jones and electrostatic potentials demonstrated that crocetin has a high affinity towards spike protein and also the main protease of the virus. Also, the quantum mechanics calculations elucidated that the crocetin could overcome energy barrier of lipid bilayer with strong dipole moment and polarizability. The pharmacokinetic and ADMET properties proved that crocetin could be a suitable drug candidate. So, crocetin could be a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19.","Kordzadeh, Azadeh; Ramazani Saadatabadi, Ahmad; Hadi, Amin",Heliyon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402032524X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33344790/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S240584402032524X,303
609122,"Delirium Incidence, Duration, and Severity in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019",2020-11-25,"COVID-19 is announced as a global pandemic in 2020. Its mortality and morbidity rate are rapidly increasing, with limited medications. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps spreading. In this infection, a patient's immune response plays pivotal role in the pathogenesis. This inflammatory factor was shown by its mediators that, in severe cases, reach the cytokine at peaks. Hyperinflammatory state may sparks significant imbalances in transporters and drug metabolic machinery, and subsequent alteration of drug pharmacokinetics may result in unexpected therapeutic response. The present scenario has accounted for the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this pandemic. Despite the diminishing developments of COVID-19, there is no drug still approved to have significant effects with no side effect on the treatment for COVID-19 patients. Based on the evidence, many antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the COVID-19 patients even though not knowing the possible drug-drug interactions (DDI). Remdesivir, favipiravir, and molnupiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agents by improving infected patient’s health. Dexamethasone is the first known steroid medicine that saved the lives of seriously ill patients. Some oligopeptides and proteins have also been using. The current review summarizes medication updates to treat COVID-19 patients in an inflammatory state and their interaction with drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes. It gives an opinion on the potential DDI that may permit the individualization of these drugs, thereby enhancing the safety and efficacy.","Kumar, Devendra; Trivedi, Neerja",Biomed Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940506/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S075333222100425X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075333222100425X?v=s5,303

This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.","Risco, Sebastián; Moltó, Germán; Naranjo, Diana M.; Blanquer, Ignacio",J Grid Comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-021-09570-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276264/,303

An extensive investigation of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for disease control. Various recombinant monoclonal antibodies of human origin that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been isolated from convalescent patients and will be applied as therapies and prophylaxis. However, the need for dedicated monoclonal antibodies suitable for molecular pathology research is not fully addressed. Here, we produced six mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibodies that exhibit not only robust performance in immunoassays including western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation, but also demonstrate neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Due to their mouse origin, our monoclonal antibodies are compatible with the experimental immunoassay setups commonly used in basic molecular biology research laboratories, providing a useful tool for future research. Furthermore, in the hope of applying the antibodies of clinical setting, we determined the variable regions of the antibodies and used them to produce recombinant human/mouse chimeric antibodies.","Guo, Youjia; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Takeshita, Masaru; Sekiya, Takeshi; Hirohama, Mikako; Yamashita, Akio; Siomi, Haruhiko; Murano, Kensaku",J Biol Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925821001186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524396/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100346; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925821001186?v=s5,303
613905,Advancing Telehealth-Based Screening for Postintensive Care Syndrome: A Coronavirus Disease 2019 Paradigm Shift,2021,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Zhao, Dan; Xu, Weifan; Zhang, Xiaofan; Wang, Xiaoting; Yuan, Enming; Xiong, Yuanpeng; Wu, Shenyang; Li, Shuya; Wu, Nian; Tian, Tingzhong; Feng, Xiaolong; Shu, Hantao; Lang, Peng; Shen, Xiaokun; Li, Haitao; Li, Pilong; Zeng, Jianyang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.09.332734,303

Methods The analytical sensitivity of LAMP and nested-PCR was obtained against10-fold serial dilutions of T. gondii DNA ranging from 1 ng to 0.01 fg. DNA samples of other parasites and human chromosomal DNA were used to determine the specificity of molecular assays. Results After testing LAMP and nested-PCR in duplicate, the detection limit of RE-LAMP, B1-LAMP, RE-nested PCR and B1-nested PCR assays was one fg, 100 fg, 1 pg and 10 pg of T. gondii DNA respectively. All the LAMP assays and nested PCRs were 100% specific. The RE-LAMP assay revealed the most sensitivity for the detection of T. gondii DNA. Conclusions The obtained results demonstrate that the LAMP technique has a greater sensitivity for detection of T. gondii. Furthermore, these findings indicate that primers based on the RE are more suitable than those based on the B1 gene.

Secondly, we evaluated the seroconversion rate and compared it between students attending schools in presence and those switched to distance-learning, using a logistic regression model, both as univariate and multivariate, adjusting for age and biological-sex. Among 1109 pupils, we found a seroprevalence of 2.8% in September before school reopening, while in January 2021, the seropositive rate was 12.5%, reflecting the general growth rate of infections during the second pandemic wave. The overall seroconversion rate was 10%, with no differences based on biological-sex and age groups; we observed no seroreversion. When considered age groups, the seroconversion rate was 10.5% (95%Confidence Interval, 2.9–24.8) among children attending preschools, 10.6% (95%Confidence Interval, 8.2–13.4) for primary schools, 9.9% (95%Confidence Interval, 6.8–13.8) for secondary schools, and 7.8% (95%Confidence Interval, 4–13.2) among high-school students. Interestingly, no differences in seroconversion rate were found between students who attended school compared to those who started remote learning in the first days of November. Furthermore, most patients (61%) reported that the contact occurred within the household. We reported a low seroconversion rate among school children in Milan, with no differences between those who attended from September 2020 to January 2021 compared to those who switched to remote learning in the first days of November.

A home chemotherapy program was implemented between 2011 and 2019 in an Italian region. This pilot study investigates its safety and feasibility, along with parental satisfaction. METHODS: Patients between 0 and 18 years diagnosed with malignancy were included. Deceased patients and patients whose families moved abroad or interrupted contact with the service were excluded. Adverse events comprised immediate deterioration of the patient’s condition, equipment failure, errors in drug storage, dose or patient identification and personnel safety issues. Parental satisfaction was explored through an email survey of 32 Likert-type and short open questions. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients received 419 doses of intravenous chemotherapy at home (cytarabine, vincristine, vinblastine). No adverse events were reported. Twenty-three families out of 25 eligible completed the survey. Most reported being “very satisfied” with the possibility of maintaining a work/domestic routine and reducing time and financial burden of hospital access. Most were “very satisfied” with the opportunity for their child of being less troubled by the treatment. Besides, most reported being “very satisfied” with the chance for healthy siblings of maintaining their routine and coping with their brother/sister’s disease. Most perceived the program as safe. All families recommended extending the program to all children in the region.

Methods In total, 348 CT scans in 112 patients were classified according to the time after the onset of the initial symptoms, namely stage-1 (0–4 days); stage-2 (5–9 days); stage-3 (10–14 days); stage-4 (15–21 days); stage-5 (22–28 days); and stage-6 (＞28 days). Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). Results The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (62.7 %), stage-4 (75.0 %) and stage-5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter. Total CT scores increased from stage-1 to stage-2 (2.8 ± 3.1, vs. 6.5 ± 4.6, respectively, P < 0.01), and thereafter remained high. The lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores except for stage-1. At stage-6 98.1 % of CT scans still showed abnormalities (CT score 7.5 ± 4.1). Conclusion Thin-section CT could provide semi-quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity.

We test whether: (a) social capital continued to predict lower mental distress during the pandemic; and (b) whether social capital buffered (moderated) the harm of social/mobility restrictions on psychological distress. In addition, we test the level at which social capital mitigation effects operated, i.e., at the individual- and/or contextual-level. To do so, we apply multilevel models to three waves of the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey consisting of probability samples of U.S. adults (with the average interview completion rate of 93%). In a novel approach, we explore two modes of capturing contextual social capital: aggregated individual-level survey responses and independently measured social capital indices (SCIs). Findings show that at the individual level social capital was associated with lower psychological distress. It also buffered the harm of restrictions: increasing restrictions had a weaker effect on distress among individuals interacting with neighbors more frequently. Importantly, mitigating processes of contextual social capital appeared conditional on how it was measured. Using aggregated survey responses, contextual social capital had no direct effect on distress but exerted an additional buffering role: individuals in counties with higher average neighbor-interaction experienced a weaker impact of restrictions. Using the independent SCI measures, we found county social capital reduced distress. However, its negative effect on distress becomes increasingly weaker the more restrictions an individual reported: where individuals reported lower restrictions, higher county SCI reduced distress; however, where individuals reported higher restrictions, higher county SCI had no effect on distress. More restrictive environments thus cut individuals off from the benefits of higher county social capital as measured using the SCI.","Laurence, James; Kim, Harris Hyun-soo",Soc Sci Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530221/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114361; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621006936; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953621006936,303
648128,The Role of Lung Ultrasound in Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-05-15,"INTRODUCTION: To improve retention on HIV treatment in Africa, public health programs are promoting a family of innovations to service delivery—referred to as “differentiated service delivery” (DSD) models—which seek to better meet the needs of both systems and patients by reducing unnecessary encounters, expanding access, and incorporating peers and patients in patient care. Data on the relative desirability of different models to target populations, which is currently sparse, can help guide prioritization of specific models during scale-up. METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment to assess patient preferences for various characteristics of treatment services. Clinically stable people living with HIV were recruited from an HIV clinic in Kisumu, Kenya. We selected seven attributes of DSD models drawn from literature review and previous qualitative work. We created a balanced and orthogonal design to identify main term effects. A total of ten choice tasks were solicited per respondent. We calculated relative utility (RU) for each attribute level, a numerical representation of the strength of patient preference. Data were analyzed using a Hierarchical Bayesian model via Sawtooth Software. RESULTS: One hundred and four respondents (37.5% men, 41.1 years mean age) preferred receiving care at a health facility, compared with home-delivery or a community meeting point (RU = 69.3, -16.2, and -53.1, respectively; p << 0.05); receiving those services from clinicians and pharmacists—as opposed to lay health workers or peers (RU = 21.5, 5.9, -24.5; p < 0.05); and preferred an individual support system over a group support system (RU = 15.0 and 4.2; p < 0.05). Likewise, patients strongly preferred longer intervals between both clinical reviews (RU = 40.1 and -50.7 for 6- and 1-month spacing, respectively; p < 0.05) and between ART collections (RU = 33.6 and -49.5 for 6- and1-month spacing, respectively; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although health systems find community- and peer-based DSD models attractive, clinically stable patients expressed a preference for facility-based care as long as clinical visits were extended to biannual. These data suggest that multi-month scripting and fast-track models best align with patient preferences, an insight which can help prioritize use of different DSD models in the region.","Dommaraju, Sagar; Hagey, Jill; Odeny, Thomas A.; Okaka, Sharon; Kadima, Julie; Bukusi, Elizabeth A.; Cohen, Craig R.; Kwena, Zachary; Eshun-Wilson, Ingrid; Geng, Elvin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34432795/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255650,303

With the growing popularity of the mhGAP-IG, a systematic review was conducted by Keynejad and colleagues (2018) to identify articles reporting on evidence generated from the implementation and evaluation of the mhGAP-IG in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Their review identified peer-reviewed articles and one thesis. In this current review, we report on the implementation and use of mhGAP-IG documented in the grey literature, an important and accessible channel to share information for LMICs. METHODS: We searched grey literature databases for documents that reported on the implementation and/or use of the mhGAP-IG or its training modules: ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, the Mental Health Innovation Network (MHIN) database, the WHO website, the mhGAP Newsletter, and the first 10 pages of Google search results. Authors developed and adapted search strategies according to database characteristics. Database searches were completed by November 12, 2019. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one (n = 151) documents were included in our review. We report on where the mhGAP-IG has been implemented and/or used worldwide. Many types of personnel were trained in the mhGAP-IG and/or used it in clinical practice. Contextual barriers and facilitators may influence the implementation and/or use of the mhGAP-IG, and we organized these according to structural, organizational, provider, patient, and innovation characteristics.

Outcomes included: feasibility of implementing and/or using the mhGAP-IG, its coverage, its impact on the capacities of personnel, patient outcomes, and policies, as well as program costs. CONCLUSIONS: This review of the grey literature provides rich experiential knowledge that can complement information documented in the peer-reviewed literature. It is important for researchers conducting reviews on global health/global mental health topics to consider incorporating grey literature search strategies in their reviews. This may not only help to acknowledge the research/dissemination realities of many LMICs, but also to generate findings that reinforce and/or expand those documented in peer-reviewed articles.","Spagnolo, Jessica; Lal, Shalini",Journal of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884192/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.04022,303
659278,A Critical Care Transport Program's Innovative Approach to Safety During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable behavioral health implications globally. One subgroup that may be of particular concern is U.S. veterans, who are susceptible to mental health and substance use concerns. The current study aimed to investigate changes in alcohol use and binge drinking before and during the first year of the pandemic among U.S. veterans, and how pre-pandemic mental health disorders, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and COVID-19-related factors like loneliness, negative reactions to COVID-19, and economic hardship influenced alcohol use trends. METHODS 1230 veterans were recruited in February 2020 as part of a larger survey study on veteran health behaviors. Veterans were asked to complete follow-up assessments throughout the pandemic at 6, 9, and 12- months. RESULTS Overall, veterans reported a significant decrease in alcohol use (IRR = 0.98) and binge drinking (IRR = 0.11) However, women, racial/ethnic minority veterans, and those with pre-existing PTSD exhibited smaller decreases in alcohol use and binge drinking and overall higher rates of use compared to men, White veterans, and those without PTSD. Both economic hardship and negative reactions to COVID-19 were associated with greater alcohol and binge drinking whereas loneliness showed a negative association with alcohol use and binge drinking. CONCLUSIONS Veterans reported decreases in alcohol use and binge drinking throughout the pandemic, with heterogeneity in these outcomes noted for higher risk groups. Special research and clinical attention should be given to the behavioral health care needs of veterans in the post-pandemic period.","Davis, Jordan P; Prindle, John; Castro, Carl C; Saba, Shaddy; Fitzke, Reagan E; Pedersen, Eric R",Addictive behaviors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34284311/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107052,303
669490,Machine Learning Prediction of Death in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021-08-19,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of novel rapid diagnostic tests: rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDT), digital immunoassays (DIA), rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), and other treatment algorithms for influenza in high-risk patients presenting to hospital with influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic test strategies (RIDT, DIA, NAAT, clinical judgement, batch polymerase chain reaction) preceding treatment; no diagnostic testing and treating everyone; and not treating anyone. We modeled high-risk 65-year old patients from a health payer perspective and accrued outcomes over a patient’s lifetime. We reported health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, and net health benefit (NHB) to measure cost-effectiveness per cohort of 100,000 patients. RESULTS: Treating everyone with no prior testing was the most cost-effective strategy, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY, in over 85% of simulations. This strategy yielded the highest NHB of 15.0344 QALYs, but inappropriately treats all patients without influenza. Of the novel rapid diagnostics, NAAT resulted in the highest NHB (15.0277 QALYs), and the least number of deaths (1,571 per 100,000). Sensitivity analyses determined that results were most impacted by the pretest probability of ILI being influenza, diagnostic test sensitivity, and treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our model, treating high-risk patients presenting to hospital with influenza-like illness, without performing a novel rapid diagnostic test, resulted in the highest NHB and was most cost-effective. However, consideration of whether treatment is appropriate in the absence of diagnostic confirmation should be taken into account for decision-making by clinicians and policymakers.","Mac, Stephen; O’Reilly, Ryan; Adhikari, Neill K.

The use of virtual social contact has been recommended by health authorities. This systematic review examined the scientific evidence of the use and feasibility of information and communication technology (ICT) for social contact by people with intellectual disabilities living in care facilities, and potential effects on well-being. METHODS: Five databases were searched using traditional systematic screening and machine-learning supported screening. Findings are presented in a narrative synthesis using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies were included. We described three themes: means of ICT used for social contact; effects on well-being; and benefits, barriers, and preconditions. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in virtual social contact may be feasible for people with severe to mild intellectual disabilities, but there is little concrete evidence that this can be used as an alternative for in-person contact.","Bakkum, Lianne; Schuengel, Carlo; Sterkenburg, Paula S; Frielink, Noud; Embregts, Petri J C M; de Schipper, Johanna Clasien; Ten Brug, Annet; Tharner, Anne","JARID, J. appl. res. intellect. disabil",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245077/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jar.12926,303
670597,Caring for Critically Ill Children With Suspected or Proven Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: Recommendations by the Scientific Sections’ Collaborative of the European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care*,2020-09-29,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutations has notoriously challenged oncologists and researchers for three notable reasons: (1) the historical assumption that KRAS is “undruggable”, (2) the disease heterogeneity and (3) the shaping of the tumor microenvironment by KRAS downstream effector functions. Better insights into KRAS structural biochemistry allowed researchers to develop direct KRAS(G12C) inhibitors, which have shown early signs of clinical activity in NSCLC patients and have recently led to an FDA breakthrough designation for AMG-510. Following the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for PDL1-positive NSCLC, this could fuel yet another major paradigm shift in the treatment of advanced lung cancer. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the biology of direct KRAS inhibition and project future opportunities and challenges of dual KRAS and immune checkpoint inhibition. This strategy is supported by preclinical models which show that KRAS(G12C) inhibitors can turn some immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” ones and therefore could benefit patients whose tumors harbor subtype-defining STK11/LKB1 co-mutations. Forty years after the discovery of KRAS as a transforming oncogene, we are on the verge of approval of the first KRAS-targeted drug combinations, thus therapeutically unifying Paul Ehrlich’s century-old “magic bullet” vision with Rudolf Virchow’s cancer inflammation theory.","Köhler, Jens; Jänne, Pasi A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22063025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809660/,303
672537,Periodic Oscillations in Daily Reported Infections and Deaths for Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Low birth weight and prematurity remain leading causes of infant mortality and morbidity globally. Although extensive literature has highlighted the importance of socioenvironmental characteristics for birth outcomes, the role of indirect violence on health remains fairly understudied. METHODS: Using geocoded birth records from the ongoing Western Region Birth Cohort (Região Oeste Coorte – ROC-Cohort) of infants born between 2012 and 2014 and geocoded crime reports, we assessed the associations between exposure to violent crimes during pregnancy within a 1-km radius of the mother’s residence and low birth weight, preterm delivery, and being born small-for-gestational-age. Violent crime exposure was categorized into quintiles. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between violence exposure and birth outcomes. Models were adjusted for sex, maternal age and education, socioeconomic status, and risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and drinking during pregnancy. RESULTS: Among the 5268 children included, the average crime exposure during the first two trimesters of pregnancy ranged from 0.44 violent crimes in the least exposed quintile to 12.74 crimes in the most exposed. Compared to children with the lowest violence exposure, children in the highest exposure quintile had higher odds of being born small-for-gestational-age (1.41[1.06–1.89]), preterm (1.35[1.01–1.80]), and low birth weight (1.42[1.03–1.98]). While socioeconomic status and maternal education were positively associated with lower violence exposure, no associations were found between these characteristics and birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher exposure to violent crimes in the close vicinity of pregnant women’s residence is associated with substantial increases in the odds of adverse birth outcomes. Policies to improve neighborhood safety can potentially contribute not only to the short-term wellbeing of populations but may also have large social, economic, and health benefits in the long term.

Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is responsible for the majority of adverse cardiovascular events. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is easily obtainable method to assess ED accurately. It is aimed to evaluate ED by measuring FMD following COVID-19 disease. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease were recruited to the hospital two month after the discharge. Sex and age-matched healthy subjects were determined as the control group. Blood samples and FMD measurements were obtained from each participant. All subjects were divided into two groups according to the presence of ED determined by FMD measurements. These two groups were compared in terms of demographic features and the presence of recovered COVID-19 disease. A total of 92 subjects consisting of 59 without ED and 33 with ED were included in the study. ED (+) group was older (p = 0.015) and more likely to have hypertension (p = 0.044) and COVID-19 rate was higher in ED (+) group (p = 0.009). While neutrophil count (p = 0.047) and CRP (p = 0.036) were higher, eGFR (p = 0.044) was lower in ED (+) group. In the backward multivariable regression analysis, COVID-19 disease [OR = 3.611, 95% CI 1.069–12.198, p = 0.039] and BMI [OR = 1.122, 95% CI 1.023–1.231, p = 0.015] were independent predictors of ED. COVID-19 disease may cause ED which is the major underlying factor of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, COVID-19 disease may deteriorate the existing cardiovascular disease course. Detecting ED in the early phase or preventing by new treatment modalities may improve short and long-term outcome.","Ergül, Elif; Yılmaz, Ahmet Seyda; Öğütveren, Muhammet Mürsel; Emlek, Nadir; Kostakoğlu, Uğur; Çetin, Mustafa",Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286447/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-021-02356-3,303

These information-centric, heterarchically structured networks are instantiated in response to major disasters with global impact. The instantiation of GCN is conceived as a problem of collective action. Its success depends on multi-level preparedness, and network orchestration and participation. With this framework we analyze the SARS outbreak in 2002 and its successful containment in 2003. We analyze two individual country cases, Canada and China and discuss the role of the network orchestrator, the World Health Organizations.

We examined the association between cirrhosis and incidence of total hip arthroplasty for avascular necrosis. METHODS: We used nationwide healthcare data to identify all Danish residents diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1994–2011, and matched them 1:5 by age and sex to non-cirrhotic reference individuals from the general population. We excluded people with a previous total hip arthroplasty, a previous hip fracture, or a previous diagnosis of avascular necrosis. We used stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for cirrhosis patients relative to reference individuals, adjusting for potential confounders. We used the cumulative incidence function to compute 5-year risks. RESULTS: We included 25,421 cirrhosis patients and 114,052 reference individuals. Their median age was 57 years, and 65% were men. 45 cirrhosis patients and 44 reference individuals underwent total hip arthroplasty for avascular necrosis. Cirrhosis patients’ HR for a total hip arthroplasty for avascular necrosis was 10 (95% CI: 6–17), yet their 5-year risk of avascular necrosis was only 0.2%. For the reference individuals, the 5-year risk was 0.02%. INTERPRETATION: Cirrhosis is a strong risk factor for avascular necrosis of the hip, but it is rare even in cirrhosis patients.","Deleuran, Thomas; Overgaard, Søren; Vilstrup, Hendrik; Jepsen, Peter",Acta Orthop,https://doi.org/10.3109/17453674.2016.1151122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26900635/,303
