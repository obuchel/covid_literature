However, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is available, imposing a heavy global health burden. The nucleoside analogue 2’-fluoro-2’-deoxycytidine (2’-FdC) has been reported to have broad antiviral activity. Here, we report that 2’-FdC significantly inhibits murine norovirus replication in macrophages. This effect was partially reversed by exogenous supplementation of cytidine triphosphate. The combination of 2’-FdC with mycophenolic acid, ribavirin or favipiravir (T705) exerts synergistic antiviral effects. These results indicate that 2’-FdC is a potential candidate for antiviral drug development against norovirus infection.

More than half of the overdose-related deaths are related to synthetic opioids represented by fentanyl which is a potent agonist of mu-opioid receptor (mOR). In recent years, crystal structures of mOR complexed with morphine derivatives have been determined; however, structural basis of mOR activation by fentanyl-like synthetic opioids remains lacking. Exploiting the X-ray structure of mOR bound to a morphinan ligand and several state-of-the-art simulation techniques, including weighted ensemble and continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, we elucidated the detailed binding mechanism of fentanyl with mOR. Surprisingly, in addition to the orthosteric site common to morphinan opiates, fentanyl can move deeper and bind mOR through hydrogen bonding with a conserved histidine H297, which has been shown to modulate mOR’s ligand affinity and pH dependence in mutagenesis experiments, but its precise role remains unclear. Intriguingly, the secondary binding mode is only accessible when H297 adopts a neutral HID tautomer. Alternative binding modes and involvement of tautomer states may represent general mechanisms in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand recognition. Our work provides a starting point for understanding mOR activation by fentanyl analogs that are emerging at a rapid pace and assisting the design of safer analgesics to combat the opioid crisis. Current protein simulation studies employ standard protonation and tautomer states; our work demonstrates the need to move beyond the practice to advance our understanding of protein-ligand recognition.","Vo, Quynh N.; Mahinthichaichan, Paween; Shen, Jana; Ellis, Christopher R.",bioRxiv,630,1

Vegetation and soil are key sources of airborne microbiota––the aerobiome. A limited number of studies have attempted to characterize the dynamics of near surface green space aerobiomes, and no studies to date have investigated these dynamics from a vertical perspective. Vertical stratification in the aerobiome could have important implications for public health and for the design, engineering, and management of urban green spaces. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this study were to: a) assess whether significant vertical stratification in bacterial species richness and evenness (alpha diversity) of the aerobiome occurred in a parkland habitat in Adelaide, South Australia; b) assess whether significant compositional differences (beta diversity) between sampling heights occurred; and c) to preliminarily assess whether there were significant altitudinal differences in potentially pathogenic and beneficial bacterial taxa. METHODS: We combined an innovative columnar sampling method at soil level, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and [Formula: see text] , using passive petri dish sampling to collect airborne bacteria. We used a geographic information system (GIS) to select study sites, and we used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to assess whether significant vertical stratification of the aerobiome occurred. RESULTS: Our results provide evidence of vertical stratification in both alpha and beta (compositional) diversity of airborne bacterial communities, with diversity decreasing roughly with height. We also found significant vertical stratification in potentially pathogenic and beneficial bacterial taxa. DISCUSSION: Although additional research is needed, our preliminary findings point to potentially different exposure attributes that may be contingent on human height and activity type. Our results lay the foundations for further research into the vertical characteristics of urban green space aerobiomes and their implications for public health and urban planning. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7807","Robinson, Jake M.; Cando-Dumancela, Christian; Liddicoat, Craig; Weinstein, Philip; Cameron, Ross; Breed, Martin F.",Environ Health Perspect,630,1

Although there is no distinct definition or detailed knowledge about AECOPD, it is commonly used as primary outcome in clinical studies. Furthermore, it may be difficult in clinical practice to differentiate the worsening of symptoms due to an AECOPD or to the development of heart failure. Therefore, it is of major clinical importance to investigate the underlying pathophysiology, and if possible, predictors of an AECOPD and thus to identify patients who are at high risk for developing an acute exacerbation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In total, 355 patients with COPD will be included prospectively to this study during a 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme at the Schoen Klinik Berchtesgadener Land, Schoenau am Koenigssee (Germany). All patients will be closely monitored from admission to discharge. Lung function, exercise tests, clinical parameters, quality of life, physical activity and symptoms will be recorded, and blood samples and exhaled air will be collected. If a patient develops an AECOPD, there will be additional comprehensive diagnostic assessments to differentiate between cardiac, pulmonary or cardiopulmonary causes of worsening. Follow-up measures will be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months. Exploratory data analyses methods will be used for the primary research question (screening and identification of possible factors to predict an AECOPD). Regression analyses and a generalised linear model with a binomial outcome (AECOPD) will be applied to test if predictors are significant. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Philipps University Marburg, Germany (No. 61/19). The results will be presented in conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Studying clinical cohorts of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma patients, we identified IFITM3 as a strong predictor of poor outcome. In normal resting B-cells, Ifitm3 was minimally expressed and mainly localized in endosomes. However, B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement induced expression of Ifitm3 and phosphorylation at Y20, resulting in accumulation at the cell surface. In B-cell leukemia, oncogenic kinases phosphorylate IFITM3-Y20, causing constitutive plasma membrane localization. Ifitm3ˉ(/)ˉ naïve B-cells developed at normal numbers; however, germinal center formation and production of antigen-specific antibodies were compromised. Oncogenes that induce development of leukemia and lymphoma failed to transform Ifitm3ˉ(/)ˉ B-cells. Conversely, the phospho-mimetic IFITM3-Y20E induced oncogenic PI3K-signaling and initiated transformation of pre-malignant B-cells. Mechanistic experiments revealed that Ifitm3 functions as PIP3-scaffold and central amplifier of PI3K signaling. PI3K signal-amplification depends on Ifitm3 scaffolding PIP3-accumulation via two lysine residues (K83 and K104) in its conserved intracellular loop. In Ifitm3ˉ(/)ˉ B-cells, lipid rafts were depleted of PIP3, resulting in defective expression of >60 lipid raft-associated surface receptors, impaired BCR-signaling and cellular adhesion. We conclude that phosphorylation of IFITM3 upon B-cell antigen-encounter induces a dynamic switch from antiviral effector functions in endosomes to a PI3K-amplification loop at the cell surface. IFITM3-dependent amplification of PI3K-signaling in part downstream of the BCR is critical to enable rapid expansion of B-cells with high affinity to antigen. In addition, multiple oncogenes depend on IFITM3 to assemble PIP3-dependent signaling complexes and amplify PI3K-signaling for malignant transformation.","Lee, Jaewoong; Robinson, Mark E.; Ma, Ning; Artadji, Dewan; Ahmed, Mohamed A.; Xiao, Gang; Sadras, Teresa; Deb, Gauri; Winchester, Janet; Cosgun, Kadriye Nehir; Geng, Huimin; Chan, Lai N.; Kume, Kohei; Miettinen, Teemu P.; Zhang, Ye; Nix, Matthew A.; Klemm, Lars; Chen, Chun Wei; Chen, Jianjun; Khairnar, Vishal; Wiita, Arun P.; Thomas-Tikhonenko, Andrei; Farzan, Michael; Jung, Jae U.; Weinstock, David M.; Manalis, Scott R.; Diamond, Michael S.; Vaidehi, Nagarajan; Müschen, Markus",Nature,630,1

A two-center randomized control trial was performed. The primary outcome was the reintubation rate of infants within 72 h of age after INSURE. Secondary outcomes included bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and incidences of adverse events. Lung function at one year of corrected age was also compared between the two groups. There were 140 cases in the CPAP group and 144 in the BiPAP group. After INSURE, the reintubation rates of infants within 72 h of age were 15% and 11.1% in the CPAP group and the BiPAP group, respectively (P>0.05). Neonates in the BiPAP group was on positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy three days less than in the CPAP group (12.6 d and 15.3 d, respectively, P<0.05), and on oxygen six days less than in the CPAP group (20.6 d and 26.9 d, respectively, P<0.05).

This study is aimed at determining the prognostic role of biomarkers in the evolution of patients with heart failure. These biomarkers are representative of different pathogenetic pathways involved in the progression of heart failure and the possible interrelationships between them and heart remodelling. Method. This is a progressive observational study on 53 hospitalized patients with low ejection fraction heart failure, who were followed up for 12 months. The aetiology of heart failure was ischemic heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients were clinically and biochemically evaluated by EKG (echocardiography) on admission and at 6 and 12 months. The biomarkers included in the present study were angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), apelin-13, NT-proBNP (biomarkers involved in the counterregulation of RAAS), interleukin 17 (IL-17), hsCRP (inflammatory biomarkers), and urinary 8-iso-PGF2α (oxidative stress biomarker). The evolution was considered unfavourable if the patients presented complications during hospitalization, were readmitted for decompensated heart failure, or died. Results. From the study group, 14 patients (24.52%) presented an unfavourable clinical evolution. The biomarkers that were associated with the evolution of patients during hospitalization were ACE2, apelin-13, NT-proBNP, and hsCRP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified ACE2 and apelin-13 as independent, predictive biomarkers for the unfavourable evolution of patients over the study period. Values of ACE2 above 4000.75 pg/mL and of apelin-13 less than 402.5 pg/mL were associated with an unfavourable evolution (poor clinical outcomes). Conclusion. The serum values of ACE2 and apelin-13 correlate with the unfavourable evolution of patients with reduced ejection fraction heart failure.","Goidescu, Cerasela Mihaela; Chiorescu, Roxana Mihaela; Diana, Mocan-Hognogi Larisa; Mocan, Mihaela; Stoia, Mirela Anca; Anton, Florin Petru; Farcaş, Anca Daniela",Dis Markers,630,28

Ferromagnetic technology has potential utility in this area. The aim of this study was to evaluate ferromagnetic heating in sealing and dividing vessels. METHODS A novel ferromagnetic (FM) sealer, FMsealer, was developed for sealing and dividing vessels. Using a swine in vivo model, the following endpoints were evaluated: (1) proof of concept, (2) 21-day survival surgery, and (3) comparison with ultrasonic (US) and/or bipolar (BP) devices for subjective outcomes. Seal burst strengths were measured in vitro. Mann-Whitney and Student's t test were used. RESULTS After showing proof of concept, 5 swine underwent survival splenectomy, nephrectomy, hysterectomy, and mesenteric vessel division (arteries ranging from 1 to 7 mm in diameter) with necropsy after day 21 showing no evidence of surgical site bleeding. FM was equivalent to BP in tissue retention and superior to BP in spread/tissue desiccation, sticking, and charring (P ≤ .01). The FM was superior to US and BP in speed of 10 cm mesentery division (mean ± SD seconds): FM (12.9 ± 1.0 seconds), US (23.3 ± 4.4 seconds), BP (46.1 ± 5.2 seconds) (P ≤ .01 FM vs US or BP). Seal burst strength and success of sealing a 5-mm carotid artery were as follows (mean ± SD mmHg, % success burst strength >240 mm Hg): FM (710 ± 206 mm Hg, 94% success), US (848 ± 565 mm Hg, 79%), and BP (619 ± 373 mm Hg, 83%). CONCLUSION Ferromagnetic heating is an effective and efficient technology for sealing and dividing of vessels.

However, despite the fact that a large number of genetically diverse SL-CoV sequences have been detected in bats, only two strains (named WIV1 and WIV16) have been successfully cultured in vitro These two strains differ from SARS-CoV only in containing an extra open reading frame (ORF) (named ORFX), between ORF6 and ORF7, which has no homology to any known protein sequences. In this study, we constructed a full-length cDNA clone of SL-CoV WIV1 (rWIV1), an ORFX deletion mutant (rWIV1-ΔX), and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mutant (rWIV1-GFP-ΔX). Northern blotting and fluorescence microscopy indicate that ORFX was expressed during WIV1 infection. A virus infection assay showed that rWIV1-ΔX replicated as efficiently as rWIV1 in Vero E6, Calu-3, and HeLa-hACE2 cells. Further study showed that ORFX could inhibit interferon production and activate NF-κB. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the unique ORFX in the WIV1 strain is a functional gene involving modulation of the host immune response but is not essential for in vitro viral replication. IMPORTANCE Bats harbor genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), and some of them have the potential for interspecies transmission. A unique open reading frame (ORFX) was identified in the genomes of two recently isolated bat SL-CoV strains (WIV1 and -16). It will therefore be critical to clarify whether and how this protein contributes to virulence during viral infection. Here we revealed that the unique ORFX is a functional gene that is involved in the modulation of the host immune response but is not essential for in vitro viral replication. Our results provide important information for further exploration of the ORFX function in the future.

During a scalarifom conjugation, the extragametangial zygospores were initially surrounded by a thin cell wall that developed into a multi-layered zygospore wall. Maturing zygospores turned dark brown and were filled with storage compounds such as lipids and starch. While M. parvula had a smooth surface, M. disjuncta had a punctated surface structure and a prominent suture. The zygospore wall consisted of a polysaccharide rich endospore, followed by a thin layer with a lipid-like appaerance, a massive electron dense mesospore and a very thin exospore composed of polysaccharides. Glycan microarray analysis of zygospores of different developmental stages revealed the occurrence of pectins and hemicelluloses, mostly composed of homogalacturonan (HG), xyloglucans, xylans, arabino-galactan proteins and extensins. In situ localization by the probe OG7-13AF 488 labelled HG in young zygospore walls, vegetative filaments and most prominently in conjugation tubes and cross walls. Raman imaging showed the distribution of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and aromatic components of the mature zygospore with a spatial resolution of ~ 250 nm. The carbohydrate nature of the endo- and exospore was confirmed and in-between an enrichment of lipids and aromatic components, probably algaenan or a sporopollenin-like material. Taken together, these results indicate that during zygospore formation, reorganizations of the cell walls occured, leading to a resistant and protective structure.","Permann, Charlotte; Herburger, Klaus; Niedermeier, Martin; Felhofer, Martin; Gierlinger, Notburga; Holzinger, Andreas",Protoplasma,630,17

However, no simple method is available in the literature for predicting the exhaled airflow from a cough with the mouth covered. This investigation used smoke to visualize the airflow exhaled by 16 human subjects. Their mouths were covered by a tissue, a cupped hand, a fist, and an elbow with and without a sleeve. This study then developed simplified models for predicting the airflow on the basis of the smoke visualization data. In addition, this investigation performed numerical simulations to assess the influence of mouth coverings on the receptor's exposure to exhaled particles. It was found that covering a cough with a tissue, a cupped hand, or an elbow can significantly reduce the horizontal velocity and cause the particles to move upward with the thermal plumes generated by a human body. In contrast with an uncovered cough, a covered cough or a cough with the head turned away may prevent direct exposure. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS This study developed simplified models for predicting the exhaled airflow from a cough with the mouth covered. The proposed models can easily be used to investigate the risk of transmission of airborne infectious diseases in enclosed environments.","Chen, C; Lin, C-H; Jiang, Z; Chen, Q",Indoor air,630,1

Standard laparoscopic techniques require multiple ports. A miniature robotic platform to be inserted completely into the peritoneal cavity through a single incision has been designed and built. The robot can be quickly repositioned, thus enabling multiquadrant access to the abdominal cavity. METHODS The miniature in vivo robotic platform used in this study consists of a multifunctional robot and a remote surgeon interface. The robot is composed of two arms with shoulder and elbow joints. Each forearm is equipped with specialized interchangeable end effectors (i.e., graspers and monopolar electrocautery). RESULTS Five robotic colectomies were performed in a porcine model. For each procedure, the robot was completely inserted into the peritoneal cavity, and the surgeon manipulated the user interface to control the robot to perform the colectomy. The robot mobilized the colon from its lateral retroperitoneal attachments and assisted in the placement of a standard stapler to transect the sigmoid colon. This objective was completed for all five colectomies without any complications. CONCLUSIONS The adoption of both laparoscopic and single-incision colectomies currently is constrained by the inadequacies of existing instruments. The described multifunctional robot provides a platform that overcomes existing limitations by operating completely within one incision in the peritoneal cavity and by improving visualization and dexterity. By repositioning the small robot to the area of the colon to be mobilized, the ability of the surgeon to perform complex surgical tasks is improved. Furthermore, the success of the robot in performing a completely in vivo colectomy suggests the feasibility of using this robotic platform to perform other complex surgeries through a single incision.","Wortman, Tyler D; Meyer, Avishai; Dolghi, Oleg; Lehman, Amy C; McCormick, Ryan L; Farritor, Shane M; Oleynikov, Dmitry",Surgical endoscopy,630,1

Heat is transferred from substrates to organisms by conduction and reflected radiation. Because brightness influences the degree of heat absorption, substrates could affect the evolution of integumentary optical properties. Here, we show that vipers (Squamata:Viperidae) inhabiting hot, highly radiative and superficially conductive substrates have evolved bright ventra for efficient heat transfer. We analyzed the brightness of 4161 publicly available images from 126 species, and we found that substrate type, alongside latitude and body mass, strongly influences ventral brightness. Substrate type also significantly affects dorsal brightness, but this is associated with different selective forces: activity-pattern and altitude. Ancestral estimation analysis suggests that the ancestral ventral condition was likely moderately bright and, following divergence events, some species convergently increased their brightness. Vipers diversified during the Miocene and the enhancement of ventral brightness may have facilitated the exploitation of arid grounds. We provide evidence that integument brightness can impact the behavioral ecology of ectotherms.","Goldenberg, Jonathan; D'Alba, Liliana; Bisschop, Karen; Vanthournout, Bram; Shawkey, Matthew D",Communications biology,630,1

Results from a pilot study.,21.678911,9.799471,2021-01-19,"BACKGROUND Interventions to alleviate stigma are demonstrating effectiveness across a range of conditions, though few move beyond the pilot phase, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Implementation science offers tools to study complex interventions, understand barriers to implementation, and generate evidence of affordability, scalability, and sustainability. Such evidence could be used to convince policy-makers and donors to invest in implementation. However, the utility of implementation research depends on its rigor and replicability. Our objectives were to systematically review implementation studies of health-related stigma reduction interventions in LMICs and critically assess the reporting of implementation outcomes and intervention descriptions. METHODS PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for evaluations of stigma reduction interventions in LMICs reporting at least one implementation outcome. Study- and intervention-level characteristics were abstracted. The quality of reporting of implementation outcomes was assessed using a five-item rubric, and the comprehensiveness of intervention description and specification was assessed using the 12-item Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR). RESULTS A total of 35 eligible studies published between 2003 and 2017 were identified; of these, 20 (57%) used qualitative methods, 32 (91%) were type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation studies, and 29 (83%) were evaluations of once-off or pilot implementations. No studies adopted a formal theoretical framework for implementation research. Acceptability (20, 57%) and feasibility (14, 40%) were the most frequently reported implementation outcomes. The quality of reporting of implementation outcomes was low. The 35 studies evaluated 29 different interventions, of which 18 (62%) were implemented across sub-Saharan Africa, 20 (69%) focused on stigma related to HIV/AIDS, and 28 (97%) used information or education to reduce stigma. Intervention specification and description was uneven. CONCLUSION Implementation science could support the dissemination of stigma reduction interventions in LMICs, though usage to date has been limited. Theoretical frameworks and validated measures have not been used, key implementation outcomes like cost and sustainability have rarely been assessed, and intervention processes have not been presented in detail. Adapted frameworks, new measures, and increased LMIC-based implementation research capacity could promote the rigor of future stigma implementation research, helping the field deliver on the promise of stigma reduction interventions worldwide.","Kemp, Christopher G; Jarrett, Brooke A; Kwon, Churl-Su; Song, Lanxin; Jetté, Nathalie; Sapag, Jaime C; Bass, Judith; Murray, Laura; Rao, Deepa; Baral, Stefan",BMC medicine,630,13

In our study, Analgesia Nociception Index monitoring in two groups who had undergone spinal stabilization surgery and were administered propofol-remifentanil (Total Intravenous Anesthesia) and sevoflurane-remifentanyl anesthesia was compared regarding its significance for prediction of postoperative early pain. METHODS BIS and Analgesia Nociception Index monitoring were conducted in the patients together with standard monitoring. During induction, fentanyl 2μg.kg-1, propofol 2.5mg.kg-1 and rocuronium 0.6mg.kg-1 were administered. During maintenance, 1.0 MAC sevoflurane+remifentanil 0.05-0.3μg.kg-1.min-1 and propofol 50-150μg.kg-1.min+remifentanil 0.05-0.3μg.kg-1.min-1 were administered in Group S and Group T, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters, BIS and Analgesia Nociception Index values were recorded during surgery and 30min postoperatively. Postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) values at 30minutes were recorded. RESULTS While no difference was found between mean Analgesia Nociception Index at all times of measurement in both groups, Analgesia Nociception Index measurements after administration of perioperative analgesic drug were recorded to be significantly higher compared to baseline values in both groups. There was correlation between mean values of Analgesia Nociception Index and VAS after anesthesia. CONCLUSION Analgesia Nociception Index is a valuable parameter for monitoring of perioperative and postoperative analgesia. In spine surgery, similar analgesia can be provided in both Total Intravenous Anesthesia with remifentanil and sevoflurane administration. Analgesia Nociception Index is efficient for prediction of the need for analgesia during the early postoperative period, and therefore is the provision of patient comfort.","Turan, Guldem; Ar, Arzu Yıldırım; Kuplay, Yıldız Yigit; Demiroluk, Oznur; Gazi, Mustafa; Akgun, Nur; Celikoglu, Erhan",Revista brasileira de anestesiologia,630,31

However, major depressive disorder may also cause temporary deterioration of one's cognition known as pseudodementia. Differentiating a true dementia and pseudodementia is still difficult even for an experienced clinician and extensive and careful examinations must be performed. Although mental disorders such as depression and dementia have been studied, there is still no solution for shorter and undemanding pseudodementia screening. This study inspects the distribution and statistical characteristics from both dementia patient and depression patient, and compared them. It is found that some acoustic features were shared in both dementia and depression, albeit their correlation was reversed. Statistical significance was also found when comparing the features. Additionally, the possibility of utilizing machine learning for automatic pseudodementia screening was explored. The machine learning part includes feature selection using LASSO algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel as the predictive model with age-matched symptomatic depression patient and dementia patient as the database. High accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was obtained in both training session and testing session. The resulting model was also tested against other datasets that were not included and still performs considerably well. These results imply that dementia and depression might be both detected and differentiated based on acoustic features alone. Automated screening is also possible based on the high accuracy of machine learning results.","Sumali, Brian; Mitsukura, Yasue; Liang, Kuo-Ching; Yoshimura, Michitaka; Kitazawa, Momoko; Takamiya, Akihiro; Fujita, Takanori; Mimura, Masaru; Kishimoto, Taishiro",Sensors,630,25

To date, few studies focused on the interactions of micro- and nanoplastics with freshwater Decapoda. The red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii, Girard, 1852) is an invasive species able to tolerate highly perturbed environments. As a benthic opportunistic feeder, this species may be susceptible to plastic ingestion. In this study, adult P. clarkii, at intermolt stage, were exposed to 100 μg of 100 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) through diet in a 72 h acute toxicity test. An integrated approach was conceived to assess the biological effects of PS NPs, by analyzing both transcriptomic and physiological responses. Total hemocyte counts, basal and total phenoloxidase activities, glycemia and total protein concentration were investigated in crayfish hemolymph at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h from PS NPs administration to evaluate general stress response over time. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hemocytes and hepatopancreas were analyzed to ascertain the response of crayfish to PS NP challenge after 72 h. At a physiological level, crayfish were able to compensate for the induced stress, not exceeding generic stress thresholds. The RNA-Sequencing analysis revealed the altered expression of few genes involved in immune response, oxidative stress, gene transcription and translation, protein degradation, lipid metabolism, oxygen demand, and reproduction after PS NPs exposure. This study suggests that a low concentration of PS NPs may induce mild stress in crayfish, and sheds light on molecular pathways possibly involved in nanoplastic toxicity.","Capanni, Francesca; Greco, Samuele; Tomasi, Noemi; Giulianini, Piero G; Manfrin, Chiara",The Science of the total environment,630,16

METHODS People with OA scheduled for TKR (TKR group; N = 19) and not scheduled (NTKR group; N = 17) were age-matched with People without OA (N = 19). Outcome measures included: joint range of motion (ROM), Timed Up and Go (TUG), joint pain levels, Oxford score, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire, and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale. Also, spatiotemporal gait parameters and joint kinematics were recorded during perturbed and unperturbed gait. The perturbed gait data were normalized by unperturbed gait data. RESULTS There were no differences between the two OA groups in the four questionnaire scores and joint ROM. The TUG score of the TKR group was higher than that of the NTKR group. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in the normalized spatiotemporal parameters. The OA groups showed statistically significant lower anterior pelvic tilt ranges and higher maximal hip adduction of the contralateral limb compared to the Non-OA group. When the contralateral limb was perturbed, the TKR group showed significantly lower pelvic rotation range compared to the NTKR and Non-OA groups. When the OA limb was perturbed, the maximal hip flexion of the injured limb was significantly lower and the maximal knee flexion higher in the OA groups compared with the Non-OA group. CONCLUSION The recovery strategy from trip-simulated perturbation of individuals with OA differs from that of individuals without OA.

We hypothesized that the polymorphism of mRNA could be applied to identifying individuals in mixture samples composed of two body fluids. In this study, we selected 5 blood-specific mRNA biomarkers of venous blood (SPTB, CD3G, AMICA1, ANK1, GYPA) that encompass 16 SNPs to identify the mixture contributor(s). Five specific gene markers for menstrual blood, semen, skin, saliva and vaginal secretions were amplified and typed as body-fluid positive controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven patients referred for percutaneous biopsy or thermal ablation of tumors near the diaphragm were prospectively enrolled. Initial PET/CT scanning was performed by using a bellows device and monitored, same-level breath-holds for PET and CT acquisitions. Breath-hold PET consisted of nine 20-second breath-hold frames, yielding a 3-minute equivalent PET dataset. A second PET/CT scan was obtained without monitoring by using end-expiration breath-hold CT and free-breathing PET. PET/CT tumor misregistration and craniocaudal tumor diameter were measured on monitored and unmonitored PET/CT datasets. Data were analyzed by using nonparametric, two-sided, signed-rank statistical tests. RESULTS Mean PET/CT image misregistrations in the craniocaudal, anteroposterior, and transverse planes were 2.6 mm (range, 0-7 mm), 3.3 mm (range, 1-8 mm), and 2.7 mm (range, 0-8 mm) with monitoring and 14.7 mm (range, 0-49 mm), 7.6 mm (range, 1-24 mm), and 4.0 mm (range, 0-12 mm) without monitoring, respectively. Differences were significant for craniocaudal (P = .0087) and anteroposterior (P = .014) planes, but not for the transverse plane (P = .23). Mean craniocaudal target diameter was 2.5 mm (range, -2 to 9 mm) larger (ie, distorted) for unmonitored versus monitored PET (P = .061).

Our previous studies have demonstrated that NBP promoted angiogenesis in the perifocal region of the ischemic brain. However, the molecular mechanism of NBP for blood-brain barrier protection in acute ischemic stroke was unclear. Here, we explored the neuroprotective effects of NBP on blood-brain barrier integrity in the acute phase of ischemic stroke in a rat model. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 82) underwent 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and received 90 mg/kg of NBP for 3 days. Brain edema, infarct volume, surface blood flow, and neurological severity score were evaluated. Blood-brain barrier integrity was evaluated by Evans blue leakage and changes in tight junction proteins. We further examined AQP4 and eNOS expression, MMP-9 enzyme activity, and possible signaling pathways for the role of NBP after ischemic stroke. Results: NBP treatment significantly increased eNOS expression and surface blood flow in the brain, reduced brain edema and infarct volume, and improved neurological severity score compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, NBP attenuated Evans blue and IgG leakage and increased tight junction protein expression compared to the control after 1 and 3 days of ischemic stroke (p < 0.05). Finally, NBP decreased AQP4 expression, MMP-9 enzyme activity, and increased MAPK expression during acute ischemic stroke. Conclusion: NBP protected blood-brain barrier integrity and attenuated brain injury in the acute phase of ischemic stroke by decreasing AQP4 expression and MMP-9 enzyme activity. The MAPK signaling pathway may be associated in this process.","Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Wei, Zhenyu; Qin, Chuan; Wang, Yongting; Tang, Yaohui; Shen, Fan-Xia; Tian, Heng-Li; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,630,5

Interestingly, a recently published phase 2 trial (NCT03248492) reported 60% overall response and 97% disease control in patients with HER2-positive disease previously treated with multiple regimens, including trastuzumab emtansine. On the basis of recent clinical trials, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to DS-8201a in advanced or unresectable HER2-positive breast cancer pretreated with at least two HER2-targeting treatment lines. We review all preclinical and clinical data of DS-8201a regarding breast cancer.","Andrikopoulou, Angeliki; Zografos, Eleni; Liontos, Michalis; Koutsoukos, Konstantinos; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Zagouri, Flora",Clinical breast cancer,630,1

Multiple factors affect RSV disease severity, and data regarding differences between RSV subtypes severity are controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, seasonality and severity of RSV subtypes in children. METHODS As part of a prospective ARI surveillance study conducted from March 2010 to March 2013 in Amman, Jordan, children less than 2 years with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected through parental interviews and medical chart review. The treating physician collected severity score data at admission. Nasal and throat swabs were collected and tested. Multivariable regression models were used to compare the odds of increased disease severity across a priori selected predictors of interest. RESULTS Overall, 1397/3168 (44%) children were RSV positive, with a mean age of 5.3 months (±4.8 SD), 59.7% were male, 6.4% had an underlying medical condition (UMC), 63.6% were RSV-A positive, 25.2% were RSV-B positive, 0.6% were positive for both, and 10.6% could not be typed. Both RSV subtypes peaked in January-March of each year. RSV A-positive children were more likely to present with decreased appetite but less likely to have viral co-detection than RSV B-positive children. Independent factors associated with RSV disease severity included cycle threshold value, vitamin D level, age, UMC, prematurity and severity score, but not RSV subtypes. CONCLUSION RSV subtypes co-circulated and had similar severity profiles; future preventive and treatment measures should target both subtypes.","Yanis, Ahmad; Haddadin, Zaid; Rahman, Herdi; Guevara, Claudia; McKay, Katlyn G; Probst, Varvara; Williams, John V; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Halasa, Natasha B",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,630,8

Psychosocial interventions have been shown to decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms in various chronic diseases, but few studies have examined their efficacy in people with chronic kidney disease and no meta-analysis has been published. Thus, the aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of psychosocial interventions on depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as quality of life in individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and/or their carers. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included published randomized controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions versus usual care for impacting depressive and anxiety symptoms and quality of life. Results: Eight studies were included in the systematic review and six of these were subjected to meta-analysis. Psychosocial interventions were associated with a medium effect size for reduction in depressive symptoms and a small effect size for improved quality of life in the in individuals with chronic-kidney-disease and their carers. Some evidence suggested a reduction in anxiety. Conclusion: Psychosocial interventions appear to reduce depressive symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with chronic-kidney-disease and their carers and to have some beneficial impact on anxiety.

Distinct modeling constructs have triggered varied ways of detecting such changes, almost every one of which gives in to certain shortcomings. Parametric models based on time series objects, for instance, work well under distributional assumptions or when change detection in specific properties - such as mean, variance, trend, etc. are of interest. Others rely heavily on the ""at most one change-point"" assumption, and implementing binary segmentation to discover subsequent changes comes at a hefty computational cost. This work offers an alternative that remains both versatile and untethered to such stifling constraints. Detection is done through a sequence of tests with variations to certain trend permuted statistics. We study non-stationary Hawkes patterns which, with an underlying stochastic intensity, imply a natural branching process structure. Our proposals are shown to estimate changes efficiently in both the immigrant and the offspring intensity without sounding too many false positives. Comparisons with established competitors reveal smaller Hausdorff-based estimation errors, desirable inferential properties such as asymptotic consistency and narrower bootstrapped margins.

Here, using a panel of replicase-specific antisera, we have analyzed the earlier stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in Vero E6 cells, in particular focusing on the subcellular localization of the replicase and the ultrastructure of the associated membranes. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the colocalization, throughout infection, of replicase cleavage products containing different key enzymes for SARS-CoV replication. Electron microscopy revealed the early formation and accumulation of typical double-membrane vesicles, which probably carry the viral replication complex. The vesicles appear to be fragile, and their preservation was significantly improved by using cryofixation protocols and freeze substitution methods. In immunoelectron microscopy, the virus-induced vesicles could be labeled with replicase-specific antibodies. Opposite to what was described for mouse hepatitis virus, we did not observe the late relocalization of specific replicase subunits to the presumed site of virus assembly, which was labeled using an antiserum against the viral membrane protein. This conclusion was further supported using organelle-specific marker proteins and electron microscopy. Similar morphological studies and labeling experiments argued against the previously proposed involvement of the autophagic pathway as the source for the vesicles with which the replicase is associated and instead suggested the endoplasmic reticulum to be the most likely donor of the membranes that carry the SARS-CoV replication complex.","Snijder, Eric J; van der Meer, Yvonne; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika; Onderwater, Jos J M; van der Meulen, Jannes; Koerten, Henk K; Mommaas, A Mieke",Journal of virology,630,24

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress. Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches. Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and 10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification (Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score, respectively.","Rashid, Nafiul; Chen, Luke; Dautta, Manik; Jimenez, Abel; Tseng, Peter; Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah Al",ArXiv,630,16

Vitamin D is important for reducing the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and plays a role in pulmonary epithelial health. While the importance of vitamin D for a healthy immune system has been known for decades, the benefits of magnesium has only recently been elucidated. Indeed, magnesium is important for activating vitamin D and has a protective role against oxidative stress. Magnesium deficiency increases endothelial cell susceptibility to oxidative stress, promotes endothelial dysfunction, reduces fibrinolysis and increases coagulation. Furthermore, magnesium deficient animals and humans have depressed immune responses, which, when supplemented with magnesium, a partial or near full reversal of the immunodeficiency occurs. Moreover, intracellular free magnesium levels in natural killer cells and CD8 killer T cells regulates their cytotoxicity. Considering that magnesium and vitamin D are important for immune function and cellular resilience, a deficiency in either may contribute to cytokine storm in the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection.","DiNicolantonio, James J; O'Keefe, James H",Missouri medicine,630,29

The aim of this study was to evaluate seasonal trends and the role of these pathogens in asthma exacerbations in school-aged children from Oporto (Portugal). METHODS Nasal aspirates were collected from children aged 6 to 12 years old with asthma exacerbations attended in the Pediatric Emergency Department one day per week from January 1 to December 31, 2003. Demographic data, severity of asthma and asthma exacerbations, and current treatment were recorded. Samples were obtained through nasal wash with 1 ml saline and were processed by immunofluorescence assays (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza and influenza virus), retrotranscription polymerase chain reaction (rhinovirus) and polymerase chain reaction (enterovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). RESULTS In 54 eligible children, 37 nasal samples were obtained. Infectious agents were detected in 78 % of the patients. Rhinovirus was detected in 70.3 %, Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 16.2 %, enterovirus in 10.8 %, and Chlamydia pneumoniae in 2.7 %. Coinfection was identified in 21.6 % of the samples. There was no significant correlation between current treatment status, severity of asthma or exacerbations and the isolated agents. Two distinct peaks of asthma exacerbation were found, 40.5 % in spring and 32.4 % in autumn [corrected] The highest number of cases was recorded in March and the lowest in August and January. Rhinoviruses was detected in 27 % of the cases in autumn and in 24.3 % in spring [corrected] CONCLUSIONS These results confirm the previously reported high frequency of rhinovirus detection in asthma exacerbations in children and provide evidence that asthma exacerbations and rhinovirus infections follow a seasonal pattern, occurring mostly in spring and autumn. The findings also underscore the frequency of Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection, and emphasize the importance of this agent as a possible trigger of asthma exacerbations.","João Silva, M; Ferraz, C; Pissarra, S; Cardoso, M J; Simões, J; Bonito Vítor, A",Allergologia et immunopathologia,630,16

Otomorpha is a morphologically heterogeneous group represented by clupei forms , alepocephaliforms, and ostariophysans (gonorynchiforms, cypriniforms, characiforms, siluriforms, and gymnoti forms) that inhabit various marine and freshwater environments worldwide. Otomorphs have a long (ca. 145 Ma) and diverse fossil record. They are the largest fish teleostean clade worldwide, as well as the largest of the Neotropical Region. While molecular studies strongly confirm the monophyly of Otomorpha, most potential morphological synapomorphies of the group become homoplastic largely due to the peculiar morphological character states (either losses or transformations) present in alepocephaliforms. The fusion of haemal arches with their respective vertebral centra anterior to preural centrum 2 stands as an unambiguous synapomorphy of the clade. The ankylosis or fusion of the extrascapular and parietal bones, and silvery areas associated with the gas bladder are also interpreted as synapomorphies, although they are homoplastic characters mainly due to secondary losses or further transformations of the morphological features in the alepocephaliforms.(AU)","Arratia, Gloria",Neotrop. ichthyol,630,32

This study explores a typology of adaptive shopping patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved a survey of 465 Indonesian consumers. Principal component analysis is used to identify the variables related to adaptive shopping patterns. Cluster analysis of the factor scores obtained on the adaptive shopping attitude and behaviour revealed the typology of Indonesian shoppers’ adaptive patterns. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) analysis is used to profile the identified clusters based on attitude, behaviour and demographic characteristics. Results revealed five adaptive shopping patterns with substantial differences among them. This study provides in-depth information about the profile of Indonesian shoppers’ adaptive patterns that would help retailers in understanding consumers and choosing their target group. The major contribution of this study is providing segmentation on shopping adaptive patterns in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic which presents interesting differences compared with previous studies.

However, for a given fat mass, there is a large variability in the risk prediction of these cardiometabolic diseases. For example, some lean people unexpectedly have a risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that is similar to the increased risk that is observed in most people who have obesity. What both of these phenotypes have in common is a very characteristic fat distribution. As a result, much focus has been given on the strong predictive power of increased visceral fat mass. However, an analysis of the causes of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as comparisons to rare diseases such as lipodystrophy and studying genetically determined fat distribution in the general population, suggest that an impaired ability to expand subcutaneous fat in the lower part of the body is also important for predicting the incidence of these cardiometabolic diseases. This Review, first, addresses the identification of distinct fat distribution phenotypes and their risk of cardiometabolic diseases by discussing findings from published studies that have applied precise quantification of different fat depots. Second, this Review provides support for the theory that a lower amount of lower-body fat mass is equally important to a high amount of visceral fat mass as a determinant of cardiometabolic diseases. Third, this Review discusses the genetic and lifestyle-related causes of metabolically healthy and unhealthy fat distribution. Finally, this Review summarises and appraises the effectiveness of lifestyle-related interventions and pharmacological interventions for reducing visceral adiposity and maintaining lower-body fat mass to prevent and treat cardiometabolic diseases.","Stefan, Norbert",Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol,630,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional single-centre study was conducted on 42 participants who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via an NPS within the past 7 days. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained for each test. The positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for the saliva samples and buccal swabs, and compared with NPS. RESULTS: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive by any one of the three tests.

SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials evaluating the effect of anakinra on the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized non-intubated patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies (n = 1,119) were eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. Their bias risk with reference to the assessed parameters was high. In pooled analyses, anakinra reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, OR: 0·38, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0·17-0·85, p= 0.02, I2=67%; 6 studies, n = 587) and mortality risk (OR: 0·32, 95% CI: 0·23-0·45, p< 0·00001, I2=0%; 9 studies, n = 1,119) compared with standard of care therapy.

Although the basic influence of information diffusion could be larger in human users than bots, the effects of bots are non-negligible under an infodemic situation.","Xu, Wentao; Sasahara, Kazutoshi",,630,0

259061,259061,259061,Errors in Tables 1 and 2,21.890623,9.460378,2021,"BACKGROUND: Self-care interventions offer a solution to support the achievement of three goals of the World Health Organization (WHO): to improve universal health coverage, reach people in humanitarian situations, and improve health and well-being. In light of implementing WHO consolidated guidelines on self-care interventions to strengthen sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists from four different EMR countries discussed the current SRH situation, inequality gaps, barriers to SRH service access and the pharmacist's crucial role as a first-line responder to patients before, during and after COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Self-care interventions for SRH allow health care providers to serve a greater number of patients, improve progress toward universal health coverage, and reach people in humanitarian crises. In fact, these interventions can be significantly enhanced by utilizing community pharmacists as first-line health care providers. This review highlights the important role of community pharmacists in promoting self-care interventions and empowering individuals, families and communities. As a result, well-informed individuals will be authoritative in their health decisions. Exploring self-care interventions in the EMR was done through reviewing selected SRH services delivery through community pharmacists before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, community pharmacists were found to be excluded from both governmental and nongovernmental SRH programmes. During the pandemic, community pharmacists managed to support patients with self-care interventions, whether voluntarily or through their pharmacy associations. This highlights the need for the health care decision-makers to involve and support community pharmacists in influencing policies and promoting self-care interventions. CONCLUSION: Self-care interventions can increase individuals' choice and autonomy over SRH. Supporting community pharmacists will definitely strengthen SRH in the EMR and may help make the health system more efficient and more targeted.","El Bizri, Luna; Jarrar, Laila Ghazi; Ali, Wael K Ali; Omar, Abdifatah H",Health Res Policy Syst,630,1

Deep learning methods especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in COVID-19 diagnosis in recent works. But they are efficient when the depth of network is high enough. However, the use of a deep network requires a sufficiently large training set, which is not available in practice. From the other hand, the use of a shallow CNN may not provide superior results because it is not able to rich feature extraction due to lacking enough convolutional layers. To deal with this difficulty, the contextual features reduced by convolutional filters (CFRCF) is proposed in this work. CFRCF extracts shape and textural features as contextual feature maps from the chest X-ray radiographs and abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. Morphological operators, Gabor filter banks and attribute filters are used for contextual feature extraction. Then, two convolutional filters are applied to the contextual feature cube to extract the nonlinear sub-features and hidden relationships among the contextual features. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to produce a reduced feature vector which is fed to a classifier. Support vector machine and random forest are used as classifier. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method from the recognition accuracy and running time point of view using limited training samples. More than 76% and 94% overall classification accuracy is obtained by the proposed method in CT scan and X-ray images datasets, respectively.","Imani, Maryam",Biomed Signal Process Control,630,16

This study represents the second cycle of a Plan-Do-Study-Act ramp to assess and improve three exercise promotion practice models and a screening process for use by healthcare providers to bridge the knowledge-translation gap within comprehensive multiple sclerosis care. METHODS: Using a quality improvement design, our research team created an online survey for evaluating program materials by healthcare providers (i.e., neurologists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists). Participants provided written comments and suggestions for improvement regarding roles and responsibilities and clarity and relatability of these tools within a real-world setting. RESULTS: Healthcare providers submitted 13 suggestions for improvement. Responses informed four specific improvements regarding program materials (i.e., patient screening, current exercise behavior, referrals, and provider checklists), thereby prompting the research team to adapt and further test the change idea.

Multiple new guidelines were proposed and existing models of social, domestic and hospital care altered. Most healthcare systems were largely unprepared for this, and the pandemic has tested their adaptability. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the demographics, presentation, clinical management and outcomes of patients with proximal femoral (hip) fractures comparing them to a similar cohort of patients admitted a year earlier. METHODS: This retrospective multi-centre cohort study compared all patients admitted with hip fractures between 1st March and 30th May 2019 (group PC: pre-COVID-19) with hip fracture patients admitted over the same time period during the pandemic in 2020 (group C: COVID-19). The data was obtained from the hospitals' local and National Hip Fracture Databases. Mortality data was checked with the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Primary outcomes were time to theatre, in-patient length of stay and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 580 patients were included (304 group PC, 276 group C). Patient demographics including Charlson Comorbidity Index and Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores were broadly similar across the two cohorts. There was a significant reduction in the percentage of total hip replacements (11 to 5%, p = 0.006) in group C. There was an increase in conservative management (1 to 5%, p = 0.002) in group C. Time to theatre was significantly delayed in group C (43.7 h) vs group PC (34.6 h) (p &#8804; 0.001). The overall length of hospital stay was significantly longer in group PC (16.6 days) vs group C (15 days) (p = 0.025). The 30-day mortality rate in group C was 9.8% compared to 8.2% in group PC (p = 0.746), but for COVID-19 (+) patients, it was significantly higher at 38.2% vs 5.8% in COVID-19 (-) patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest multi-centre comparative cohort study in the literature to date examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of hip fracture patients. Whilst mortality rates were similar in both groups, COVID-19-positive patients were almost seven times more likely to die, reflecting the seriousness of the COVID-19 infection and its sequelae in such elderly, vulnerable patients.","Wignall, Alice; Giannoudis, Vasileios; De, Chiranjit; Jimenez, Andrea; Sturdee, Simon; Nisar, Sohail; Pandit, Hemant; Gulati, Aashish; Palan, Jeya",J Orthop Surg Res,630,1

We discuss this vulnerability among LTCF residents using an ecological framework, on levels spanning from the individual to families and caregivers, institutions, health services and systems, communities, and contextual government policies. Challenges abound for fully understanding the burden of COVID-19 in LTCF, including differences in nomenclature, data collection systems, cultural differences, varied social welfare models, and (often) under-resourcing of the LTC sector. Registration of cases and deaths may be limited by testing capacity and policy, record-keeping and reporting procedures. Hospitalization and death rates may be inaccurate depending on atypical presentations and whether or not residents' goals of care include escalation of care and transfer to hospital. Given the important contribution of frailty, use of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is discussed as a readily implementable measure, as are lessons learned from the study of frailty in relation to influenza. Biomarkers hold emerging promise in helping to predict disease severity and address the puzzle of why some frail LTCF residents are resilient to COVID-19, either remaining test-negative despite exposure or having asymptomatic infection, while others experience the full range of illness severity including critical illness and death. Strong and coordinated surveillance and research focused on LTCFs and their frail residents is required. These efforts should include widespread assessment of frailty using feasible and readily implementable tools such as the CFS, and rigorous reporting of morbidity and mortality in LTCFs.","Andrew, Melissa; Searle, Samuel D; McElhaney, Janet E; McNeil, Shelly A; Clarke, Barry; Rockwood, Kenneth; Kelvin, David J",J Infect Dev Ctries,630,16

In this white paper, we estimate that Australian astronomers' total greenhouse gas emissions from their regular work activities are>~15 ktCO_2-e/yr (equivalent kilotonnes of carbon dioxide per year). This can be broken into 4.3 +/- 1.1 ktCO_2-e/yr from flights, ~6.8 ktCO_2-e/yr from supercomputer usage, ~1.8 ktCO_2-e/yr from powering office buildings, and ~2 ktCO_2-e/yr from the operation of the Murchison Radio Observatory (with other observatories unaccounted for here that would add to this number). Split across faculty scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD students, this averages to>~19 tCO_2-e/yr per astronomer. We outline steps astronomers can take to reduce their emissions from these environmentally unsustainable practices. (1) We should exclusively use supercomputers and observatories that are powered predominantly by renewable energy sources. Where facilities that we currently use are unsatisfactory, they should be lobbied to invest in renewables, such as solar or wind farms. Emphasis must also be placed on code efficiency for projects that consume millions of CPU core-hours. (2) Air travel should be reduced wherever possible, replaced primarily by video conferencing. We emphasise that while carbon offsetting should be mandatory for all 'unavoidable' travel, it does not negate carbon emissions, and hence does not justify flights. Based on an ICRAR-UWA case study, senior scientists have the greatest responsibility to reduce flying, as they generate ~70% more emissions per person from flying than postdocs, and more than triple that of PhD students, on average.

The extent and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is far greater than previous coronaviruses that emerged in the 21st Century. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4°C± 2°C, 22°C± 2°C, and 37°C ± 2°C). We evaluated stability at 0 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days, and 14 days post-exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was stable on skin through the duration of the experiment at 4°C (14 days). Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22°C and for at least 8h at 37°C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4°C while we did not detect viable virus on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h. The virus remained stable on both Bank Notes for at least 8 h at 22°C and 4 h at 37°C. Clothing samples were similar in stability to the currency. Viable virus remained for at least 96 h at 4°C and at least 4 h at 22°C. We did not detect viable virus on clothing samples at 37°C after initial exposure. This study confirms the inverse relationship between virus stability and temperature. Furthermore, virus stability on skin demonstrates the need for continued hand hygiene practices to minimize fomite transmission both in the general population as well as in workplaces where close contact is common.","Harbourt, David E; Haddow, Andrew D; Piper, Ashley E; Bloomfield, Holly; Kearney, Brian J; Fetterer, David; Gibson, Kathleen; Minogue, Timothy",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,630,29

However, not all US hospitals possess telehealth capabilities. This brief report was designed to explore US hospitals' readiness with respect to telehealth availability. We hope to gain deeper insight into the factors affecting possession of these valuable capabilities, and how this varies between rural and urban areas. METHODS: Based on 2017 data from the American Hospital Association survey, Area Health Resource Files and Medicare cost reports, we used logistic regression models to identify predictors of telehealth and eICU capabilities in US hospitals. RESULTS: We found that larger hospitals (OR(telehealth) = 1.013; P < .01) and system members (OR(telehealth) = 1.55; P < .01) (OR(eICU) = 1.65; P < .01) had higher odds of possessing telehealth and eICU capabilities. We also found evidence suggesting that telehealth and eICU capabilities are concentrated in particular regions; the West North Central region was the most likely to possess capabilities, given that these hospitals had higher odds of possessing telehealth (OR = 1.49; P < .10) and eICU capabilities (OR = 2.15; P < .05). Rural hospitals had higher odds of possessing telehealth capabilities as compared to their urban counterparts, although this relationship was marginally significant (OR = 1.34, P < .10). CONCLUSIONS: US hospitals vary in their preparation to use telehealth to aid in the COVID-19 battle, among other issues.

COVID-19 has significantly affected human health and it has impacted on the occupation of vulnerable groups such as tour guides, drivers and shop assistants. Of these, the present study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 self-isolation policy on the occupation of vulnerable groups in Semarang City, Indonesia. To achieve this objective, this study uses a qualitative method with an ethnography approach considering a rational or non-rational thinking model. The binary opposition thinking pattern pioneered by Lévi-Strauss was used in the interview process with 25 informants in Semarang City, Indonesia. The data analyzed the response pattern of informants through the taxonomy analysis. Three levels of vulnerability among groups relating to occupation were identified; jobs lost, income decreased, and delayed salary. The result of the analysis found that the group who obeyed self-isolation was categorized as a rational thinking; these groups stay at home, do not go to work, and have no income. Besides that, the group who ignored self-isolation is categorized as non-rational thinking; they work, as usual, get their salary, and believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster and they pray for their safety to God. In conclusion, COVID-19 brings a significant impact on occupation in the forms of postponing, declining, and missing income besides the health effects among vulnerable groups in Semarang city, Indonesia. In avoiding COVID-19 infection, the circumstances of vulnerable groups are worse when self-isolation is required. Thus, this study suggests that the government needs to assist vulnerable groups by focusing on strategic policies, such as strategies for survival, providing access to basic needs, including health, and offering livelihood plans by providing access to medical services and other source of income.","Amirudin, Amirudin; Urbanski, Mariusz; Saputra, Jumadil; Johansyah, Muhamad Deni; Latip, Latip; Tarmizi, Ahmad; Afrizal, Teuku",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),630,4

Early and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in reducing the spread of the disease and its accompanied mortality. Currently, detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard of outpatient and inpatient detection of Covid-19. RT-PCR is a rapid method, however, its accuracy in detection is only ~70-75%. Another approved strategy is computed tomography (CT) imaging. CT imaging has a much higher sensitivity of ~80-98%, but similar accuracy of 70%. To enhance the accuracy of CT imaging detection, we developed an open-source set of algorithms called CovidCTNet that successfully differentiates Covid-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. CovidCTNet increases the accuracy of CT imaging detection to 90% compared to radiologists (70%). The model is designed to work with heterogeneous and small sample sizes independent of the CT imaging hardware. In order to facilitate the detection of Covid-19 globally and assist radiologists and physicians in the screening process, we are releasing all algorithms and parametric details in an open-source format.

The population is generally susceptible to COVID-19, which mainly causes lung injury. Some cases may develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Currently, ARDS treatment is mainly mechanical ventilation, but mechanical ventilation often causes ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) accompanied by hypercapnia in 14% of patients. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) can remove carbon dioxide from the blood of patients with ARDS, correct the respiratory acidosis, reduce the tidal volume and airway pressure, and reduce the incidence of VILI. CASE REPORT: Two patients with critical COVID-19 combined with multiple organ failure undertook mechanical ventilation and suffered from hypercapnia. ECCO2R, combined with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), was conducted concomitantly. In both cases (No. 1 and 2), the tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were down-regulated before the treatment and at 1.5 hours, one day, three days, five days, eight days, and ten days after the treatment, together with a noticeable decrease in PCO2 and clear increase in PO2, while FiO2 decreased to approximately 40%. In case No 2, compared with the condition before treatment, the PCO2 decreased significantly with down-regulation in the tidal volume and PEEP and improvement in the pulmonary edema and ARDS after the treatment. CONCLUSION: ECCO2R combined with continuous blood purification therapy in patients with COVID-19 who are criti-cally ill and have ARDS and hypercapnia might gain both time and opportunity in the treatment, down-regulate the ventilator parameters, reduce the incidence of VILI and achieve favorable therapeutic outcomes.","Chen, Ye; Wang, Shouhong; Huang, Jianrong; Fu, Yingyun; Wen, Juanmin; Zhou, Chengbin; Fu, Yang; Liu, Lei",,630,16

We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods: In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings: We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation: COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions (suspension of public transportation, cancellation of mass gatherings, implementation of surveillance and testing, and promotion of personal hygiene and face mask use).","Wang, Yuke; Teunis, Peter",Front.

Growing evidence suggests that the nasopharyngeal and respiratory tract microbiome are influenced by various health and disease conditions, including the presence and the severity of different viral disease. To evaluate the potential interactions between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the nasopharyngeal microbiome. Microbial composition of nasopharyngeal swab samples submitted to the clinical microbiology lab for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections was assessed using 16S amplicon sequencing. The study included a total of 55 nasopharyngeal samples from 33 subjects, with longitudinal sampling available for 12 out of the 33 subjects. 21 of the 33 subjects had at least one positive COVID-19 PCR results as determined by the clinical microbiology lab. Inter-personal variation was the strongest factor explaining > 75% of the microbial variation, irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 status. No significant effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the nasopharyngeal microbial community was observed using multiple analysis methods. These results indicate that unlike some other viruses, for which an effect on the microbial composition was noted, SARS-CoV-2 does not have a strong effect on the nasopharynx microbial habitants.","Braun, Tzipi; Halevi, Shiraz; Hadar, Rotem; Efroni, Gilate; Glick Saar, Efrat; Keller, Natahan; Amir, Amnon; Amit, Sharon; Haberman, Yael",Sci Rep,630,26

This study aimed to obtain a taste-masked formulation of TMS by hot melt extrusion (HME) technology and to investigate the formulation's characterization, stability, and effects in vitro/in vivo. Eudragit® E PO was selected as the carrier, and TMS dissolution in artificial saliva was used as a reference. The HME parameters were optimized via an orthogonal design. The optimized results were as follows: 135 â extrusion temperature, 100â¯rpm screw speed and 30 % drug load. The masking efficiency of the formulation was evaluated by both simulated oral drug release in vitro and electronic tongue tests. The release of the taste-masked formulation in artificial saliva medium was significantly reduced within 60â¯s (less than 2%), while the release in 0.1â¯M HCl buffer was fast (more than 80 %) within 30â¯min. As suggested by the results of the electronic tongue, the taste-masked formulation had a better taste-masked effect than the commercial premix and the commercial enteric granules. Finally, a pharmacokinetic study was performed. Analysis of variance demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic behavior of the TMS taste-masked formulation was similar to that of the commercial premix, while the absorption effect was better than that of the commercially available enteric granules. This research indicates that the taste-masked formulation has the potential for future commercialization.","Yan, Guoqing; Liang, Qiuling; Wen, Xuemei; Peng, Jianbo; Deng, Ruihan; Lv, Li; Ji, Min; Deng, Xin; Wu, Liqin; Feng, Xin; He, Jiakang",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,630,26

We studied the long-term temporal relationship between several antimicrobial drug groups and the composition of the human gut microbiota determined in feces samples. METHODS: Feces samples were obtained from a community-dwelling cohort of middle-aged and elderly individuals (Rotterdam Study). Bacterial DNA was isolated and sequenced using V3/V4 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). The time between the last prescription of several antimicrobial drug groups and the day of sampling was categorized into 0-12, 12-24, 24-48 and >48 months. The effects of the antimicrobial drug groups on the Shannon alpha-diversity (diversity), the Bray-Curtis beta-diversity (community structure), the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and individual genera were determined. RESULTS: We studied the gut microbiota of 1413 individuals (57.5% female, median age 62.6 years). The alpha-diversity was significantly lower up to 4 years after prescriptions of macrolides and lincosamides. It was also lower in the first year after the use of beta-lactams. The community structure (beta-diversity) of the microbiota was significantly different up to 4 years for macrolides and lincosamides, the first year for beta-lactams and at least the first year for quinolones. For the F/B ratio, drugs with a high anaerobic activity shifted the ratio toward Firmicutes in the first year whereas other antimicrobial drugs shifted the ratio toward Bacteroidetes. CONCLUSION: Use of antimicrobial drugs is associated with a shift in the composition of the gut microbiota.These effects differ in strength and duration, depending on the antimicrobial drug group used. These findings should be considered when prescribing antimicrobial drugs.","Mulder, M; Radjabzadeh, D; Kiefte-de Jong, J C; Uitterlinden, A G; Kraaij, R; Stricker, B H; Verbon, A",Gut Microbes,630,1

METHODS: We performed an audit of performance of neuroendovascular procedures at 18 institutions (seven countries) for two periods; January-April 2019 and 2020, to identify changes in various core procedures. We divided the region where the hospital was located based on the median value of total number of COVID-19 cases per 100,00 population-into high and low prevalent regions. RESULTS: Between 2019 and 2020, there was a reduction in number of cerebral angiograms (30.9% reduction), mechanical thrombectomy (8% reduction), carotid artery stent placement for symptomatic (22.7% reduction) and asymptomatic (43.4% reduction) stenoses, intracranial angioplasty and/or stent placement (45% reduction), and endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (44.6% reduction) and ruptured (22.9% reduction) and unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (66.4% reduction). There was an increase in the treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (10% increase) and other neuroendovascular procedures (34.9% increase). There was no relationship between procedural volume change and intuitional location in high or low COVID-19 prevalent regions. The procedural volume reduction was mainly observed in March-April 2020.

A cytokine storm has been recognized as one of the leading causes of death in patients with COVID-19. ALI and ARDS along with multiple organ failure have also been presented as the consequences of acute inflammation and cytokine storm. It has been previously confirmed that SARS-CoV, as another member of the beta-CoV family, activates NLRP3 inflammasome and consequently develops acute inflammation in a variety of ways through having complex interactions with the host immune system using structural and nonstructural proteins. Numerous studies conducted on Tranilast have further demonstrated that the given drug can act as an effective anti-chemotactic factor on controlling inflammation, and thus, it can possibly help the improvement of the acute form of COVID-19 by inhibiting some key inflammation-associated transcription factors such as NF-&#954;B and impeding NLRP3 inflammasome. Several studies have comparably revealed the direct effect of this drug on the prevention of inappropriate tissue's remodeling; inhibition of neutrophils, IL-5, and eosinophils; repression of inflammatory cell infiltration into inflammation site; restriction of factors involved in acute airway inflammation like IL-33; and suppression of cytokine IL-13, which increase mucosal secretions.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of data collected by the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS). Data were analysed using multivariate regression analysis. SETTING: Acute hospital trusts in England that submit data to CHESS routinely. PARTICIPANTS: Of 14 150 patients included in CHESS until 13 May 2020, 401 lacked a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and 7666 lacked a recorded date of symptom onset. This left 6083 individuals, of whom 15 were excluded because the time between symptom onset and hospital admission exceeded 3 months. The study cohort therefore comprised 6068 unique individuals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality during the study period. RESULTS: Timing of hospital admission was an independent predictor of mortality following adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, ethnicity and obesity. Each additional day between symptom onset and hospital admission was associated with a 1% increase in mortality risk (HR 1.01; p<0.005). Healthcare workers were most likely to have an increased interval between symptom onset and hospital admission, as were people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, and patients with obesity. CONCLUSION: The timing of hospital admission is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Healthcare workers and individuals from a BAME background are at greater risk of later admission, which may contribute to reports of poorer outcomes in these groups. Strategies to identify and admit patients with high-risk and those showing signs of deterioration in a timely way may reduce the consequent mortality from COVID-19, and should be explored.","Alaa, Ahmed; Qian, Zhaozhi; Rashbass, Jem; Benger, Jonathan; van der Schaar, Mihaela",BMJ Open,630,24

Characterization of the aerosol and bioaerosol was carried out to estimate the personal exposure to aerosol concentrations, as well as particle size distributions, and to give an indication of the native microbial load.The data obtained showed a predominance of particles with a diameter greater than 8 µm, associated with low ability of penetration in the human respiratory system. A low microbial load was also observed, with a prevalence of noncultivable strains generated by the aerosolization of the thermal waters.Finally, the estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by means of mathematical modeling revealed a low risk of transmission, with a decisive effect given by the mechanical ventilation system, which together with the adoption of social distancing measures makes the risk of infection extremely low.","Scungio, Mauro; Crognale, Silvia; Lelli, Davide; Carota, Eleonora; Calabrò, Giuseppe",,630,28

This process is delicately adjusted by the variant residues of MHC I, especially the residues in the peptide binding groove (PBG). In a series of MHC I molecules, a salt bridge is formed above the N-terminus of the peptides. However, the potential impact of the salt bridge on peptide binding and T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of MHC I, as well as the corresponding molecular basis, are still largely unknown. Herein, we determined the structures of HLA-B*4001 and H-2K(d) in which two different types of salt bridges (Arg62-Glu163 or Arg66-Glu163) across the PBG were observed. Although the two salt bridges led to different conformation shifts of both the MHC I α helix and the peptides, binding of the peptides with the salt bridge residues was relatively conserved. Furthermore, through a series of in vitro and in vivo investigations, we found that MHC I mutations that disrupt the salt bridge alleviate peptide binding and can weaken the TCR recognition of MHC I-peptide complexes.

Severe Covid-19 fulfills the diagnostic criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, it is unclear whether there is any relationship between ventilatory management and AKI development in Covid-19 ICU patients. PURPOSE: To describe the clinical course and outcomes of Covid-19 ICU patients, focusing on ventilatory management and factors associated with AKI development. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective observational study, which assessed AKI incidence in Covid-19 ICU patients divided by positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) tertiles, with median levels of 9.6 (low), 12.0 (medium), and 14.7 cmH(2)O (high-PEEP). RESULTS: Overall mortality was 51.5%. AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3) occurred in 38% of 101 patients. Among the AKI patients, 19 (53%) required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). In AKI patients, mortality was significantly higher versus non-AKI (81% vs. 33%, p < 0.0001). The incidence of AKI in low-, medium-, or high-PEEP patients were 16%, 38%, and 59%, respectively (p = 0.002). In a multivariate analysis, high-PEEP patients showed a higher risk of developing AKI than low-PEEP patients (OR = 4.96 [1.1–21.9] 95% CI p < 0.05). ICU mortality rate was higher in high-PEEP patients, compared to medium-PEEP or low-PEEP patients (69% vs. 44% and 42%, respectively; p = 0.057). CONCLUSION: The use of high PEEP in Covid-19 ICU patients is associated with a fivefold higher risk of AKI, leading to higher mortality. The cause and effect relationship needs further analysis.

Recently, nanomaterials-based biosensors have attracted enormous interest due to their biological activities and unique sensing properties, which enable the detection of analytes such as nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), aptamers, and proteins in clinical samples. In addition, the advances of nanotechnologies also enable the development of miniaturized detection systems for point-of-care (POC) biosensors, which could be a new strategy for detecting human viral diseases. The detection of virus-specific genes by using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes has become a particular interest due to their higher sensitivity and specificity compared to immunological methods based on antibody or antigen for early diagnosis of viral infection. Hence, this review has been developed to provide an overview of the current development of nanoparticles-based biosensors that target pathogenic RNA viruses, toward a robust and effective detection strategy of the existing or newly emerging human viral diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. This review emphasizes the nanoparticles-based biosensors developed using noble metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) by virtue of their powerful characteristics as a signal amplifier or enhancer in the detection of nucleic acid. In addition, this review provides a broad knowledge with respect to several analytical methods involved in the development of nanoparticles-based biosensors for the detection of viral nucleic acid using both optical and electrochemical techniques.","Ibrahim, Nadiah; Jamaluddin, Nur Diyana; Tan, Ling Ling; Mohd Yusof, Nurul Yuziana",Sensors (Basel),630,5

At last, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have risen high on the global policy agenda, but there are many disputed issues. First, what are they? Their name refers not to what they are but what they are not. Second, where do their boundaries lie? What diseases are included? Third, should we view their causes as mainly biomedical, behavioural, or social, or a combination? Our failure to resolve these issues has been invoked as a reason for our limited progress in developing and implementing effective remedies. In this scoping review, we ask “What is known from the existing literature about how NCDs are framed in the global policy discourses?” We answer it by reviewing the frames employed in policy and academic discourses. METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases for articles published since inception to 31 May 2019. We also reviewed websites of eight international organisations to identify global NCDs policies. We extracted data and synthesised findings to identify key thematic frames. RESULTS: We included 36 articles and nine policy documents on global NCDs policies. We identified five discursive domains that have been used and where there are differing perspectives. These are: “Expanding the NCDs frame to include mental health and air pollution”; “NCDs and their determinants”; “A rights-based approach to NCDs”; “Approaches to achieving policy coherence in NCDs globally”; and “NCDs as part of Sustainable Socio-economic Development”. We further identified 12 frames within the five discursive domains. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identifies issues that remain unresolved and points to a need for alignment of perspectives among global health policy actors, as well as synergies with those working on mental health, maternal health, and child health. The current COVID-19 pandemic warrants greater consideration of its impact on global NCDs policies. Future global strategies for NCDs need to consider explicitly how NCDs are framed in a changing global health discourse and ensure adequate alignment with implementation and global health issues. There is a need for global strategies to recognise the pertinent role of actors in shaping policy discourses.

While these technological innovations are bound to transform health care, they also bring new ethical concerns to the forefront. One particularly elusive challenge regards discriminatory algorithmic judgements based on biases inherent in the training data. A common line of reasoning distinguishes between justified differential treatments that mirror true disparities between socially salient groups, and unjustified biases which do not, leading to misdiagnosis and erroneous treatment. In the curation of training data this strategy runs into severe problems though, since distinguishing between the two can be next to impossible. We thus plead for a pragmatist dealing with algorithmic bias in healthcare environments. By recurring to a recent reformulation of William James’s pragmatist understanding of truth, we recommend that, instead of aiming at a supposedly objective truth, outcome-based therapeutic usefulness should serve as the guiding principle for assessing ML applications in medicine.","Starke, Georg; De Clercq, Eva; Elger, Bernice S.",Med Health Care Philos,630,33

Ramping up the testing capacity of a country supposes an essential public health response to this new outbreak. A pool testing strategy where multiple samples are tested in a single reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) kit could potentially increase a country's testing capacity. The aim of this study is to propose a simple mathematical model to estimate the optimum number of pooled samples according to the relative prevalence of positive tests in a particular healthcare context, assuming that if a group tests negative, no further testing is done whereas if a group tests positive, all the subjects of the group are retested individually. The model predicts group sizes that range from 11 to 3 subjects. For a prevalence of 10% of positive tests, 40.6% of tests can be saved using testing groups of four subjects. For a 20% prevalence, 17.9% of tests can be saved using groups of three subjects. For higher prevalences, the strategy flattens and loses effectiveness. Pool testing individuals for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a valuable strategy that could considerably boost a country's testing capacity. However, further studies are needed to address how large these groups can be, without losing sensitivity on the RT‐PCR. The strategy best works in settings with a low prevalence of positive tests. It is best implemented in subgroups with low clinical suspicion. The model can be adapted to specific prevalences, generating a tailored to the context implementation of the pool testing strategy.","Aragón‐Caqueo, Diego; Fernández‐Salinas, Javier; Laroze, David",J Med Virol,630,1

Consequently, many people now wear surgical face masks in public. We investigated whether surgical face masks affected the performance of human observers, and a state-of-the-art face recognition system, on tasks of perceptual face matching. Participants judged whether two simultaneously presented face photographs showed the same person or two different people. We superimposed images of surgical masks over the faces, creating three different mask conditions: control (no masks), mixed (one face wearing a mask), and masked (both faces wearing masks). We found that surgical face masks have a large detrimental effect on human face matching performance, and that the degree of impairment is the same regardless of whether one or both faces in each pair are masked. Surprisingly, this impairment is similar in size for both familiar and unfamiliar faces. When matching masked faces, human observers are biased to reject unfamiliar faces as “mismatches” and to accept familiar faces as “matches”. Finally, the face recognition system showed very high classification accuracy for control and masked stimuli, even though it had not been trained to recognise masked faces. However, accuracy fell markedly when one face was masked and the other was not. Our findings demonstrate that surgical face masks impair the ability of humans, and naïve face recognition systems, to perform perceptual face matching tasks. Identification decisions for masked faces should be treated with caution.","Carragher, Daniel J.; Hancock, Peter J. B.",Cogn Res Princ Implic,630,3

BACKGROUND: Persistent symptoms after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection are referred to as ""post-COVID-19 syndrome"" (PCS), with a reported incidence ranging between 35% and 87%. Fatigue, palpitations and exercise intolerance are common complains among PCS patients in whom unexplained sinus tachycardia, occasionally exacerbated by postural changes, is a frequent observation that remains poorly characterized. PURPOSE: We sought to characterize the prevalence of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) and postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS) in a consecutive and prospective population of patients with PCS. METHODS: Consecutive patients with persistent symptoms 3 months after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively evaluated at a multi-disciplinary PCS unit. All patients were screened for IST or POTS and those with confirmed criteria underwent comprehensive cardiovascular examination including echocardiography, 24-hour Holter, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), six-minute walking test (6MWT) and inflammation and myocardial biomarkers. Two control patients, matched by age and gender, were assigned to each case: one with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection without PCS (group 2) and one without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (group 3). RESULTS: IST or POTS criteria were met in 34 out of the 200 PCS patients (17%). The mean age was 39 ± 10 years, with 29 women (91%). The interval from the index COVID-19 disease to the PCS diagnosis was 71 ± 17 days, with a majority of patients (n = 29,85%) not requiring hospital admission during the acute phase. At physical examination, the mean heart rate was 96 ± 3bpm at supine and 112 ± 17bpm at the upright position, with 8 patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria of POTS. No underlying structural heart disease, pro-inflammatory state, myocyte injury or hypoxia were identified among our patient population. The 6MWT showed a significantly diminished exercise capacity with a 59% of the estimated distance after adjustment by age, sex and body mass index; an impaired quality of life was also identified, as suggested by a median MLFHQ total score of 67 out of 105 points. The 24-hour Holter showed an increase in HR predominantly during daytime in group 1 (mean daytime HR of 94 ± 3bpm), an altered heart rate variability with a decrease in time domain parameters [PNN50 4 ± 4 in group 1 (vs. 11 ± 9 in group 2 and 18 ± 9 in group 3; p < 0.002)respectively; SD 100 ± 20 (vs. 127 ± 38 and 136 ± 13; p = 0.009) and a decrease in frequency domain parameters [LF 751 ± 450 (vs. 1721 ± 1009 and 2199 ± 920; p = 0.01), HF 336 ± 280 (vs. 823 ± 1200 and 1229 ± 630; p = 0.01)]. CONCLUSIONS: IST and its POTS variant are a prevalent condition among PCS patients and may at least partially explain the common symptoms of fatigue, impaired exercise and palpitations that characterize the PCS. Cardiac autonomic nervous system imbalance may account as a plausible pathophysiological mechanism of IST in PCS patients.","Arano Llach, J; Victor Bazan, VBG; Gemma Llados, GLL; Raquel Adelino, RA; Maria Jesus Dominguez, MJ; Marta Massanella, MM; Felipe Bisbal, FB; Axel Sarrias, AS; Antoni Bayes-Genis, ABG; Lourdes Mateu, LM; Roger Villuendas Sabate, RVS",Europace,630,26

First, ABA service delivery quality (ASDQ) is undefined in ABA research and the industry. Second, we cannot rely exclusively on professional organizations that oversee licensure and certification to control ABA service delivery quality because they do not have control over the relevant contingencies. Third, without objective indicators of ABA service delivery quality, it is difficult for ABA organizations to distinguish the quality of their services from competitors. In this article, first we explain the need for more critical discussion of ASDQ in the field at large, briefly describe a sample of common views of quality in ABA research and the industry, and identify some of their limitations. Then we define ASDQ and present a cohesive theoretical framework which brings ASDQ within the scope of our science so that we might take a more empirical approach to understanding and strengthening ASDQ. Next, we explain how organizations can use culturo-behavioral science to understand their organization’s cultural practices in terms of cultural selection and use the evidence-based practice of ABA at the organizational level to evaluate the extent to which methods targeting change initiatives result in high ASDQ. Lastly, in a call to action we provide ABA service delivery organizations with six steps they can take now to pursue high ASDQ by applying concepts from culturo-behavioral science and total quality management.","Silbaugh, Bryant C.; El Fattal, Robbie",Behav Anal Pract,630,21

Our primary aim was to estimate in the UK adult population the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy explained by blood-injection-injury fears. METHODS: In total, 15 014 UK adults, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, income and region, took part (19 January–5 February 2021) in a non-probability online survey. The Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale assessed intent to be vaccinated. Two scales (Specific Phobia Scale-blood-injection-injury phobia and Medical Fear Survey–injections and blood subscale) assessed blood-injection-injury fears. Four items from these scales were used to create a factor score specifically for injection fears. RESULTS: In total, 3927 (26.2%) screened positive for blood-injection-injury phobia. Individuals screening positive (22.0%) were more likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy compared to individuals screening negative (11.5%), odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.97–2.40, p < 0.001. The population attributable fraction (PAF) indicated that if blood-injection-injury phobia were absent then this may prevent 11.5% of all instances of vaccine hesitancy, AF = 0.11; 95% CI 0.09–0.14, p < 0.001. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was associated with higher scores on the Specific Phobia Scale, r = 0.22, p < 0.001, Medical Fear Survey, r = 0.23, p = <0.001 and injection fears, r = 0.25, p < 0.001. Injection fears were higher in youth and in Black and Asian ethnic groups, and explained a small degree of why vaccine hesitancy is higher in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Across the adult population, blood-injection-injury fears may explain approximately 10% of cases of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Addressing such fears will likely improve the effectiveness of vaccination programmes.","Freeman, Daniel; Lambe, Sinéad; Yu, Ly-Mee; Freeman, Jason; Chadwick, Andrew; Vaccari, Cristian; Waite, Felicity; Rosebrock, Laina; Petit, Ariane; Vanderslott, Samantha; Lewandowsky, Stephan; Larkin, Michael; Innocenti, Stefania; McShane, Helen; Pollard, Andrew J.; Loe, Bao Sheng",Psychological medicine,630,16

We assessed individuals’ MW through a free association task and an attentional task with thought-probes combined with a questionnaire for the phenomenological characteristic of each MW episode. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to assess participants’ personality traits and their associations with measures of MW. Our study was limited by the course of the Covid-19 pandemic and only nine healthy young individuals completed the testing sessions, which were carried out before and after the MOM training. After MOM, participants showed fewer repetitive and self-relevant thoughts and indices of better performance in the attentional task; the linguistic analysis of participants’ free associations showed lower verbal productivity and a decrease in utterances that expressed anxiety/stress. Overall, we foresee that future studies could replicate our preliminary findings with larger samples and in a period without a global health emergency. This multilevel approach to the study of MW may allow researchers to gain a broader view of the phenomenon, considering its occurrence, qualitative characteristics, impact on cognitive tasks, malleability via mindfulness or other psychological interventions, and relations with personality traits.","Cantone, Damiano; Feruglio, Susanna; Crescentini, Cristiano; Cinot, Sabrina; Matiz, Alessio",Behav Sci (Basel),630,24

Unfortunately, these ASGM activities lacked adequate tailings management strategies, so contamination of the environment is prevalent. In this study, soil contamination with copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) in Nabunturan, Davao de Oro, Philippines due to ASGM activities was investigated. The results showed that ASGM-impacted soils had Cu, Pb, Zn and As up to 3.6, 83, 73 and 68 times higher than background levels, respectively and were classified as ‘extremely’ polluted (CD = 30–228; PLI = 5.5–34.8). Minerals typically found in porphyry copper-gold ores like pyrite, chalcopyrite, malachite, galena, sphalerite and goethite were identified by XRD and SEM-EDS analyses. Furthermore, sequential extraction results indicate substantial Cu (up to 90%), Pb (up to 50%), Zn (up to 65%) and As (up to 48%) were partitioned with strongly adsorbed, weak acid soluble, reducible and oxidisable fractions considered as ‘geochemically mobile’ phases in the environment. Although very high Pb and Zn were found in ASGM-impacted soils, they were relatively immobile under oxidising conditions around pH 8.5 because of their retention via adsorption to hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs), montmorillonite and kaolinite. In contrast, Cu and As release from the historic ASGM site samples exceeded the environmental limits for Class A and Class C effluents, which could be attributed to the removal of calcite and dolomite by weathering. The enhanced desorption of As at around pH 8.5 also likely contributed to its release from these soils.","Tabelin, Carlito Baltazar; Silwamba, Marthias; Paglinawan, Florifern C.; Mondejar, Alissa Jane S.; Duc, Ho Gia; Resabal, Vannie Joy; Opiso, Einstine M.; Igarashi, Toshifumi; Tomiyama, Shingo; Ito, Mayumi; Hiroyoshi, Naoki; Villacorte-Tabelin, Mylah",Chemosphere,630,1
