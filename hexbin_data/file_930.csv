932,932,932,Activity based protein profiling to detect serine hydrolase alterations in virus infected cells,9.945547,7.3751287,2012-08-22,"Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a newly emerging technique that uses active site-directed probes to monitor the functional status of enzymes. Serine hydrolases are one of the largest families of enzymes in mammals. More than 200 serine hydrolases have been identified, but little is known about their specific roles. Serine hydrolases are involved in a variety of physiological functions, including digestion, immune response, blood coagulation, and reproduction. ABPP has been used recently to investigate host–virus interactions and to understand the molecular pathogenesis of virus infections. Monitoring the altered serine hydrolases during viral infection gives insight into the catalytic activity of these enzymes that will help to identify novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic application. This review presents the usefulness of ABPP in detecting and analyzing functional annotation of host cell serine hydrolases as a result of host–virus interaction.","Shahiduzzaman, Md.; Coombs, Kevin M.",Front Microbiol,930,28

The constraints based on a complete set of observational data are derived. There is a strong Bayesian evidence in favor of such a dark energy in comparison to a standard $\Lambda$CDM model and that this energy cannot be reduced to a cosmological constant. Besides, there is a shift towards smaller values of baryon density parameter and towards larger values of the Hubble parameter, which reduces the Hubble tension.","Dabrowski, Mariusz P.; Salzano, Vincenzo",,930,1

We leveraged this method to develop a multiplexed diagnostic platform for detection of biomarkers that could potentially be used to triage patients with myocardial infarction and traumatic brain injury using only 15 microliters of blood. Single-digit pg/mL sensitivity was obtained within minutes for all the biomarkers tested in unprocessed human plasma samples and whole blood, which is much faster and at least 50 times more sensitive than traditional ELISA methods, and the signal was stable enough to be measured after one week of storage. The multiplexed EC sensor platform was validated by analyzing 22 patient samples, which demonstrated excellent correlation with reported clinical values.","Sharma Timilsina, S.; Durr, N.; Yafia, M.; Sallum, H.; Jolly, P.; Ingber, D.

Here, we tested whether a greater long-term daily light exposure supports the immune response to the annual influenza vaccination. Eighty older institutionalised patients suffering from dementia (54 women and 26 men) continuously wore an activity tracker for 8 weeks to assess individual light exposure and rest-activity cycles. The patients’ immune response was analysed from two blood samples taken before and 4 - 5 weeks after the annual influenza vaccination. Individual antibody concentrations to three influenza virus strains (H3N2, H1N1, IB) were quantified via hemagglutination inhibition assays. By quantifying individual light exposure profiles (including daylight), we classified the patients into a low and a high light exposure group based on a median illuminance of 392.6 lux. The two light exposure groups did not differ in cognitive impairment severity, age or gender distribution. However, patients in the high light exposure group showed a significantly greater circadian rest-activity amplitude (i.e. more daytime activity and less nighttime activity) along with a significantly greater antibody titer increase to the H3N2 vaccine than patients in the low light exposure group, despite similar pre-vaccination concentrations. Sufficient seroprotective responses to all three influenza virus strains were attained for ≥ 75 % of participants. These data provide first evidence for an enhanced immune response in patients with dementia when they received more daily light. Increasing daily light exposure may have beneficial effects on the human immune system, either directly or via circadian rhythm stabilisation.","Münch, Mirjam; Goldbach, Rolf; Zumstein, Naomi; Vonmoos, Petra; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis; Wirz-Justice, Anna; Cajochen, Christian",bioRxiv,930,1

METHODS: The neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and antibodies targeting nucleocapsid (N), spike protein (S), and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in longitudinal plasma samples from the LOTUS China trial were measured by microneutralization assay and ELISA. Viral load was determined by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 576 plasma and 576 throat swabs were collected from 191 COVID-19 patients. Antibody titers related to adverse outcome and clinical improvement were analysed. Multivariable adjusted generalized linear mixed model for random effects were developed. RESULTS: After day 28 post symptoms onset, the rate of antibody positivity reached 100% for RBD-IgM, 97.8% for S-IgM, 100% for N-IgG, 100% for RBD-IgG, 91.1% for N-IgM and 91.1% for NAbs. The NAbs titers increased over time in both survivors and non-survivors and correlated to IgG antibodies against N, S and RBD, while its presence showed no statistical correlation with death. N-IgG (slope -2.11, 95% CI -3.04 to -1.18, p&0.0001), S-IgG (slope -2.44, 95% CI -3.35 to -1.54, p&0.0001) and RBD-IgG (slope -1.43, 95% CI -1.98 to -0.88, p&0.0001) were negatively correlated with viral load. S-IgG titers were lower in non-survivors than survivors (p=0.020) at week 4 after symptoms onset. CONCLUSIONS: IgM, IgG against N, S and RBD and NAbs developed in most severe COVID-19 patients, and do not correlate clearly with clinical outcomes. The levels of IgG antibodies against N, S and RBD were related to viral clearance.","Ren, Lili; Fan, Guohui; Wu, Wenjuan; Guo, Li; Wang, Yeming; Li, Xia; Wang, Conghui; Gu, Xiaoying; Li, Caihong; Wang, Ying; Wang, Geng; Zhou, Fei; Liu, Zhibo; Ge, Qing; Zhang, Yi; Li, Hui; Zhang, Lulu; Xu, Jiuyang; Wang, Chen; Wang, Jianwei; Cao, Bin",Clin. infect. dis,930,20

This review reports on the most highlighted polyphenolic compounds present in up to date literature and their specific antiviral perceptive properties that might enhance the body immunity facing COVID-19, and other viral infectious diseases. In fact, several studies and clinical trials increasingly proved the role of polyphenols in controlling numerous human pathogens including SARS and MERS, which are quite similar to COVID-19 through the enhancement of host immune response against viral infections by different biological mechanisms.

But due to recent advancement of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (i.e. ML/AI) in the medical field, it has been observed that the time frame for the development of such medications and detection has reduced a lot. This chapter paves the way for such demand by combining two basic ML techniques involving unsupervised and supervised learning. Since the occurrence of Colon Cancer is somewhat rare and complex, available Colon Cancer data sets are still underdeveloped and the Colon Cancer data set that is present is complex. The data set also has very less number of samples. To resolve this problem of fewer data and to get the most relevant information from the available data set, our research involves an oversampling method on the original data with preserving of the basic nature of the data set which is followed by the clustering of the data using K-Medoid clustering, Girvan-Newman clustering and Mahalanobis distance-based clustering for multivariate data. Once the same set of samples are predicted using the clustering, we are extrapolating the data based on the clusters formed using a statistical approach. To reduce complex processing and remove the irrelevant features with the intent of cleaning the data set, we are applying a correlation-based approach for feature selection and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied for dimensionality reduction. The final set of features thus obtained is then fed into an Artificial Neural Network for the classification of the Colon Cancer. The result of the experiment shows that the methodology proposed has a better accuracy than the available approaches which proves the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ghosh, J.; Sharma, A.

However, since lipemia interferes with spectrophotometric determinations such as those used to assess OS, the present study investigated the effect of PPL on OS parameters of healthy dogs. Twenty dogs had lipemic postprandial samples compared to the average of two non-lipemic moments. Subsequently, PPL was simulated in vitro using a commercial lipid emulsion and twelve pools of non-lipemic serum of these dogs were used to simulate the minimum, median and maximum concentrations of triglycerides obtained during the lipemic state. Serum OS parameters were assessed using the antioxidants uric acid, albumin and total bilirubin; total antioxidant capacity (TAC); total oxidant capacity (TOC); and lipid peroxidation. In vivo PPL caused an increase in albumin, TAC-CUPRAC, TAC-FRAP, uric acid (p < 0.0001), TOC (p = 0.0012) and total bilirubin (p = 0.0245); reduction of TAC-ABTS (p = 0.0008); and did not alter the lipid peroxidation (p = 0.8983). In vitro, levels of albumin increased at the three lipemic concentrations (p < 0.0001), uric acid increased in the median and maximum levels (p < 0.0001), and total bilirubin concentration increased only at the maximum lipemic level (p = 0.0012). All lipemic levels tested increased TAC-ABTS (p = 0.0011) and TAC-FRAP (p < 0.0001). TAC-CUPRAC (p = 0.5002), TOC (p = 0.5938) and lipid peroxidation (p = 0.4235) were not affected by in vitro lipemia. In conclusion, both the in vivo postprandial state and in vitro simulated lipemia affect oxidative stress markers in dogs depending on the oxidative stress marker, and thus the postprandial state and/or lipemic samples should be avoided.","Bonatto, Natália Camila Minucci; de Oliveira, Paula Lima; Mancebo, Aline Martins; Costa, Letícia Ramos; Bosculo, Maria Raquel Melo; Bosco, Anelise Maria; Ciarlini, Paulo César; Floriano, Beatriz Perez; de Barros, Luiz Daniel; Almeida, Breno Fernando Martins de",Res Vet Sci,930,26

AIM OF THE STUDY: The identification and quantification of compounds responsible for antiplasmodial activity in different parts (leaf, stem and root) of C. pareira is the target of current study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The hydro ethanolic parent extracts of different parts of C. pareira, fractions prepared from these extracts were evaluated against Pf3D7 (chloroquine sensitive) and PfINDO (chloroquine resistance) strains in culture to quantify the IC50 for extracts and fractions. Promising fractions of root part of plant were subjected to silica gel column chromatography to obtain pure compounds and their structures were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis. Pure compounds were also tested against Pf3D7 and PfINDO strains. A rapid and simple UPLC-DAD method was developed for the identification and quantification of pharmaceutically important metabolites of C. pareira. RESULTS: Among different extracts, the hydro ethanolic extract of root part of C. pareira was found most active with IC50 values (µg/ml) of 1.42 and 1.15 against Pf 3D7 and Pf INDO, respectively. Tested against Pf 3D7 the most potent fractions were root ethyl acetate fraction (IC50 4.0 µg/ml), stem water fraction (IC50 4.4 µg/ml), and root water fraction (IC50 8.5 µg/ml).

Hayatinine (15), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, isolated from root ethyl acetate fraction was most promising compound with IC50 of 0.41 µM (Pf INDO) and 0.509 µM (Pf 3D7). Magnocurarine (10) and cissamine (13) were also found active with IC50 values of 12.51 and 47.34 µM against Pf INDO and 12.54 and 8.76 µM against Pf 3D7, respectively. A total of thirty compounds were detected in studied extracts and fractions, structures were assigned to 15 of these and five of these biologically important compounds were quantified. Isolation of saluteridine (11) from C. pareira and the evaluation of antiplasmodial activity of pure compound from C. pariera is disclosed for the first time. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that the antimalarial potential of C. pareira may be attributed to isoquinoline type alkaloids present in this plant and also provides the scientific evidence for the traditional use of this plant in treatment of malaria.","Bhatt, Vinod; Kumari, Surekha; Upadhyay, Pooja; Agrawal, Prakhar; Sahal, Dinkar; Sharma, Upendra",J Ethnopharmacol,930,33

Despite many exciting applications that have emerged based on this technology, workflows based on multi-step operations, including molecular biology and cell-based phenotypic screening assays, cannot be easily adapted to droplet format. Here, we present a microfluidics-based technique to isolate single cells, or biological samples, into semi-permeable hydrogel capsules and perform multi-step biological workflows on thousands to millions of individual cells simultaneously. The biochemical reactions are performed by changing the aqueous buffer surrounding the capsules, without needing sophisticated equipment. The semi-permeable nature of the capsules' shell retains large encapsulated biomolecules (such as genome) while allowing smaller molecules (such as proteins) to passively diffuse. In contrast to conventional hydrogel bead assays, the approach presented here improves bacterial cell retention during multi-step procedures as well as the efficiency of biochemical reactions. We showcase two examples of capsule use for single genome amplification of bacteria, and expansion of individual clones into isogenic microcolonies for later screening for biodegradable plastic production.","Leonaviciene, Greta; Leonavicius, Karolis; Meskys, Rolandas; Mazutis, Linas",Lab Chip,930,20

Since 2013, India has been regulating the prices of drugs included in its national list of essential medicines (NLEM). Here we evaluate the cost variations among available cardiovascular drugs and perform cost-analysis comparing essential and non-essential drugs. METHODS: Data on listed prices of selected cardiovascular drugs - essential (NLEM) and non-essential (NNLEM) - were sourced from multiple drug information compendia. Price of medications was calculated in cost-per-defined-daily-dose (DDD)-units and NLEM vs. NNLEM drugs were compared. Regression analysis was used to explore the determinants of percentage cost variation (PCV) of drugs. RESULTS: The median-cost/DDD of essential medicines was lower as compared to non-essential ones for all therapeutic drug classes, with greatest difference observed for antianginals and least for heart failure medicines. There were substantial cost variations with values in excess of 1000% for six medicines, all being essential. The regression analysis failed to demonstrate a significant effect of essentiality on PCV (ß = 0.19, P = 0.314). CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses demonstrate considerable cost variations for some essential cardiovascular medicines. Given the need for prolonged and often, lifelong-treatment, there is significant potential for cost savings based on chosen brand, highlighting the need for patient as well as prescriber education.","Khanijo, Simran; Kakkar, Ashish Kumar; Kumar, Rohit; Patil, Amol Narayan; Bhusal, Gomata; Vishwas, Gopal; Arora, Geetika",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,930,26

We also studied the effect of different face masks worn bij infected persons on spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the air. MethodsWe developed a high-volume air sampler method that uses a household vacuum cleaner with a surgical mask serving as a sample filter. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was harvested from these sample filters and analyzed on the presence of RNA by polymerase chain reaction. We acquired air samples in close aproximity of HCWs wearing different facemasks. Also, we obtained free air samples away from the infected HCWs and samples near intensive care unit (ICU) patients undergoing AGMP. Fog experiments were performed to visualize the airflow around our air sampler. ResultsAerosols were visibly suctioned into the vacuum cleaner when there was no face mask, whereas wearing a face mask resulted in a delayed and reduced flow of aerosols into the vacuum cleaner. The face masks that were worn by the HCWs were positive in 54-83% of cases. The proportion of positive air samples was higher in household settings of recently infected HCWs (29/41; 70.7%) compared to ICU settings (4/17; 23.5%) (p<0.01). ConclusionThis high-volume air sampler method was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples. Air samples in the household environment of recently infected HCWs more frequently contained SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to those obtained in patient rooms during potential AGMP.","Man, Peter de; Sanchez, Marco Ortiz; Bluyssen, Philomena; Man, Stijn de; Rentmeester, Marie-Joze; Vliet, Marijke van der; Wils, Evert-Jan; Ong, David",,930,29

This review provides an in-depth summary of the available information about SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding disease (also known as COVID-19), with a multi-disciplinary approach. After the paper introduction, the first section treats the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the medical implications of the infection, and the human susceptivity. Great attention is devoted to the factor affecting the infection routes, distinguishing among the possible human-to-human, environmental-to-human, and pollution-to-human transmission mechanisms. The second section is devoted to reporting the impact of SARS-CoV-2 not only on the healthcare systems but also on the economy and society. The third section is devoted to non-pharmaceutical behaviours against COVID-19. In this context, this review section presents an analysis of the European second wave allowing not only to focalize the importance of some restrictions, but also the relevance of social acceptance of some measures. The data reassumed in this work are very useful for interdisciplinary researchers that work in a team to find the basic available information about all the aspects connected with this pandemic (from virus diffusion mechanism to health information, from economic and social impacts to measures to reduce the pandemic spread), with great attention to social acceptance of restriction measures and of vaccines (that currently results to be insufficient to achieve community immunity). Then, this review paper highlights the fundamental role of the trans-multi-disciplinary research that is devoted not only to understand the basics of the pandemic to propose solutions but has also the commitment to find strategies to increase population resilience. For this aim, the authors strongly suggest the establishment of an international health-care trans-multi-disciplinary workforce devoted to investigate, mitigate, and control also future viral events.","Anand, Uttpal; Cabreros, Carlo; Mal, Joyabrata; Ballesteros, Florencio; Sillanpää, Mika; Tripathi, Vijay; Bontempi, Elza",Environ Res,930,24

To perform a genomic characterization from the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, we sequenced viral samples to: (i) identify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the region, the state, and bordering countries/regions; (ii) characterize the mutation spectra; (iii) hypothesize viral dispersal routes by using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. We found that 96.4% of the samples belonged to the P.1 lineage and approximately 20% of them were assigned as the novel P.1.2, a P.1-derived sublineage harboring signature substitutions recently described in other Brazilian states and foreign countries. Moreover, sequences from this study were allocated in distinct branches of the P.1 phylogeny, suggesting multiple introductions in RS and placing this state as a potential diffusion core of P.1-derived clades and the emergence of P.1.2. It is uncertain whether the emergence of P.1.2 and other P.1 clades is related to clinical or epidemiological consequences. However, the clear signs of molecular diversity from the recently introduced P.1 warrant further genomic surveillance.","Franceschi, Vinícius Bonetti; Caldana, Gabriel Dickin; Perin, Christiano; Horn, Alexandre; Peter, Camila; Cybis, Gabriela Bettella; Ferrareze, Patrícia Aline Gröhs; Rotta, Liane Nanci; Cadegiani, Flávio Adsuara; Zimerman, Ricardo Ariel; Thompson, Claudia Elizabeth",Pathogens,930,9

This study explored psychological reactions to the Covid-19 emergency and IBD disease management in a sample of Italian patients. METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed to assess general concerns, psychological reaction, disease management, socio-demographics, and clinical information with validated scales and ad hoc items. A non-probabilistic purposive sample was selected, comprised patients with IBD who belonged to the Italian Association for patients with IBD (AMICI Onlus) completed the questionnaire in April 2020. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics, student’s T-test for independent groups, and one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). RESULTS: One thousand fourteen eligible questionnaires were analyzed. Italian patients with IBD appeared to be very worried about the Covid-19 emergency (60.7%) and concerned about the risks of infection (59%). Half of the sample reported medium to high-perceived stress, and 74% had low-medium coping self-efficacy levels. One third was in a state of psychological arousal. Twenty-nine percent of patients had canceled hospital appointments for fear of contracting the virus. The majority of responders believed that belonging to the Italian Association for Patients with IBD - AMICI Onlus - is useful. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that this sample of Italian patients with IBD lived with medium level of stress and with inadequate coping self-efficacy regarding disease management. Accordingly, Covid-19 may affect self-management behaviors. Therefore, national and regional associations for patients with IBD, should largely support these patients in this emergency.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been at the forefront of treatment for cancer and a wide array of other diseases due to their specificity and potency. While mammalian cell-produced mAbs have shown promise as therapeutic candidates against several flaviviruses, their eventual approval for human application still faces several challenges including their potential risk of predisposing treated patients to more severe secondary infection by a heterologous flavivirus through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The high cost associated with mAb production in mammalian cell cultures also poses a challenge for the feasible application of these drugs to the developing world where the majority of flavivirus infection occurs. Here, we review the current therapeutic mAb candidates against various flaviviruses including West Nile (WNV), Dengue virus (DENV), and ZIKV. The progress of using plants for developing safer and more economical mAb therapeutics against flaviviruses is discussed within the context of their expression, characterization, downstream processing, neutralization, and in vivo efficacy. The progress of using plant glycoengineering to address ADE, the major impediment of flavivirus therapeutic development, is highlighted. These advancements suggest that plant-based systems are excellent alternatives for addressing the remaining challenges of mAb therapeutic development against flavivirus and may facilitate the eventual commercialization of these drug candidates.","Sun, Haiyan; Chen, Qiang; Lai, Huafang",Int J Mol Sci,930,1

Our urban emergency department (ED), a member of the NYC public hospital system had to process the increased volume while also differentiating our patients’ critical needs. We established a forward treatment area (FTA) directly in front of the ED to accomplish these goals from March 23–April 16, 2020. METHODS: A clinical greeter evaluated patients 18 years and older who presented to the walk-in entrance of the ED where they were screened for COVID-19-like complaints. If they did not appear critically ill and could ambulate they were directed into the FTA. Clinical and non-clinical staff worked in concert to register, evaluate, and process patients with either a disposition of directly home or into the ED for further care. RESULTS: A total of 634 patients were seen in the FTA from March 23–April 16, 2020. Of the 634 patients evaluated, 135 (21%) were referred into the ED for further evaluation, of whom 81 (12.7% of the total) were admitted. These patients were disproportionately male (91 into the ED and 63 admitted) and tended to have a higher heart rate (105.4 vs 93.7), a higher respiratory rate (21.5 vs 18.1), and lower oxygen saturation (93.9% vs 97.8%). CONCLUSION: A forward treatment area is an effective method to rapidly screen and process an increased volume of COVID-19 patients when resources are limited.
