415,"Pneumonia Incidence and Mortality in Mainland China: Systematic Review of Chinese and English Literature, 1985–2008",2010-07-23,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a leading infectious disease killer worldwide, yet the burden in China is not well understood as much of the data is published in the non-English literature. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically reviewed the Chinese- and English-language literature for studies with primary data on pneumonia incidence and mortality in mainland China. Between 1985 and 2008, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the studies was highly variable. For children <5 years, incidence ranged from 0.06–0.27 episodes per person-year and mortality ranged from 184–1,223 deaths per 100,000 population. Overall incidence and mortality were stable or decreased over the study period and were higher in rural compared to urban areas. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Pneumonia continues to be a major public health challenge in young children in China, and estimates of pneumonia incidence and mortality vary widely. Reliable surveillance data and new prevention efforts may be needed to achieve and document additional declines, especially in areas with higher incidence and mortality such as rural settings.","Guan, Xuhua; Silk, Benjamin J.; Li, Wenkai; Fleischauer, Aaron T.; Xing, Xuesen; Jiang, Xiaoqing; Yu, Hongjie; Olsen, Sonja J.; Cohen, Adam L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2909231/,178
3931,Investigation of Fugitive Aerosols Released into the Environment during High-Flow Therapy,2019-06-01,"Background: Nebulised medical aerosols are designed to deliver drugs to the lungs to aid in the treatment of respiratory diseases. However, an unintended consequence is the potential for fugitive emissions during patient treatment, which may pose a risk factor in both clinical and homecare settings. Methods: The current study examined the potential for fugitive emissions, using albuterol sulphate as a tracer aerosol during high-flow therapy. A nasal cannula was connected to a head model or alternatively, a interface was connected to a tracheostomy tube in combination with a simulated adult and paediatric breathing profile. Two aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) recorded time-series aerosol concentrations and size distributions at two different distances relative to the simulated patient. Results: The results showed that the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions were influenced by the interface type, patient type and supplemental gas-flow rate. There was a trend in the adult scenarios; as the flow rate increased, the fugitive emissions and the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol both decreased. The fugitive emissions were comparable when using the adult breathing profiles for the nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces; however, there was a noticeable distinction between the two interfaces when compared for the paediatric breathing profiles. The highest recorded aerosol concentration was 0.370 ± 0.046 mg m(−3) from the tracheostomy interface during simulated paediatric breathing with a gas-flow rate of 20 L/min. The averaged MMAD across all combinations ranged from 1.248 to 1.793 µm by the APS at a distance of 0.8 m away from the patient interface. Conclusions: Overall, the results highlight the potential for secondary inhalation of fugitive emissions released during simulated aerosol treatment with concurrent high-flow therapy. The findings will help in developing policy and best practice for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions.","McGrath, James A.; O’Toole, Ciarraí; Bennett, Gavin; Joyce, Mary; Byrne, Miriam A.; MacLoughlin, Ronan",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630289/,178
4231,Impaired production of immune mediators in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of adults with end stage renal disease,2019-12-24,"Chronic kidney disease is an epidemiologically identified risk factor for development of severe dengue in dengue-affected patients. However, available data on the immune pathogenesis in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients affected by dengue is insufficient. We performed an in vitro study to evaluate the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of patients with ESRD (n = 34) and in healthy controls (n = 30). The concentrations of interleukins (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and viral load cycle threshold (Ct) were measured in the dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection. We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection. Our study discloses that the expression of immune mediators of dengue-infected mononuclear cells is impaired in ESRD patients.","Lee, Ing-Kit; Yang, Zih-Syuan; Ng, Hwee-Yeong; Li, Lung-Chih; Huang, Wen-Chi; Chen, Yi-Chun; Tsai, Ching-Yen; Lee, Chien-Te",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6930266/,178
4268,Forehead electrodes sufficiently detect propofol-induced slow waves for the assessment of brain function after cardiac arrest,2019-02-20,"In a recent study, we proposed a novel method to evaluate hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) by assessing propofol-induced changes in the 19-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). The study suggested that patients with HIE are unable to generate EEG slow waves during propofol anesthesia 48 h after cardiac arrest (CA). Since a low number of electrodes would make the method clinically more practical, we now investigated whether our results received with a full EEG cap could be reproduced using only forehead electrodes. Experimental data from comatose post-CA patients (N = 10) were used. EEG was recorded approximately 48 h after CA using 19-channel EEG cap during a controlled propofol exposure. The slow wave activity was calculated separately for all electrodes and four forehead electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8) by determining the low-frequency (< 1 Hz) power of the EEG. HIE was defined by following the patients’ recovery for six months. In patients without HIE (N = 6), propofol substantially increased (244 ± 91%, mean ± SD) the slow wave activity in forehead electrodes, whereas the patients with HIE (N = 4) were unable to produce such activity. The results received with forehead electrodes were similar to those of the full EEG cap. With the experimental pilot study data, the forehead electrodes were as capable as the full EEG cap in capturing the effect of HIE on propofol-induced slow wave activity. The finding offers potential in developing a clinically practical method for the early detection of HIE.","Kortelainen, Jukka; Väyrynen, Eero; Juuso, Ilkka; Laurila, Jouko; Koskenkari, Juha; Ala-Kokko, Tero",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6946726/,178
4338,Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants for pediatric influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-01-16,"Standard inactivated influenza vaccines are poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive healthy young children, who are particularly vulnerable to complications from influenza. For them, there is an unmet need for better influenza vaccines. Oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are promising candidates, but clinical trials yielded inconsistent results. Here, we meta-analyze randomized controlled trials with efficacy data (3 trials, n = 15,310) and immunogenicity data (17 trials, n = 9062). Compared with non-adjuvanted counterparts, adjuvanted influenza vaccines provide a significantly better protection (weighted estimate for risk ratio of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza: 0.26) and are significantly more immunogenic (weighted estimates for seroprotection rate ratio: 4.6 to 7.9) in healthy immunologically naive young children. Nevertheless, in immunologically non-naive children, adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines provide similar protection and are similarly immunogenic. These results indicate that oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant improves the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines in healthy young children at the first-time seasonal influenza vaccination.","Lin, Yu-Ju; Wen, Chiao-Ni; Lin, Ying-Ying; Hsieh, Wen-Chi; Chang, Chia-Chen; Chen, Yi-Hsuan; Hsu, Chian-Hui; Shih, Yun-Jui; Chen, Chang-Hsun; Fang, Chi-Tai",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6965081/,178

11248,Measuring endotracheal tube intracuff pressure: no room for complacency,2020-03-20,"RSV is one of the most important agents of lower respiratory infections in childhood. In this study, anti-RSV antibody levels in mother-infant pairs and factors related to antibody transfer ratio were investigated. One hundred and twenty-seven women that had term babies and their babies and 84 mother-infant pairs of them who continued the study after 6 months were enrolled. Anti-RSV IgG antibodies of the mothers and infants were positive in 46.5% and 61.5%, respectively. At the sixth month, anti-RSV antibodies were negative in all infants. Median of the anti-RSV antibody levels of the mothers and infants at birth were 12.08 IU/ml (1.21–119.27) and 13.78 IU/ml (3.99–108.6), respectively. There was a significant correlation between anti-RSV antibody levels of mothers and infants at birth (p: 0.0001, r: 0.667) and anti-RSV antibody levels of infants at birth and at 6th month (p: 0.0001, r: 0.343). Median ratio of infant and mother antibody levels was 1.22 (0.14–6.05). Median ratio that was detected in appropriate for gestational age infants was significantly higher than in small for gestational age or large for gestational age infants. In this study, the significant positive correlation between maternal antibody levels and infants’ antibody levels at birth suggests that maternal vaccination strategies may be logical. We showed that antibody transfer rate was highest in appropriate for gestational age infants. It should be kept in mind that maternal vaccination strategies may be less effective in small for gestational age and large for gestational age infants.","Yildiz, Mehmet; Kara, Manolya; Sutcu, Murat; Mese, Sevim; Demircili, Mehmet Emin; Sivrikoz, Tugba Sarac; Torun, Selda Hancerli; Agacfidan, Ali; Coban, Asuman; Unuvar, Emin; Somer, Ayper",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223508/,178
11305,Choosing the best supraglottic airway for ophthalmic general anaesthesia: a manikin study,2020-04-09,"OBJECTIVE: To predict the added value of diaphragmatic and lung ultrasound indices (US) in anticipation of the outcome of mechanical ventilation of pediatric patients in the intensive care unit. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in Zagazig University, Pediatric Hospitals, PICU; Egypt. One hundred six mechanically ventilated children aged between 1 mo to 170 mo were included in the study. All patients were candidates for weaning and have been given a chance for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), during which diaphragmatic and lung US was performed for them. The diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF), the diaphragmatic excursion and the lung US score (LUS), that included 4 US aeration forms, were assessed. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between patients with failed weaning and those with successful weaning regarding DTF, diaphragmatic excursion and LUS (p < 0.001). The best cut-off value of DTF, diaphragmatic excursion, and LUS for predicting weaning failure was ≥23.175%, ≥ 6.2 mm, and ≥ 12 with an AUC (area under curve) of 0.932, 0.876, and 0.934, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic and lung US add a quick, accurate and non-invasive indices to the weaning readiness parameters compared to the other standard parameters alone. So, it is recommended to be added to the predictive parameters of weaning outcome.","Abdel Rahman, Dalia A.; Saber, S.; El-Maghraby, A.",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223651/,178
11306,Early changes in diaphragmatic function evaluated using ultrasound in cardiac surgery patients: a cohort study,2019-07-05,"STUDY DESIGN: Survey study. OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord injury (SCI)-associated pneumonia (SCI-AP) is associated with poor functional recovery and a major cause of death after SCI. Better tackling SCI-AP requires a common understanding on how SCI-AP is defined. This survey examines clinical algorithms relevant for diagnosis and treatment of SCI-AP. SETTING: All departments for SCI-care in Germany. METHODS: The clinical decision-making on SCI-AP and the utility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for diagnosis of ‘clinically defined pneumonia’ were assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire including eight case vignettes of suspected SCI-AP. The diagnostic decisions based on the case information were analysed using classification and regression trees (CART). RESULTS: The majority of responding departments were aware of the CDC-criteria (88%). In the clinical vignettes, 38–81% of the departments diagnosed SCI-AP in accordance with the CDC-criteria and 7–41% diagnosed SCI-AP in deviation from the CDC-criteria. The diagnostic agreement was not associated with the availability of standard operating procedures for SCI-AP management in the departments. CART analysis identified radiological findings, fever, and worsened gas exchange as most important for the decision on SCI-AP. Frequently requested supplementary diagnostics were microbiological analyses, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. For empirical antibiotic therapy, the departments used (acyl-)aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, or combinations of (acyl-)aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors with fluoroquinolones or carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: This survey reveals a diagnostic ambiguity regarding SCI-AP despite the awareness of CDC-criteria and established SOPs. Heterogeneous clinical practice is encouraging the development of disease-specific guidelines for diagnosis and management of SCI-AP.","Druschel, Claudia; Ossami Saidy, Ramin R.; Grittner, Ulrike; Nowak, Claus P.; Meisel, Andreas; Schaser, Klaus-Dieter; Niedeggen, Andreas; Liebscher, Thomas; Kopp, Marcel A.; Schwab, Jan M.",Spinal Cord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223654/,178

11475,Event-triggered averaging of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) respiratory waveforms as compared to low-pass filtering for removal of cardiac related impedance changes,2019-07-05,"The objective of this study was to assess the risk of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) of ultrasound (US)-guided cannulation of the brachiocephalic vein (BCV) compared to standard epicutaneous cava catheters (ECCs) in preterm infants. This was a retrospective cohort study in preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g. Each BCV catheter was matched 1:3 with ECCs according to sex, birth weight, and year of insertion. The main outcome was the CLABSI density rate per 1000 days. Secondary outcomes included CLABSI episodes, CLABSI episodes per infant, and CLABSI/death. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether the type of catheter (ECC vs. BCV) was associated with CLABSI risk. Ninety-six catheters (21 BCVs and 75 ECCs) in 79 infants were included (993 catheter days). BCV catheters were associated with a reduced CLABSI density rate compared to ECCs (3.05/1000 days vs 21.1/1000 days; p < 0.001). ECCs were associated with increased CLABSI risk compared to BCV catheters in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 36; (95% CI, 2.5–511); p = 0.008). Conclusion: US-guided supraclavicular cannulation of the BCV was associated with a reduced risk of CLABSI compared to ECCs. This finding deserves further multicenter research.","Oulego-Erroz, Ignacio; Fernández-García, Alba; Álvarez-Juan, Beatriz; Terroba-Seara, Sandra; Quintela, Paula Alonso; Rodríguez-Núñez, Antonio",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223997/,178
11502,Peripheral perfusion index as a predictor of failed weaning from mechanical ventilation,2020-02-08,"PURPOSE: Previous studies assessing impact of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on mortality have shown conflicting results. We sought to assess the independent association of ARDS with in-hospital mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODS: We studied two prospective sepsis cohorts drawn from the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI; n = 474) and Validating Acute Lung Injury markers for Diagnosis (VALID; n = 337) cohorts. ARDS was defined by Berlin criteria. We used logistic regression to compare in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ARDS, controlling for baseline severity of illness. We also estimated attributable mortality, adjusted for illness severity by stratification. RESULTS: ARDS occurred in 195 EARLI patients (41%) and 99 VALID patients (29%). ARDS was independently associated with risk of hospital death in multivariate analysis, even after controlling for severity of illness, as measured by APACHE II (odds ratio [OR] 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02, 2.67), p = 0.04 in EARLI; OR 2.12 (CI 1.16, 3.92), p = 0.02 in VALID). Patients with severe ARDS (P/F < 100) primarily drove this relationship. The attributable mortality of ARDS was 27% (CI 14%, 37%) in EARLI and 37% (CI 10%, 51%) in VALID. ARDS was independently associated with ICU mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and ventilator-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Development of ARDS among ICU patients with sepsis confers increased risk of ICU and in-hospital mortality in addition to other important outcomes. Clinical trials targeting patients with severe ARDS will be best poised to detect measurable differences in these outcomes.

11915,On some factors determining the pressure drop across tracheal tubes during high-frequency percussive ventilation: a flow-independent model,2020-06-25,"BACKGROUND: The use of multiplex PCR to shorten time to identification of pathogens and their resistance mechanisms for patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is attractive, but poorly studied. The multiplex PCR–based Unyvero pneumonia cartridge assay can directly identify 20 bacteria and one fungus, amongst the most frequently causing VAP, and 19 of their resistance markers in clinical specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage or tracheal aspirate), with a turnaround time of 4–5 h. We performed this study to evaluate the concordance between the multiplex PCR–based Unyvero pneumonia cartridge assay and conventional microbiological techniques to identify pathogens and their resistance mechanisms in patients with VAP. METHODS: All patients suspected of having VAP (January 2016 to January 2019), who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and whose BALF microscopy examination revealed intracellular bacteria, were included. BALF conventional cultures (gold standard), antimicrobial susceptibility testing and processing for the Unyvero pneumonia cartridge were done. Culture and Unyvero results were compared. RESULTS: Compared to cultures of the 93 samples processed for both techniques, Unyvero correctly identified pathogens in 68 (73%) proven VAP episodes, was discordant for 25 (27%), detected no pathogen in 11 and overdetected a not otherwise found pathogen in six. For the eight remaining discordant results, the pathogen responsible for VAP was not included in the Unyvero cartridge panel or it grew at a non-significant level in culture. Amongst the 31 (33%) resistance mechanism discordances observed, 22 were resistance detection failures and 24 concerned Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to conventional microbiological cultures, the Unyvero pneumonia cartridge had poor diagnostic performance: it correctly identified pathogens and their resistance mechanisms in 73% and 67% of VAP cases, respectively. The lack of performance on the resistance mechanism was more pronounced when the pathogen detected was a Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Hékimian, Guillaume; Bonnet, Isabelle; Bréchot, Nicolas; Schmidt, Matthieu; Robert, Jérôme; Combes, Alain; Aubry, Alexandra",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7316635/,178

13179,Multiple Traditional Chinese Medicine interventions for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of overview,2020-09-25,"INTRODUCTION: Foot ulcers are a common and costly complication of diabetes, and delays in treatment can result in impaired healing, infection, hospitalization, and lower extremity amputation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We aimed to determine whether patterns in plantar diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) recurrence coincided with typical intervals between routine preventive care appointments, which would suggest that delays exist between ulcer development and identification. We completed an analysis of existing data from two multicenter studies in 300 total participants. We analyzed unadjusted counts of DFU binned in weekly intervals and defined ‘exam periods’ as intervals from 2 to 4 weeks, from 6 to 8 weeks, within 1 week of 3 months and within 1 week of 6 months. We tested whether recurrence rates during exam periods were equivalent to rates outside exam periods. We estimated the delay between DFU development and DFU identification such that the rate of development would have been constant. RESULTS: During exam periods, a total of 43 DFUs were identified (43/86=50%) despite the fact that these periods represent only 23.5% of follow-up in aggregate. Accounting for censoring, the annualized incidence during exam periods was 0.68 DFU/year (CI 0.48 to 0.89) in contrast to 0.25 DFU/year (CI 0.18 to 0.32) outside exam periods (incidence ratio=2.8, CI 1.8 to 4.3). We estimated delays between DFU occurrence and identification to average 15.3 days (IQR 7.4–23.7 days). CONCLUSIONS: These findings have potential implications for practice, particularly related to the value of telehealth and in-home monitoring of patients in diabetic foot remission. Additionally, there are implications for study design, which should consider the impact of interval censoring and attempt to control for confounders related to frequency and timing of exams.","Petersen, Brian J; Bus, Sicco A; Rothenberg, Gary M; Linders, David R; Lavery, Lawrence A; Armstrong, David G",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7528350/,178
13550,Integrated TCGA and GEO analysis showed that SMAD7 is an independent prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinoma,2020-10-30,"RATIONALE: Pulmonary hemorrhage is a rare but fatal complication of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), and more easily ignored in children than in adults due to the absence of clinically evident hemoptysis. Moreover, despite being sporadically reported, given that pulmonary hemorrhage may develop after regression and even disappearance of skin rash, the asynchronous progression of skin and lung lesions poses escalating challenges in the timely diagnosis. We herein presented a delayed diagnosis of late-onset pulmonary hemorrhage in a child with HSP after regression of purpuric rash. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 6-year and 3-month child with a history of self-resolved purpuric rash three weeks ago, presented acutely with cough and dyspnea but without fever. DIAGNOSES: The decreased hemoglobin and diffuse ground-glass opacities of both lungs on CT scan weren’t comprehensively evaluated. The child was initially misdiagnosed as pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment was initiated. However, no improvement of respiratory status was found following aggressive combination therapy. Bronchoscopy was subsequently performed. OUTCOMES: An diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with low inflammatory profile was noted after a bronchoscopy. Considering the history of HSP, the diagnosis of HSP-associated pulmonary hemorrhage was ultimately confirmed and the patient received corticosteroids with satisfactory results. LESSONS: Pulmonary hemorrhage could occur in children with HSP at late onset of disease after regression of skin rash. New-onset respiratory symptoms in patients with a history of HSP should heighten suspicion for pulmonary hemorrhage, particularly if presenting with lack of fever, sudden drop of hemoglobin, new pulmonary infiltrates and unresponsiveness to antibiotics therapy.

14596,Accuracy of a battery-powered portable capnometer in premature infants,2021-01-01,"PURPOSE: Thoracentesis and chest tube insertion are procedures commonly performed in routine clinical practice and are considered mandatory skills for all physicians. Adverse events secondary to these procedures have been widely reported; however, epidemiology data concerning life-threatening events associated with these procedures are lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from the Japan Council for Quality Health Care open database regarding subject safety incidents involving thoracentesis and chest tube insertion. The adverse events extracted from the database included only events associated with thoracentesis and chest tube insertion reported between January 2010 and April 2020. RESULTS: We identified 137 adverse events due to thoracentesis or chest tube insertion. Our analysis also revealed at least 15 fatal adverse events and 17 cases of left/right misalignment. Not only resident doctors but also physicians with 10 years or more of clinical experience had been mentioned in these reports. The most common complications due to adverse events were lung injury (55%), thoracic vascular injury (21%), and liver injury (10%). Surgical treatment was required for 43 (31%) of the 137 cases, and the mortality risk was significantly higher for thoracic vascular injury than for other complications (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We identified at least 15 fatal adverse events and 17 cases of left/right misalignment over a 10-year period in the Japan Council for Quality Health Care open database. Our findings also suggest that care should be taken to avoid thoracic vascular injury during chest tube insertion and that immediate intervention is required should such an injury occur.","Kamio, Tadashi; Iizuka, Yusuke; Koyama, Hiroshi; Fukaguchi, Kiyomitsu",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7775838/,178

Trauma management is part of health care, and by definition, it must be checked constantly. The only way to measure quality and outcomes is to systematically accrue data and analyze them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic revision of the literature about quality indicators in trauma associated to an international consensus conference RESULTS: An internationally approved base core set of 82 trauma quality indicators was obtained: Indicators were divided into 6 fields: prevention, structure, process, outcome, post-traumatic management, and society integrational effects. CONCLUSION: Present trauma quality indicator core set represents the result of an international effort aiming to provide a useful tool in quality evaluation and improvement. Further improvement may only be possible through international trauma registry development. This will allow for huge international data accrual permitting to evaluate results and compare outcomes.","Coccolini, Federico; Kluger, Yoram; Moore, Ernest E.; Maier, Ronald V.; Coimbra, Raul; Ordoñez, Carlos; Ivatury, Rao; Kirkpatrick, Andrew W.; Biffl, Walter; Sartelli, Massimo; Hecker, Andreas; Ansaloni, Luca; Leppaniemi, Ari; Reva, Viktor; Civil, Ian; Vega, Felipe; Chiarugi, Massimo; Chichom-Mefire, Alain; Sakakushev, Boris; Peitzman, Andrew; Chiara, Osvaldo; Abu-Zidan, Fikri; Maegele, Marc; Miccoli, Mario; Chirica, Mircea; Khokha, Vladimir; Sugrue, Michael; Fraga, Gustavo P.; Otomo, Yasuhiro; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; Catena, Fausto",World J Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901006/,178

The accuracy of ICD codes to identify bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study in a single-center NICU (n = 166) to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10 codes for the diagnosis of BPD. Analysis of large insurance claims database (n = 7887) to determine date of assignment of the code. RESULTS: The sensitivity of any BPD-related ICD codes ranged from 0.82 to 0.95, while the specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.36. In a large national insurance database, the most common date of ICD-9 or ICD-10 code assignment was the day of birth, which is inconsistent with the clinical definition. CONCLUSIONS: ICD codes registered for BPD are unlikely to accurately reflect the current clinical definition and should be interpreted with caution.","Beam, Kristyn S.; Lee, Matthew; Hirst, Keith; Beam, Andrew; Parad, Richard B.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7917960/,178
16200,Non-resuscitation fluid in excess of hydration requirements is associated with higher mortality in critically ill children,2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND: The study of mental wellbeing requires reliable, valid, and practical measurement tools. One of the most widely used measures of mental wellbeing is the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). We conducted four studies to validate the Polish version of the WEMWBS. Their objectives are the following: (1) to present the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the WEMWBS (study 1: n = 1197); (2) to evaluate the test–retest reliability of the Polish version of the WEMWBS (study 2: n = 24); (3) to determine the validity of the WEMWBS (study 3: n = 610); (4) to examine sensitivity of the WEMWBS scale to detect population with different levels of pro-health behaviours (study 4: n = 430). METHODS: To explore the dimensional structure of the scale we tested a one-factor model. The evaluation employed explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses and tested reliability and stability. To determine the convergent validity of the WEMWBS we analysed correlations among wellbeing and life satisfaction and risk depression. To examine sensitivity of the WEMWBS scale to detect a population with different levels of health-related behaviours we used Student’s t test. RESULTS: The results presented confirm that the psychometric properties of the Polish adaptation of WEMWBS are very good. Using EFA and CFA it was shown that a one-factor solution is optimal. Reliability, measured using the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and McDonald's omega proved to be very high. The estimation of the stability of the Polish version of the WEMWBS proved to be high. Our validation studies also provided data demonstrating sensitivity of the WEMWBS to detect a population with different levels of health-related behaviours, indicating that group with high level of pro-health behaviours achieved higher WEMWBS wellbeing results than group with low level of pro-health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: WEMWBS was confirmed as a short, reliable and valid measure with good psychometric properties. Due to the high indicators for its psychometric properties, the scale may therefore prove to be a particularly useful tool not only in empirical research, but also in mental wellbeing monitoring, and could serve as support in educational and preventive.","Konaszewski, Karol; Niesiobędzka, Małgorzata; Surzykiewicz, Janusz",Health Qual Life Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971144/,178
18094,A retrospective cohort study assessing acute kidney injury and renal recovery among septic patients empirically treated with vancomycin piperacillin–tazobactam versus vancomycin cefepime,2021-06-05,BACKGROUND: Mechanical chest compression devices are accepted alternatives for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) under specific circumstances. Current devices lack prospective and comparative data on their specific cardiovascular effects and potential for severe thoracic injuries. OBJECTIVES: To compare CPR effectiveness and thoracic injuries of two mechanical chest compression devices in pigs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomised trial. ANIMALS: Eighteen male German landrace pigs. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in anaesthetised and instrumented pigs and the animals were randomised into two intervention groups. Mechanical CPR was initiated by means of LUCAS™ 2 (mCCD1) or Corpuls™ cpr (mCCD2) device. Advanced life support was applied for a maximum of 10 cycles and animals achieving ROSC were monitored for 8 h. Ventilation/perfusion measurements were performed and blood gas analyses were taken. Thoracic injuries were assessed via a standardised damage score. RESULTS: Five animals of the mCCD1 group and one animal of the mCCD2 group achieved ROSC (p = 0.048). Only the mCCD1 animals survived until the end of the monitoring period (p < 0.01). MCCD1 animals showed less pulmonary shunt (p = 0.025) and higher normal V/Q (p = 0.017) during CPR. MCCD2 animals showed significantly more severe thoracic injuries (p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The LUCAS 2 device shows superior resuscitation outcomes and less thoracic injuries compared to Corpuls cpr when used for experimental CPR in juvenile pigs. Researchers should be aware that different mCCDs for experimental studies may significantly influence the respective outcome of resuscitation studies and affect comparability of different trials. Controlled human and animal CPR studies and a standardised post-resuscitation injury evaluation could help to confirm potential hazards. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial approval number: G16–1-042-E4.

This also relates particularly to the important aspects of the explainability and interpretability of the applied models and their results, and thus ultimately to the outcome of the data mining process. With this, in general, the inclusion of domain knowledge leading towards semantic data mining approaches is an emerging and important research direction. This article aims to survey relevant works in these areas, focusing on semantic data mining approaches and methods, but also on selected applications of ubiquitous sensing in some of the most prominent current application areas. Here, we consider in particular: (1) environmental sensing; (2) ubiquitous sensing in industrial applications of artificial intelligence; and (3) social sensing relating to human interactions and the respective individual and collective behaviors. We discuss these in detail and conclude with a summary of this emerging field of research. In addition, we provide an outlook on future directions for semantic data mining in ubiquitous sensing contexts.","Nalepa, Grzegorz J.; Bobek, Szymon; Kutt, Krzysztof; Atzmueller, Martin",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8271490/,178

The BRIDGE “Building Regulation in Dual Generations” Program treats maternal MI using Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills with a paired curriculum that promotes non-reactive and emotionally validating parenting designed to improve child mental health and ultimately prevent MI. The pilot feasibility trial (n = 28 dyads) included mothers and their preschool-aged children. The 20-week program was completed in a group-based format using mixed methods questionnaires and interviews. Results indicate high feasibility and acceptability (86% retention). Consistent improvements were seen across program targets and outcomes including maternal depression (d = 1.02) and child mental health (d = 1.08), with clinically significant symptom reductions for 85% of clients. Mothers with higher adversity exhibited greater reductions in parenting stress. Qualitative results highlighted efficacy in promoting positive parent–child relationships, rewarding parenting experiences, competence, and child development. Evidence suggests high feasibility and accessibility for BRIDGE in addressing intergenerational mental health needs. There was strong satisfaction with the program material and efficacy across key outcomes. BRIDGE holds promise for offering a transdiagnostic approach to preventing child MI in families of at-risk preschool aged children.

Computer-aided diagnosis has been developed to automatically identify avian malaria infections and classify the blood infection stage development. In this study, four types of deep convolutional neural networks, namely Darknet, Darknet19, Darknet19-448 and Densenet201 are used to classify P. gallinaceum blood stages. We randomly collected a dataset of 12,761 single-cell images consisting of three parasite stages from ten-infected blood films stained by Giemsa. All images were confirmed by three well-trained examiners. The study mainly compared several image classification models and used both qualitative and quantitative data for the evaluation of the proposed models. In the model-wise comparison, the four neural network models gave us high values with a mean average accuracy of at least 97%. The Darknet can reproduce a superior performance in the classification of the P. gallinaceum development stages across any other model architectures. Furthermore, the Darknet has the best performance in multiple class-wise classification, with average values of greater than 99% in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. It also has a low misclassification rate (< 1%) than the other three models. Therefore, the model is more suitable in the classification of P. gallinaceum blood stages. The findings could help us create a fast-screening method to help non-experts in field studies where there is a lack of specialized instruments for avian malaria diagnostics.","Kittichai, Veerayuth; Kaewthamasorn, Morakot; Thanee, Suchansa; Jomtarak, Rangsan; Klanboot, Kamonpob; Naing, Kaung Myat; Tongloy, Teerawat; Chuwongin, Santhad; Boonsang, Siridech",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8376898/,178

It is very important to determine the efficacy of these tests in the diagnosis of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus due to the global spread of this new influenza virus. METHODS: We evaluated 4 rapid influenza diagnostic tests (Binax Now Influenza A&B, BD Directigen EZ Flu A+B, Fujirebio Espline Influenza A&B-N, and BioTracer Influenza A&B Test) for their ability to detect the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus and compared these results with the diagnostic sensitivity obtained following real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the same samples. RESULTS: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of 252 specimens identified 176 influenza A (H1N1) positive samples. Of these, between 29 and 62 also tested positive using the 4 rapid tests examined, demonstrating the sensitivity of the respective tests was 16.5%–35.2% with specificities of 100%. However, the 4 rapid tests were 77.3%–100% sensitive when samples contained high influenza A (H1N1) virus titers, suggesting the sensitivity of these detection kits was dependent on viral loads. Finally, the sensitivity of the 4 detection kits tested was higher when samples from children were examined compared with samples from adults. CONCLUSIONS: Data presented in this report indicated the sensitivity of the respective influenza antigen detection test kits examined was low compared to the sensitivity observed following RT-PCR. Nonetheless, they are useful tools during early outbreak investigations of influenza-like illnesses, particularly in the screening of critically ill patients and pediatric patients. However, negative results could be confirmed using other tests (eg, RT-PCR if necessary).","Ming, Chen; Wei, Xiao; Biao, Ai; Han, He; Xuezheng, Liu; Hong, Dong; Jun, Xiong; Li, Xu",Lab Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313843/,178

The COVID-19 epidemic impacted disproportionally migrants which are often in disadvantaged positions due to the lower socioeconomic status, communication barriers and lower education levels. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: During the COVID-19 epidemic migrants were particularly affected due to multiple factors including communication barriers, restriction measures imposed, loss of employment, challenges accessing the healthcare system, travel ban and mental health issues. Ports were closed preventing disembarkation of migrant boats and asylum request applications were put on hold. RESULTS: As of the 16th of June, a total of 30.2% (n = 198) confirmed COVID-19 cases were migrants. A strategy to support migrants was designed and implemented. The COVID-19 outbreak in a migrant centre resulted in all the 800 residents being placed in lock-down for 38 days (5th April till 13th May) and a total of 50 COVID-19 cases. Migrant boats that arrived before ports were closed were placed under quarantine. Migrants reported difficulties seeking healthcare, using the helpline, and higher exposure risk due to overcrowded living conditions. LESSONS: Migrants faced additional challenges due to the impact of the pandemic. The public health response measures implemented for the general population were not always feasible or accessible for the migrant population including hygiene recommendations, access to testing, isolation and quarantine and access to accurate scientific information. The mental health impact of COVID-19 among migrant populations was enhanced due to loneliness, lack of communication with their families and financial instability. Challenges accessing the healthcare system, understanding the restriction measures and the evolving public health recommendations were highlighted. Future strategies to control epidemics should always include specific plans to support migrant populations. KEY MESSAGES: The public health strategy must incorporate specific plans to support migrants in order to control and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Transdisciplinary policy needs to be developed considering the ethical, socio-economical, psychological and human right aspects of the migrant population.","Melillo, T; Medialdea-Carrera, R M C",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543386/,178

As the SDGs are interdependent, intersectional and interdisciplinary, so must be their solutions. This chapter argues that the best way to identify, develop, and scale solutions of such quality is (digital) entrepreneurship, building on the principles of open innovation, cutting-edge technologies, and social business. The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 in particular serves as a stark reminder of the interconnected nature of the SDGs and the challenges we face in achieving them. In this article, we explore the third SDG (SDG-3), “Good health and well-being”. We show the potential for digital entrepreneurship to foster the rise of new forms of digital health care and to accelerate the digitalization of the healthcare sector. Due to both perceived and real issues of regulatory compliance, user experience, and long investment/equipment use cycles, SDG-3 has been one of the slowest to adopt innovative solutions by far. We discuss specific areas, such as blended reality or quantum computing, for emerging and future digital health applications. In this chapter, we provide: the “memoreBox” of social start-up RetroBrain R&D, a special edition of gamelab.berlin’s app “Singleton”, and D-Wave’s free access to its cloud quantum computing services. All these examples of digital entrepreneurship utilize in whole or in part a combination of open innovation, future and emerging technologies, and social business, thus supporting our rationale. The article closes with recommendations for different stakeholders of entrepreneurial ecosystems, demonstrating both the necessity and the potential of digital entrepreneurship for the SDGs and the “Decade of Action”.","Shamsrizi, Manouchehr; Pakura, Adalbert; Wiechers, Jens; Pakura, Stefanie; Dauster, Dominique V.",Digital Entrepreneurship,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7664685/,178

The deregulation of financial markets that took place from the 1980s onwards, combined with the privatization of social housing, has transformed UK real estate from an ordinary good, insulated to some extent from consumer and financial markets, into a valuable financial asset. The financialization of real estate has had a largely negative impact on the UK’s housing market, the wider economy and individual communities; wealth inequality, financial instability, gentrification and homelessness have all increased as the role of the financial sector in UK property has increased. The financial crisis only accelerated many of these trends as distressed real estate was bought up by investors in its wake, and as loose monetary policy pushed up house prices in the period after the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic is only likely to exacerbate these issues; the UK is sleepwalking into a potential evictions crisis, and ongoing loose monetary policy is likely to prevent a significant and necessary correction in house prices over the long term.","Blakeley, Grace",Community Dev J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665346/,178

This article reports on a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with thirteen MPs. The aim of the research was to find out what characterises their constituency work to understand why it apparently bears comparison with social work. The article draws on the concepts of proximity and place from the mobilities paradigm to articulate the idea of ‘politics as social work’. MPs in the study engaged in face-to-face emotional labour in which they formed and sustained empathic relationships with people and places to represent them. They practised judgement under uncertainty and risk work, and they were embedded in local organisational networks of risk and trust with local authorities and other agencies.

GitLab has no physical office and its employees can work from anywhere they choose. Any step of the organizational life of a GitLab employee (e.g., hiring, onboarding and firing) is performed remotely, except for a yearly companywide gathering. GitLab strongly relies on asynchronous coordination, allowing employees to work anytime they want. After highlighting some of the main practices implemented by GitLab to effectively work all remotely and asynchronously, I asked renowned organizational scientists their thoughts on this interesting case and to question the generalizability of the all remote asynchronous model. Understanding whether and under what conditions this model can succeed can be of guidance for organizational designers that are now considering different remote models in response of the COVID-19 shock and its aftermath.","Choudhury, Prithwiraj; Crowston, Kevin; Dahlander, Linus; Minervini, Marco S.; Raghuram, Sumita",J Org Design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7666882/,178
42268,VP45.32: Pressing goals at the time of COVID: rebuilding patient attention and organisation of the gynecology department in a Spanish tertiary care hospital,2020-10-15,"OBJECTIVES: Compassion is the beneficial response of an individual to the sufferings and difficulties of others. Self-compassion refers to feelings of concern an individual feel towards oneself. Both may serve as potential buffers in a hospital setting where caregivers attending to patients in critical condition experience emotional distress, which may lead to burnout. However, the unique contribution of compassion, both to self and others, to the decrease of burnout is unclear. METHODS: In the present study, we recruited 109 professional caregivers working in a hospital’s intensive care and rehabilitative units. We explored a theoretically driven mediation model in which the relationship between compassion for self and others and burnout is mediated by different basic psychological needs, detailed in the self-determination theory. RESULTS: Results indicated that self-compassion and concern for others were associated with reduced levels of burnout. Each of these buffers against burnout was mediated by a unique psychological need, thereby supporting a three-layered model of (a) compassion and self-compassion, (b) basic psychological needs, and (c) burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights compassion and self-compassion as potential resilience factors against the challenge of burnout in healthcare. It points to promising avenues for preemptive clinical interventions.","Gerber, Zach; Anaki, David",Mindfulness (N Y),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667216/,178

44241,Short-term usage of three non-invasive ventilation interfaces causes progressive discomfort in healthy adults,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) has been described as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given paucity of data, we sought to describe characteristics of CP recipients in survivors and non-survivors. METHODS: We conducted retrospective review of electronic medical records which included any patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test who received CP at an 890-bed quaternary care hospital in Southeast Michigan between March-May 2020. Data collected included: demographics, co-morbidities, mSOFA score on admission, laboratory values, and treatment. Outcomes assessed included inflammatory markers and clinical status based on an 8-point ordinal scale(a). These values were recorded on admission, the date of CP (day 1), day 3, 7, and day 30 post-CP. Patient outcomes were stratified by ordinal scale score and compared using Mann-Whitney U tests to examine differences in clinical characteristics: scale of 1–4 (“meaningful survivor”), 5–7 (“survivor”), and 8 (“non-survivor”). RESULTS: Results of our study are summarized in Table 1 and 2. Non-survivors were older than survivors (62 vs 71 years; p=0.026). There was no statistically significant difference between patient gender, race, number of days from positive PCR test to CP, treatments, and co-morbidities. There was a trend toward higher mSOFA score on admission in non-survivors (p=0.056). A lower ordinal scale score on the date of receiving CP was significantly associated with meaningful survivorship (6 vs 7, p=0.005). Comparisons of Characteristics Based on Ordinal Scale at Day 30 [Image: see text] Comparisons of Outcomes Based on Ordinal Scale at Day 30 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Patients who have a lower ordinal scale score on the date of CP administration are most likely to have meaningful survivorship at day 30.

One of the technology bottle-necks of such sensors is that the phase sensorgram, when measured at fixed angle set-up, can lead to low reproducibility as the signal conveys multiple data. Leveraging the sensitivity, while securing satisfying reproducibility, is therefore is an underdiscussed key issue. One potential solution is to map the phase sensorgram into refractive index unit by the use of sensor calibration data, via a simple non-linear fit. However, basic fitting functions poorly portray the asymmetric phase curve. On the other hand, multi-layer reflectivity calculation based on the Fresnel coefficient can be employed for a precise mapping function. This numerical approach however lacks the explicit mathematical formulation to be used in an optimization process. To this end, we aim to provide a first methodology for the issue, where mapping functions are constructed from Bayesian optimized multi-layer model of the experimental data. The challenge of using multi-layer model as optimization trial function is addressed by meta-modeling via segmented polynomial approximation. A visualization approach is proposed for assessment of the goodness-of-the-fit on the optimized model. Using metastatic cancer exosome sensing, we demonstrate how the present work paves the way toward better plasmonic sensors.","Wu, Tzu-Heng; Yang, Ching-Hsu; Chang, Chia-Chen; Liu, Hui-Wen; Yang, Chia-Yu; Shen, Tang-Long; Lin, Chii-Wann; Bruyant, Aurélien",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8004883/,178

We compare mortality rates from In-Patient (IP) and Day Case (DC) trauma patients and compare the mortality rates of patients who tested positive or negative for Covid-19. METHOD: We reviewed all trauma admissions that underwent surgical intervention in both our IP and DC services during 31 days from March 23(rd) 2020. We recorded their sex, age, operation, Covid-19 symptoms, Covid-19 test results and mortality. The findings were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In total 127 patients underwent surgery (66 IP; 61 DC). There were 6 deaths (9.1%) within the IP group and 0 deaths in the DC group (p = 0.006). In the IP group 8 patients (12.1%) tested positive for Covid-19 of which 4 died (50%) compared to the remaining 58 patients (87.9%) of which 2 (3.4%) died (p < 0.001). A higher mortality rate was observed in patients with symptoms but a negative Covid-19 test (6.7%) than patients in whom a test was never indicated (2.3%). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 positive patients requiring in-patient admission for trauma surgery have a significantly higher mortality rate than both in-patient admissions that were Covid-19 negative or asymptomatic and patients that were treated with Day Case Trauma surgery.","Qureshi, M; Lokanathan, S; Adapa, A; Stansfield, J; Jain, N; Bhutta, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135882/,178

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy (VRT), specifically Nintendo Wii, combined with physiotherapy or occupational therapy (OT) for improving motor proficiency in individuals with Down syndrome, compared to standard physiotherapy, OT or no intervention. METHOD: Nine computerised databases were searched from inception to July 2020. Methodological quality of randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies was appraised using the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials and four quasi-experimental studies were included, with an average PEDro score of 7.3. One included case study scored 5. This review included 345 participants. Motor proficiency includes balance, coordination, strength and agility. Agility showed a significant improvement after 5 (p = 0.01) or 24 (p < 0.01) weeks. Strength showed a significant improvement after a 6- (p = 0.000) or 24-week intervention (p < 0.05). Balance showed inconclusive results for adults, and significant improvement in children after 6 (p = 0.000), 8 (p < 0.05) or 24 (p < 0.003) weeks. One study (n = 155) showed that upper limb and bilateral coordination improved significantly after 24 weeks (p < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Level II, III-1 and IV evidence suggested that VRT may be valuable to improve agility and strength in individuals with Down syndrome, and balance and coordination in children with Down syndrome. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It may be beneficial to use VRT in addition to standard physiotherapy or OT interventions for improving motor proficiency in individuals with Down syndrome.","Stander, Jessica; du Preez, Jennifer C.; Kritzinger, Chantel; Obermeyer, Natasha M.; Struwig, Silke; van Wyk, Nikki; Zaayman, Jessica; Burger, Marlette",S Afr J Physiother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182459/,178

We evaluated this screening and report cases that demonstrate problems with screening in a non-research setting. STUDY DESIGN An elective state-directed public health screening program was evaluated in Middle Tennessee; 14 564 infants were screened after 24 h of age and before discharge. The screening was performed in a non-research setting by nurses at the local hospitals. A parallel investigation of the methods and timing of diagnosis in Middle Tennessee revealed a surprisingly high incidence of antenatal diagnosis (66%). RESULT Using a saturation value of 94% as the defined normal, the positive predictive value was less than 1%, with 112 infants having a false positive case and 1 having a true positive case identified (incidence 1/34 775). The one true positive case was not referred for evaluation. One false-positive case resulted in a costly referral and hospitalization. Antenatal diagnosis when combined with physical examination detected 43 of 44 infants with critical CHD during the year-long evaluation.

62329,Regulatory and legislative issues on telehealth.,2021-06-23,"Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating and first-responding innate myeloid cells and have so far been underestimated in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most frequent, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. MS is treatable but not curable and its cause(s) and pathogenesis remain elusive. The involvement of neutrophils in MS pathogenesis has been suggested by the use of preclinical animal disease models, as well as on the basis of patient sample analysis. In this review, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms and functions by which neutrophils may contribute to the development and pathology of MS. Neutrophils display a broad variety of effector functions enabling disease pathogenesis, including (1) the release of inflammatory mediators and enzymes, such as interleukin-1β, myeloperoxidase and various proteinases, (2) destruction and phagocytosis of myelin (as debris), (3) release of neutrophil extracellular traps, (4) production of reactive oxygen species, (5) breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and (6) generation and presentation of autoantigens. An important question relates to the issue of whether neutrophils exhibit a predominantly proinflammatory function or are also implicated in the resolution of chronic inflammatory responses in MS.","De Bondt, Mirre; Hellings, Niels; Opdenakker, Ghislain; Struyf, Sofie",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604901/,178

Materials and methods: This prospective non-randomized study was conducted from December 2010 to July 2012. CEUS-CT/MR fusion imaging and routine CEUS were used for treatment response assessment in the ablation procedure of 146 HCCs and 122 HCCs, respectively. Supplementary ablations were performed immediately if necessary. The primary technique efficacy rate, LTP rate and overall survival (OS) rate were calculated. Results: For CEUS-CT/MR fusion imaging and routine CEUS, the technical success rate, technique efficacy rate and supplementary ablation rate were 86.3% (126/146) and 98.4% (120/122) (p = .000), 99.2% (125/126) and 94.2% (113/120) (p = .032), and 14.3% (18/126) and 4.2% (5/120) (p = .006), respectively. The cumulative LTP rate and OS rate were not significantly different between fusion imaging group and routine CEUS group. However, for lesions that were larger than 3 cm or close to major vessels (41 lesions in fusion imaging group and 44 lesions in routine CEUS group, who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization before ablation), the cumulative LTP rate was significantly lower in fusion imaging group than in routine CEUS group (p = .032). Conclusion: Although intraprocedural CEUS-CT/MR fusion imaging has certain limitations in application, it might provide a potential more efficient method compared with routine CEUS in reducing LTP in HCC thermal ablation, especially for difficult ablation lesions.","Ju, Jin-Xiu; Zeng, Qing-Jing; Xu, Er-Jiao; He, Xu-Qi; Tan, Lei; Huang, Qian-Nan; Li, Kai; Zheng, Rong-Qin","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2019.1640899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431086/,178

There is scarce literature about these diseases in dairy regions in Colombia. In 29 randomly selected herds in Pasto, Colombia, 249 dairy cows were followed weekly for two months postpartum to determine: 1) incidence risk of SARA and SCK; and 2) effects of SARA and SCK on the occurrence of postpartum anestrus (PA) at two months. Samples from ruminal liquor and blood were obtained one time per cow during the first week postpartum to determine presence of SARA (pH < 5.6) and SCK (1.0-2.9 mmol/L of blood Beta-Hydroxy-Butyrate), respectively. PA diagnosis was determined with ultrasound. Pregnancy risks at 30 and 60 days post-breeding (and assumed embryo losses between these days) were determined. Risk factors associated with PA were estimated through a mixed multi-level multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for clustering of cows within herds. The incidence risks of SARA and SCK were 23.3% and 46.2%, respectively. Simultaneous occurrence of SCK and SARA (SCASCK) was present in 5.2% of the cows. In the final multivariable model, the occurrence of SARA (Odds Ratio: OR = 39.4), SCK (OR = 47.4) and SCASCK (OR = 68.5) was associated with increased odds of PA. Feeding a transition period diet was associated with reduced odds of PA (OR = 0.15). Second parity cows had significantly lower odds of PA than first parity cows (OR = 0.21). In conclusion, inadequate pre-partum and postpartum nutritional management of the herds increased the occurrence of SARA and SCK, which had adverse effects on reproductive performance.","Vallejo-Timarán, Darío; Reyes-Vélez, Julián; VanLeeuwen, John; Maldonado-Estrada, Juan; Astaiza-Martínez, Juan",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32274437/,178

They are characterized by a number of traits which are considered plesiomorphic for the Artiodactyla order. The objective of this study was to examine sleep in the lesser mouse-deer (Tragulus kanchil), which is the smallest in this group (body mass <2.2 kg). Electroencephalogram, nuchal electromyogram, electrooculogram and body acceleration were recorded in 4 adult mouse-deer females using a telemetry system in Bu Gia Map National Park in Vietnam. The mouse-deer spent on average 49.7±3.0% of 24-h in NREM sleep. REM sleep occupied 1.7±0.3% of 24-h or 3.2±0.5% of total sleep time. The average duration of REM sleep episodes was 2.0±0.2 min, the average maximum was 5.1±1.1 min, and the longest episodes lasted 8 min. NREM sleep occurred in sternal recumbency with the head heals above the ground while 64.7+6.4% of REM sleep occurred with the head resting on the ground. The eyes were open throughout most of the NREM sleep period. The mouse-deer displayed polyphasic sleep and crepuscular peaks in activity (04:00-06:00 and 18:00-19:00). The largest amounts of NREM occurred in the morning (06:00-09:00) and the smallest before dusk (at 04:00-06:00). REM sleep occurred throughout most of the daylight hours (08:00-16:00) and in the first half of the night (19:00-02:00).

PARTICIPANTS Non-nursing home-dwelling Black, Latino, and white adults age 65+ (n = 10,886). MEASUREMENTS We estimated racial/ethnic differences in five dichotomous indicators of poor HRQOL (depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-rated health, pain, and physical functional limitations), stratified by dementia status (probable, possible, none). We used generalized estimating equations to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and differences, and marginal standardization to estimate prevalence. RESULTS Generally, Blacks and Latinos reported higher prevalence of poor HRQOL compared with whites. The largest differences were observed for self-rated health, and Latino-white differences were slightly larger compared to Black-white differences. PRs were larger among those with no dementia. For example, the Black versus white PRs for poor self-rated health were 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.82-2.04) among the no dementia group and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.12-1.31) among the probable dementia group; Latino versus white PRs for these comparisons were 2.39 (2.21-2.59) and 1.48 (1.35-1.62), respectively. Prevalence differences also showed racial/ethnic differences, but these were similar across dementia statuses. CONCLUSIONS We observed racial/ethnic disparities in poor HRQOL, showing greater unmet clinical needs among Black and Latino versus white older adults. Relative disparities were smaller in those with dementia, but absolute magnitudes of disparities were similar by dementia status.","Hayes-Larson, Eleanor; Mobley, Taylor M; Gilmore-Bykovskyi, Andrea; Shaw, Crystal; Karlamangla, Arun; Manly, Jennifer J; Mayeda, Elizabeth Rose",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184835/,178
72006,Evaluation of At-home Bleaching Times on Effectiveness and Sensitivity with 10% Hydrogen Peroxide: A Randomized Controlled Double-blind Clinical Trial.,2021-08-09,"Population growth, the impacts of climate change, and the need for greater water security have made the reuse of wastewater, including potable use, increasingly desirable. As interest in potable reuse of wastewater increases, a variety of processes have been proposed for advanced water treatment following conventional wastewater treatment. In all cases, the operation and performance of advanced water treatment facilities (AWTFs) is improved when the treated wastewater feed is of the highest quality that can be achieved and the advanced water treatment (AWT) processes are operated at a constant flow. One proven method of optimizing the performance of wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) is constant flow operation with no extraneous return flows other than internal process recycle flows, such as return settled solids. A number of approaches can be used to achieve constant flow including flow equalization, divided treatment trains, and satellite treatment. The ways in which constant flow wastewater treatment benefits both WWTFs as well as the AWTFs are considered with special emphasis on the ability to achieve predictable log removal credits (LRCs) for specific microorganisms. Actual performance data from constant flow WWTFs are used to illustrate how LRCs are determined. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Constant flow WWTFs should be considered to produce the highest quality secondary effluent for AWT. Flow equalization, divided treatment trains, and satellite treatment can be used to achieve constant flow to optimize wastewater treatment in small and medium size WWTFs. Flow equalization can be used to maximize the amount of wastewater that can be recovered for potable reuse. Important benefits of constant flow for wastewater treatment facilities include economic and operational savings, stable and predictable treatment performance, energy savings, ability to optimize performance for the removal of specific constituents, and the ability to assign pathogen log removal credits (LRCs). Important benefits of constant flow and optimized WWT for AWTFs include economic and operational savings; less pretreatment needed, including energy and chemical usage; elimination of the need to cycle treatment processes; and added factor of safety with respect to the required pathogen LRCs. In large WWTFs, constant flow for AWTFs will typically be achieved by effluent diversion; depending on the effluent quality additional pretreatment may be needed. The design and implementation of WWTFs and AWTFs for potable reuse should be integrated for optimal performance and protection of public health.","Tchobanoglous, George; Kenny, John; Leverenz, Harold",Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,https://doi.org/10.1002/wer.1531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547686/,178

73427,Chronic pericardial effusion secondary to a influenza virus A (H1N1)/2009 infection.,2013,"Blood from 30 free-ranging brown hyenas ( Parahyaena brunnea) was collected for biochemical analysis and select serologic screening in Namibia from 1997 to 2010. Age was found to have an influence on several biochemical parameters that may be related to growth, a developing immune system, and differences in diet. Seasonal differences in diet of coastal brown hyenas also had an overall significant effect on lipemia values, and differences in stress due to varying capture methods could be associated with an increase in glucose and creatinine kinase. Comparisons among hyena species from published data were inconclusive, as some samples may have been derived from captive populations and individuals. Sera were tested for antibodies against 18 pathogens. Antibodies were not detected for most pathogens, but the proportion of sera containing antibodies against canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1) and canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) was 65% and 84%, respectively. There was no effect of sex, age, year of sampling, or contact with domestic dogs, indicating that CAV-1 or CAV-2 may be enzootic. The prevalence of antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV) was 43%, and older brown hyenas were 6.9 times more likely to have been exposed to CDV, adjusting for year of sampling and degree of estimated contact with domestic dogs, suggesting epizootic outbreaks. This study is the first to present biochemical reference intervals for wild brown hyenas and provides an indication of disease exposure in this species.","Wiesel, Ingrid; Zimmerman, Dawn M; Suedmeyer, Wm Kirk",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2017-0121.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592906/,178

METHODS An intensive longitudinal design was applied in which 25 FCs underwent in-home assessments for up to 56 days. At baseline, demographic data and employment status were collected. FCs wore a wrist-worn device with an accelerometer to assess objective total sleep time (TST) for consecutive 24-hour periods. FCs answered the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) every night before sleep. Linear mixed model analysis was used to examine the effect of objective sleep status on ZBI and PANAS scores the following day. RESULTS Mean participant age was 66.3 ± 10.8 years (72.0% female), and mean survey period was 29.1 ± 9.6 days (866 observations). Mean TST of FCs was 5.7 ± 1.4 hours. In total, 32.0% of FCs were employed either full- or part-time. TST of employed FCs was significantly associated with care burden and negative affect (B = -0.4 and -1.3, respectively); however, positive affect was not associated with TST. FCs who were unemployed experienced less care burden and negative affect (rate of change: -7.7 and -8.0, respectively). Additionally, TST of unemployed FCs was associated with negative affect; thus, when they slept 1 hour longer than their mean TST, they experienced less negative affect the following day. CONCLUSION A reduction in TST could lead to increased care burden and more severe negative affect the following day, which may be moderated by employment status.","Ryuno, Hirochika; Yamaguchi, Yuko; Greiner, Chieko",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0891988720957099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912003/,178

An increasing number of neuroimaging studies have emphasized that PDM is associated with functional and structural abnormalities in the regions related to the default mode network (DMN). Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the aim of this study was to use amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) to investigate changes of the intrinsic brain activity in the DMN in PDM. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess relationships between the neuroimaging findings and clinical symptoms. Forty-eight PDM patients and thirty-eight matched healthy controls participated in this study. Compared to healthy controls, PDM patients had increased ALFF in the precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and decreased ALFF in the thalamus. PDM patients also had decreased connectivity between the precuneus and left dmPFC and right ACC, while increased connectivity between the precuneus and left thalamus. In addition, the ALFF in the left dmPFC in PDM patients positively correlated with disease duration. Our findings provide further evidence of the DMN-related abnormalities in PDM patients which might contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease.","Liu, Peng; Liu, Yanfei; Wang, Geliang; Yang, Xuejuan; Jin, Lingmin; Sun, Jinbo; Qin, Wei",Brain imaging and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-016-9627-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27738992/,178

Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where effector immune cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires a sustained immune suppressive state not only by expansion of maternal Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) but also by leaning the immune clock toward a Th2 dominant arm. The fetus, known as a semi-allograft or temporary-self, leads to remission of autoimmune hepatitis during pregnancy. However, this tolerogenic immune state reverts back to a Th1 dominant arm, resulting in post-partum flare of AIH. Various hormones play a significant role in endocrine-immune axis during pregnancy. The placenta functions as a barrier between the maternal immune system and the fetus also plays a pivotal role in creating a tolerogenic environment during pregnancy. We review the evidence of immune tolerance during pregnancy and immune escape at post-partum period, focusing on patients with autoimmune hepatitis.","Bozward, Amber G; Wootton, Grace E; Podstawka, Oskar; Oo, Ye H",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.591380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072138/,178

METHODS The 36 tumors in 25 patients were included. Dual-energy computed tomography was performed before RFA and at 2 days and 1, 3, and 6 months thereafter. The effective atomic number (Zeff) of the tumors before RFA was compared with the Zeff at each follow-up using the paired t test. Lung perfusion was evaluated by iodine map images. When decreased perfusion was suspected after RFA, lung perfusion scintigraphy was performed. RESULTS The mean Zeff of the tumors significantly (P < 0.001) decreased at each follow-up, compared with that before RFA. Lung perfusion in the parenchyma peripheral to the tumors appeared to decrease at 2 days in 9 tumors, which was confirmed by scintigraphy in 7 tumors. CONCLUSIONS Dual-energy computed tomography was useful by providing additional information on tumor composition and lung perfusion.","Tomita, Koji; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Matsui, Yusuke; Kanazawa, Susumu",Journal of computer assisted tomography,https://doi.org/10.1097/rct.0000000000000422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27224234/,178

79678,Association between the Wilms tumor-1 rs16754 polymorphism and acute myeloid leukemia: A MOOSE-compliant meta-analysis.,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND CPAP is frequently used in prehospital and emergency settings. An air-flow output minimum of 60 L/min and a constant positive pressure are 2 important features for a successful CPAP device. Unlike hospital CPAP devices, which require electricity, CPAP devices for ambulance use need only an oxygen source to function. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare on a bench model the performance of 3 orofacial mask devices (Ventumask, EasyVent, and Boussignac CPAP system) and 2 helmets (Ventukit and EVE Coulisse) used to apply CPAP in the prehospital setting. METHODS A static test evaluated air-flow output, positive pressure applied, and FIO2 delivered by each device. A dynamic test assessed airway pressure stability during simulated ventilation. Efficiency of devices was compared based on oxygen flow needed to generate a minimum air flow of 60 L/min at each CPAP setting. RESULTS The EasyVent and EVE Coulisse devices delivered significantly higher mean air-flow outputs compared with the Ventumask and Ventukit under all CPAP conditions tested. The Boussignac CPAP system never reached an air-flow output of 60 L/min. The EasyVent had significantly lower pressure excursion than the Ventumask at all CPAP levels, and the EVE Coulisse had lower pressure excursion than the Ventukit at 5, 15, and 20 cm H2O, whereas at 10 cm H2O, no significant difference was observed between the 2 devices. Estimated oxygen consumption was lower for the EasyVent and EVE Coulisse compared with the Ventumask and Ventukit. CONCLUSIONS Air-flow output, pressure applied, FIO2 delivered, device oxygen consumption, and ability to maintain air flow at 60 L/min differed significantly among the CPAP devices tested. Only the EasyVent and EVE Coulisse achieved the required minimum level of air-flow output needed to ensure an effective therapy under all CPAP conditions.","Brusasco, Claudia; Corradi, Francesco; De Ferrari, Alessandra; Ball, Lorenzo; Kacmarek, Robert M; Pelosi, Paolo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26420898/,178
79721,The diagnostic accuracy of lung auscultation in adult patients with acute pulmonary pathologies: a meta-analysis.,2020-04-30,"The effects of pre cooling on endurance performance are widely known. In contrast, the approach of cooling during endurance exercise in combination with pre-exercise cooling has been poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the effects of precooling and cooling during exercise enhance exercise performance compared to the ingestion of a thermo-neutral beverage (20 °C) or precooling alone in cycling performance. This was an experimental study using a randomised crossover design in which 7 cyclists underwent three trials comprising of 45 min steady state cycling (SS) at 70% VO2 max and a subsequent 10 km time trial (TT) in hot conditions (32 °C, 50% relative humidity). Rectal temperature (Tre), heat storage (HS), heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (BLA) and thermal sensation (TS) were measured. The intervention consisted of: (1) ingestion of thermo-neutral beverage before and during SS cycling (TN), (2) ingestion of ice slurry beverage and application of iced towels (precooling) prior to exercise, and then ingestion of thermo-neutral beverage during SS (PRE) and (3) precooling strategy as above plus ice slurry ingestion during SS cycling (PRE + MID). The intake of thermo-neutral or ice slurry beverage (14 g/kg) occurred over 30 min before and every 15 min during SS cycling. There was no significant difference in TT performance between all the conditions (P =0.72). However, PRE and PRE + MID caused a significant decrease in Tre (P < 0.05) from TN during exercise. Accordingly, both precooling and a combination of precooling and mid-cooling during exercise in hot conditions may be a practical and effective way of reducing core temperature. Future studies should investigate longer distance events and timing of ice slurry ingestion.","Mejuto, Gaizka; Chalmers, Samuel; Gilbert, Stephanie; Bentley, David",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29496007/,178

Although the primary diagnostic criterion for PMVT (presence of motor or vocal tics, but not both) is clear, less is known about its clinical presentation. OBJECTIVE The goals of this study were to compare the prevalence and number of comorbid psychiatric disorders, tic severity, age at tic onset, and family history for TS and PMVT. METHODS We analyzed data from two independent cohorts using generalized linear equations and confirmed our findings using meta-analyses, incorporating data from previously published literature. RESULTS Rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were lower in PMVT than in TS in all analyses. Other psychiatric comorbidities occurred with similar frequencies in PMVT and TS in both cohorts, although meta-analyses suggested lower rates of most psychiatric disorders in PMVT compared with TS. ADHD and OCD increased the odds of comorbid mood, anxiety, substance use, and disruptive behaviors, and accounted for observed differences between PMVT and TS. Age of tic onset was approximately 2 years later, and tic severity was lower in PMVT than in TS. First-degree relatives had elevated rates of TS, PMVT, OCD, and ADHD compared with population prevalences, with rates of TS equal to or greater than PMVT rates. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the hypothesis that PMVT and TS occur along a clinical spectrum in which TS is a more severe and PMVT a less severe manifestation of a continuous neurodevelopmental tic spectrum disorder. © 2021 The Authors.

In this context, knowledge of growth and physiology in seedlings of different provenances can be useful in the selection of appropriate seed sources for restoration. In this study we investigated variations in survival, growth, and leaf-level physiology of five provenances of Quillaja saponaria Mol. and five provenances of Cryptocarya alba Mol. originated from coastal and Pre Andean sites exhibiting latitudinal-related climate differences in central Chile. Seedlings were grown in a nursery on 600 mL pots for 18 months and then planted in a dryland site severely damaged by fire. One year after establishment, we measured survival, growth, and leaf-level physiology. We also analyzed the relationship between outplanting survival with seedling characteristics prior to planting, and the relationship between growth and survival with physiological traits and with climate variables. Growth and survival were similar among provenances of Q. saponaria and C. alba, with the exception of differing heights observed within the provenance of Q. saponaria. Initial root collar diameter of Q. saponaria was observed to be positively correlated to outplanting survival. With the exception of photosynthesis in Q. saponaria, all provenances of both species differed in the leaf-level physiological traits. Those provenances originating from interior dryland sites exhibited lower stomatal conductance and used water more efficiently. The opposite was true for provenances coming from coastal sites. In outplanting sites with Mediterranean-type climates that have been damage by severe fire, selections based on larger diameter seedlings, especially for Q. saponaria and from interior and pre-Andean provenances, will likely improve outplanting success.","Espinoza, Sergio E; Yañez, Marco A; Martínez, Eduardo E; Carrasco-Benavides, Marcos R; Vaswani, Suraj A; Gajardo, John; Magni, Carlos R",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85599-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737615/,178

Data sources We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence), which retrieves articles from multiple sources such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, among other pre-print and protocols repositories. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) was adapted to expand the range of evidence and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place on a daily search basis. The search covered a period of time up to July 31, 2020. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel living systematic reviews to this question's specificities. We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of either suspension or indication of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers as monotherapy, or in combination versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We pooled the results using meta-analysis and applied the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We will resubmit results every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results We screened 772 records, but none was considered for eligibility. We identified 55 ongoing studies, including 41 randomized trials evaluating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for patients with COVID-19. Conclusions We did not find a randomized clinical trial meeting our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence for supporting the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

The effects of this pandemic on nursing students in terms of their professional identity, intention to leave the nursing profession, and perception of clinical nursing work remain unclear. PURPOSE The aims of this study were, first, to investigate nursing students' professional identity, intention to leave the nursing profession, and perception of clinical nursing work during the COVID-19 pandemic and, second, to explore factors influencing professional identity to help develop effective strategies to enrich and strengthen this factor in the future. METHODS This cross-sectional, descriptive survey study was conducted on 150 nursing students in China in February 2020. RESULTS The 14 (9.3%) participants who reported intending to leave the nursing profession earned lower scores for professional identity than their peers who reported intending to remain. The participants who believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had made them ""more passionate about clinical nursing work"" earned the highest scores, followed by those who believed the pandemic had ""no effect."" The lowest scores were earned by those who believed clinical nursing work to be ""too dangerous to engage in."" COVID-19 knowledge scores, the perceived effectiveness of preventive and control measures, the number of cases seen on the day the study survey was taken, and time spent daily on COVID-19 events were the variables found to influence professional identity.

We describe the utility of three-dimensional (3D) printed models for complex patients to individualize care. DESCRIPTION Oral effervescent agents, with positive enteric contrast, distended the esophagus during computed tomography (CT) scanning to facilitate segmentation during post-processing. The CT data were segmented, converted into a stereolithography file, and printed using photopolymer materials. EVALUATION In 1 patient with a left pneumonectomy, aortic bypass, and esophageal diversion, 3D printing enabled visualization of the native esophagus and facilitated endoscopic mucosal resection, followed by hiatal dissection and division of the gastroesophageal junction as treatment. In a second patient, 3D printing allowed enhanced visualization of multiple esophageal diverticula, allowing for optimization of the surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS Printing of 3D anatomic models in patients with complex esophageal pathology facilitates planning the optimal surgical approach and anticipating potential difficulties for the multidisciplinary team.

The calcium-dependent protease, calpain, participates in the development of neurodegeneration following concussion, but there is no information regarding the relative contribution of calpain-1 and calpain-2, the major calpain isoforms in the brain. We used a mouse model of repeated concussions, which reproduces most of the behavioral and neuropathological features of the human condition, to address this issue. Deletion of calpain-2 or treatment with a selective calpain-2 inhibitor for 2 weeks prevented most of these neuropathological features. Changes in TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) subcellular localization similar to those found in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia were also prevented by deletion of calpain-2 or treatment with calpain-2 inhibitor. Our results indicate that a selective calpain-2 inhibitor represents a therapeutic approach for concussion.","Wang, Yubin; Liu, Yan; Nham, Amy; Sherbaf, Arash; Quach, Diana; Yahya, Emad; Ranburger, Davis; Bi, Xiaoning; Baudry, Michel",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937436/,178

Acute kidney injury has been found prevalent in transplant recipients with COVID-19. In those with severe COVID-19 disease who transfer to an intensive care unit prevalence of acute kidney injury is more than 50%. The pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney involvement and the type of involvement are unclear. Here, we present a 71-year-old kidney transplant recipient who was admitted to our hospital with pulmonary and renal involvement. A kidney allograft biopsy demonstrated diffuse intrarenal hemorrhage, capillary congestion, and severe acute tubular injury. COVID-19 RNA was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction from lysed allograft tissues, but no findings of acute or chronic cellular or antibody-mediated rejection were detected. This case indicates that COVID-19 may involve the allograft by causing hemorrhage within the renal parenchymal via direct or indirect pathways.","Demir, Mehmet Emin; Merhametsiz, Özgür; Yurttutan Uyar, Neval; Uyar, Murathan; Sevmis, Murat; Sevmis, Sinasi; Aktas, Sema; Hacisalihoglu, Uguray Payam; Baba, Z Füsun",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2020.0529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142936/,178

However, a comprehensive understanding of the neural substrates underlying recovery is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between brain anatomy, physiology and hand motor function in individuals with chronic stroke. METHODS Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches were used to evaluate cortical excitability and brain structural morphometry in individuals with chronic stroke. Hemispheric differences and relationships between these measures and hand dexterity were evaluated. RESULTS Hemispheric differences were observed for TMS and MRI measures. Bilateral hand dexterity correlated with TMS resting motor threshold and precentral gyral thickness. Transcallosal inhibition across hemispheres was positively associated with midcallosal white matter volume. Regression modeling results demonstrated that combining TMS and MRI measures predicted unique amounts of variance in hand dexterity. CONCLUSIONS RESULTS confirm and extend findings showing differences in brain structure and function after stroke. RESULTS suggested a structure-function relationship underlying interhemispheric connectivity in chronic stroke. The utility of combined TMS and MRI measures to predict motor function can be used in future investigations to aid identifying optimal biomarkers of stroke recovery to predict response to rehabilitation to maximize treatment outcomes.","Borich, Michael R; Neva, Jason L; Boyd, Lara A",Restorative neurology and neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3233/rnn-140425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25374346/,178

Here, we examined Mtb lipid-induced response in murine macrophage, as well as in human T-cell subpopulations in order to gain an insight into how changes in cell wall lipid composition may modulate host immune response. Relative to WT Mtb cell wall lipids, the non-polar lipid extracts from Δmce1 enhanced the mRNA expression of lipid-sense nuclear receptors TR4 and PPAR-γ and dampened the macrophage expression of genes encoding TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. Relative to untreated control, WT lipid-pre-stimulated macrophages from healthy individuals induced a higher level of CD4-CD8- double negative T-cells (DN T-cells) producing TNF-α. Conversely, compared to WT, stimulation with Δmce1 lipids induced higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in IL-10-producing DN T cells. Mononuclear cells from TB patients stimulated with WT Mtb lipids induced an increased production of TNF-α by CD8+ lymphocytes. Taken together, these observations suggest that changes in mce1 operon expression during a course of infection may serve as a strategy by Mtb to evade the host pro-inflammatory responses.","Petrilli, Jéssica D; Müller, Igor; Araújo, Luana E; Cardoso, Thiago M; Carvalho, Lucas P; Barros, Bruna C; Teixeira, Maurício; Arruda, Sérgio; Riley, Lee W; Queiroz, Adriano",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973761/,178

94176,Biomarkers and the Prediction of Adverse Outcomes in Preeclampsia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2020-12-03,"Background Pediatric dental procedures are performed under anesthesia because children may be uncooperative in the dental clinic due to their young age. Emergence delirium (ED), which involves a variety of behavioral disturbances that are frequently observed in children following emergence from general anesthesia, remains an unclear phenomenon. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the incidence of ED in children who underwent full mouth dental rehabilitation under either sevoflurane (SEVO) anesthesia or propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Patients and methods One hundred and twenty children with American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, aged ≥3 and ≤6 years, undergoing dental rehabilitation were assigned to receive either TIVA or SEVO. ED and postoperative pain were evaluated by a blinded investigator using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale every 5 min. The recovery time, satisfaction levels of parents or guardians, extubation time, duration of the operation, and type of dental procedure were also recorded. Results Data of 116 subjects were analyzed. The incidence of ED was higher after SEVO than after TIVA (65.5 vs 3.4%, P=0.00). Greater postoperative pain was observed in the SEVO group (median 3 vs 1, P=0.000). A statistically significant, moderate correlation (rs=0.46, P<0.0001) was found between the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability and Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scores. A higher parental satisfaction level was observed in the TIVA group. Conclusion A lower incidence of ED and a higher parental satisfaction level were observed after TIVA. Moreover, TIVA resulted in a more comfortable postoperative period due to reduced postoperative pain, and the extubation time and recovery time were not increased.","Kocaturk, Ozlem; Keles, Sultan",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s164106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013385/,178

Firstly, we address the question of the effect of the virus on children in regard to strategies implemented to limit its spread and the capacity of medical devices in Africa. Second, we address the issue of the additional disruptions that the virus could generate by infecting the parents or guardians of children who often find themselves subject to the disquietudes of an informal economy. Finally, we discuss the long-term effects of the crisis on children about food security issues, particularly in relation to overweight and obesity. Based on studies that have documented the long-term overweight risks that can occur due to school cessation as a result of lockdown measures, we provide strategies to address this emerging public health problem in Africa.

97202,MicroRNAs in toxic acute kidney injury: Systematic scoping review of the current status.,2021-04-01,"INTRODUCTION During a laparoscopic total gastrectomy, the combined process of purse-string suture placement and anvil insertion of a circular stapler is one of the most difficult steps in the reconstruction. We have developed a stable and reliable technique in which purse-string suture placement and anvil insertion using anterior esophagotomy precede complete transection of the esophagus. METHODS The procedure involves tying the distal esophagus, insufflating the esophagus via a nasogastric tube, anterior wall purse-string suture, anterior esophagotomy, posterior wall purse-string suture, anvil insertion, fastening purse-string suture, and transecting the esophagus. The technique has been employed in nine patients since April 2011. RESULTS Eight of the nine gastrectomies were for patients with stage IA early gastric cancer and one was for a patient with medically intractable bleeding from multiple polyps. Three were men and six were women. Average BMI was 25.2 ± 5.3 (range, 16.3-33.9). Mean operation time was 276.2 ± 56.3 min (range, 215.0-395.0 min) and the mean duration for anvil insertion was 29.8 ± 7.0 min (range, 23.0-46.0 min). There were no intraoperative or postoperative anastomosis-related complications or mortality. CONCLUSION Our method of anvil insertion of a circular stapler can be a good option for safe and reliable esophagojejunostomy during a laparoscopic total gastrectomy.","Kong, Seong-Ho; Suh, Yunsuhk; Kwon, Sebastianus; Lee, Hyuk-Joon; Kim, Hyung-Ho; Yang, Han-Kwang",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23323665/,178

Here, we determine the three-dimensional structure of AEG12 and describe the binding specificity of acyl-chain ligands within its large central hydrophobic cavity. We show that AEG12 displays hemolytic and cytolytic activity by selectively delivering unsaturated fatty acid cargoes into phosphatidylcholine-rich lipid bilayers. This property of AEG12 also enables it to inhibit replication of enveloped viruses such as Dengue and Zika viruses at low micromolar concentrations. Weaker inhibition was observed against more distantly related coronaviruses and lentivirus, while no inhibition was observed against the nonenveloped virus adeno-associated virus.

For two-line thermometry, the uncertainties in linestrengths of the absorption lines may cause systematic errors in temperature and species concentration estimations. Thus, the radial profiles of water vapor concentration are obtained first using the LIBS, assuming that the combustion is complete; then, the radial temperature profiles are estimated from the radial profiles of absorption coefficient, as reconstructed from the absorbance profiles obtained using the TDLAS. The spectral lines of water vapor at 7185.6 and 7444.36 cm-1 are selected as the linestrengths show monotonic decreases with the increase in temperature within the measuring temperature range. The radial profiles of temperature and water mole fraction are well-reconstructed, and the measurement error is found to be as low as 3%. The technique yielded higher temperatures compared to the thermocouple, possibly owing to the significant radiative heat loss in the thermocouple data.","Lee, Jungwun; Bong, Cheolwoo; Yoo, Jihyung; Bak, Moon Soo",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.396909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680158/,178

We retrospectively researched treatment results of patients with CNS tumors treated with nimotuzumab from 2010 to 2015. The study included nine patients with the diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma; eight with medulloblastoma; three each with anaplastic ependymoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (CNS PNET); two patients with gliomatosis cerebri; and one patient each with other tumor types, including atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, thalamic astrocytoma, low-grade glial tumor, high-grade glial tumor, and cribriform neuroepithelial tumor. An objective response was observed in 10 of 33 patients with four patients showing a complete response, three a partial response, and three patients had stable disease. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 35 ±9% and 19 ±8%, respectively. Due to the objective response in medulloblastoma, CNS PNET, and anaplastic ependymoma (MED group), survival rates of this group were analyzed. The 2-year OS and PFS for the MED group were 71 ±12% and 30 ±13%, respectively. The treatment was well tolerated.

102753,Is COVID-19 a risk factor for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients?,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Immunization with replication-competent recombinant vectors provides exposure to transgene-encoded antigens in the context of inflammation that may drive more potent and durable immunity compared to non-replicating vaccines. To understand the features of a replicating vaccine that drive such responses we tested a replication-competent adenovirus type 4 encoding influenza virus H5 hemagglutinin (Ad4-H5-Vtn) administered by an oral capsule or via a tonsillar swab or nasal spray. METHODS Viral shedding from the nose, mouth, and rectum was measured by PCR and culture. H5-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were measured by bead array binding assays. Serum antibodies were measured by a pseudovirus entry inhibition assay (PVEI), microneutralization (MN), and hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI). RESULTS Ad4-H5-Vtn DNA was shed from most upper respiratory tract (URT)-immunized volunteers for 2-4 weeks, but cultured from only 60% of participants with a median duration of one day. Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination induced increases in H5-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and IgG and IgA in nasal, cervical and rectal secretions. URT immunizations induced high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to H5 which remained stable at week 26. The duration of viral shedding correlated with the magnitude of the NAb response at week 26. Adverse events (AE) were mild, and peak NAb titer was associated with overall AE frequency or duration. Serum neutralizing antibody titers could be boosted to very high levels 2-5 years after Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination with recombinant H5 or inactivated split H5N1 vaccine. CONCLUSION Replicating Ad4 delivered to the URT causes prolonged exposure to antigen, drives durable systemic and mucosal immunity, and is a promising platform for the induction of immunity against viral surface glycoprotein targets.

The aim of the present trial was to determine the efficacy of a mechanical device (PressureEasy®) in the continuous control of P cuff in patients intubated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-cuffed tracheal tubes, compared with routine care using a manometer. METHODS This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, cross-over study. All patients requiring intubation with a predicted duration of mechanical ventilation ≥48 h were eligible. Eighteen patients randomly received continuous control of P cuff with PressureEasy® device for 24 h, followed by discontinuous control (every 4 h) with a manual manometer for 24 h, or vice versa. P cuff and airway pressure were continuously recorded. P cuff target was 25 cmH2O during the two periods. RESULTS The percentage of time spent with P cuff 20-30 cmH2O (median (IQR) 34 % (17-57) versus 50 % (35-64), p = 0.184) and the percentage of time spent with P cuff <20 cmH2O (23 % (5-63) versus 43 % (16-60), p = 0.5) were similar during continuous control of P cuff and routine care, respectively. However, the percentage of time spent with P cuff >30 cmH2O was significantly higher during continuous control compared with routine care of tracheal cuff (26 % (14-39) versus 7 % (1-18), p = 0.002). No significant difference was found in P cuff (25 (18-28) versus 21 (18-26), p = 0.17), mean airway pressure (14 (10-17) versus 14 (11-16), p = 0.679), or coefficient of variation of P cuff (19 % (11-26) versus 20 % (11-25), p = 0.679) during continuous control compared with routine care of tracheal cuff, respectively. CONCLUSIONS PressureEasy® did not demonstrate a better control of P cuff between 20 and 30 cmH2O, compared with routine care using a manometer. Moreover, the device use resulted in significantly higher time spent with overinflation of tracheal cuff, which might increase the risk for tracheal ischemic lesions.

We evaluated and compared the costs of thoracoscopic lobectomy versus open lobectomy. METHODS Data from all patients who underwent lobectomy for clinical stage I NSCLC from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009 were reviewed. Two hundred eighty-seven major pulmonary resections (269 lobectomies and 18 anatomic segmentectomies) for NSCLC were performed: 98 cases via a totally endoscopic approach (TS) and 189 via a classical posterolateral thoracotomy (PLT). Direct medical costs [hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, disposables, theatre time, laboratory, and radiology costs] were evaluated. RESULTS Patient demographics were similar in both groups. The two groups did not differ in histology, pathologic stage, or type of lobectomy. There were no differences in postoperative complications or readmissions during the 30-day postoperative period; however, patients in the TS group had significantly fewer chest tube days and shorter hospital length of stay (p < 0.001). Theatre costs were significantly higher in the TS group [2,861 ± 458 vs. 2,260 ± 399 (p < 0.001)]. Mean cost for disposables for TS was 1,800 ± 560.46 vs. 901 ± 328 for PLT (p < 0.001). Thoracoscopic upper-right lobectomy and anatomic segmentectomy were more expensive than other thoracoscopic lobectomies. Mean costs for hospital stay, laboratory, and radiological services for TS were less than for PLT (p < 0.001), although mean ICU stay was similar in both groups. Finally, overall costs were significantly greater for the PLT group (14,145.57 ± 7,117.84) than for the TS group (11,934.13 ± 6,690.25) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic lobectomy was less expensive than open lobectomy for patients with early-stage NSCLC. Although thoracoscopic lobectomy has a higher initial cost, overall cost is less expensive due to a shorter hospital stay.","Ramos, Ricard; Masuet, Cristina; Gossot, Dominique",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1891-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898011/,178

The aim is to analyse these concepts to provide a framework in which mutual influences are ontologically analysed; more specifically this article will explore whether health promotion should improve health literacy or health literacy is actually a pre-requisite for understanding (and put into practice) health promotion/public health messages. Public health must protect the public from misinformation and on this nurses and other health care providers play a crucial role in supporting individuals and communities in the comprehension of public health messages. The paradox under analysis is the link between health literacy and health promotion; what the role of health literacy is when, as in the case of the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Public Health must address tens of hundreds of health promotion messages to the whole population. During the outbreak, there was an underlying uncertainty, every day new data and information emerged and every day something more was understood (or misunderstood) about the virus. There was a massive presence of COVID-19 misinformation, particularly on social media in terms of, among others, treatments, the utility of wearing mask, COVID-19 cases by age group, conspiracy theories, all added more confusion and uncertainty to the public.

In order to address this global phenomenon, intensive studies have been carried out leading to the advancement of drugs like anti-depressants, anxiolytics, and analgesics which although help in combating the symptoms of such disorders but also create long-term side effects. Thus, as an alternative to such clinical practices, various complementary therapies such as yoga and meditation have been proved to be effective in alleviating the causes and symptoms of different neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of altered brain waves in this context has been recognized and needs to be pursued at the highest level. Thus, the current study provides a review focused on describing the effects of yoga and meditation on anxiety and depression as well as exploring brain waves as a tool for assessing the potential of these complementary therapies for such disorders.","Kaushik, Medha; Jain, Akarshi; Agarwal, Puneet; Joshi, Shiv Dutt; Parvez, Suhel",Journal of evidence-based integrative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2515690x20949451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985243/,178

Exposure to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media has been associated with subsequent development of NSF. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is characterized by skin induration preferentially affecting the extremities. In addition, involvement of internal organs occurs, which leads ultimately to death. Skin biopsy is important for confirmation of the diagnosis. The main therapeutic goal is restoration of renal function. To reduce the risk of NSF, renal function must be determined before exposure to gadolinium-containing MR contrast agents. Gadolinium-based MR contrast media should be avoided in the presence of advanced renal failure with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The recommended dose of contrast agent should not be exceeded. In addition, a sufficient period of time for elimination of the contrast agent from the body should be allowed before readministration of the contrast agent.","Kribben, Andreas; Witzke, Oliver; Hillen, Uwe; Barkhausen, Jörg; Daul, Anton E; Erbel, Raimund",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2008.12.061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19406336/,178

PfPMV is necessary for parasite viability and has become a novel promising target for antimalarial therapy. The first recombinant expression of soluble, active PfPMV as thioredoxin fusion proteins is reported herein. Two truncated forms of PfPMV were fused to thioredoxin (Trx) to generate Trx-PfPMVp37 and Trx-PfPMVm84. The fusion proteins were successfully purified using Ni(2+) affinity chromatography in combination with ATP treatment to eliminate Escherichia coli HSP60 contaminant. Trx-PfPMVm84 could hydrolyze the PEXEL-containing peptides more efficiently than Trx-PfPMVp37. Interestingly, both Trx-PfPMVs preferred to cleave PfEMP2 peptide over HRPII peptide. The replacement of Ser with Val or Glu at P1' position created a substrate with 75% reduction in the enzyme activity, whereas the substitution of Ile with Lys or Glu at P2 position reduced the cleavage efficiency by 30%. The activity of Trx-PfPMVm84 was inhibited by PMSF and nelfinavir but not by pepstatin A. After the removal of Trx domain, activities of both enzymes toward PfEMP2 and HRPII peptides were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten model to determine kinetic parameters. The Km values toward both peptides were apparently much lower than the previously reported data although with similar kcat values. Along with an improved PfPMV preparation protocol, these findings have provided insights into its substrate specificity at P2 and P1' positions as well as interactions among the enzyme, substrates, and inhibitors.","Boonyalai, Nonlawat; Sittikul, Pichamon; Yuvaniyama, Jirundon",Molecular and biochemical parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2015.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25986559/,178

Few large studies on this issue have been conducted and most of them have been performed as part of penicillin hypersensitivity studies. OBJECTIVE We described our 26-year experience exploring cephalosporin drug hypersensitivity, from which we identified epidemiological and cross-reactivity data. METHODS We included 476 patients who reported Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction (DHR) to cephalosporin and underwent an allergy workup between January 1992 and July 2018 in the Allergy Unit of the University Hospital of Montpellier (France). According to their structural side chain R1 homology we worked with four classes of cephalosporins. Logistic regression analysis was used to search for risk factors for hypersensitivity to cephalosporin (positive skin test or provocation test results). RESULTS Cephalosporin hypersensitivity was proven in 22.3% of the patients referred in our Unit, according to positive ST (51.9%) or DPT to the culprit drug (48.1%). One in five patients were children and cephalosporin hypersensitivity was confirmed in 15% (47.6% of them by means of ST). In the cephalosporin hypersensitive population, initial reactions were mostly immediate (68.9%) and anaphylactic (72.7%). Cross-reactivity with aminopenicillins was the most frequent pattern of cross-reactivity. In multivariate analysis, immediate reactions (OR=3 (95%CI [1.6-5.5]), p<0.001)), anaphylactic shock (OR=6.5 (95%CI [3.3-13.1], p<0.001)) and anaphylaxis (OR=3.1 (95%CI [1.6-6.1], p<0.001)) and multiple reactions to the same or several cephalosporins (OR=2.0 (95% CI [1-3.5], p=0.04)) were statistically associated with confirmed DHR. DPT was generally safe, but elicited anaphylaxis in 20% of patients. Systemic reactions during skin testing occurred in 9.1% of positive patients, almost always related to anaphylactic index reactions. Non-immediate confirmed DHR to cephalosporins were rare and occurred in less than 10% of the positive patients. CONCLUSION Almost a quarter of the tested patients were confirmed as hypersensitive to cephalosporins; sensitivity of skin testing was 51.9%, thus, half of the positive patients needed a DPT in order to prove the diagnosis.","Touati, Nidhal; Cardoso, Barbara; Delpuech, Marie; Bazire, Raphaelle; El Kara, Nathalie; Ouali, Djamila; Demoly, Pascal; Anca-Mirela, C H I R I A C",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

Five life-support home ventilators were assessed in a bench test using different settings simulating the specificities of MPV, such as intermittent circuit disconnection and presence of continuous leaks. The intermittent disconnection of the circuit caused relevant swings in the delivered tidal volume ( VT), showing a VT overshoot during the disconnection periods and a VT decrease when the interface was reconnected to the test lung. The five ventilators showed substantial differences in the number of respiratory cycles necessary to reach a stable VT in the volume-controlled setting, ranging from 1.3 ± 0.6 to 7.3 ± 1.2 cycles. These differences were less accentuated in the volume-assisted setting (MPV-dedicated mode, when available). Our data show large differences in the capacity of the different ventilators to deal with the rapidly changing respiratory load features that characterize MPV, which can be further accentuated according to the used ventilator setting. The dedicated MPV modes allow improvement in the performance of ventilators only in some defined situations. This has practical consequences for the choice of the ventilator to be used for MPV in a specific patient.","Ogna, Adam; Prigent, Helene; Falaize, Line; Leroux, Karl; Santos, Dante; Vaugier, Isabelle; Orlikowski, David; Lofaso, Frederic",Chronic respiratory disease,https://doi.org/10.1177/1479972316647177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146811/,178

We use a Bayesian approach and officially published data to estimate some of the model parameters, including the basic reproduction number. Our findings suggest that social distancing and quarantine are the winning strategies to reduce the impact of the outbreak. Environmental cleaning can also be relevant, but its cost and effort required to bring the maximum of the outbreak under control indicate that its cost-efficacy is low.","Saldaña, Fernando; Flores-Arguedas, Hugo; Camacho-Gutiérrez, José Ariel; Barradas, Ignacio",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987574/,178

Without any malignant factors in preoperative examinations, we performed laparoscopic appendectomy including the cecal wall. We could avoid performing excessive operation for cystadenoma with accurate preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative finding and pathological diagnosis during surgery. Appendiceal mucocele is a rare disease that is divided into 3 pathological types: hyperplasia, cystadenoma, and cystadenocarcinoma. The surgical approaches for it remain controversial and oversurgery is sometimes done for benign tumor, because preoperative diagnosis is difficult and rupturing an appendiceal tumor results in dissemination. Based on our study, volcano sign on colonoscopy and CT findings were important for the preoperative diagnosis of appendiceal mucocele. Furthermore, we think that laparoscopic resection will become a surgical option for the treatment of appendiceal mucocele.","Shiihara, Masahiro; Ohki, Takeshi; Yamamoto, Masakazu",Case reports in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000480374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29033775/,178

Yet, this task is difficult to achieve because it is costly and time consuming when compared with validating reference intervals from assay manufacturers. METHODS Following the recommendations of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry, healthy local Chinese adults were recruited to set up reference intervals for common serum analytes. Statistical methods recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards were used for defining the reference limits. RESULTS Data from 335 subjects were analysed. The reference intervals set up were broadly similar to those provided by the assay manufacturer, except for sodium and potassium. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease equation, with or without modification for Chinese. Body mass index had a significant impact on serum urate and alanine aminotransferase levels. CONCLUSION Reference intervals of common serum analytes have been set up for the local Chinese population. A good example of quality laboratory service has also been set up to provide clinicians with reliable reference intervals that they can confidently rely on for the diagnosis and management of patients.","Chan, A O K; Lee, K C; Leung, J N S; Shek, C C",Journal of clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1136/jcp.2007.053637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18441157/,178

PGHD have the potential to enhance decision making by providing the valuable information that may not be ordinarily captured during a routine care visit. These data which are captured from mobile devices, such as smartphones, activity trackers and other sensors, should be integrated into clinical workflows to allow for optimal use by clinicians. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study aims to conduct a rigorous scoping review to explore evidence related to the integration of PGHD into EHRs. Using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley, we will create a systematic search strategy, chart data from the relevant articles, and use a qualitative, thematic approach to analyse the data. This review will enable the identification of types of integration and describe challenges and barriers to integrating PGHD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Database searches will be initiated in June 2019. The review is expected to be completed by October 2019. As the content of the full-text articles emerges, the authors will summarise the characteristics related to the integration of PGHD. The findings of this scoping review will identify research gaps and present implications for future research.","Tiase, Victoria L; Hull, William; McFarland, Mary M; Sward, Katherine A; Del Fiol, Guilherme; Staes, Catherine; Weir, Charlene; Cummins, Mollie R",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852707/,178
122343,The Year in Thoracic Anesthesia: Selected Highlights From 2020.,2021-04-17,"PURPOSE Sleep deprivation (SD) is characterized by reduced cognitive capabilities and endurance exercise performance and increased perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise. The combined effects of SD and exercise-induced changes in neuromuscular function and cognition are unknown. This study aimed to determine whether central fatigue is greater with SD, and if so, whether this corresponds to diminished cognitive and physical responses. METHODS Twelve active males performed two 2-d conditions (SD and control (CO)). On day 1, subjects performed baseline cognitive and neuromuscular testing. After one night of SD or normal sleep, subjects repeated day 1 testing and then performed 40-min submaximal cycling and a cycling test to task failure. Neuromuscular and cognitive functions were evaluated during the cycling protocol and at task failure. RESULTS After SD, exercise time to task failure was shorter (1137 ± 253 vs 1236 ± 282 s, P = 0.013) and RPE during 40 min submaximal cycling was greater (P = 0.009) than that in CO. Maximal peripheral voluntary activation decreased by 7% (P = 0.003) and cortical voluntary activation tended to decrease by 5% (P = 0.059) with exercise. No other differences in neuromuscular function or cognitive control were observed between conditions. After SD, mean reaction time was 8% longer (P = 0.011) and cognitive response omission rate before cycling was higher (P < 0.05) than that in CO. Acute submaximal exercise counteracted cognitive performance deterioration in SD. CONCLUSIONS One night of complete SD resulted in decreased time to task failure and cognitive performance and higher RPE compared with the control condition. The lack of difference in neuromuscular function between CO and SD indicates that decreased SD exercise performance was probably not caused by increased muscular or central fatigue.","Temesi, John; Arnal, Pierrick J; Davranche, Karen; Bonnefoy, Régis; Levy, Patrick; Verges, Samuel; Millet, Guillaume Y",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0b013e31829ce379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23760468/,178

The BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory BCG vaccination COVID-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced BCG as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from BCG vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance. CONCLUSIONS At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of COVID-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory BCG vaccination. Other factors that might affect the results should be considered in further analysis. The results of clinical trials will provide more reliable proofs than analysis of epidemiological data. WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 and recommends it to newborns from areas with a higher incidence of tuberculosis.","Ręka, Gabriela; Korzeniowska, Anna; Piecewicz-Szczęsna, Halina",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,https://doi.org/10.32394/pe.74.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115218/,178
123519,Intentional leaks in industrial masks have a significant impact on efficacy of bilevel noninvasive ventilation: a bench test study.,2009,"Hyppocrates constructed the medicines-surgery-energy triangle which includes all therapeutical modalities. Hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HITHOC) is a synergy-based single stage multimodality treatment encompassing the locoregional manifestation of the systemic malignant process. Pleural space, thermal effect, lavage/irrigation and chemotherapy represent the basic science ports of the network hub: HITHOC. The malignant transformation and process of the pleural surface (and underlying lung) challenges space management and tissue control. Thermotherapy without local chemotherapy is insufficient, similar to the normothermic local irrigation aligned with anticancer agents. The local administration of combined heat-transfer fluid and chemotherapy with or without subsequent surgical removal offers reasonable outcome in extensive primary pleural neoplasms (malignant mesothelioma), advanced (> Stage IIIA) NSCLC, functionally inoperable lung cancer and pleural carcinosis from extrathoracic malignancies. Measured by symptom-free survival and the quality of life, HITHOC in its present form, offers a modest yet fully substantiated solution. HITHOC in combination with the local application of targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy administered in the pleural space are currently under investigation. Additional development including new acting substances, their solvents and the means regarding surgical delivery and anesthesiology techniques are sign posts up ahead. Level 2 evidence are required in order to stepping up the recommendation levels, rewriting protocols and guidelines, in which HITHOC earns its revered position in the decision making process it deserves.","Molnar, Tamas F; Drozgyik, Andras",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-5855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350269/,178

126611,Day-90 survival in critically-ill patients with COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine: a propensity analysis.,2021-04-01,"By serving as vectors of transmission, insects play a key role in the infection cycle of many plant viruses. Viruses use sophisticated transmission strategies to overcome the spatial barrier separating plants and the impediment imposed by the plant cell wall. Interactions among insect vectors, viruses, and host plants mediate transmission by integrating all organizational levels, from molecules to populations. Best-examined on the molecular scale are two basic transmission modes wherein virus-vector interactions have been well characterized. Whereas association of virus particles with specific sites in the vector's mouthparts or in alimentary tract regions immediately posterior to them is required for noncirculative transmission, the cycle of particles through the vector body is necessary for circulative transmission. Virus transmission is also determined by interactions that are associated with changes in vector feeding behaviors and with alterations in plant host's morphology and/or metabolism that favor the attraction or deterrence of vectors. A recent concept in virus-host-vector interactions proposes that when vectors land on infected plants, vector elicitors and effectors ""inform"" the plants of the confluence of interacting entities and trigger signaling pathways and plant defenses. Simultaneously, the plant responses may also influence virus acquisition and inoculation by vectors. Overall, a picture is emerging where transmission depends on multilayered virus-vector-host interactions that define the route of a virus through the vector, and on the manipulation of the host and the vector. These interactions guarantee virus propagation until one or more of the interactants undergo changes through evolution or are halted by environmental interventions.","Dáder, Beatriz; Then, Christiane; Berthelot, Edwige; Ducousso, Marie; Ng, James C K; Drucker, Martin",Insect science,https://doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.12470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28426155/,178

Because HER2 status was not captured in the ATTRACTION-2 trial, we used patients with prior trastuzumab use (Tmab+) as surrogate for HER2 expression status to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab as third- or later-line therapy in these patients. METHODS In ATTRACTION-2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 multicenter trial, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (3 mg/kg) or placebo every 2 weeks until disease progression or toxicity requiring study discontinuation. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety were assessed. RESULTS Of 493 enrolled patients, 81 (nivolumab, n = 59; placebo, n = 22) were Tmab+ and 412 (nivolumab, n = 271; placebo, n = 141) were Tmab-. In both groups, patients receiving nivolumab showed a longer median OS vs placebo (Tmab+, 8.3 [95% confidence interval, 5.3-12.9] vs 3.1 [1.9-5.3] months, hazard ratio, 0.38 [0.22-0.66]; P = 0.0006; Tmab-, 4.8 [4.1-6.0] vs 4.2 [3.6-4.9] months, 0.71 [0.57-0.88]; P = 0.0022).

128175,Impact of Right Atrial Remodeling in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND Measuring public response during COVID-19 is an important way of ensuring the suitability and effectiveness of epidemic response efforts. An analysis of social media provides an approximation to public sentiment during an emergency like the current pandemic. The measures introduced across the globe to help curtail the spread of the coronavirus have led to the development of a situation labelled as a 'perfect storm', triggering a wave of domestic violence. As people use social media to communicate their experiences, analyzing public discourse and sentiment on social platforms offers a way to understand concerns and issues related to domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study was based on an analysis of public discourse and sentiment related to domestic violence during the stay-at-home periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia in 2020. It aimed to understand the more personal self-reported experiences, emotions and reactions towards domestic violence, that were not always classified/collected by official public bodies during the pandemic. METHODS We searched social media posts in Australia using key terms related to domestic violence and COVID-19 during 2020 using digital analytics tools to determine sentiments related to domestic violence during this period. RESULTS The study showed that the use of sentiment and discourse analysis to assess social media data is useful in measuring the public expression of feelings and sharing of resources in relation to the otherwise personal experience of domestic violence. Heightened awareness of this could help agencies tailor and target messaging to maximize impact. Negative or neutral sentiment centered on the sharp rise in domestic violence during different lockdown periods of the 2020 pandemic with neutral to positive sentiment centered around praise of efforts to raise awareness of domestic as well as the positive actions of domestic violence charities and support groups in their campaigns. There were calls for positive and proactive handling (rather than a mishandling of) of the pandemic and results indicated a high level of public discontent related to the rising rates of the violence and the lack of services during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS This study provided a timely understanding of public sentiment related to domestic violence during the COVID-19 lockdown periods in Australia using social media analysis. Social media represents an important avenue for dissemination of information that can be widely dispersed and easily accessed by a range of different communities who are often difficult to reach. Improved understanding of these issues is important for future policy direction.

128274,Opening Up Resident Education During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic and Beyond.,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Ordinal outcomes, such as modified Rankin Scale (mRS), are the standard primary end points in acute stroke trials. Regression models for assessing treatment efficacy after adjusting for baseline covariates have been developed for continuous, binary, or ordinal end points. There has been no consensus on the best choice of method for analyzing these data. METHODS We compared several regression models for assessing treatment efficacy in acute stroke trials using existing data sets from the Interventional Management of Stroke-III and Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism II (PROACT-2) trials. Patients with baseline non-contrast computed tomographic Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) > 5, baseline computed tomographic angiography, or conventional angiogram showing an intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery trunk (M-1) occlusion, adequate collateral circulation shown on computed tomographic angiography, and treatment times of non-contrast computed tomographic to groin puncture of ≤90 minutes, were included. Monte Carlo techniques were used to compare the statistical power of these regression models under a variety of simulated data analytic scenarios. RESULTS Binary logistic regression showed greater power when the treatment is predicted to show evidence of benefit on one end of the mRS with no other gains across other levels of the scale. Proportional odds regression showed greater power when the treatment is predicted to show evidence of improvement on both ends of the mRS. CONCLUSIONS The mRS distribution for both treatment and control groups influences the power of the investigated statistical models to assess treatment efficacy. A careful evaluation of the expected outcome distribution across the mRS scale is required to determine the best choice of primary analysis.","Sajobi, Tolulope T; Zhang, Yukun; Menon, Bijoy K; Goyal, Mayank; Demchuk, Andrew M; Broderick, Joseph P; Hill, Michael D",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.009328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26022639/,178

In this study, a facile and clean method based on thermal evaporation at high pressure is introduced, by which a highly porous, black colored structure of Au can be formed through the control of homogeneous nucleation and growth during evaporation. The deposited films have different morphologies, from columnar to nanoporous structures, depending on the working pressure. These porous structures consist of Au nanoparticle aggregates, and a large number of nano-gaps are found among the nanoparticles. Thus, these structures indicate a much higher intensity of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) when compared with commercial SERS substrates. The SERS intensity depends on the working pressure and thickness. Even circumstances that can induce agglomeration of nanoparticle aggregates do not deteriorate the sensitivity of SERS. These nanoporous structures based on high-pressure thermal evaporation are expected to provide a new platform for the development of low-cost and highly sensitive chemical sensors.","Lee, Eunji; Ryu, Sangwoo",Nanomaterials,https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11061463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205886/,178

METHODS We conducted a systematic review of self-management interventions for older adults (65+) with cancer guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. We conducted an exhaustive search of the following databases: Ageline, AMED, ASSIA, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO, and Sociological Abstracts. We assessed for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Down & Black for quasi-experimental studies, with data synthesized in a narrative and tabular format. RESULTS Sixteen thousand nine hundred and eight-five titles and abstracts were screened, subsequently 452 full-text papers were reviewed by two independent reviewers, of which 13 full-text papers were included in the final review. All self-management interventions included in this review measured Quality of Life; other outcomes included mood, self-care activity, supportive care needs, self-advocacy, pain intensity, and analgesic intake; only one intervention measured frailty. Effective interventions were delivered by a multidisciplinary teams (n = 4), nurses (n = 3), and mental health professionals (n = 1). Self-management core skills most commonly targeted included: problem solving; behavioural self-monitoring and tailoring; and settings goals and action planning. CONCLUSIONS Global calls to action argue for increased emphasize on self-management but presently, few interventions exist that explicitly target the self-management needs of older adults with cancer. Future work should focus on explicit pathways to support older adults and their caregivers to prepare for and engage in cancer self-management processes and behaviours.","Haase, Kristen R; Sattar, Schroder; Hall, Steven; McLean, Bianca; Wills, Aria; Gray, Mikaela; Kenis, Cindy; Donison, Valentina; Howell, Doris; Puts, Martine",Psycho-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33724608/,178

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, a DL model was trained on 112,120 CXR images with 14 labeled classifiers (ChestX-ray14) and fine-tuned using initial CXR on hospital admission of 509 patients, who had undergone COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The test set consisted of a CXR on presentation of 248 individuals suspected of COVID-19 pneumonia between February 16 and March 3, 2020 from 4 centers (72 RT-PCR positives and 176 RT-PCR negatives). The CXR were independently reviewed by 3 radiologists and using the DL algorithm. Diagnostic performance was compared with radiologists' performance and was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC). RESULTS The median age of the subjects in the test set was 61 (interquartile range: 39 to 79) years (51% male). The DL algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.81, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.72 in detecting COVID-19 using RT-PCR as the reference standard. On subgroup analyses, the model achieved an AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.80, and specificity of 0.74 in detecting COVID-19 in patients presented with fever or respiratory systems and an AUC of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.81 in distinguishing COVID-19 from other forms of pneumonia. The algorithm significantly outperforms human readers (P<0.001 using DeLong test) with higher sensitivity (P=0.01 using McNemar test). CONCLUSIONS A DL algorithm (COV19NET) for the detection of COVID-19 on chest radiographs can potentially be an effective tool in triaging patients, particularly in resource-stretched health-care systems.","Chiu, Wan Hang Keith; Vardhanabhuti, Varut; Poplavskiy, Dmytro; Yu, Philip Leung Ho; Du, Richard; Yap, Alistair Yun Hee; Zhang, Sailong; Fong, Ambrose Ho-Tung; Chin, Thomas Wing-Yan; Lee, Jonan Chun Yin; Leung, Siu Ting; Lo, Christine Shing Yen; Lui, Macy Mei-Sze; Fang, Benjamin Xin Hao; Ng, Ming-Yen; Kuo, Michael D",Journal of thoracic imaging,https://doi.org/10.1097/rti.0000000000000559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32969949/,178

These reports did not include baseline demographic descriptions. METHODS An IFSO Global Registry pilot project in 2014 demonstrated that it was possible to amalgamate large numbers of individual patient data from different local and national database systems. Here we describe demographic data from the second report for 54,490 patients from 31 countries operated in the 3 calendar years 2013-2015 and follow up data from 66,560 of 112,544 patients in 2009-2015. RESULTS Most procedures (97.8%) were performed laparoscopically and 73.3% (95% CI: 73.0-73.7%, range 54.2 to 80.3%) were female. The average age was 42.0 years (95% CI 41.9-42.1, inter-quartile range 33.0-51.0 years) and the median body mass index was 43.3 kg/m2 (inter-quartile range 39.4-48.8 kg/m2). Before surgery, 22.0% patients had type 2 diabetes (inter-country variation 7.4-63.2%); 31.9% were hypertensive (15.8-92.7%); 17.6% had depression (0.0-46.3%); 27.8% took medication for musculoskeletal pain (0.0-58.9%); 18.9% had sleep apnea (0.0-63.2%); and 29.6% of patients had gastro-esophageal reflux disease (9.1-90.9%). Gastric bypass was the most prevalent operation (49.4%), followed by sleeve gastrectomy (40.7%) and gastric banding (5.5%). The 1-year total weight loss for patients with available data was 30.53% (95% CI: 30.22-30.84%) and in the cohort 2009-15 was 30.4% with a follow-up rate of 59.14%. In the 2009-2015 cohort, 64.7% of patients on treatment for diabetes preoperatively were not on treatment postoperatively.

Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19. METHODS We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro-computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression. RESULTS In patients who died from Covid-19-associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth - predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis - was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS In our small series, vascular angiogenesis distinguished the pulmonary pathobiology of Covid-19 from that of equally severe influenza virus infection.

Using the Rip1Tag2 transgenic mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), we have investigated the potential benefit of a combination of anti-angiogenic treatment with targeted internal radiotherapy. METHODS [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, a radiopeptide that selectively binds to GLP-1R expressed on insulinoma and other neuroendocrine tumor cells, was co-administered with oral vatalanib (an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)) or imatinib (a c-kit/PDGFR inhibitor). The control groups included single-agent kinase inhibitor treatments and [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-natIn)NH2]-exendin-4 monotherapy. For biodistribution, Rip1Tag2 mice were pre-treated with oral vatalanib or imatinib for 0, 3, 5, or 7 days at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Subsequently, [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 was administered i.v., and the biodistribution was assessed after 4 h. For therapy, the mice were injected with 1.1 MBq [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and treated with vatalanib or imatinib 100 mg/kg orally for another 7 days. Tumor volume, tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation, and microvessel density were quantified. RESULTS Combination of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and vatalanib was significantly more effective than single treatments (p < 0.05) and reduced the tumor volume by 97% in the absence of organ damage. The pre-treatment of mice with vatalanib led to a reduction in the tumor uptake of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, indicating that concomitant administration of vatalanib and the radiopeptide was the best approach. Imatinib did not show a synergistic effect with [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4. CONCLUSION The combination of 1.1 MBq of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 with 100 mg/kg vatalanib had the same effect on a neuroendocrine tumor as the injection of 28 MBq of the radiopeptide alone but without any apparent side effects, such as radiation damage of the kidneys.","Wicki, Andreas; Wild, Damian; Prêtre, Vincent; Mansi, Rosalba; Orleth, Annette; Reubi, Jean-Claude; Rochlitz, Christoph; Mamot, Christoph; Mäcke, Helmut R; Christofori, Gerhard",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2191-219x-4-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528513/,178

Aortic stiffness has been studied as an additional imaging-based risk factor, and has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. Reports suggest that some aortic pathology is asymmetric around the vessel circumference, a feature which would not be identified with current imaging approaches. We propose that this asymmetry may be revealed using Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE). The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of assessing asymmetric stretch in healthy and diseased ascending aortas using DENSE. METHODS Aortic wall displacement was assessed with DENSE cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in 5 volunteers and 15 consecutive patients. Analysis was performed in a cross-sectional plane through the ascending aorta at the pulmonary artery. Displacement data was used to determine the wall stretch between the expanded and resting states of the aorta, in four quadrants around the aortic circumference. RESULTS Analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not only show significant differences in stretch between groups of volunteers (p<0.001), but also significant differences in stretch along the circumference of the aorta (p<0.001), indicating an asymmetric stretch pattern. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the asymmetry between volunteers and different groups of patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of asymmetric stretch is feasible in the ascending aorta with DENSE CMR. Clear differences in stretch are seen between patients and volunteers, with asymmetric patterns demonstrated around the aortic circumference.","Haraldsson, Henrik; Hope, Michael; Acevedo-Bolton, Gabriel; Tseng, Elaine; Zhong, Xiaodong; Epstein, Frederick H; Ge, Liang; Saloner, David",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,https://doi.org/10.1186/1532-429x-16-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400865/,178

A Randomized Double-Blind Trial.,2020-09-16,"To assess the efficacy and safety of the Leo stent used alone or with coiling to treat complex intracranial aneurysms (IAs) not eligible for simple or balloon-assisted coiling, this single-center retrospective study included consecutive adults with ruptured or unruptured IAs treated in 2011-2018 by stenting with or without coiling. The indication for stenting was IA complexity precluding simple or balloon-assisted coiling. Extensive data on the patients, IAs, antiplatelet treatments, procedures, and outcomes over the first 36 months were collected. Risk factors for early complications (univariate analysis) and delayed ischemia (multivariate analysis) were sought. We include 64 patients with 66 IAs. The procedural success rate was 65/66 (98.5%). Obliteration was Raymond Roy class I or II for 85% of IAs. Six patients died including four of the 12 patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was the only significant risk factor for early major complications. At 1 month, 45/64 (69%) had no disabilities. No rebleeding was reported. Ischemia was detected by routine MRI in 20 (35%) of the 57 patients with long-term data and was asymptomatic in 14. The stent-within-a-stent configuration was the only independent risk factor for ischemia. The Leo stent used alone or with coils to manage challenging IAs was associated with a high procedural success rate and complete or nearly complete IA obliteration of 85% of IAs. The high frequency of ischemia is ascribable to our use of routine serial MRI. In patients with bleeding, the Leo stent was associated with an excess risk of early, major, intracranial complications, as compared to patients without bleeding. Long-term follow-up was marked by the occurrence of ischemic events in the vascular territory of the stent, mostly silent.","Lebeaupin, François; Comby, Pierre-Olivier; Lenfant, Marc; Thouant, Pierre; Lemogne, Brivaël; Guillen, Kévin; Chevallier, Olivier; Ricolfi, Frédéric; Loffroy, Romaric",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640559/,178

In addition to the efforts to develop an effective vaccine, alternative approaches are essential to control this pandemic, which will most likely require multiple readily available solutions. Among them, monoclonal anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies have been isolated by multiple laboratories in record time facilitated by techniques that were first pioneered for HIV-1 antibody discovery. Here, we summarize how lessons learned from anti-HIV-1 antibody discovery have provided fundamental knowledge for the rapid development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RECENT FINDINGS Research laboratories that successfully identified potent broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 have harnessed their antibody discovery techniques to isolate novel potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which have efficacy in animal models. These antibodies represent promising clinical candidates for treatment or prevention of COVID-19. SUMMARY Passive transfer of antibodies is a promising approach when the elicitation of protective immune responses is difficult, as in the case of HIV-1 infection. Antibodies can also play a significant role in post-exposure prophylaxis, in high-risk populations that may not mount robust immune responses after vaccination, and in therapy. We provide a review of the recent approaches used for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery and upcoming challenges in the field.","Mendoza, Pilar; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Gaebler, Christian",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229949/,178

Because of a high rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak at birth we developed a 3 layer closure (3LC) comprising a bovine collagen patch, a myofascial layer and a skin layer, using the same exteriorized uterus, fetoscopic technique. METHODS Prospective cohort study: 32 consecutive SLC controls were compared with 18 consecutive 3LC cases. All patients satisfied Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) criteria. Obstetric, maternal, fetal, and early neonatal outcomes were compared. RESULTS Maternal demographics and gestational age at fetal surgery (24.9 ± 0.7 vs. 25.0 ± 0.5 weeks; p = NS) and at delivery (36.5 ± 3.5 vs. 37.6 ± 3.1 weeks; p = 0.14) were similar for SLC vs. 3LC, respectively. PPROM < 37 weeks (28% vs. 29%; p = NS), timing of PPROM (32.3 ± 3.4 vs. 32.7 ± 1.9 weeks; p = NS), and vaginal delivery (50% vs. 47%; p = 0.8) were similar for SLC vs. 3LC respectively. SLC showed a significantly higher rate of CSF leak (8/32 (25%) vs. 3LC (0/17 (0%); p = 0.02), and a lower rate of reversal of hind brain herniation at 6 weeks postoperatively (SLC = 18/30 (60%) vs. 3LC = 14/15 (93%); p 0.02). The rates of meeting MOMS criteria for hydrocephalus (SLC = 23/31 (74%) vs. 3LC = 7/12 (58%); p = 0.31) and requiring treatment for hydrocephalus at 12 months (15/32 (47%) SLC controls vs. 4/12 (33%) 3LC; p=0.14) were similar. CONCLUSIONS Compared to SLC, 3LC preserves the fetal and obstetric benefits of fetoscopic repair, and shows improved rates of CSF leakage and reversal of hindbrain herniation at 6 weeks postoperatively.

Nevertheless, these kidneys have the potential to fully recover. Tubular regeneration following acute kidney injury is driven by the regenerative potential of tubular cells originating from a tubular stem cell pool. We investigated urinary sediments of acute kidney injury transplanted patients and compared it to those of non-transplanted patients. Thereby we discovered tubular cell agglomerates, which have not been described in vivo. We hypothesized that these so-called nephrospheres were associated with recovery from acute kidney injury. METHODS Urine sediment of 45 kidney-transplanted and 19 non-transplanted individuals was investigated. Nephrospheres were isolated and stained for several molecular markers including aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and calcium sensing receptor (CASR). Nephrospheres were cultured to examine their growth behavior in vitro. In addition, quantitative PCR for CASR, AQP1, and podocin (NPHS2) was performed. RESULTS Nephrospheres were excreted in the urine of 17 kidney-transplant recipients 7 days after onset of acute kidney injury and were detectable over several days until kidney function was recovered to baseline creatinine levels. None were found in the urine of non-transplanted individuals. Nephrospheres were either AQP1+/CASR+ or AQP1-/CASR+ and could be cultured for 27 days. Mitotic cells could still be visualized after 17 days in culture. Quantitative PCR detected AQP1 in both kidney-transplanted and non-transplanted individuals during the phase of creatinine decline. As a limitation qPCR was only performed for the entire urinary sediment. CONCLUSIONS Nephrospheres are three dimensional tubular cell agglomerates which appeared in urine of kidney transplant recipients recovering from acute kidney injury. Appearance of nephrospheres in urine was independent of the duration after kidney transplantation. Nephrospheres proliferated in cell culture and kept expressing kidney specific marker. Presence of nephrospheres in urine showed a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 60.71% for recovery.","Knafl, Daniela; Winnicki, Wolfgang; Mazal, Peter; Wagner, Ludwig",BMC nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-019-1454-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288784/,178

143830,Comparison of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adult COVID-19 and influenza patients - a prospective observational study.,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND Self-harm (defined here as an act of intentionally causing harm to own self, irrespective of the type, motive or suicidal intent) is one of the strongest antecedents of suicide in youth. While there have been a number of studies of youth self-harm in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is currently no systematic review of studies of prevalence rates and risk and protective factors. AIM To systematically review the evidence relating to the prevalence rates and forms of self-harm in youth in LMICs and its relationship to family economic status, family functioning, relationship with the peer group, social relationships and academic performance. METHODS Electronic searches of three databases, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus, were performed. In total, 27 school-, community- and hospital-based studies evaluating self-harm in LMICs with youth focus (with participants between 12 and 25 years) were included. RESULTS The self-harm was divided into suicidal and non-suicidal depending on the nature of self-harm. The 12-month prevalence rates of non-suicidal self-harm varied from 15.5% to 31.3%, and the range of suicidal behaviour rates was from 3.2% to 4.7%. Banging and hitting were the most common in the community-based studies, followed by cutting, scratching and wound picking. Self-poisoning with pesticides was most commonly reported in hospital-based studies. Risk factors for self-harm were family conflict, peer groups with members indulging in self-harm, truancy and school absenteeism. Protective factors were having an understanding family, having friends and higher school competence. Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and attempts were lack of close friends and history of suicide by a friend. CONCLUSION The 12-month prevalence rates of youth self-harm in LMICs are comparable to high-income countries (HICs). The profile of risk and protective factors suggests that family-based interventions could be useful in treatment and prevention. Future studies should aim for greater consistency in assessment methods and the constructs under evaluation.","Aggarwal, Shilpa; Patton, George; Reavley, Nicola; Sreenivasan, Shreenivas A; Berk, Michael",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764017700175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28351292/,178

METHODS From January 2012 to December 2013, data from patients who underwent curative radical gastrectomy and consequently received AC for pathologic stage 2 or 3 gastric cancer at 27 institutions in South Korea were analyzed. RESULTS The study enrolled 925 patients, 661 patients (71.5%) who completed 8 cycles of AC and 264 patients (28.5%) who did not. Compared with the mean disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients who completed 8 AC cycles (69.3 months), the mean DFS of patients who completed 6 AC cycles (72.4 months; p = 0.531) and those who completed 7 AC cycles (63.7 months; p = 0.184) did not differ significantly. However, the mean DFS of the patients who completed 5 AC cycles (48.2 months; p = 0.016) and those who completed 1-4 AC cycles (62.9 months; p = 0.036) was significantly lower than the DFS of those who completed 8 AC cycles. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the mean DFS was significantly affected by advanced stage, large tumor size, positive vascular invasion, and number of completed AC cycles (1-5 cycles: hazard ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.08; p = 0.041). CONCLUSION The current multicenter observational cohort study showed that the mean DFS for 6 or 7 AC cycles was similar to that for 8 AC cycles as an adjuvant treatment for gastric cancer.","Jeong, Sang-Ho; Yoo, Moon-Won; Son, Young-Gil; Oh, Sung Jin; Kim, Jong-Han; Kim, Hyoung-Il; Park, Joong-Min; Hur, Hoon; Jee, Ye Seob; Hwang, Sun-Hwi; Jin, Sung-Ho; Lee, Sang Eok; Lee, Yong-Joon; Seo, Kyung Won; Park, Sungsoo; Lee, Chang Min; Kim, Chang Hyun; Jeong, In Ho; Lee, Han Hong; Choi, Sung Il; Lee, Sang-Il; Kim, Chan Young; Chae, Hyundong; Son, Myoung-Won; Pak, Kyung Ho; Kim, Sungsoo; Lee, Moon-Soo; Min, Jae-Seok",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-09504-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423177/,178

Although there are numerous potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated AKI, our current knowledge of kidney pathologic findings in COVID-19 is limited. METHODS We examined the postmortem kidneys from 42 patients who died of COVID-19. We reviewed light microscopy findings in all autopsies and performed immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization studies for SARS-CoV-2 on a subset of samples. RESULTS The cohort had a median age of 71.5 years (range, 38-97 years); 69% were men, 57% were Hispanic, and 73% had a history of hypertension. Among patients with available data, AKI developed in 31 of 33 patients (94%), including 6 with AKI stage 1, 9 with stage 2, and 16 with stage 3. The predominant finding correlating with AKI was acute tubular injury. However, the degree of acute tubular injury was often less severe than predicted for the degree of AKI, suggesting a role for hemodynamic factors, such as aggressive fluid management. Background changes of hypertensive arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis were frequent but typically mild. We identified focal kidney fibrin thrombi in 6 of 42 (14%) autopsies. A single Black patient had collapsing FSGS. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were largely unrevealing, and in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 showed no definitive positivity. CONCLUSIONS Among a cohort of 42 patients dying with COVID-19, autopsy histologic evaluation revealed acute tubular injury, which was typically mild relative to the degree of creatinine elevation. These findings suggest potential for reversibility upon resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Santoriello, Dominick; Khairallah, Pascale; Bomback, Andrew S; Xu, Katherine; Kudose, Satoru; Batal, Ibrahim; Barasch, Jonathan; Radhakrishnan, Jai; D'Agati, Vivette; Markowitz, Glen",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020050744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727719/,178
144045,CT Findings of Pregnant Women With Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia.,2020-04-14,"South Africa maintains the world's largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers' (HCWs)' beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs' role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions. Inviting leadership from local HCWs may increase the likelihood of delivery plans that account for unique local context and structural barriers researchers may otherwise struggle to uncover.","Asabor, Emmanuella Ngozi; Lett, Elle; Moll, Anthony; Shenoi, Sheela V",AIDS and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03213-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763802/,178

Újabb megfigyelések szerint a SARS-CoV-2-fertőzést követően gyermekekben a paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) elnevezésű, sokkállapottal szövődött Kawasaki-megbetegedéshez hasonlító, többszervi elégtelenségnek megfelelő tünetegyüttes alakulhat ki. A gyermekek többségében ilyenkor a direkt víruskimutatás már sikertelen, azonban a SARS-CoV-2 ellen képződött antitest igazolhatja a diagnózist. Dolgozatunk célja az egyik első hazai eset ismertetése. Egy 15 éves fiú került gyermek intenzív osztályos felvételre több napon át észlelt magas láz, kesztyű-, zokniszerű exanthema, conjunctivitis, többszervi elégtelenség, szeptikus sokk tüneteivel, akut gyulladásra utaló laboratóriumi eltérésekkel és diffúz hasi panaszokkal. Felvételét megelőzően néhány héttel SARS-CoV-2-fertőzésen esett át. Felvételekor a direkt víruskimutatás sikertelen volt, ám a SARS-CoV-2 elleni antitest vizsgálata pozitív lett. Komplex intenzív terápia mellett állapota stabilizálódott. Az irodalmi ajánlásoknak megfelelően immunglobulin-, acetilszalicilsav- és szteroidkezelésben részesítettük, melynek hatására állapota maradványtünetek nélkül rendeződött. A növekvő esetszámú gyermekkori SARS-CoV-2-fertőzés mellett egyre gyakrabban várható a SARS-CoV-2-fertőzést követő, a Kawasaki-betegség tüneteire emlékeztető PIMS kialakulása. Gyermekekben súlyos szeptikus állapot és többszervi elégtelenség esetén gondolni kell a PIMS lehetőségére, mely esetenként intenzív osztályos ellátást és célzott terápiát igényel. Legjobb tudomásunk szerint a leírásra került beteg a Magyarországon diagnosztizált egyik legkorábbi eset. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(16): 602-607. Summary. Recently following SARS-CoV-2 infection, a new, multisystem disease (paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, PIMS) with fever was recognized in children with shock and multiorgan failure. On of the first Hungarian cases will be described. A 15-year-old boy was admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit with persistent high fever, diffuse abdominal pain, septic shock, multiple organ failure, gloves- and socks-shaped cutan exanthema, conjunctivitis and laboratory signs of inflammation. Some weeks preceding his admission, symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection were revealed. At admission, the SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antigen tests were negative, however, the presence of IgG antibody was shown. Following complex supportive intensive care along with internationally recommended immunoglobulin, aspirin and steroid treatment, the patient was completely cured without any sequalae. In children after SARS-CoV-2 infection, PIMS could occur mimicking Kawasaki syndrome. At this time, in children virus PCR or antigen tests are usually negative already, but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody could prove the preceding disease. Due to the increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the occurrence of post-SARS-CoV-2 PIMS in childhood is expected to increase. For paediatric patients, in case of severe septic state and multiple organ failure, PIMS should be also considered, which may require intensive care and targeted therapy. As far as we know, the described case is one of the earliest cases of PIMS in Hungary.

In contrast, glycan patterns of immunogenic viral proteins, which differ significantly between the various expressions systems, are hardly analyzed yet. The influenza A virus (IAV) proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have multiple N-glycosylation sites, and alteration of N-glycan micro- and macroheterogeneity can have strong effects on virulence and immunogenicity. Here, we present a versatile and powerful glycoanalytical workflow that enables a comprehensive N-glycosylation analysis of IAV glycoproteins. We challenged our workflow with IAV (A/PR/8/34 H1N1) propagated in two closely related Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell lines, namely an adherent MDCK cell line and its corresponding suspension cell line. As expected, N-glycan patterns of HA and NA from virus particles produced in both MDCK cell lines were similar. Detailed analysis of the HA N-glycan microheterogeneity showed an increasing variability and a higher complexity for N-glycosylation sites located closer to the head region of the molecule. In contrast, NA was found to be exclusively N-glycosylated at site N73. Almost all N-glycan structures were fucosylated. Furthermore, HA and NA N-glycan structures were exclusively hybrid- and complex-type structures, to some extent terminated with alpha-linked galactose(s) but also with blood group H type 2 and blood group A epitopes. In contrast to the similarity of the overall glycan pattern, differences in the relative abundance of individual structures were identified.

147269,Perioperative goal-directed therapy.,2014,"Peptides are versatile and attractive biomolecules that can be applied to modulate genetic mechanisms like alternative splicing. In this process, a single transcript yields different mature RNAs leading to the production of protein isoforms with diverse or even antagonistic functions. During splicing events, errors can be caused either by mutations present in the genome or by defects or imbalances in regulatory protein factors. In any case, defects in alternative splicing have been related to several genetic diseases including muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease and cancer from almost every origin. One of the most effective approaches to redirect alternative splicing events has been to attach cell-penetrating peptides to oligonucleotides that can modulate a single splicing event and restore correct gene expression. Here, we summarize how natural existing and bioengineered peptides have been applied over the last few years to regulate alternative splicing and genetic expression. Under different genetic and cellular backgrounds, peptides have been shown to function as potent vehicles for splice correction, and their therapeutic benefits have reached clinical trials and patenting stages, emphasizing the use of regulatory peptides as an exciting therapeutic tool for the treatment of different genetic diseases.","Nancy, Martínez-Montiel; Nora, Rosas-Murrieta; Rebeca, Martínez-Contreras",Peptides,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2015.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748022/,178

In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in comparison to clinic visits. We also demonstrate that nonsurgical specialties had significantly lower no-show rates and the greatest number of telehealth visits. Overall, our findings highlight the potential shortcomings of telemedicine in servicing non-English-speaking patients, while maintaining that it is an important tool with the potential to improve access to health care, particularly in nonprocedural specialties.","Franciosi, Ellen B; Tan, Alice J; Kassamali, Bina; Leonard, Nicholas; Zhou, Guohai; Krueger, Steven; Rashighi, Mehdi; LaChance, Avery",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826411/,178

The port is not affected by the location of the through hole in the gastrointestinal tract or vagina which elicits a problem in conventional NOTES, and its length can be adjusted during surgery by cutting the port itself. The port is made of polymer resin with a low friction coefficient. Furthermore, the port walls have a square wave structure which contributes to (1) the prevention of devices, for example, endoscope, from getting stuck at the time of insertion and retrieval, (2) the prevention of port slippage in the surgical opening for port insertion, (3) the prevention of unexpected port removal, (4) the prevention of port bore deformation, and (5) the improvement of port flexibility in the longitudinal direction. We validated the insertion and retrieval capacities of commercially available forceps for laparoscope-assisted surgery and power devices. Furthermore, we used the flexible port to conduct cholecystectomy and partial gastrectomy. We could confirm that the selection of the flexible port diameter according to the device type allowed the smooth insertion and retrieval of the device and that the port produced no air leakage. We affirmed that it is possible to conduct surgery by the cross or parallel method similarly to single port surgery.

To date, dexamethasone is the first and an important therapeutic to significantly reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Due to powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, dexamethasone could attenuate SARS-CoV-2-induced uncontrolled cytokine storm, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. Nevertheless, dexamethasone treatment is a double-edged sword, as numerous studies have revealed that it has significant adverse impacts later in life. In this article, we reviewed the literature regarding the adverse effects of dexamethasone administration on different organ systems as well as related disease pathogenesis in an attempt to clarify the potential harms that may arise in COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone treatment. Overall, taking the threat of COVID-19 pandemic into account, we think it is necessary to apply dexamethasone as a pharmaceutical therapy in critical patients. However, its adverse side effects cannot be ignored. Our review will help medical professionals in the prognosis and follow-up of patients treated with dexamethasone. In addition, given that a considerable amount of uncertainty, confusion and even controversy still exist, further studies and more clinical trials are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the parameters and the effects of dexamethasone on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chen, Fei; Hao, Lanting; Zhu, Shiheng; Yang, Xinyuan; Shi, Wenhao; Zheng, Kai; Wang, Tenger; Chen, Huiran",Infectious diseases and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40121-021-00500-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296386/,178

The objective of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of patients exposed to noxious emissions of decomposing sargassum seaweed. METHODS This observational study included patients from January 2018 to December 2018 for complaints attributed to decomposing sargassum seaweed. History and geographical characteristics of sargassum seaweed strandings as well as detection of ambient air hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels were documented during the inclusion period. FINDINGS A total of 154 patients were included. Mean exposure period was 3 months. Neurological (80%), digestive (77%) and respiratory (69%) disorders were the most frequent reasons for medical visit. Temporal distribution of medical visits was related to history of strandings. Geographical origins of patients were consistent with the most impacted areas of strandings as well as the most elevated ambient air H2S levels. INTERPRETATION The toxicological syndrome induced by sargassum seaweed exposure is close to the toxidrome associated with acute H2S exposure in the range of 0-10 ppm. Our study suggests that patients living in massive stranding areas may be exposed to H2S > 5 ppm for 50 days per year.","Resiere, Dabor; Mehdaoui, Hossein; Florentin, Jonathan; Gueye, Papa; Lebrun, Thierry; Blateau, Alain; Viguier, Jerome; Valentino, Ruddy; Brouste, Yannick; Kallel, Hatem; Megarbane, Bruno; Cabie, André; Banydeen, Rishika; Neviere, Remi",Clinical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2020.1789162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633580/,178

Clinical outcomes of patients who received either TPD or IPD using an APD system were compared in a randomized, open-label, prospective control study in a single-center setting. From May 2011 to May 2013, 49 patients were enrolled and 27 patients received low-volume TPD treatment, whereas 22 patients underwent low-volume IPD right after Tenckhoff catheter insertion. The incidence of complications during the 14-day APD treatment were observed. After APD treatment, all the patients were transferred to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and followed up for 2 years. The IPD group demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of catheter-related complications (omental wrapping 27.3% vs. 0% and suction pain 18.2% vs. 0%) than the TPD group after adjusting for age, gender, baseline diabetes, systolic blood pressure, BMI, and the experience of the operators. However, the short duration of APD treatment with either IPD or TPD mode did not affect the long-time technical survival. In patients immediately after catheter insertion, low-volume TPD mode demonstrated a lower incidence of catheter-related complications compared to IPD. Although our results provided evidence that TPD is a preferable APD mode for this specific population, definitive conclusions about TPD benefit cannot be made, owing to early termination of the trial.","Xie, Jianteng; Wang, Huizhen; Li, Sheng; Zuo, Yangyang; Wang, Yanhui; Zhang, Yifan; Liang, Tiantian; Li, Jing; Wang, Liping; Feng, Zhonglin; Ye, Zhiming; Liang, Xinling; Shi, Wei; Wang, Wenjian","Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy",https://doi.org/10.1111/1744-9987.12791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30624012/,178

METHODS This was a prospective randomized clinical trial. Forty Asian patients who required toilet and suture for minor lacerations in the emergency department of the Singapore General Hospital over a 4-month period. The patients were assigned randomly to 2 arms of treatment. The first was the LAT gel group who had LAT gel applied to the laceration prior to suturing. The second was the control group in whom the anesthetic administered was lignocaine infiltration (LI) via a syringe. The pain of the process of administering anesthetic and efficacy of anesthesia were scored using the visual pain scale included within. The efficacy of LAT vs. lignocaine infiltration as an anesthetic prior to the toilet and suture of minor lacerations and complications of therapy. RESULTS Twenty patients were randomized to LAT gel and 16 to LI on an intention to treat analysis. The mean pain score by patients in the LAT gel group was 2.5 (0.52 SE), and 2.5 (0.58 SE) in the LI group. The pain score for pain during application of the anesthetic was 1.5 (0.40) in the LAT gel group, and 3.5 (0.46) in the LI group. There was no difference in complications between the LAT and LI groups.

Seventeen healthy adults participated in two testing sessions where they received either 50-Hz (cTBS50) or 30-Hz (cTBS30) cerebellar cTBS. Cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI), a measure of cerebello-thalamocortical pathway strength, and motor evoked potentials (MEP) were measured in the dominant first dorsal interosseous muscle before and after (up to ~ 40 min) cerebellar cTBS.

However, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in the rate of CR-BSI associated with the conventional type of central venous catheters (cCVCs) and peripherally inserted CVCs (PICCs) in such patients. To address this question, we retrospectively investigated the incidence of CR-BSIs associated with PICCs versus cCVCs in patients with hematological malignancies. We used PICCs in all consecutive patients requiring CVC placement between February 2009 and February 2013. We compared the CR-BSI rate in patients with PICCs with that in patients with cCVCs treated between September 2006 and January 2009 (control group). Eighty-four patients received PICCs and 85 received cCVCs. The most common reason for removal due to catheter-related complications was CR-BSI.

Analysis of the link between intention to follow recommendations for protective behavior in the case of Covid-19 pandemic and individual attitudes toward the situation, normative beliefs and behavior of referent group, anticipated affect and perceived behavioral control. Background. In the situation of the coronavirus pandemic, which is widespread ubiquitously, people have to inevitably and quickly change their lifestyle. These changes are closely linked to economic, social and existential uncertainty. In this regard, it becomes necessary to identify the facilitating and inhibiting factors for adaptation to required forms of behavior in society (rules of social distancing and seeking medical care). Methodology. The methodological rationale for the research was a positive constructivist view of individual behavior. On the basis of the Theory of Planned Behavior the questionnaire ""Protective behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic"" was developed. Study design. The survey method was applied through online-forms of questionnaires in Azerbaijani and Russian languages. The regression model of following the protective behavior was tested separately for each language group. Participants. The study involved 56 Russian-speaking and 68 Azerbaijani-speaking residents of Azerbaijan (social networks users). Results. The reliability of the questionnaire was tested and a regression model was created to explain protective behavior. Differences in individual attitudes and subjective norms that determine protective behavior for Russian-speaking and Azerbaijani-speaking citizens are shown. The general role of past experience (duration of adherence to the quarantine regime) in consolidating protective behavior for both groups was determined. Conclusions. Individual attitudes and normative beliefs define protective behavior in different ways among Russian-speaking and Azerbaijani-speaking citizens. An assumption has been made about the defensive nature of following the protective behavior as a decrease in anxiety in connection with future uncertainty. The results of the study reveal the peculiarity of following the protective behavior of a specific sample of respondents - people of the middle class of early adulthood, which limits the possibility of generalizing the conclusions to other age and socio-economic groups.","Bayramova, Y.

Normally organic loading would be localized, but the slow degradation of microplastics allows the circulation across all the oceans. Single use plastics, such as wipes are having an increasing impact due to significant growth of demand and particularly with sanitation concerns with COVID-19. Biodegradability of plastics needs to be reassessed and the use of actual ocean conditions is needed. Verifying claims of biodegradability need to be reassessed since these are based on methods that have not considered nitrogen limitations in the ocean. © 2021 The Authors","Van Rossum, T.",Water Cycle,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watcyc.2021.06.001,178

This research note compares the current coronavirus disease-2019 crisis to previous ones and investigates the willingness of European Union citizens to show solidarity towards fellow member states. We test the influence of socio-political attitudes of citizens on solidarity preferences in three crisis scenarios. We analyse Greece and Germany as cases differently affected by the past decade's crises and cases that chose different crisis management strategies when facing the novel virus. Our findings indicate that solidarity is highest in a pandemic, while for all crisis scenarios it is higher in Greece than in Germany.

CoVs encode a diverse number of proteins, ranging from 5 proteins in bat CoV, to 14 in SARS CoV, which could have implication on viral tropism and pathogenicity. Here, we highlight the functional protein motifs (domains) that could contribute in the coronavirus infection and severity, including SARS-CoV-2. For this role, we used the experimentally validated domain (motif) datasets that are known to be crucial for viral infection. Then, we highlight the potential molecular pathways and interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins within human cells. Interestingly, the C-terminal of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 protein encodes MREL motif, which a signature motif of the tubulin superfamily, and regulate tubulin expression.

It may also have had a psychological impact, especially on those with less resources already before the crisis and those who reported substantial changes to their work situation.ObjectivesTo investigate whether socioeconomic status before the crisis and changes in work situation during the crisis (unemployment, home-office) are associated with psychological impact in a cohort of young Swiss men.MethodsA total of 2345 young Swiss men (mean age = 29) completed assessments shortly before (April 2019 to February 2020) and early during the COVID-19 crisis (May to June 2020). Assessments covered psychological outcomes assessed before and during COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and assessed during the crisis (fear, isolation and COVID-19 psychological trauma), socioeconomic status (relative financial status and difficulty to pay bills) before the crisis and changes in work situation (unemployment, home-office).ResultsAbout a fifth of the sample were in partial unemployment or lost their job during COVID-19 crisis. Those in partial or full unemployment, those mostly working from home and those with a lower socioeconomic status already prior to the crisis showed overall higher levels of depression, stress, psychological trauma, fear and isolation.ConclusionsEven in a country with high social security such as Switzerland, the COVID-19 crisis had a higher psychological impact on those who were already disadvantaged before the crisis or experienced deteriorations in their work situation. Supporting disadvantaged subpopulations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of pre-existing inequalities.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Marmet, S.; Wicki, M.; Gmel, G.; Gachoud, C.; Bertholet, N.; Studer, J.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.293,178

This has provided us with an opportunity to assess and analyse the students perception of these virtual classes which otherwise did not form a significant part of the traditional medical education. The objective of the study was to assess medical students' perception on virtual classes conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 21 questions was administered to students studying in all phases of MBBS in our college using Google Forms. A response rate of 73% was achieved. Results: The response of the students when analysed showed limited perceived benefits of virtual classes, these included accessibility to recorded lectures and convenience of attending classes in the time of pandemic. Drawbacks include decreased levels of social interaction, internet connectivity issues and absence of practical's/ clinicals to better correlate with theory topics. Low motivational levels to attend classes, decreased engagement in classes and decreased perceived knowledge gained were also significant limitations. Conclusion: Better internet connectivity along with accessibility to recorded classes and increased student-teacher interaction could enhance the learning experience of the students in the virtual platform.","Karanth, M.; Shenoy Basti, A.

Critical to correctly describe the conditions of planet formation, these processes are best probed spectroscopically. About five-hundred orbits of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are being devoted in 2020-2022 to the ULLYSES public survey of about 70 low-mass (M<2Msun) young (age<10 Myr) stars at UV wavelengths. Here we present the PENELLOPE Large Program that is being carried out at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) to acquire, contemporaneous to HST, optical ESPRESSO/UVES high-resolution spectra to investigate the kinematics of the emitting gas, and UV-to-NIR X-Shooter medium-resolution flux-calibrated spectra to provide the fundamental parameters that HST data alone cannot provide, such as extinction and stellar properties. The data obtained by PENELLOPE have no proprietary time, and the fully reduced spectra are made available to the whole community. Here, we describe the data and the first scientific analysis of the accretion properties for the sample of thirteen targets located in the Orion OB1 association and in the sigma-Orionis cluster, observed in Nov-Dec 2020. We find that the accretion rates are in line with those observed previously in similarly young star-forming regions, with a variability on a timescale of days of<3. The comparison of the fits to the continuum excess emission obtained with a slab model on the X-Shooter spectra and the HST/STIS spectra shows a shortcoming in the X-Shooter estimates of<10%, well within the assumed uncertainty. Its origin can be either a wrong UV extinction curve or due to the simplicity of this modelling, and will be investigated in the course of the PENELLOPE program. The combined ULLYSES and PENELLOPE data will be key for a better understanding of the accretion/ejection mechanisms in young stars.","Manara, C. F.; Frasca, A.; Venuti, L.; Siwak, M.; Herczeg, G.

Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli lysate-based cell-free biosensors coupled to a personal glucose monitor (PGM) can enable on-site analyte quantification, with the potential for straightforward reconfigurability to diverse types of analytes. We show that analyte-responsive regulators of transcription and translation can modulate production of the reporter enzyme β-galactosidase, which in turn converts lactose into glucose for PGM quantification. Because glycolysis is active in the lysate and would readily deplete converted glucose, we decoupled enzyme production and glucose conversion to increase endpoint signal output. This lysate metabolism did, however, allow for one-pot removal of glucose present in complex samples (like human serum) without confounding target quantification. Taken together, we show that integrating lysate-based cell-free biosensors with PGMs enables accessible target detection and quantification at the point of need.

To keep our economy running, especially in difficult times of epidemics, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is of utmost importance to keep ships sailing, moving the bulk of goods including medical supplies and food. Every month, around 100,000 seafarers need to disembark from the ships that they operate to comply with regulations governing safe working hours and crew welfare, and another 100,000 seafarers will embark to continue to move the global trade safely. However, as countries around the world tighten border controls in against the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, seafarers are prohibited from boarding or leaving ships at most ports, with the exception of just a few. This situation is leading seafarers to serve onboard vessels beyond their contracted shifts. Given that more than a quarter of seafarers suffer from depression because of their long time spent at sea and being away from family and friends, banning crew changes will put their mental health at risk. This will further increase the likelihood of marine accidents, jeopardize global supply chains, and ultimately exacerbate current hardships. To tackle this emergency, the International Maritime Organization and the European Commission, amongst others, call on governments to coordinate efforts to designate ports for crew changes while preventing the potential spread of the coronavirus. The aim of the study is to develop a framework that integrates big data, machine learning, and operational research for governments and supranational organizations to choose ports for crew changes, safeguarding seafarers’ welfare, and strengthening the global response to the threats of epidemics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Guo, Y.; Yan, R.; Wu, Y.; Wang, S.","4th International Symposium on Smart Transportation Systems, KES-STS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-2324-0_12,178

The healthcare professional needs useful tools to diagnose medical illnesses. Classifiers are important to provide tools that can be useful to the health professional for this purpose. However, questions arise: which classifier to use? What metrics are appropriate to measure the performance of the classifier? How to determine a good distribution of the data so that the classifier does not bias the medical patterns to be classified in a particular class? Then most important question: does a classifier perform well for a particular disease? This paper will present some answers to the questions mentioned above, making use of classification algorithms widely used in machine learning research with datasets relating to medical illnesses under the supervised learning scheme. In addition to state-of-the-art algorithms in pattern classification, we introduce a novelty: the use of meta-learning to determine, a priori, which classifier would be the ideal for a specific dataset. The results obtained show numerically and statistically that there are reliable classifiers to suggest medical diagnoses. In addition, we provide some insights about the expected performance of classifiers for such a task.","Moreno-Ibarra, M. A.; Villuendas-Rey, Y.; Lytras, M. D.; Yanez-Marquez, C.; Salgado-Ramirez, J.

A six-year retrospective review of primary UH repairs between January 2012 and December 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center was undertaken. Patients were identified through a database search of the electronic medical record. The primary endpoint of UH recurrence was examined; median follow-up was 3.4 years. Primary, elective UH repair was performed in 244 patients; 71 per cent of hernias were small (<2 cm). The total number of recurrences was seven (3%). The t test analysis showed significant differences in the average size of hernia defects between those with recurrences (2 cm) and those without (1.4 cm), P < 0.05. Primary repair affords low infection and recurrence rates, comparable to those reported for mesh repair. Our single-surgeon/large-volume study contributes to the evidence that primary UH repair is a safe and durable method, with low risk of recurrence.

Despite its importance, the long-term persistence of its small and fragmented populations is jeopardised by genetic erosion and hence, monitoring its genetic resource and variability is practically required for providing conservation measures of the species germplasm in Zagros woodland ecosystem. The present study aimed to provide the first data on genetic diversity and genetic differentiation pattern of 19 natural populations comprising 240 individuals of A. monspessulanum across its growing area in Zagros forests using three molecular tools including inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), start codon targeted (SCoT), and simple sequence repeat (SSR). In total, ISSR and SCoT primers generated a total of 141 and 121 clear and scorable bands for analysis with the polymorphism rate of 90.50 and 90.02% and a mean of 10.85 and 11 fragments per marker, respectively. In addition, 73 alleles were achieved using 10 polymorphic SSR loci from the studied accessions with 100% polymorphism, ranging between 5 and 10 alleles per locus. Average percentage of polymorphic alleles per population for ISSR, SCoT, and SSR data was 84.02%, 83%, and 100%, respectively, and generally, Nei's gene diversity (H) and Shannon's index of diversity (I) values for all populations demonstrated moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (H = 0.267-0.707; I = 0.38-1.38). The AMOVA results of the three marker systems attributed higher genetic variation to individuals within in each population than among populations. Furthermore, overall GST value for all populations detected the moderate to high levels of genetic differentiation, indicating a limited gene flow occurrence among the populations.

Since then, COVID-19 has come as a shock to society and health systems. It has surpassed provincial, radical, conceptual, spiritual, social, and pedagogical boundaries. In the present pandemic situation, all countries are fighting their battle with COVID-19 and looking for a practical and cost-effective solution to face the problems. This chapter highlights the COVID-19 pandemic challenges faced by individuals and healthcare systems and how society is trying to utilize the benefits of the latest technologies, such as the sensor network and the Internet of things.","Udgata, Siba Kumar; Suryadevara, Nagender Kumar",SpringerBriefs Appl.

202833,The chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury involvement in COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), combined with the risk of polio importation from Ukraine, we evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and enteroviruses in 25 sewage water samples from Romania, concentrated using the WHO method between January 2020 and January 2021. Surveillance for enteroviruses and SARS-CoV-2 are relevant in the calculation of prevalence estimates as well as early detection of the introduction or disappearance of these viruses. For SARS-CoV-2 detection, we used two immunochromatographic nucleocapsid antigenic tests as well as real-time PCR assays, produced for respiratory samples. The isolation of cell culture lines, in accordance with the WHO recommendations, was carried out for enterovirus detection. Twenty-three of the samples investigated were positive in rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2, while the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, detected with Respiratory 2.1 plus a panel Biofire Film array, was present in eight samples. The Allplex 2019-nCoV assay was used for the validation of the tests. There were three genes detected in one sample, E, RdPR, and N, two genes, E and RdPR, in one sample, two genes, RdPR and N, in four samples, one gene, RdPR, in five samples and one gene, N, in one sample. Eight samples were positive for non-polio enteroviruses, and no poliovirus strains were isolated. This study suggests the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and enteroviruses in Romanian sewage water in 2020. As such, our results indicate that a rapid, more specific test should be developed especially for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage water.","BaicuÈ, Anda; Cherciu, Carmen Maria; Lazar, Mihaela",Viruses,,178

203490,The Critical Need for Process Improvement in Heart Failure,2020,"There are no definitive therapies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with severe disease. This case series explores the safety and effectiveness of intravenous allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), formulated as CAP-1002, in critically ill patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed. All patients (n = 6; age range 19-75 years, 1 female) required ventilatory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, n = 5) with PaO2/FiO2 ranging from 69 to 198. No adverse events related to CAP-1002 administration were observed. Four patients (67%) were weaned from respiratory support and discharged from the hospital. One patient remains mechanically ventilated as of April 28th, 2020; all survive. A contemporaneous control group of critically ill COVID-19 patients (n = 34) at our institution showed 18% overall mortality at a similar stage of hospitalization. Ferritin was elevated in all patients at baseline (range of all patients 605.43-2991.52 ng/ml) and decreased in 5/6 patients (range of all patients 252.89-1029.90 ng/ml). Absolute lymphocyte counts were low in 5/6 patients at baseline (range 0.26-0.82 × 103/µl) but had increased in three of these five patients at last follow-up (range 0.23-1.02 × 103/µl). In this series of six critically ill COVID-19 patients, intravenous infusion of CAP-1002 was well tolerated and associated with resolution of critical illness in 4 patients. This series demonstrates the apparent safety of CAP-1002 in COVID-19. While this initial experience is promising, efficacy will need to be further assessed in a randomized controlled trial.","Singh, Siddharth; Chakravarty, Tarun; Chen, Peter; Akhmerov, Akbarshakh; Falk, Jeremy; Friedman, Oren; Zaman, Tanzira; Ebinger, Joseph E; Gheorghiu, Mitch; Marbán, Linda; Marbán, Eduardo; Makkar, Raj R",Basic Res Cardiol,,178
203669,"Evidence does not make decisions, people do",2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has a deleterious effect on several systems, including the cardiovascular system. We aim to systematically explore the association of COVID-19 severity and mortality rate with the history of cardiovascular diseases and/or other comorbidities and cardiac injury laboratory markers. METHODS: The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from the 56 studies. The prognostic performance of cardiac markers for predicting adverse outcomes and to select the best cutoff threshold was estimated by ROC curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining cardiac markers with demographic and clinical features was applied to predict mortality and severity in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 17,794 patients showed patients with high cardiac troponin I (OR=5.22, 95%CI=3.73-7.31, p<0.001) and AST levels (OR=3.64, 95%CI=2.84-4.66, p<0.001) were more likely to develop adverse outcomes. High troponin I >13.75 ng/L combined with either advanced age >60 years or elevated AST level >27.72 U/L was the best model to predict poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 severity and mortality are complicated by myocardial injury. Assessment of cardiac injury biomarkers may improve the identification of those patients at the highest risk and potentially lead to improved therapeutic approaches.

204693,"Long-Term Non-invasive Ventilation in Children: Current Use, Indications, and Contraindications",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has forced the health care delivery structure to change rapidly. The pandemic has further widened the disparities in health care and exposed vulnerable populations. Health care services caring for such populations must not only continue to operate but create innovative methods of care delivery without compromising safety. We present our experience of incorporating telemedicine in our university hospital-based outpatient clinic in one of the worst-hit areas in the world. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to assess the adoption of a telemedicine service in the first month of its implementation in outpatient practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also want to assess the need for transitioning to telemedicine, the benefits and challenges in doing so, and ongoing solutions during the initial phase of the implementation of telemedicine services for our patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective review of clinic operations data from the first month of a telemedicine rollout in the outpatient adult ambulatory clinic from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. A telemedicine visit was defined as synchronous audio-video communication between the provider and patient for clinical care longer than 5 minutes or if the video visit converted to a telephone visit after 5 minutes due to technical problems. We recorded the number of telemedicine visits scheduled, visits completed, and the time for each visit. We also noted the most frequent billing codes used based on the time spent in the patient care and the number of clinical tasks (eg, activity suggested through diagnosis or procedural code) that were addressed remotely by the physicians. RESULTS: During the study period, we had 110 telemedicine visits scheduled, of which 94 (85.4%) visits were completed. The average duration of the video visit was 35 minutes, with the most prolonged visit lasting 120 minutes. Of 94 patients, 24 (25.54%) patients were recently discharged from the hospital, and 70 (74.46%) patients were seen for urgent care needs. There was a 50% increase from the baseline in the number of clinical tasks that were addressed by the physicians during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high acceptance of telemedicine services by the patients, which was evident by a high show rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Detroit. With limited staffing, restricted outpatient work hours, a shortage of providers, and increased outpatient needs, telemedicine was successfully implemented in our practice.","Garg, Alpana; Goyal, Sachin; Thati, Rohit; Thati, Neelima",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,178

206724,Comment on 'Reorganisation of medical oncology departments during the novel coronavirus disease-19 pandemic: A nationwide Italian survey' by Alice Indini et al,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic has exposed surgeons to hazardous working conditions, imposing the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) use during surgery. The use of such equipment may affect their non-technical skills, augment fatigue, and affect performance. This study aimed to assess the surgeons' perceptions of the impact of wearing PPE during emergency surgery throughout the pandemic. METHODS: An international cooperation group conducted an anonymous online survey among surgeons from over 30 countries, to assess perceptions about the impact of PPE use on non-technical skills, overall comfort, decision making, and surgical performance during emergency surgery on COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Responses to the survey (134) were received from surgeons based on 26 countries. The vast majority (72%) were males. More than half of the respondents (54%) felt that their surgical performance was hampered with PPE. Visual impairment was reported by 63%, whereas 54% had communication impediments. Less than half (48%) felt protected with the use of PPE, and the same proportion perceived that the use of such equipment influenced their decision making. Decreased overall comfort was cited by 66%, and 82% experienced increased surgical fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons perceived impediment for both visibility and communication, and other non-technical skills while using PPE on emergency surgery in COVID-19 patients. Their perceived lack of protection and comfort and increased fatigue may have inhibited their optimal surgical performance. More attention should be placed in the design of more user-friendly equipment, given the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic.","Yánez Benítez, Carlos; Güemes, Antonio; Aranda, José; Ribeiro, Marcelo; Ottolino, Pablo; Di Saverio, Salomone; Alexandrino, Henrique; Ponchietti, Luca; Blas, Juan L; Ramos, Juan Pablo; Rangelova, Elena; Muñoz, Mercedes; Yánez, Carlos",World J Surg,,178

The S protein is likely the most complicated of all viral glycoproteins and is a key factor in immunological responses and virus pathogenesis. It is also the driving force dictating virus entry mechanisms, which are highly 'plastic' for coronaviruses, allowing a plethora of options for different virus variants and strains in different cell types. Here we review coronavirus entry as a foundation for current work on SARS-CoV-2. We focus on the post-receptor binding events and cellular pathways that direct the membrane fusion events necessary for genome delivery, including S proteolytic priming and activation. We also address aspects of the entry process important for virus evolution and therapeutic development.","Whittaker, Gary R; Daniel, Susan; Millet, Jean K",Curr Opin Virol,,178

DATA AND METHODS: We collected organizational network data through a content analysis of online news articles and the government's white paper. Social network analysis was used to analyze the key organizations and their connections in crucial response tasks. RESULTS: Three national health authorities (Central MERS Management Headquarters [CMMH], Korea Centers for Disease Control [KCDC], Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW]) led the response. CMMH, which did not appear in the government's response plans, played a significant role in all 3 networks. KCDC also was involved in all 3 networks, but was most prominent in the laboratory testing network. MOHW appeared only in the patient management network. Each health authority coordinated and collaborated with distinctive types of organizations in the networks, but unclear lines of responsibilities also were found. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the roles and responsibilities of health authorities at the national level were fragmented and lacked clarity.

Early career researchers (ECRs) are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic on job security and career development. The goal of this study was to capture the challenges ECRs are facing during the pandemic and the supports that are needed for career development and research. ECRs were invited to complete an online survey that focused on four major areas; the impact of COVID-19 on their research; changes in productivity due to COVID-19; changes to training due to COVID-19; and current mental health. 150 ECRs were eligible and provided sufficient data for inclusion. All but one ECRs reported their research had been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Reductions in productivity were reported by 85% of ECRs. The biggest impacts included recruitment of participants, increased needs at home and personal mental health. ECRs reported a 3-fold increase in burnout, as well as increased anxiety. ECR supports, such as funding, flexibility, and tenure extensions, are required to ensure ASD research does not suffer from a ""lost generation"" of researchers. LAY SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative impacts on research around the world. Loss of productivity impedes autism research discoveries. However, researchers in the earliest phases of their career, specifically postdoctoral fellows through individuals in assistant professor (or equivalent) positions, are particularly vulnerable to long-lasting effects of pandemic-related disruptions which may limit their ability to continue as autism researchers. This survey highlights the needs of this group and identifies mechanisms by which these early career researchers may be supported in this time. This is critical to ensure the next generation of ASD researchers and clinician scientists continue on the path to advancing understanding of autism in the decades to come.","Harrop, Clare; Bal, Vanessa; Carpenter, Kimberly; Halladay, Alycia",Autism research (Online),,178

Although staff are being supported through organisational provisions, facilitated by those in leadership roles, the emergence of mental health difficulties or the exacerbation of existing ones amongst these members of staff is a cause for concern. Acknowledging this, academics and healthcare professionals alike are calling for psychological support for frontline staff, which not only addresses distress during the initial phases of the outbreak but also over the months, if not years, that follow. Fortunately, mental health services and psychology professional bodies across the United Kingdom have issued guidance to meet these needs. An attempt has been made to translate these sets of guidance into clinical provisions via the recently established Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway delivered by Talk Changes (Hackney & City IAPT). This article describes the phased, stepped-care and evidence-based approach that has been adopted by the service to support local frontline NHS staff. We wish to share our service design and pathway of care with other IAPT services who may also seek to support hospital frontline staff within their associated NHS Trusts and in doing so, lay the foundations of a coordinated response.","Cole, C.

It allowed to calculate the air flow and aerosol droplets deposition in all bronchial branches up to alveolus. Human breathing was calculated using COVID-19 thermal helium-oxygen mixture treatment method. Breathing with a thermal helium-oxygen mixture requires less effort from the patient than breathing with air. Three-dimensional numerical calculations of air flow and aerosol droplets in human lungs have been performed. The characteristics of a serial medical nebulizer were used to calculate the deposition of aerosol droplets. It is shown that the number of past droplets depends (except for flow, droplet size) on the duration of breath.

We aimed to evaluate the changes of frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs, a population of cells with potent immunosuppressive capacity, in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was elevated in COVID-19 patients, particularly severe patients. A follow-up comparison revealed a decline of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs percentages in most patients 1 day after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were still greater than 50.0% in 3 ICU patients 4-10 days after negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Elevated frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was positively correlated with oropharyngeal viral loads and length of hospital stay, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte counts and serum albumin. Moreover, strong correlations were observed between the frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs and T cell subsets, NK cell counts, and B cell percentages. The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs could be used as a predictor of COVID-19 severity.

Making these decisions require comprehensive understanding of the dynamics by which the disease spreads. In traditional epidemiological models, individuals do not adapt their contact behavior during an epidemic, yet adaptive behavior is well documented (i.e., fear-induced social distancing). In this work we revisit Epstein’s “coupled contagion dynamics of fear and disease” model in order to extend and adapt it to explore fear-driven behavioral adaptations and their impact on efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion of contact behavior adaptation endows the resulting model with a rich dynamics that under certain conditions reproduce endogenously multiple waves of infection. We show that the model provides an appropriate test bed for different containment strategies such as: testing with contact tracing and travel restrictions. The results show that while both strategies could result in flattening the epidemic curve and a significant reduction of the maximum number of infected individuals;testing should be applied along with tracing previous contacts of the tested individuals to be effective. The results show how the curve is flattened with testing partnered with contact tracing, and the imposition of travel restrictions.","Rajabi, Amirarsalan Mantzaris Alexander V.; Mutlu, Ece C.; Garibay, Ozlem O.",Applied Sciences,,178

219192,COVID-19 and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,2020,"INTRODUCTION: There is limited data on the analytical performance of commercial nucleic acid tests (NATs) for laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal, combined nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was collected from persons with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and synthetic positive controls (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) were tested using i) AusDiagnostics assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd); ii) in-house developed assays targeting the E and RdRp genes; iii) multiplex PCR assay targeting endemic respiratory viruses. Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes. RESULTS: Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (nâ¯=â¯5), rhinovirus (nâ¯=â¯7), enterovirus (nâ¯=â¯5), influenza B (nâ¯=â¯4), hMPV (nâ¯=â¯5), influenza A (nâ¯=â¯2), PIV-2 (nâ¯=â¯1), RSV (nâ¯=â¯2), CoV-NL63 (nâ¯=â¯1) and CoV-229E (nâ¯=â¯1). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four additional samples by the AusDiagnostics assay. Using the in-house assays as the ""gold standard"", the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the AusDiagnostics assay was 100 %, 92.16 %, 55.56 % and 100 % respectively. The Ct values of the real-time in-house-developed PCR assay targeting the E gene was significantly lower than the corresponding RdRp gene assay when applied to clinical samples, viral culture and positive controls (mean 21.75 vs 28.1, pâ¯=â¯0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: The AusDiagnostics assay is not specific for the detection SARS-CoV-2. Any positive results should be confirmed using another NAT or sequencing.

220458,Case Series: Evidence of Borderzone Ischemia in Critically-Ill COVID-19 Patients Who “Do Not Wake Up”,2020,"The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is essential to viral attachment and the subsequent fusion process. Interfering with this event represents an attractive avenue for the development of therapeutics and vaccine development. Here, a hybrid approach of ligand- and structure-based virtual screening techniques were employed to disclose similar analogues of a reported antiviral phytochemical, glycyrrhizin, targeting the blockade of ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike. A ligand-based similarity search using a stringent cut-off revealed 40 FDA-approved compounds in DrugBank. These filtered hits were screened against ACE2 using a blind docking approach to determine the natural binding tendency of the compounds with ACE2. Three compounds, deslanoside, digitoxin, and digoxin, were reported to show strong binding with ACE2. These compounds bind at the H1-H2 binding pocket, in a manner similar to that of glycyrrhizin which was used as a control. To achieve consistency in the docking results, docking calculations were performed via two sets of docking software that predicted binding energy as ACE2-Deslanoside (AutoDock, -10.3 kcal/mol and DockThor, -9.53 kcal/mol), ACE2-Digitoxin (AutoDock, -10.6 kcal/mol and DockThor, -8.84 kcal/mol), and ACE2-Digoxin (AutoDock, -10.6 kcal/mol and DockThor, -8.81 kcal/mol). The docking results were validated by running molecular simulations in aqueous solution that demonstrated the stability of ACE2 with no major conformational changes in the ligand original binding mode (~ 2 Å average RMSD). Binding interactions remained quite stable with an increased potential for getting stronger as the simulation proceeded. MMGB/PBSA binding free energies were also estimated and these supported the high stability of the complexes compared to the control (~ -50 kcal/mol net MMGB/PBSA binding energy versus ~ -30 kcal/mol). Collectively, the data demonstrated that the compounds shortlisted in this study might be subjected to experimental evaluation to uncover their real blockade capacity of SARS-CoV-2 host ACE2 receptor.","Ahmad, Sajjad; Waheed, Yasir; Abro, Asma; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid; Ismail, Saba",J Mol Model,,178
221442,The Compensatory Protective Effects of Social Support at Work in Presenteeism During the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is characterised by a hyper activation of immune system that leads to multiorgan failure. It is suggested that excessive immune response in patients with COVID-19 could mimic this syndrome. Some COVID-19 autopsy studies have revealed the presence of haemophagocytosis images in bone marrow, raising the possibility, along with HScore parameters, of sHLH. AIM: Our objective is to ascertain the existence of sHLH in some patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We report the autopsy histological findings of 16 patients with COVID-19, focusing on the presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, obtained from rib squeeze and integrating these findings with HScore parameters. CD68 immunohistochemical stains were used to highlight histiocytes and haemophagocytic cells. Clinical evolution and laboratory parameters of patients were collected from electronic clinical records. RESULTS: Eleven patients (68.7%) displayed moderate histiocytic hyperplasia with haemophagocytosis (HHH) in bone marrow, three patients (18.7%) displayed severe HHH and the remainder were mild. All HScore parameters were collected in 10 patients (62.5%). Among the patients in which all parameters were evaluable, eight patients (80%) had an HScore >169. sHLH was not clinically suspected in any case. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the recommendation of some authors to use the HScore in patients with severe COVID-19 in order to identify those who could benefit from immunosuppressive therapies. The presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow tissue, despite not being a specific finding, has proved to be a very useful tool in our study to identify these patients.","Núñez-Torrón, Claudia; Ferrer-Gómez, Ana; Moreno Moreno, Esther; Pérez-Mies, Belen; Villarrubia, Jesús; Chamorro, Sandra; López-Jiménez, Javier; Palacios, J; Piris-Villaespesa, Miguel; García-Cosío, Mónica",J. clin. pathol,,178

An important feature of the labour markets in India, notwithstanding intersectionalities across segments, is greater access to high-quality work with social security benefits to the privileged sections of the society as compared to the socially oppressed sections, including women. The latter dominate in low-quality, less stable and insecure work in the informal sector.The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures have increased the vulnerability of the informal workers, including the migrant workers. The article analyses the features of rural and urban labour markets, prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, that had contributed to vulnerability of the workforce. The analysis was based on the National Statistical Office (NSO, 2020)?Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) database of 2018?2019, NSSO (2014)?Report of the Situation of Agricultural Households in India, NSSO (2014)?Employment and Unemployment Survey, Labour Bureau, and the Economic Survey of India. It also analyses the impacts of the pandemic on the rural labour market based on the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database. Our analysis reveals that the rural labour market in India was more adversely affected by the lockdown measures than the urban counterpart. In the rural areas, there was collapse of non-farm employment and increased participation in agricultural work was largely an outcome of distress. Furthermore, reverse migration of workers had led to sharp decline in remittances, particularly in the eastern Indian states that are largely agrarian and poor.

This review discuss how mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with defective immune response in aging and different age-related diseases, and with many of the comorbidities associated with poor prognosis in the progression of COVID-19. We suggest here that chronic inflammation caused by mitochondrial dysfunction is responsible of the explosive release of inflammatory cytokines causing severe pneumonia, multi-organ failure and finally death in COVID-19 patients.

233483,The Utility of High-Flow Nasal Oxygen for Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia in a Resource-Constrained Setting: A Multi-Centre Prospective Observational Study,2020,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak poses a serious public health risk. To date, the disease has affected almost all countries in the world. The enormous scale of the outbreak and the relative lack of knowledge and information regarding a new virus, as well as the unpredictability of events, make it challenging for leadership teams to respond. This paper shares how we have reconfigured our radiology leadership team into a smaller disease outbreak task force (DOTF) to respond and coordinate all related efforts during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The DOTF format is modelled after the military with domain groups looking at manpower, intelligence, operations, and logistics matters on a daily basis so that timely decisions can be made and action plans executed promptly. In managing the DOTF, discipline, flexibility, and teamwork are key principles, and these are built upon a strong foundation of focus on infection prevention and control, and patient and staff safety as well as staff well-being. The DOTF has positioned us well to confront the many challenges to date. We believe it will also help us navigate the complex issues that will arise with future surges in cases and in formulating strategies to manage exit from the present and future lockdowns. KEY POINTS: â¢ In a pandemic, regular and directed meetings by a smaller leadership core group are required, for prompt decision making and execution of action plans. â¢ The military format, with domain groups to look at manpower, intelligence, operations, and logistics matters, is useful in managing a pandemic. â¢ Discipline, flexibility, and teamwork with strong focus on infection prevention and control, and patient and staff safety as well as staff well-being are key principles for leadership teams managing a pandemic.","Tay, Kiang Hiong; Ooi, Chin Chin; Mahmood, Muhammad Illyyas Bin; Aw, Lian Ping; Chan, Lai Peng; Ng, David Chee Eng; Tan, Bien Soo",Eur. radiol,,178

We find that SIP orders reduced mobility nationally by 12 percentage points (95% CI: -13.1 to -10.9), however the effects varied substantially across states, from -35 percentage points to +11 percentage points. Larger reductions were observed in states with higher incomes, higher population density, lower Black resident share, and lower 2016 vote shares for Donald J. Trump.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a spine examination via video. METHODS: A total of 43 patients were recruited. Each participant underwent a video-based (VB) and a conventional face-to-face (FTF) spine examination. Pain intensity, active range of motion, inspection, a neurophysiologic basic exam and provocations tests were evaluated using video-based and face-to-face methods. RESULTS: The intra-rater reliability (IRR) was measured between both examinations. Good to very good IRR values were obtained in inspection (Kappa between 0,752 und 0,944), active range of motion and basic neurophysiological examination (Kappa between 0,659 und 0,969). Only moderate matches were found in specific provocation tests (Kappa between 0,407 und 0,938). A video-based spine examination is a reliable tool for measuring pain intensity, active range of motion and a basic neurophysiologic exam. CONCLUSION: A basic spine examination during a video consultation is possible. A good agreement of the test results between video-based and face-to-face examination could be found.","Jansen, Tom; Gathen, Martin; Touet, Amadeo; Goost, Hans; Wirtz, Dieter Christian; Burger, Christof; Pflugmacher, Robert; Welle, Kristian; Kabir, Koroush",Z Orthop Unfall,,178

251988,Correlation Between Adult Tobacco Smoking Prevalence and Mortality of Coronavirus Disease-19 Across the World,2020,"Many countries have been implementing various control measures with different strictness levels to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from spreading. With the great reduction in human mobility and daily activities, considerable impacts have been imposed on the global air transportation industry. This study applies a hybrid SARIMA-based intervention model to measure the differences in the impacts of different control measures implemented in China, the U.S. and Singapore on air passenger and air freight traffic. To explore the effect of time span for the measures to be in force, two scenarios are invented, namely a long-term intervention and a short-term intervention, and predictions are made till the end of 2020 for all three countries under both scenarios. As a result, predictive patterns of the selected metrics for the three countries are rather different. China is predicted to have the mildest economic impact on the air transportation industry in this year in terms of air passenger revenue and air cargo traffic, provided that the control measures were prompt and effective. The U.S. would suffer from a far-reaching impact on the industry if the same control measures are maintained. More uncertainties are found for Singapore, as it is strongly associated with international travel demands. Suggestions are made for the three countries and the rest of the world on how to seek a balance between the strictness of control measures and the potential long-term industrial losses.","Meng, Fanyu; Gong, Wenwu; Liang, Jun; Li, Xian; Zeng, Yiping; Yang, Lili",PLoS One,,178
252261,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of renin-angiotensin system drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes: What is the evidence so far?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the closure or partial closure of international borders in almost all countries. Here we investigate the efficacy of imported case detection considering quarantine length and different testing measures for travellers on arrival. METHODS: We examine 8 broad border control strategies from utilising quarantine alone, pretesting, entry and exit testing, and testing during quarantine. In comparing the efficacy of these strategies, we calculate the probability of detecting travellers who have been infected up to 2 weeks pre-departure according to their estimated incubation and infectious period. We estimate the number of undetected infected travelers permitted entry for these strategies across a prevalence range of 0.1%-2% per million travelers. RESULTS: At 14-day quarantine, on average 2.2% (Range: 0.5%-8.2%) of imported infections are missed across the strategies, leading to 22 (5-82) imported cases at 0.1% prevalence per million travellers, increasing up to 430 (106-1641) at 2%. The strategy utilising exit testing results in 3.9% (3.1%-4.9%) of imported cases being missed at 7-day quarantine, down to 0.4% (0.3%-0.7%) at 21-day quarantine, and the introduction of daily testing, as the most risk averse strategy, reduces the proportion further to 2.5%-4.2% at day 7 and 0.1-0.2% at day 21 dependent on the tests used. Rapid antigen testing every 3 days in quarantine leads to 3% being missed at 7 days and 0.7% at 14 days, which is comparable to PCR testing with a 24-hour turnaround. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory testing, at a minimal of pre-testing and on arrival, is strongly recommended where the length of quarantining should then be determined by the destination country's level of risk averseness, pandemic preparedness and origin of travellers. Repeated testing during quarantining should also be utilised to mitigate case importation risk and reduce the quarantining duration required.","Dickens, Borame L; Koo, Joel R; Lim, Jue Tao; Park, Minah; Sun, Haoyang; Sun, Yinxiaohe; Zeng, Zitong; Quaye, Sharon Esi Duoduwa; Clapham, Hannah E; Wee, Hwee Lin; Cook, Alex R",J. travel med,,178

To provide an answer, a ""new normality"" scenario is built, comprising the structural changes likely to take place in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic. To develop such scenario, two intermediate steps are necessary, in both cases relying on the use of the latest generation of the MAcroeconomic, Sectoral, Social, Territorial (MASST4) model. First, short-run costs of the COVID-induced lockdowns, in terms of missed GDP, are calculated for all European NUTS2 regions, needed because of the lack of short-run statistics about the extent of the regional costs caused by the lockdowns that will only appear in 2 years. Second, a long-run simulation of the economic rebound expected to take place from 2021 through 2030 is presented, assuming, among other trends, that no further national lockdowns will be undertaken in European countries. In the ""new normality"" scenario, regional disparity trends will decrease as a result of a decisive rebound of those countries mostly hit by the pandemic.","Capello, Roberta; Caragliu, Andrea",Journal of regional science,,178

Aim was to investigate whether subpopulations of platelets were programmed to procoagulant and inflammatory activities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with pneumonia, without comorbidities predisposing to thromboembolism. Approach and Results: Overall, 37 patients and 28 healthy subjects were studied. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates, platelet-derived microvesicles, the expression of P-selectin, and active fibrinogen receptor on platelets were quantified by flow cytometry. The profile of 45 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors released by platelets was defined by immunoassay. The contribution of platelets to coagulation factor activity was selectively measured. Numerous platelet-monocyte (mean±SE, 67.9±4.9%, n=17 versus 19.4±3.0%, n=22; P<0.0001) and platelet-granulocyte conjugates (34.2±4.04% versus 8.6±0.7%; P<0.0001) were detected in patients. Resting patient platelets had similar levels of P-selectin (10.9±2.6%, n=12) to collagen-activated control platelets (8.7±1.5%), which was not further increased by collagen activation on patient platelets (12.4±2.5%, P=nonsignificant). The agonist-stimulated expression of the active fibrinogen receptor was reduced by 60% in patients (P<0.0001 versus controls). Cytokines (IL [interleukin]-1&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IL, 17, IL-27, IFN [interferon]-&#945;, and IFN-Î³), chemokines (MCP-1/CCL2 [monocyte chemoattractant protein 1]), and growth factors (VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor]-A/D) were released in significantly larger amounts upon stimulation of COVID-19 platelets. Platelets contributed to increased fibrinogen, VWF (von Willebrand factor), and factor XII in COVID-19 patients. Patients (28.5±0.7 s, n=32), unlike controls (31.6±0.5 s, n=28; P<0.001), showed accelerated factor XII-dependent coagulation.

Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can provide an important treatment option to fight COVID-19, especially for the most vulnerable populations. In this work, potent antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were identified from COVID-19 convalescent patients. Among them, P4A1 interacts directly with and covers majority of the Receptor Binding Motif of the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain, shown by high-resolution complex structure analysis. We further demonstrate the binding and neutralizing activities of P4A1 against wild type and mutant Spike proteins or pseudoviruses. P4A1 was subsequently engineered to reduce the potential risk for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of infection and to extend its half-life. The engineered antibody exhibits an optimized pharmacokinetic and safety profile, and it results in complete viral clearance in a rhesus monkey model of COVID-19 following a single injection. These data suggest its potential against SARS-CoV-2 related diseases.","Guo, Yu; Huang, Lisu; Zhang, Guangshun; Yao, Yanfeng; Zhou, He; Shen, Shu; Shen, Bingqing; Li, Bo; Li, Xin; Zhang, Qian; Chen, Mingjie; Chen, Da; Wu, Jia; Fu, Dan; Zeng, Xinxin; Feng, Mingfang; Pi, Chunjiang; Wang, Yuan; Zhou, Xingdong; Lu, Minmin; Li, Yarong; Fang, Yaohui; Lu, Yun-Yueh; Hu, Xue; Wang, Shanshan; Zhang, Wanju; Gao, Ge; Adrian, Francisco; Wang, Qisheng; Yu, Feng; Peng, Yun; Gabibov, Alexander G; Min, Juan; Wang, Yuhui; Huang, Heyu; Stepanov, Alexey; Zhang, Wei; Cai, Yan; Liu, Junwei; Yuan, Zhiming; Zhang, Chen; Lou, Zhiyong; Deng, Fei; Zhang, Hongkai; Shan, Chao; Schweizer, Liang; Sun, Kun; Rao, Zihe",Nat Commun,,178

257441,Switching warfarin patients to a direct oral anticoagulant during the Coronavirus Disease-19 pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hit Italy early and strongly, challenging the whole health care system. Proctological patients and surgeons are experiencing a previously unseen change in care with unknown repercussion. Here we discuss the proctological experience of 4 Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Following remote brainstorming, the authors summarised their experience in managing proctological patients during the COVID-19 pandemics and put forward some practical observations to further investigate. RESULTS: The 4 hospitals shifted from a high-volume proctological activity to almost ""zero"" visits and surgery. Every patient accessing the hospital must respect a specific COVID-19 protocol. Proctological patients can be stratified based on presentation and management considerations into (1) neoplastic patients, the only allowed to be surgically treated, (2) the ones requiring urgent care, operated only in highly selected cases and (3) the stable, already known patients, managed remotely. Changes in the clinical management of the proctological disease are presented together with some considerations to be explored. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of scientific evidence, these practical considerations may be valuable to proctological surgeons starting to face the COVID-19 pandemics. Beside the more clinical considerations, this crisis produced unexpected consequences such as an improvement of the therapeutic alliance and a shift towards telemedicine that may be worth exploring also in the post-COVID-19 era.","Mascagni, Domenico; Eberspacher, Chiara; Mascagni, Pietro; Arezzo, Alberto; Selvaggi, Francesco; Sturiale, Alessandro; Milito, Giovanni; Naldini, Gabriele",Int J Colorectal Dis,,178
257999,Reduced adiponectin levels in patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure: A case-control study,2021,"Species living in extremely cold environments resist the freezing conditions through antifreeze proteins (AFPs). Apart from being essential proteins for various organisms living in sub-zero temperatures, AFPs have numerous applications in different industries. They possess very small resemblance to each other and cannot be easily identified using simple search algorithms such as BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Diverse AFPs found in fishes (Type I, II, III, IV and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs)), are sub-types and show low sequence and structural similarity, making their accurate prediction challenging. Although several machine-learning methods have been proposed for the classification of AFPs, prediction methods that have greater reliability are required. In this paper, we propose a novel machine-learning-based approach for the prediction of AFP sequences using latent space learning through a deep auto-encoder method. For latent space pruning, we use the output of the auto-encoder with a deep neural network classifier to learn the non-linear mapping of the protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods, yielding excellent results in comparison. A comprehensive ablation study is performed, and the proposed method is evaluated in terms of widely used performance measures. In particular, the proposed method demonstrated a high Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.52, F-score of 0.49, and Youden's index of 0.81 on an independent test dataset, thereby outperforming the existing methods for AFP prediction.","Usman, Muhammad; Khan, Shujaat; Lee, Jeong-A",Sci Rep,,178

This study describes variation in vaccination coverage by sociodemographic characteristics between December 2020 and August 2021. MethodsUsing population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census, we estimated monthly first dose vaccination rates by age group and sociodemographic characteristics amongst adults aged 18 years or over in England. We also present a tool to display the results interactively. FindingsOur study population included 35,223,466 adults. A lower percentage of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups. Vaccination rates were highest among individuals of White British and Indian ethnic backgrounds and lowest among Black Africans (aged [≥]80 years) and Black Caribbeans (18-79 years). Differences by ethnic group emerged as soon as vaccination roll-out commenced and widened over time. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socio-economic group, and had fewer qualifications. InterpretationWe found inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination rates by sex, ethnicity, religion, area deprivation, disability status, English language proficiency, socio-economic position, and educational attainment, but some of these differences varied by age group. Research is urgently needed to understand why these inequalities exist and how they can be addressed. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for publications on sociodemographic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Several studies have reported differences in coverage by characteristics such as ethnicity and religion, however these have focused on older adults and the clinically vulnerable who were initially prioritized for vaccination. There is little evidence on sociodemographic inequalities in vaccination coverage among younger adults and evidence is also lacking on coverage by a wider range of characteristics such as sex, disability status, English language proficiency, socio-economic position, and educational attainment. Added value of this studyThis study provides the first evidence for sociodemographic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage among the entire adult population in England, using population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census. By disaggregating the data by age group, we were able to show that disparities in coverage by some sociodemographic characteristics differed by age group. For example, a lower proportion of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups, and vaccination rates were lowest among Black Africans in those aged [≥]80 years but lowest among Black Caribbeans for all other age groups. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socio-economic group, and had fewer qualifications. Implications of all the available evidenceMany of the groups with the lowest rates of COVID-19 vaccination are also the groups that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including severe illness and mortality. Research is urgently needed to understand why these disparities exist and how they can be addressed, for example through public health or community engagement programmes. Since the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination coverage may differ by age group, it is important for future research to disaggregate by age group when examining these inequalities.","Dolby, Ted; Finning, Katie; Baker, Allan; Dowd, Leigh; Khunti, Kamlesh; Razieh, Cameron; Yates, Thomas; Nafilyan, Vahe",,,178

However, there is a lack of COVID-19 adjusted case fatality risk (aCFR) estimates and information on states with high aCFR. Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in the first pandemic wave and 17 state-specific geodemographic, socio-economic, health and comorbidity-related factors were collected. State-specific aCFRs were estimated, using a 13-day lag for fatality. To estimate country-level aCFR in the first wave, state estimates were meta-analysed based on inverse-variance weighting and aCFR as either a fixed- or random-effect. Multiple correspondence analyses, followed by univariable logistic regression, were conducted to understand the association between aCFR and geodemographic, health and social indicators. Based on health indicators, states likely to report a higher aCFR were identified. Using random- and fixed-effects models, cumulative aCFRs in the first pandemic wave on 27 July 2020 in India were 1.42% (95% CI 1.19%–1.70%) and 2.97% (95% CI 2.94%–3.00%), respectively. At the end of the first wave, as of 15 February 2021, a cumulative aCFR of 1.18% (95% CI 0.99%–1.41%) using random and 1.64% (95% CI 1.64%–1.65%) using fixed-effects models was estimated. Based on high heterogeneity among states, we inferred that the random-effects model likely provided more accurate estimates of the aCFR for India. The aCFR was grouped with the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and acute respiratory infections in the first and second dimensions of multiple correspondence analyses. Univariable logistic regression confirmed associations between the aCFR and the proportion of urban population, and between aCFR and the number of persons diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and stroke per 10,000 population that had visited NCD (Non-communicable disease) clinics. Incidence of pneumonia was also associated with COVID-19 aCFR. Based on predictor variables, we categorised 10, 17 and one Indian state(s) expected to have a high, medium and low aCFR risk, respectively. The current study demonstrated the value of using meta-analysis to estimate aCFR. To decrease COVID-19 associated fatalities, states estimated to have a high aCFR must take steps to reduce co-morbidities.","Singh, Balbir B.; Ward, Michael P.; Lowerison, Mark Lewinson Ryan T.; Vallerand, Isabelle A.; Deardon, Rob Gill Jatinder P.

271261,Addendum: Early triage of critically ill COVID-19 patients using deep learning,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid switch from undergraduate classroom teaching to online-teaching; a challenging process for teachers and students. Based on a recent online survey among German pediatric university hospitals the ""AG Lehre der DGKJ"" (teaching working group of the German Society of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine) summarizes latest experiences with e­learning during the summer term of 2020. The survey participants from 17 pediatric university hospitals report that the large spectrum of e­learning formats could sufficiently replace classical lectures and seminars but could not fully replace teaching involving direct contact to patients. The introduction of new digital teaching formats is time-consuming, needs high-quality IT infrastructure, should be embedded in a continuous curriculum and provide the possibility of regular exchange between students and teachers. Teachers should be provided with the opportunity for training in didactic methods and IT skills. These results correspond to the literature on e­learning in general and undergraduate medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. The experiences summarized here should not only facilitate the development of e­learning tools during the ongoing pandemic but also stimulate to establish e­learning as a valuable component of future pediatric medical education. New digital substitutes for teaching involving pediatric patients need to be developed.The statement was drafted by consensus by the German Society of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Working Group on Teaching and approved by the DGKJ board.","Häusler, Martin; Bosse, Hans Martin; Fischbach, Thomas; Graf, Norbert; von Kleist-Retzow, Jürgen-Christoph; Kreuder, Joachim",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,178
272159,Coronavirus Disease 19 from the Perspective of Ageing with Focus on Nutritional Status and Nutrition Management-A Narrative Review,2021,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT As COVID-19 reached pandemic status, in-person orthopedic clinics across the United States were forced to close as many states adopted stay-at-home orders. Previously, the use of telemedicine in orthopedic practices was minimal for a variety of reasons, one being the inability to perform a physical exam in a specialty reliant on direct patient contact for diagnosis and treatment. PURPOSE To evaluate the administration of a novel virtual physical exam for evaluation of spine patients in the telehealth setting. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Prospective consecutive cohort at a large academic spine center. METHODS A prospective cohort of 52 patients consented to participating in a novel virtual physical exam protocol during routine telemedicine visits at a large, tertiary orthopedic spine practice. Participants were asked to perform a series of carefully designed physical maneuvers using readily available household objects to allow their provider to better assess sensory and motor function in the telemedicine setting. Patients were then asked to complete a short satisfaction survey. RESULTS In total, 52 patients completed the physical exam and survey. Males and females were distributed evenly among the cohort at 50%. The average age was 52.1 +/- 15.5 years. The average score for ease of understanding the exam (1 = easiest, 5 = hardest) was 1.1 while the average score for ease of performance was 1.5. There were 97.56% of participants who felt their provider was better able to understand their condition using the virtual exam findings. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the utility of a virtual physical exam for assessment of spine patients in the telemedicine setting. Furthermore, this study illustrates the ease with which such an exam can implemented and performed to improve patient evaluation and satisfaction.

272875,The cardiovascular burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a focus on congenital heart disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) have been used in management of severe Covid-19. Here in this study, we report our single-center experience regarding IVIg treatment in management of severe Covid-19. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Among hospitalized adult Covid-19 patients between April 1 and December 31, 2020, patients with confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 who had Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale score &#8805; 3, hyperinflammation and received IVIg treatment in addition to standard of care were retrospectively investigated. We grouped IVIg recipients into three according to reasons for IVIg administration: Group 1 patients requiring anti-inflammatory treatment but complicated with secondary infection and/or sepsis , group 2 patients with Covid-19 related complications including progressive disease refractory to other anti-inflammatory agents, myocarditis, adult multisystem inflammatory syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohystiocytosis like syndrome and group 3 patients with other complications non-specific to Covid-19. Mortality and clinical data was compared among groups. RESULTS: A total of 46 IVIg recipients were enrolled. Group 1 comprised 17 (36.9%), group 2 comprised 18 (39.1%) and group 3 comprised 11 (23.9%) patients. No significant differences in means of age, gender and comorbidities were observed among groups. Mortality was significantly lower in group 3 when compared to group 1 (64.7% vs 18.2%, p = 0.016) and close to significance when compared to group 2 (50% vs 18.2% p = 0.087).

272876,The cardiovascular burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a focus on congenital heart disease,2020,"This commentary draws on sub-Saharan African health researchers' accounts of their countries' responses to control the spread of COVID-19, including social and health impacts, home-grown solutions, and gaps in knowledge. Limited human and material resources for infection control and lack of understanding or appreciation by the government of the realities of vulnerable populations have contributed to failed interventions to curb transmission, and further deepened inequalities. Some governments have adapted or limited lockdowns due to the negative impacts on livelihoods and taken specific measures to minimize the impact on the most vulnerable citizens. However, these measures may not reach the majority of the poor. Yet, African countries' responses to COVID-19 have also included a range of innovations, including diversification of local businesses to produce personal protective equipment, disinfectants, test kits, etc., which may expand domestic manufacturing capabilities and deepen self-reliance.

This work extends the results presented in the 2013 and 2015 \Planck/LFI Calibration Papers, based on the data acquired in 2009--2011. Planck observed each planet up to eight times during the nominal mission. We processed time-ordered data from the 22 LFI radiometers to derive planet antenna temperatures for each planet and transit. We accounted for the beam shape and radiometer bandpasses, as well as several systematic effects. We compared our results with WMAP's 9th-year results, Planck/HFI observations, and existing data and models for planetary microwave emissivity. For Jupiter, we obtained Tb = 144.9, 159.8, 170.5 K (pm 0.2 K at 1 sigma, with temperatures expressed using the Rayleigh-Jeans scale) respectively at 30, 44 and 70 GHz, or equivalently a band averaged Planck temperature TbBA=144.7, 160.3, 171.2 K in good agreement with WMAP and existing models. A slight excess at 30 GHz with respect to models is interpreted as an effect of synchrotron emission. Our measures for Saturn agree with WMAP having for rings Tb = 9.2 pm 1.4, 12.6 pm 2.3, 16.2 pm 0.8 K, while for disk we obtained Tb = 140.0 pm 1.4, 147.2 pm 1.2, 150.2 pm 0.4 K, or equivalently a TbBA=139.7, 147.8, 151.0 K. Measures for Uranus (Tb = 152 pm 6, 145 pm 3, 132 pm 2 K, or TbBA=152, 145, 133 K) and Neptune Tb = 154 pm 11, 148 pm 9, 128 pm 3 K, or TbBA=154, 149, 128 K are well in agreement with WMAP and previous data in literature.","Maris, Michele; Romelli, Erik; Tomasi, Maurizio; Gregorio, Anna; Sandri, Maura; Galeotta, Samuele; Tavagnacco, Daniele; Frailis, Marco; Maggio, Gianmarco; Zacchei, Andrea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04504v1.pdf,178
277503,Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo) for patients with covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many commonly used drugs can prolong the QTc interval (QTc), which can lead to potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. In the current era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is worth mentioning that the disease itself and several drugs used for its treatment have been associated with QTc prolongation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the agreement and clinical precision of a portable single-lead ECG device to measure the QTc interval compared to the standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS: In sequential tests, QTc of ECG recordings obtained with the device KardiaMobile (KM-1L) (AliveCor®) were compared to QTc obtained with conventional 12-lead ECG. Agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and the Lin's concordance coefficient. Consistency between the two devices in determining QTc prolongation (QTc &#8805;470 ms in males, or &#8805;480 ms in females), was evaluated with kappa statistics. RESULTS: 128 patients with a presumed or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to a University Hospital were included. QTc intervals measured with KM were similar to QTc measured with conventional ECG (442.45±40.5 vs. 441.65±40.3 ms, p:0.15). Bland-Altman analysis showed no significant difference in QTc values (average difference of -0.797, 95% Limits Of Agreement:-13.179;11.585). Lin's concordance coefficient showed an excellent agreement (0.988, p<0.001). Concordance between the two devices for determining QTc prolongation was excellent (Kappa>0.90). CONCLUSION: ECG recordings obtained with KM-1L allow an accurate QTc interval assessment. Considering its simplicity of use, this approach has advantages over conventional ECG and can provide an alternative for the evaluation of QTc in hospitalized patients, during the current time of pandemic by COVID-19 and beyond.","Marin O, María Mónica; García P, Ángel Alberto; Muñoz V, Oscar Mauricio; Castellanos R, Julio César; Cáceres M, Edward; Pacheco, David Santacruz",,,178
280728,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Immunity Booster Green Foods: A Mini Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Individuals admitted to hospital for COVID-19 might have persisting symptoms (so-called long COVID) and delayed complications after discharge. However, little is known regarding the risk for those not admitted to hospital. We therefore examined prescription drug and health-care use after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using the Danish prescription, patient, and health insurance registries. All individuals with a positive or negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark between Feb 27 and May 31, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest were delayed acute complications, chronic disease, hospital visits due to persisting symptoms, and prescription drug use. We used data from non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2-positive and matched SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals from 2 weeks to 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 test to obtain propensity score-weighted risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for initiation of 14 drug groups and 27 hospital diagnoses indicative of potential post-acute effects. We also calculated prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall health-care use. This study is registered in the EU Electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EUPAS37658). FINDINGS: 10 498 eligible individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark from Feb 27 to May 31, 2020, of whom 8983 (85·6%) were alive and not admitted to hospital 2 weeks after their positive test. The matched SARS-CoV-2-negative reference population not admitted to hospital consisted of 80 894 individuals. Compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were not at an increased risk of initiating new drugs (RD <0·1%) except bronchodilating agents, specifically short-acting ß2-agonists (117 [1·7%] of 6935 positive individuals vs 743 [1·3%] of 57 206 negative individuals; RD +0·4% [95% CI 0·1-0·7]; RR 1·32 [1·09-1·60]) and triptans (33 [0·4%] of 8292 vs 198 [0·3%] of 72 828; RD +0·1% [0·0-0·3]; RR 1·55 [1·07-2·25]). There was an increased risk of receiving hospital diagnoses of dyspnoea (103 [1·2%] of 8676 vs 499 [0·7%] of 76 728; RD +0·6% [0·4-0·8]; RR 2·00 [1·62-2·48]) and venous thromboembolism (20 [0·2%] of 8785 vs 110 [0·1%] of 78 872; RD +0·1% [0·0-0·2]; RR 1·77 [1·09-2·86]) for SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with negative individuals, but no increased risk of other diagnoses. Prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall general practitioner visits (1·18 [95% CI 1·15-1·22]) and outpatient hospital visits (1·10 [1·05-1·16]), but not hospital admission, showed increases among SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. INTERPRETATION: The absolute risk of severe post-acute complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission is low. However, increases in visits to general practitioners and outpatient hospital visits could indicate COVID-19 sequelae.

However, the challenge remains to distinguish COVID-19 in the complex scenario of multi-type pneumonia classification and improve the overall diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose a novel periphery-aware COVID-19 diagnosis approach with contrastive representation enhancement to identify COVID-19 from influenza-A (H1N1) viral pneumonia, community acquired pneumonia (CAP), and healthy subjects using chest CT images. Our key contributions include: 1) an unsupervised Periphery-aware Spatial Prediction (PSP) task which is designed to introduce important spatial patterns into deep networks; 2) an adaptive Contrastive Repre-sentation Enhancement (CRE) mechanism which can effectively capture the intra-class similarity and inter-class difference of various types of pneumonia. We integrate PSP and CRE to obtain the representations which are highly discriminative in COVID-19 screening. We evaluate our approach comprehensively on our constructed large-scale dataset and two public datasets. Extensive experiments on both volume-level and slice-level CT images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with PSP and CRE for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Hou, Junlin; Xu, Jilan; Jiang, Longquan; Du, Shanshan; Feng, Rui; Zhang, Yuejie; Shan, Fei; Xue, Xiangyang",Pattern Recognit,,178

One of the striking targets amongst all the proteins in coronavirus is the main protease (Mpro), as it plays vital biological roles in replication and maturation of the virus, and hence the potential target. The aim of this study is to repurpose the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved molecules via computer-aided drug designing against Mpro (PDB ID: 6Y2F) of SARS CoV-2 due to its high x-ray resolution of 1.95 Å as compared to other published Mprostructures. High Through Virtual Screening (HTVS) of 2456 FDA approved drugs using structure-based docking were analyzed. Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed to check the overall structural stability (RMSD), C&#945; fluctuations (RMSF) and protein-ligand interactions. Further, trajectory analysis was performed to assess the binding quality by exploiting the protein-residue motion cross correlation (DCCM) and binding free energy (MM/GBSA). Tenofovir, an antiretroviral for HIV-proteases and Terlipressin, a vasoconstrictor show stable RMSD, RMSF, better MM/GBSA with good cross correlation as compared to the Apo and O6K. Moreover, the results show concurrence with Nelfinavir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir which have shown significant inhibition in in vitro studies. Therefore, we conclude that Tenofovir and Terlipresssin might also show protease inhibition but are still open to clinical validation in case of SARS-CoV 2 treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

History of solid organ transplant, pre-existing renal impairment, asthma and an elevated D-dimer were identified as established risk factors for severe COVID-19. Supportive management was provided, baseline immunosuppression with everolimus was continued, and oral prednisolone was increased. A complete recovery was observed. Given the favourable outcome despite risk factors for severe COVID-19, we identify and review the potential mitigating roles of immunosuppression and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in this disease. Further investigation is required to establish whether mTOR inhibitors could be used as therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19, or as alternative immunosuppression implemented early in the COVID-19 disease course.","Heron, Vanessa C; Bach, Cindy-Anne T; Holmes, Natasha E; Whitlam, John B",BMJ case reports,,178

291858,A potentially effective treatment for COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma therapy in treating severe infectious disease,2020,"Background. The hyperinflammation seen as part of a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in its most severe form leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure and death. Corticosteroid therapy targets this hyperinflammation, otherwise known as a cytokine storm. It is the only therapeutic agent to date with a mortality benefit, with clear guidelines from national and international health authorities guiding its use. Objectives. To compare severity-of-illness indices, survival, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and potential ICU complications in patients treated with different corticosteroid regimens (high-dose hydrocortisone, high-dose methylprednisolone and lower-dose dexamethasone). Methods. In this single-centre descriptive retrospective observational study of a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to a COVID-dedicated ICU, we compared patients treated with the three different corticosteroid regimens. Results. In 242 cases we could not demonstrate any statistically or clinically significant difference in the outcome of patients with critical COVID-19 treated with high-dose intravenous hydrocortisone (n=88) or methylprednisolone (n=46) compared with a relatively lower dose of dexamethasone (n=108). The survival rates were 38.6%, 39.1% and 33.3%, respectively (p=0.68). Patients treated with methylprednisolone tended to have a shorter length of ICU stay (median (interquartile range) 6 (4 - 10), 4 (2 - 8) and 5 (2 - 8) days;p=0.015) and fewer episodes of nosocomial sepsis (47.7%, 32.6% and 48.1%;p=0.01). Conclusions. Hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone can be given as an alternative to dexamethasone in the management of critical COVID-19, and this is a feasible alternative, especially in resource-constrained settings.","du Plessis, E.

In the first regime the proportion of infected is very low, and the proportion of susceptible is very close to 100the proportion of infected is moderate, but not negligible. We show that the first regime corresponds almost exactly to a well-known problem in finance, the problem of portfolio and consumption decisions under mean-reverting returns (Wachter, JFQA 2002), for which the optimal control has an analytical solution. We develop a perturbative solution for the second problem.

For the optimal provision of early intervention, professionals in the field are required to have specialised knowledge and skills in implementing these programmes. In the context of South Africa, there is evidence to suggest that therapists are ill-prepared to handle the unique challenges posed in neonatal intensive care units and wards with at-risk infants in the first few weeks of life. This is attributed to several reasons; however, irrespective of the causative factors, the need to bridge this knowledge-to-practice gap remains essential. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a multimethod stakeholder-driven study using a scoping review followed by an appreciative inquiry and Delphi process that will aid in the development, implementation and evaluation of a knowledge translation intervention to bridge knowledge-gaps in occupational and physiotherapists working in the field. Therapists currently working in the public health sector will be recruited for participation in the various stages of the study. The analysis will occur via thematic analysis for qualitative data and percentages and frequencies for descriptive quantitative data. Issues around trustworthiness and rigour, and reliability and validity, will be ensured within each of the phases, by use of a content validity index and inter-rater reliability for the Delphi survey; thick descriptions, peer debriefing, member checking and an audit trail for the qualitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received full ethical approval from the Health Research and Knowledge Management Directorate of the Department of Health and a Biomedical Research Ethics Committee.

Characterized by and associated with early and deleteriously enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by respiratory epithelial cells, severe COVID-19 illness has the potential to inflict acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Due to the fast spreading nature of COVID-19 and the current lack of a vaccine or specific pharmaceutical treatments, understanding of viral pathogenesis, behavioral prophylaxis, and mitigation tactics are of great public health concern. This review article outlines the immune response to viral pathogens, and due to the novelty of COVID-19 and the large body of evidence suggesting the respiratory and immune benefits from regular moderate intensity exercise, provides observational and mechanistic evidence from research on other viral infections that suggests strategically planned exercise regimens may help reduce susceptibility to infection, while also mitigating severe immune responses to infection commonly associated with poor COVID-19 prognosis. We propose that regular moderate intensity exercise should be considered as part of a combinatorial approach including widespread hygiene initiatives, properly planned and well-executed social distancing policies, and use of efficacious facial coverings like N95 respirators. Studies discerning COVID-19 pathogenesis mechanisms, transfer dynamics, and individual responses to pharmaceutical and adjunct treatments are needed to reduce viral transmission and bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hutchinson, Noah T.; Steelman, Andrew; Woods, Jeffrey A.",Sports Med.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished via ACE-2 receptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection coactivates both innate and adaptive immune responses. Although SARS-CoV-2 stimulates antibody production with a typical pattern of IgM/IgG, cellular immunity is also impaired. In severe cases, low CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts are associated with impaired immune functions, and high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios accompanying low lymphocyte subsets have been demonstrated. Recently, high IFN -&#945;/Î³ ratios with impaired T cell responses, and increased IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-4, IL-10 have been reported in COVID-19 infection. Increased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with severe COVID-19 may cause the suppression of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and regulatory T cells, causing excessive inflammatory responses and fatal cytokine storm with tissue and organ damage. Consequently, novel therapeutics to be developed against host immune system, including blockade of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, IFN) themselves, their receptors or signaling pathways- JAK inhibitors- could be effective as potential therapeutics.","Tascioglu, Didem; Akkaya, Emre; Genc, Sema",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,,178

308038,Combined effect of Controlling Nutritional Status and Acute Kidney Injury on severe COVID-19 short-term outcomes,2021,"Background: Childhood immunisation services have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO recommends considering outbreak risk using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether to conduct preventive vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. Methods: We used two to three models per infection to estimate the health impact of 50% reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 and delay of campaign vaccination from 2020 to 2021 for measles vaccination in Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan, for meningococcal A vaccination in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, and for yellow fever vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Our counterfactual comparative scenario was sustaining immunisation services at coverage projections made prior to COVID-19 (i.e. without any disruption). Results: Reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 without catch-up vaccination may lead to an increase in measles and yellow fever disease burden in the modelled countries. Delaying planned campaigns in Ethiopia and Nigeria by a year may significantly increase the risk of measles outbreaks (both countries did complete their supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) planned for 2020). For yellow fever vaccination, delay in campaigns leads to a potential disease burden rise of >1 death per 100,000 people per year until the campaigns are implemented. For meningococcal A vaccination, short-term disruptions in 2020 are unlikely to have a significant impact due to the persistence of direct and indirect benefits from past introductory campaigns of the 1- to 29-year-old population, bolstered by inclusion of the vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule accompanied by further catch-up campaigns. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19-related disruption to vaccination programs varies between infections and countries. Planning and implementation of campaigns should consider country and infection-specific epidemiological factors and local immunity gaps worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic when prioritising vaccines and strategies for catch-up vaccination.

A mediation analysis was conducted using cross-sectional U.S. survey data collected between March 27 and 30, 2020, to elucidate how individuals' trust in health experts and White House leadership, their perceptions of susceptibility and severity to COVID-19, and perceived benefits of protecting against COVID-19, influenced their uptake of recommended protective actions. Trust in health experts was associated with greater perceived severity of COVID-19 and benefits of taking action, which led to greater uptake of recommended actions. Trust in White House leadership was associated with lower perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 and was not associated with taking recommended actions. Having trust in health experts is a greater predictor of individuals' uptake of protective actions than having trust in White House leadership.

There is a need to identify empirically supported strategies to increase uptake, especially among young adults as this subpopulation has shown relatively poor adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Social norms - estimates of peers' behavior and attitudes - are robust predictors of health behaviors and norms-based intervention strategies may increase COVID vaccine uptake, once available. This study examined the extent that vaccination intentions and attitudes were associated with estimated social norms as an initial proof-of-concept test. METHOD: In November of 2020, 647 undergraduate students (46.21% response rate) completed online surveys in which they reported intentions to get COVID and influenza vaccines, perceived importance of these vaccines for young adults, and estimated social norms regarding peers' vaccination behaviors and attitudes. RESULTS: Students reported significantly greater intentions to get a COVID vaccine (91.64%) than an influenza vaccine (76.04%), and perceived COVID vaccination as significantly more important than influenza vaccination. The sample generally held strong intentions to receive a COVID vaccine and thought that doing so was of high importance, but participants, on average, perceived that other young adults would be less likely to be vaccinated and would not think vaccination was as important. Multiple regression models indicated that estimated social norms were positively associated with participants' own intentions and perceived importance of getting a COVID vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These significant associations highlight the potential value in developing and testing norms-based intervention strategies, such as personalized normative feedback, to improve uptake of forthcoming COVID vaccines among young adults.","Graupensperger, Scott; Abdallah, Devon A; Lee, Christine M",Vaccine,,178

This began the largest global testing programme in history, in which hundreds of millions of individuals have been tested to date. The unprecedented scale of testing has driven innovation in the strategies, technologies and concepts that govern testing in public health. This Review describes the changing role of testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the use of genomic surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 transmission around the world, the use of contact tracing to contain disease outbreaks and testing for the presence of the virus circulating in the environment. Despite these efforts, widespread community transmission has become entrenched in many countries and has required the testing of populations to identify and isolate infected individuals, many of whom are asymptomatic. The diagnostic and epidemiological principles that underpin such population-scale testing are also considered, as are the high-throughput and point-of-care technologies that make testing feasible on a massive scale.","Mercer, Tim R; Salit, Marc",Nat. rev. genet,,178

METHODS: Long-term care pharmacy data from 1,944 U.S. NHs were used to evaluate trends in prescribing of antibiotics and drugs that were investigated for COVID-19 treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, famotidine, and dexamethasone. To account for seasonal variability in antibiotic prescribing and decreased NH occupancy during the pandemic, monthly prevalence of residents with a prescription dispensed per 1,000 residents serviced was calculated from January - October and compared as relative percent change from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: In April 2020, prescribing was significantly higher in NHs for drugs investigated for COVID-19 treatment than 2019; including hydroxychloroquine (+563%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.87, 7.48) and azithromycin (+150%, 95% CI 2.37, 2.63). Ceftriaxone prescribing also increased (+43%, 95% CI 1.34, 1.54). Prescribing of dexamethasone was 36% lower in April (95% CI 0.55, 0.73) and 303% higher in July (95% CI 3.66, 4.45). Although azithromycin and ceftriaxone prescribing increased, total antibiotic prescribing among residents was lower from May (-5%, 95% CI 0.94, 0.97) through October (-4%, 95% CI 0.94, 0.97) in 2020 compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, large numbers of residents were prescribed drugs investigated for COVID-19 treatment, and an increase in prescribing of antibiotics commonly used for respiratory infections was observed. Prescribing of these drugs may increase the risk of adverse events, without providing clear benefits. Surveillance of NH prescribing practices is critical to evaluate concordance with guideline-recommended therapy and improve resident safety.","Gouin, Katryna A; Creasy, Stephen; Beckerson, Mary; Wdowicki, Martha; Hicks, Lauri A; Lind, Jennifer N; Geller, Andrew I; Budnitz, Daniel S; Kabbani, Sarah",Clin. infect. dis,,178

In vivo, NTZ is metabolized into Tizoxanide (TIZ), which is the active circulating metabolite. With the emergence of SARS-Cov-2 as a Pandemic agent, NTZ became one of the molecules already approved for human use to engage clinical trials, due to results in vitro showing that NTZ was highly effective against the SARS-Cov-2, agent of COVID-19. There are currently several ongoing clinical trials mainly in the USA and Brazil involving NTZ due not only to the in vitro results, but also for its long-known safety. Here, we study the response of Vero cells to TIZ treatment and unveil possible mechanisms for its antimicrobial effect, using a label-free proteomic approach (LC/MS/MS) analysis to compare the proteomic profile between untreated- and TIZ-treated cells. Fifteen differentially expressed proteins were observed related to various biological processes, including translation, intracellular trafficking, RNA processing and modification, and signal transduction. The broad antimicrobial range of TIZ points towards its overall effect in lowering cell metabolism and RNA processing and modification. The decreased levels of FASN, HNRNPH and HNRNPK with the treatment appear to be important for antiviral activity.","Yamamoto, K A; Blackburn, K; Migowski, E; Goshe, M B; Brown, D T; Ferreira, D F; Soares, M R",Sci Rep,,178

318500,High Rate of Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients with Secondary Sclerosing Cholangitis in Critically Ill Patients (SC-CIP),2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undoubtedly revolutionized the whole globe and given a new point of view on respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cannot be perceived as a disease limited only to pneumonia with diverse severity. More and more reports have demonstrated a wide range of possible systemic symptoms, including hepatic complications. Liver injury has been observed in a significant proportion of patients, especially in those with a severe or critical illness. COVID-19 might provoke a deterioration of liver function in patients with already diagnosed chronic liver diseases and without pre-existing liver disorders. The deterioration of liver function worsens the prognosis, increases the risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prolongs the hospital stay. In general, patients who develop liver dysfunction in COVID-19 are mainly males, elderly people, and those with higher body mass index. The underlying mechanisms for hepatic failure in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear, nevertheless liver damage appears to be directly connected with virus-induced cytopathic effects. A liver injury observed during hospitalization might be simultaneously caused by the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs, mainly antiviral agents. This minireview focuses on a possible relationship between COVID-19 and the liver, potential molecular mechanisms of liver damage, the characteristics of liver injury and suggested factors predisposing to hepatic manifestations in COVID-19 patients.","Cichoz-Lach, Halina; Michalak, Agata",World J Gastroenterol,,178

Our theory development is based on three ongoing academic debates related to (a) the unrepresentativeness of the stakeholder theory in entrepreneurship research; (b) the emergence of digital social entrepreneurship (DSE) as a bridge between stakeholders' needs, socio-economic actors, and digital-social initiatives; and (c) the role of N-Helix collaborations to facilitate the emergence of global knowledge-intensive initiatives and the rapid adoptions of open innovations. Our results support our assumptions about the positive mediation effect of DSE in the relationship between N-Helix collaborations and stakeholders' satisfaction. Notably, results show how pandemic has intensified these relationships and how DSE in N-Helix collaborations can generate social impacts globally.

METHODS: From April 2014 to June 2019, we retrospectively reviewed BCLC stage 0-B1 patients with fresh hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions that were repeatedly treated by RFA (control group, n = 72), and by RFA and subsequent SBRT (case group, n = 26). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce the selection bias between two groups. Recurrence, survival, Child-Pugh scores and short-term side effects (fever, bleeding, skin change, abdominal pain and fatigue) were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: After PSM, 21 patients remained in each group. Seventeen and 20 patients in the case and control groups experienced recurrence. For these patients, the median times to progression and follow-up were 10.7 and 35.8 months, respectively. After PSM, the 1-year progression-free survival rate in case and control groups were 66.7% and 52.4%, respectively (P = 0.313). The inter-group overall survival (OS) was comparable (3 and 5-year OS rates in case groups were 87.3% and 74.8%, while rates in control groups were 73.7% and 46.3%, respectively; P = 0.090). The short-term side effects were mild, and the incidence showed no inter-group difference. The 1-year rates of the Child-Pugh score deterioration of &#8805;2 in case and control groups were 23.8% and 33.3% (P > 0.05), respectively.

If untreated, this condition may evolve into liver impairment also co-occurred by extrahepatic involvements. Here, we aim to identify a new panel of biomarkers including IgG subclasses, Rheumatoid Factor (RF), and Free Light Chains (FLC) that may result useful and reliable for clinical evaluation of HBV-related cryoglobulinemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 44 HBV positive patients. Patients were stratified on the presence/absence of mixed cryoglobulinemia in two group: 22 with cryoglobulins (CGs) and 22 without CGs. Samples from 20 healthy blood donors (HD) were used as negative controls. Serum samples were tested for IgG subclasses, RF (IgM, IgG, and IgA type), and FLC. RESULTS: We detected a strikingly different serum IgG subclasses distribution between HD and HBV positive patients together with different RF isotypes; FLC were significantly increased in HBV-patients if compared with HD while no significant difference was shown between HBV with/without MC. CONCLUSION: The immune-inflammatory response triggered by HBV may be monitored by a peculiar profile of biomarkers. Our results open new perspective in precision medicine era; in these challenging times, they could be also employed to monitor the clinical course of COVID-19 patients, at high risk of HBV reactivation due to liver impairment and/or immunosuppressive therapies.","Pocino, Krizia; Napodano, Cecilia; Gragnani, Laura; Ciasca, Gabriele; Colantuono, Stefania; Marri, Silvia; Vantaggio, Lorenzo; Gulli, Francesca; Lorini, Serena; Barini, Antonella; Stefanile, Annunziata; Miele, Luca; Casato, Milvia; Zignego, Anna Linda; Rapaccini, Gian Ludovico; Marino, Mariapaola; Visentini, Marcella; Basile, Umberto",Rheumatology (Oxford),,178

Daily number of confirmed and incubative cases, as well as time-dependent reproductive number (Rt) was calculated to indicate the transmission of the diseases in the population. Spearman's correlation coefficients were assessed to show the correlation between meteorological factors and daily confirmed cases, daily incubative cases, as well as Rt. In particular, the results showed that there was a highly significant correlation between daily incubative cases and absolute humidity throughout the selected regions. Multiple linear regression model further confirmed the negative correlation between absolute humidity and incubative cases.

Intensive care respirators were specifically developed for the use in patients with pathological lung mechanics. Nevertheless, modern anesthesia machines offer similar technical capabilities including a number of different modes. However, conceptual differences must be accounted for, requiring close monitoring and the presence of trained personnel. Modern transport ventilators are mainly for bridging purposes as they can only be used with 100% oxygen in contaminated surroundings.

330555,Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients May Be Prone to Subacute Thyroiditis,2020,"We demonstrated that effects of serum matrix on molecular interactions between drugs and target proteins can be investigated in real time using magnetic bio-sensing techniques. A giant magneto-resistive (GMR) sensor was used on which target proteins were fixed and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (diameter: 50 nm) conjugated with drug were used in phosphate buffer, with and without serum. In this study, the following drug-protein pairs were investigated: quercetin and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), Infliximab and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;), and Bevacizumab and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). For the quercetin and PKA pair, the time profile of the signal from the GMR sensor due to binding between quercetin and PKA clearly changed before and after the addition of serum. Moreover, it was revealed that not only the association process, but also the dissociation process was influenced by the addition of serum, suggesting that the quercetin and PKA complex may partially contain serum proteins, which affect the formation and stability of the complex. For antibody drugs, little effects of serum matrix were observed on both the association and dissociation processes. These clear differences may be attributed to the hydrophobic and electrostatic character of the drug molecule, target protein, and serum proteins. The real-time monitoring of molecular interactions in a biological matrix enabled by the GMR bio-sensing technique is a powerful tool to investigate such complicated molecular interactions. Understanding the molecular interactions that occur in a biological matrix is indispensable for determining the mechanism of action of the drugs and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics inside the body. Additionally, this method can be applied for the analysis of the influence of any kind of third molecule that may have some interaction between two molecules, for example, an inhibitor drug against the interaction between two kinds of proteins.","Saito, Toshiro; Momiyama, Masayoshi; Manri, Chihiro; Yu, Heng; Choudhury, Kalidip; Osterfeld, Sebastian J; Nakasawa, Takashi",J Pharm Biomed Anal,,178

The study used a prospective cross-sectional design. Data was collected using an online self-administered questionnaire. A total of 862 Saudi adults participated. Information was gathered on the participants' perspectives towards the severity and susceptibility of the COVID-19 infection, reasons for their hesitancy to receive the vaccine, perceived benefits, and reasons for action. Just under a quarter (19.6%) of respondents had previously tested positive for COVID-19. A small minority of the participants had already received the vaccine (2.1%), while 20.3% had registered in the Sehaty app (application) to receive the vaccine. Just under half of them (48%) will take the vaccine when mass vaccination is achieved and approximately the same number (46.7%) will only take it if it is made mandatory. Vaccine reluctance is highly prevalent among the general public in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many are aware of a high likelihood of getting the infection, the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccine were reported as barriers to vaccination.","Almaghaslah, D.; Alsayari, A.; Kandasamy, G.; Vasudevan, R.",Vaccines (Basel),,178

We described not only public attention volume trends, discussion sentiments, top sources, top posts that gained the most public attention, and hot keyword frequency but also hot keywords' co-occurrence as visualized by the VOSviewer software tool. RESULTS: In this study, we reached four main conclusions. First, based on changing discussion trends regarding the COVID-19 subject, 7 periods were identified based on events that can be aggregated into two pandemic waves in Vietnam. Second, community pages on Facebook were the source of the most engagement from the public. However, the sources with the highest average interaction efficiency per article were government sources. Third, people's attitudes when discussing the pandemic have changed from negative to positive emotions. Fourth, the type of content that attracts the most interactions from people varies from time to time. Besides that, the issue-attention cycle theory occurred not only once but four times during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that online resources can help the government quickly identify public attention to public health messages during times of crisis. We also determined the hot spots that most interested the public and public attention communication patterns, which can help the government get practical information to make more effective policy reactions to help prevent the spread of the pandemic.","Tran, Huyen Thi Thanh; Lu, Shih-Hao; Tran, Ha Thi Thu; Nguyen, Bien Van",JMIR Med Inform,,178

337429,Temporal Differential Expression of Physiomarkers Predicts Sepsis in Critically Ill Adults,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether racial/ethnic differences in telehealth use existed during the peak pandemic period among NYC patients seeking care for COVID-19 related symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used data from a large health system in NYC - the epicenter of the US crisis - to describe characteristics of patients seeking COVID-related care via telehealth, ER, or office encounters during the peak pandemic period. Using multinomial logistic regression, we estimated the magnitude of the relationship between patient characteristics and the odds of having a first encounter via telehealth versus ER or office visit, and then used regression parameter estimates to predict patients' probabilities of using different encounter types given their characteristics. RESULTS: Demographic factors, including race/ethnicity and age, were significantly predictive of telehealth use. As compared to Whites, Blacks had higher adjusted odds of using both the ER versus telehealth (OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 4.0-4.6) and office visits versus telehealth (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.3-1.5). For Hispanics versus Whites, the analogous ORs were 2.5 (95% CI: 2.3-2.7) and 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1-1.3). Compared to any age groups, patients 65+ had significantly higher odds of using either ER or office visits versus telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: The response to COVID-19 has involved an unprecedented expansion in telehealth. While older Americans and minority populations among others are known to be disadvantaged by the digital divide, few studies have examined disparities in telehealth specifically, and none during COVID-19. Additional research into sociodemographic heterogeneity in telehealth use is needed to prevent potentially further exacerbating health disparities overall.","Weber, Ellerie; Miller, Sarah J; Astha, Varuna; Janevic, Teresa; Benn, Emma",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,178

This study sought to document COVID-19's impact on eating disorders (ED) research, which may be particularly susceptible to such disruptions, given its focus on individuals who are physically and emotionally vulnerable. We invited ED researchers from editorial boards and scientific organizations to complete a quantitative/qualitative survey about: COVID-19's current and future impact on ED research; areas of concern about research disruptions; and effective strategies for conducting and supporting research during and after COVID-19. Among 187 participants, many had moved studies online and/or shutdown part of their research. Across position types (permanent, 52.7%; temporary, 47.3%), participants reported high concern about data collection, recruitment, and securing future funding. Those holding temporary positions reported significantly greater concern about COVID-19's impact on their career and greater stress than participants in permanent positions. Strategies for dealing with research disruptions included: employing technology; reprioritizing goals/tasks; and encouraging collaboration. Results underscore the high levels of stress and disruption caused by COVID-19.

Several studies, particularly from Europe and the USA, have now confirmed these symptoms as an early key feature of COVID-19. About 70â% of patients seem to experience a reduction of smell and taste in the course of the disease, with most of the studies published to date based on questionnaires and anamnestic data. Validated smell tests have so far only been used in a few studies. A distinction between taste and taste disorders, i.âe. a distinction between retronasal aroma taste and the olfactory system from the dysfunction of taste capsules and the further cranial nerves, was mostly not made in the studies available to date. Some reports associate olfactory disorders with a milder clinical course. At the same time, the olfactory system via the olfactory bulb represents an entry point into the central nervous system, and an olfactory disorder could be a predisposing factor for central neurological symptoms. The clinical significance of smell and taste disorders in COVID-19 patients is currently still unclear. Further open questions concern the exact prevalence and the prognosis, so that overall higher quality studies with validated smell tests and larger numbers of patients are required.","Otte, Martin Sylvester; Klußmann, Jens Peter; Luers, Jan Christoffer",Laryngorhinootologie,,178

The Fear of COVID-19 scale is a scale that can measure anxiety related to COVID-19 in a short time. The purpose of this study was to verify the reliability and validity the Korean version of Fear of COVID-19 scale (KF-COVID-19S). METHODS: The data of total 186 normal adults and 17 patients were finally used for the statistical analysis. For internal consistency, Cronbach's &#945; was calculated. For concurrent and discriminant validity, the correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment Instrument Brief Form (WHOQOLBREF) were analyzed. For construct validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Cronbach alpha was 0.88. The two-factor model (factor 1: Physical fear, factor 2: Emotional fear) showed significantly positive correlations and appeared to be ""good"" fitness (CFI=0.906, IFI=0.907, NFI=0.902). CONCLUSION: The KF-COVID-19S can be a useful scale that can measure the physical and emotional fears associated with COVID-19 in a short time. Because the psychiatric patients are a more vulnerable group to the fear, it is thought that the KF-COVID-19S will help to determine the patient's level of anxiety and make a therapeutic plan for the underlying mental disorder.","Hwang, Kyu-Sic; Choi, Hye-Ji; Yang, Chan-Mo; Hong, Jeongwan; Lee, Hye-Jin; Park, Min-Cheol; Jang, Seung-Ho; Lee, Sang-Yeol",,,178

Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease.","Abdul Bari, Ahamed Basha; Samuel, Prince Johnson",J Immunoassay Immunochem,,178

349827,"Kerala, India's Front Runner in Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)",2020,"OBJECTIVE(S): Obstetric Violence refers to professional deficiencies in maternity care, which can occur in both low and high resource settings. Examples include non-dignified care, lack of respect when giving care, discrimination and abandonment of care. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes towards obstetric violence in a cohort of medical students in India and the UK. STUDY DESIGN: An online survey was sent to 240 UK and 280 Indian medical students. This incorporated a video showing a dramatized scenario of obstetric violence. The survey assessed participant's demographics and prior knowledge of obstetric violence. Participants scored their perceptions of eight behaviours in the video on visual analogue scales. Participants were asked to reflect on their own practice and score this. Comparisons of survey responses between UK and Indian participants were made using chi squared/Student's t-test. RESULTS: 62 Indian medical students and 58 UK medical students completed the survey. Indian medical students were significantly more likely to be male (p < 0.001). 26 % of UK participants had previously heard the term obstetric violence, compared to 34 % of Indian participants (p = 0.15). Both were able to correctly define obstetric violence at similar rates (32 % versus 34 %). Indian medical students were significantly less critical (p < 0.001) of all eight scored behaviours in the video of obstetric violence compared to their UK counterparts. UK medical students were significantly less likely to agree that the video had changed their perception on how teams should behave and act in this context (p < 0.001). 90 % of UK participants and 38 % of Indian participants had received training in professional behaviours. 14 % of UK participants had seen examples of obstetric violence in clinical practice compared to 49 % of Indian participants. CONCLUSIONS: UK and Indian medical students were able to identify behaviours associated with obstetric violence, although the majority were previously unaware of the term. Indian medical students in this study were less critical of obstetric violence in the video, which may be because of cultural reasons, greater numbers of male students, greater exposure to obstetric violence or less training on professional behaviours. Standardised training to prevent obstetric violence should be part of undergraduate medical training internationally.","Gray, Thomas; Mohan, Suruchi; Lindow, Stephen; Pandey, Uma; Farrell, Tom",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,178

METHODS: Retrospective, propensity-matched observational study of consecutive COVID-19-positive patients between February 24, 2020, and May 13, 2020. RESULTS: Of 878 patients in the analysis, 83 (9.5%) received famotidine. In comparison to patients not treated with famotidine, patients treated with famotidine were younger (63.5 ± 15.0 vs 67.5 ± 15.8 years, P = 0.021), but did not differ with respect to baseline demographics or preexisting comorbidities. Use of famotidine was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.86, P = 0.021) and combined death or intubation (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.96, P = 0.040). Propensity score matching to adjust for age difference between groups did not alter the effect on either outcome. In addition, patients receiving famotidine displayed lower levels of serum markers for severe disease including lower median peak C-reactive protein levels (9.4 vs 12.7 mg/dL, P = 0.002), lower median procalcitonin levels (0.16 vs 0.30 ng/mL, P = 0.004), and a nonsignificant trend to lower median mean ferritin levels (797.5 vs 964.0 ng/mL, P = 0.076). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that famotidine was an independent predictor of both lower mortality and combined death/intubation, whereas older age, body mass index >30 kg/m, chronic kidney disease, National Early Warning Score, and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio were all predictors of both adverse outcomes. DISCUSSION: Famotidine use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with a lower risk of mortality, lower risk of combined outcome of mortality and intubation, and lower levels of serum markers for severe disease in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.(Equation is included in full-text article.).","Mather, Jeffrey F; Seip, Richard L; McKay, Raymond G",Am J Gastroenterol,,178
353727,Defining IL-6 Levels in Healthy Individuals: A Meta-Analysis,2020,"As media reports have noted, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated market mainstreaming of immune-boosting food bioactives, supplements, and nutraceuticals. However, most studies reporting on the potential of bioactives against COVID-19 transmission have been uploaded as preprints with little opportunity to revise content for benefit and impact. The current review discusses current best evidence and information underpinning the role of food ingredients and bioactive compounds in supporting immune functions in humans and animals, specifically in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease. Up to now, some evidence from randomized population and clinical trials has suggested that vitamin D levels may be linked to COVID-19 transmission and severity. Numerous theoretical studies have pointed to polyphenols and particularly flavonoids as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also inconclusive evidence to support the future use of ß-glucan to address COVID-19 due in part to variability in immune response arising from heterogeneity in polysaccharide branch and chain length for different sources and the absence of a standardized extraction method. To confirm the promising outcomes and hypotheses for bioactive compounds, more randomized and controlled clinical studies are needed. The results of such studies would have a profound effect on the prospects of food supplements and nutraceuticals as potential prophylaxis against COVID-19 and serve to help consumers to protect themselves during the post-lockdown recovery era.","Galanakis, Charis M; Aldawoud, Turki M S; Rizou, Myrto; Rowan, Neil J; Ibrahim, Salam A",,,178

Using longitudinal data of 7400 American adults between March 10 and June 23, 2020, the study examines social-distancing and mask-wearing behaviors. We use a staggered difference-in-difference model to explore whether state policies lead to preventive behaviors. We further examine heterogeneity in individual responses to state mandates by including interaction terms with health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The study finds that state policies lead to increased adoption of these behaviors. Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates. The adoption of the behaviors is also polarized between CNN users and Fox News/Social Media users, with greater compliance by the former.","Shin, Su Hyun; Ji, Hyunjung; Lim, HanNa",Soc Sci Med,,178

Using the questionnaire star, the online platform of the Marketing Research Office of Peking University and ""snowball"" methods 700 questionnaires were collected. Results: The response rate was 89.71% (n = 700). Female employees are more sensitive to the perceived event strength of the novel coronavirus pneumonia than male employees (F = 10.94, p <0.001); Employees aged 30-40 affected by the epidemic have the highest level of emotional exhaustion (F = 5.22, p < 0.01); A higher education level leads to a higher level of emotional exhaustion (F = 4.74, p < 0.01); The emotional exhaustion is polarized with the annual family income (F = 4.099, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The novelty, disruption, criticality of the Corona Virus Disease event has had a positive impact on the emotional exhaustion of employees in the workplace; Emotional exhaustion plays a partly mediating role between event strength with constructive deviant behaviors, and destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a positive effect on creative constructive deviant behaviors, challenging constructive deviant behaviors, and interpersonal destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a negative impact on organizational destructive deviant behaviors, and has no significant impact on interpersonal constructive deviant behaviors.","Liu, Yingyan; Zhang, Zaisheng; Zhao, Heng",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,178

355800,Predictive value of neutrophil to lymphocyte and platelet to lymphocyte ratio in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of modern-day oncology, including how stakeholders communicate through social media. We surveyed oncology stakeholders in order to assess their attitudes pertaining to social media and how it has been affected during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 40-item survey was distributed to stakeholders from 8 July to 22 July 2020 and was promoted through the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the OncoAlert Network. RESULTS: One thousand and seventy-six physicians and stakeholders took part in the survey. In total, 57.3% of respondents were medical oncologists, 50.6% aged <40 years, 50.8% of female gender and mostly practicing in Europe (51.5%). More than 90% of respondents considered social media a useful tool for distributing scientific information and for education. Most used social media to stay up to date on cancer care in general (62.5%) and cancer care during COVID-19 (61%) given the constant flow of information. Respondents also used social media to interact with other oncologists (78.8%) and with patients (34.4%). Overall, 61.1% of respondents were satisfied with the role that social media was playing during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, 41.1% of respondents reported trouble in discriminating between credible and less credible information and 30% stated social networks were a source of stress. For this reason, one-third of respondents reduced its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding meeting attendance, a total of 59.1% of responding physicians preferred in-person meetings to virtual ones, and 51.8% agreed that virtual meetings and social distancing could hamper effective collaboration. CONCLUSION: Social media has a useful role in supporting cancer care and professional engagement in oncology. Although one-third of respondents reported reduced use of social media due to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority found social media useful to keep up to date and were satisfied with the role social media was playing during the pandemic.","Morgan, G; Tagliamento, M; Lambertini, M; Devnani, B; Westphalen, B; Dienstmann, R; Bozovic-Spasojevic, I; Calles, A; Criscitiello, C; Curioni, A; Garcia, A M; Lamarca, A; Pilotto, S; Scheffler, M; Strijbos, M; Wong, R; de Azambuja, E; Peters, S",ESMO Open,,178

357286,Pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in two critically ill patients who recovered from COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: The vulnerability of postacute and long-term care (PA/LTC) facility residents to COVID-19 has manifested across the world with increasing facility outbreaks associated with high hospitalization and mortality rates. Systematic protocols to guide telehealth-centered interventions in response to COVID-19 outbreaks have yet to be delineated. This article is intended to inform PA/LTC facilities and neighboring health care partners how to collaboratively utilize telehealth-centered strategies to improve outcomes in facility outbreaks. Methods: The University of Virginia rapidly developed a multidisciplinary telehealth-centered COVID-19 facility outbreak strategy in response to a LTC facility outbreak in which 41 (out of 48) facility residents and 7 staff members tested positive. This strategy focused on supporting the facility team remotely using rapidly deployed technologic solutions. Goals included (1) early identification of patients who need their care escalated, (2) monitoring and treating patients deemed safe to remain in the facility, (3) care coordination to facilitate bidirectional transfers between the skilled nursing facility (SNF) and hospital, and (4) daily facility needs assessment related to technology, infection control, and staff well-being. To achieve these goals, a standardized approach centered on daily multidisciplinary virtual rounds and telemedicine consultation was provided. Results: Over a month since the outbreak began, 18 out of 48 (38%) facility residents required hospitalization and 6 (12.5%) died. Eleven facility residents have since returned back to the SNF after recovering from their hospitalization. No staff required hospitalization. Conclusions: Interventions that reduce hospitalizations and mortality are a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality and hospitalization rates seen in this PA/LTC facility outbreak are significantly lower than has been documented in other facility outbreaks. Our multidisciplinary approach centered on telemedicine should be considered as other PA/LTC facilities partner with neighboring health care systems in responding to COVID-19 outbreaks. We have begun replicating these services to additional PA/LTC facilities facing COVID-19 outbreaks.","Harris, Drew A; Archbald-Pannone, Laurie; Kaur, Jasveen; Cattell-Gordon, David; Rheuban, Karen S; Ombres, Rachel L; Albero, Kimberly; Steele, Rebecca; Bell, Taison D; Mutter, Justin B",Telemed. j. e. health,,178
357383,CJEM journal club: corticosteroids use for critically ill COVID-19 patients,2021,"The aim of this article was to study the impact of the COVID19 lockdown on anxiety and depressive symptoms on the basis of responses to an online survey from 1753 French-speaking subjects, conducted between April 27 and May 11, 2020. METHOD: Using a biopsychosocial model, the effects of socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender at birth, socio-professional category, sexual orientation), lockdown conditions (material factors: urban density of the place of residence, surface area of the place of residence during lockdown), social characteristics: living with a partner during lockdown, presence of children during lockdown) and psychosocial history (attachment styles) on anxiety - evaluated on the GAD7 - and depression - evaluated on the MDI - were investigated. Ordinal regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The rates of depression observed (moderate or severe depression: 22.5%) and anxiety (moderate or severe anxiety: 18.4%) were higher than usual but lower than what has been documented in other studies on the effects of lockdown. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men (Anxiety: AOR=1.647, CI 95%=1.647-2.530; Depression: AOR=1.622, CI 95%=1.274-2.072). Bisexual individuals had an increased likelihood of anxiety symptoms (AOR=1.962, CI 95%=1.544-2.490) and depression (AOR=1.799, CI 95%=1.394-2.317). For homosexuals, only links with depression were observed (AOR=1.757, CI 95%=1.039-2.906). People in a situation of economic vulnerability were more prone to anxiety disorders (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=1.791, CI 95%=1.147-2.790) or depression (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=2.581, CI 95%=1.633-4.057). Links with attachment styles were also found. Fearful subjects were particularly vulnerable (anxiety: AOR=2.514, CI 95%=1.985-3.190; depression: AOR=2.521, CI 95%=1.938-3.289), followed by subjects with an anxious attachment style (anxiety: AOR=1.949, CI 95%=1.498-2.540; depression: AOR=1.623, CI 95%=1.207-2.181). The impact of lockdown on avoidant subjects only concerned depression (AOR=1.417, CI 95%=1.034-1.937). Being with a partner during lockdown appeared to have a protective effect against depression (AOR=.693, CI 95%=.555-.866). Neither the presence of children, the surface area of the lockdown residence, nor the population density of the place of residence was associated with anxiety or depression. CONCLUSION: The impact of lockdown on mental health depends on a range of dimensions that need to be apprehended in order to tailor post-lockdown psychological and social support. Management based on a biopsychosocial approach should be favored.","Gouvernet, B; Bonierbale, M",Encephale,,178

358567,Pregnancy hypertension diagnosis and care in COVID-19 era and beyond,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if Victorian State of Emergency (SOE) measures to combat COVID-19 were associated with delayed presentations or management of acute stroke and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: This was a retrospective, pre- and post-implementation study using data from an adult, tertiary cardiology and neurosciences centre with 24-h capacity for endovascular procedures. All primary presentations with acute stroke or AMI during the first 28 days of stage 2 and stage 3 SOE restrictions (26 March to 23 April 2020) were compared to an equivalent period without restrictions (26 March to 23 April 2019). The primary outcome variable was time from onset of symptoms to ED presentation. RESULTS: There were 52 (1.6% of all ED presentations) patients who met inclusion criteria during the SOE period and 57 (1.0%) patients in the comparator period. Patients were equally matched for demographics, disease severity and prior history of stroke or AMI. Median time from symptom onset to presentation was 227 (93-1183) min during the SOE period and 342 (119-1220) min during the comparator period (P = 0.24). Among eligible patients with ischaemic stroke or ST-elevation AMI, median time to primary reperfusion intervention was 65 (37-78) min during SOE and 44 (39-60) min in the comparator period (P = 0.54). There were no differences in mortality at hospital discharge (9.6% vs 10.5%) and hospital length of stay (5.4 vs 4.3 days). CONCLUSIONS: In the first 28 days, SOE measures to combat COVID-19 were not associated with delays in presentation or life-saving interventions for patients with acute stroke and AMI.","Mitra, Biswadev; Mitchell, Rob D; Cloud, Geoffrey C; Stub, Dion; Nguyen, Minh; Nanayakkara, Shane; Miller, Jean-Philippe; O039, M; Reilly, Gerard; Smit, De Villiers; Cameron, Peter A",Emerg Med Australas,,178
359481,Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Plasma Concentration in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Observational Study,2021,"Relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction measures in the evaluation of clinical trial data are poorly understood by health professionals and the public. The absence of reported absolute risk reduction in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can lead to outcome reporting bias that affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy. The present article uses clinical epidemiologic tools to critically appraise reports of efficacy in Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine clinical trials. Based on data reported by the manufacturer for Pfzier/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2, this critical appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.0% to 97.6%; p = 0.016; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.59% to 0.83%; p < 0.000. For the Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273, the appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 94.1%; 95% CI, 89.1% to 96.8%; p = 0.004; absolute risk reduction, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.97% to 1.32%; p < 0.000. Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures. Reporting absolute risk reduction measures is essential to prevent outcome reporting bias in evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.","Brown, Ronald B",Medicina (Kaunas),,178

362613,Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Dosage Individualization of Cefepime in Critically Ill Patients: A Case Study,2021,"COVID-19 has rapidly spread through the world, and is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) face an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 because of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) upregulation, an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Our group recently revealed that COPD-derived lung fibroblasts express higher level of ACE2, and provide direct evidence that chronic cigarette smoke (CS) exposure significantly increases pulmonary ACE2 protein. CS is the primary risk factor for COPD. ACE2 expression may be regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels. Changes in protein expression can be controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). One of the best studied RBPs is human antigen R (HuR), a ubiquitously expressed RBP, that regulates the stability, localization and/or translation of target mRNAs. To stabilize target mRNA, HuR translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. CS may increases HuR translocation to the cytoplasm, thereby indirectly augmenting cellular protein levels. Therefore, we hypothesized that HuR regulates ACE2 expression in response to CS, thereby accounting for higher ACE2 in COPD-derived cells. Aims: 1)- Evaluate HuR expression and localization in Normal, Smoker and COPD lung tissues;2) Establish that HuR induces ACE2 expression in primary human lung fibroblasts (HLF);3)- Determine if HuR controls ACE2 expression by regulating mRNA stability. Methods: 1)- Multiplex Immunohistochemistry was performed on lung tissue from Normal, Smoker and COPD subjects. The localization of HuR was assessed in HLF exposed to 2% cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 4h by subcellular fractionation-western blot. 2)- Normal, Smoker and COPD HLF were transfected with either small interfering RNA (siRNA) against HuR or Control siRNA. ACE2 protein was evaluated by western blot. 3)- RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-qPCR was used to assess the association of HuR to ACE2 mRNA in Normal, Smoker and COPD HLF. The effect of HuR on the stability of ACE2 mRNA was assessed by using actinomycin D pulse-chase followed by qPCR. Results: 1)- HuR cytoplasmic localization is higher in Smoker and COPD lung tissues. There was an increase in cytoplasmic HuR in HLF exposed to 2%CSE for 4h. 2)- Knockdown of HuR slightly increases ACE2 protein. 3)- HuR associates with ACE2 mRNA in Normal and Smoker HLF. Significance: Our work is the first to highlight the association between ACE2 and HuR in COPD. The regulation of ACE2 by HuR could provide the basis to understand the upregulation of ACE2 expression in COPD HLF and the potential consequence towards COVID-19.","Aloufi, N.; Haidar, Z.; Nair, P.; Eidelman, D.

362969,Physiology-guided revascularization versus optimal medical therapy of non-culprit lesions in elderly patients with myocardial infarction: Rationale and design of the FIRE trial,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: New data has emerged regarding higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and its severity and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article explores the possibility of COVID 19 induced diabetes and highlights a potential bidirectional link between COVID 19 and T1DM. METHODS: A literature search was performed with Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Google Scholar electronic databases till October 2020, using relevant keywords (COVID-19 induced diabetes; COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes; COVID-19 induced DKA; new-onset diabetes after SARS-CoV-2 infection) to extract relevant studies describing relationship between COVID-19 and T1DM. RESULTS: Past lessons and new data teach us that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) can enter islet cells via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors and cause reversible ß-cell damage and transient hyperglycemia. There have been postulations regarding the potential new-onset T1DM triggered by COVID-19. This article reviews the available evidence regarding the impact and interlink between COVID-19 and &#932;1DM. We also explore the mechanisms behind the viral etiology of &#932;1DM. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can trigger severe diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation in individuals with new-onset diabetes. However, at present, there is no hard evidence that SARS-CoV-2 induces T1DM on it's own accord. Long term follow-up of children and adults presenting with new-onset diabetes during this pandemic is required to fully understand the type of diabetes induced by COVID-19.","Boddu, Sirisha Kusuma; Aurangabadkar, Geeta; Kuchay, Mohammad Shafi",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,178

The use of disposable surgical masks is common for patients, doctors, and even the general public in highly risky areas. However, the current surgical masks cannot self-sterilize in order to reuse or be recycled for other applications. The resulting high economic and environmental costs are further damaging societies worldwide. Herein, we reported a unique method for functionalizing commercially available surgical masks with outstanding self-cleaning and photothermal properties. A dual-mode laser-induced forward transfer method was developed for depositing few-layer graphene onto low-melting temperature nonwoven masks. Superhydrophobic states were observed on the treated masks' surfaces, which can cause the incoming aqueous droplets to bounce off. Under sunlight illumination, the surface temperature of the functional mask can quickly increase to over 80 °C, making the masks reusable after sunlight sterilization. In addition, this graphene-coated mask can be recycled directly for use in solar-driven desalination with outstanding salt-rejection performance for long-term use. These roll-to-roll production-line-compatible masks can provide us with better protection against this severe virus. The environment can also benefit from the direct recycling of these masks, which can be used for desalinating seawater.","Zhong, Hong; Zhu, Zhaoran; Lin, Jing; Cheung, Chi Fai; Lu, Vivien L; Yan, Feng; Chan, Ching-Yuen; Li, Guijun",ACS Nano,,178

Data on methylprednisolone are limited. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-flow oxygen (FiO2 &#8805; 50%) admitted to an academic centre in New York, from 1 March to 15 April 2020. We used inverse probability of treatment weights to estimate the effect of methylprednisolone on clinical outcomes and intensive care resource utilization. RESULTS: Of 447 patients, 153 (34.2%) received methylprednisolone and 294 (65.8%) received no corticosteroids. At 28 days, 102 patients (22.8%) had died and 115 (25.7%) received mechanical ventilation. In weighted analyses, risk for death or mechanical ventilation was 37% lower with methylprednisolone (hazard ratio 0.63; 95% CI 0.47-0.86; P = .003), driven by less frequent mechanical ventilation (subhazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.40-0.79; P = .001); mortality did not differ between groups. The methylprednisolone group had 2.8 more ventilator-free days (95% CI 0.5-5.1; P = .017) and 2.6 more intensive care-free days (95% CI 0.2-4.9; P = .033) during the first 28 days.

These observations question if some genetic factors may be related to the vulnerability and poor prognosis of the disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether MBL2 gene B variant at codon 54 (rs1800450) were related to the variabilities in clinical course of this infection. METHODS: 284 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 100 healthy controls were included in the study. COVID-19 patients were subdivided according to the clinical features and clinical characteristics were analyzed. DNAs of all patients and controls were examined for the codon 54 A/B (gly54asp: rs1800450) variation in exon 1 of the MBL2 gene. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, BB genotype of MBL2 gene was more common among COVID-19 cases compared with controls (10.9% vs 1.0%, respectively; OR = 12.1, 95%CI = 1.6-90.1, p = 0.001). Multivariate analyses, adjusted for age, sex and MBL genetic variants, revealed that when compared with the COVID-19 patients that had AA genotype (reference), the patients that had BB or AB genotypes suffered from a higher risk for severe disease (for BB genotype, odds ratio (OR) = 5.3, p < 0.001; for AB genotype, OR = 2.9, p = 0.001) and for ICU need (for BB genotype, OR = 19.6, p < 0.001; for AB genotype, OR = 6.9, p = 0.001). On the other hand, there was not any significant difference between the genotype variants in terms of mortality at 28 days or development of secondary bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: The B variants of MBL2 gene at codon 54, which were associated with lower MBL2 levels, were related to a higher risk for a more severe clinical course of COVID-19 infection in some respects. Our findings may have potential future implications, e.g. for use of MBL protein as potential therapeutics or prioritize the individuals with B variants during vaccination strategies.","Medetalibeyoglu, Alpay; Bahat, Gulistan; Senkal, Naci; Kose, Murat; Avci, Kader; Sayin, Gozde Yesil; Isoglu-Alkac, Ummuhan; Tukek, Tufan; Pehlivan, Sacide",Infect Genet Evol,,178

Genomics data integrated with multi-omics layering have advanced cancer research. Uncovering such layers of genetic mutations/modifications, epigenetic regulation and their role in the complex pathophysiology of cancer progression could lead to novel therapeutic interventions. Although a plethora of literature is available in public domain defining the role of various tumor driver gene mutations, understanding of epigenetic regulation of cancer is still emerging. This review focuses on epigenetic regulation association with the pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSC has higher prevalence in Caucasian populations compared to other races. Due to lack of proper reporting to cancer registries, the incidence rates for NMSC worldwide cannot be accurately estimated. However, this is the most common neoplasm in humans, and millions of new cases per year are reported in the United States alone. In organ transplant recipients, the incidence of NMSC particularly of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is very high and these SCCs frequently become metastatic and lethal. Understanding of solar ultraviolet (UV) light-induced damage and impaired DNA repair process leading to DNA mutations and nuclear instability provide an insight into the pathogenesis of metastatic neoplasm. This review discusses the recent advances in the field of epigenetics of NMSCs. Particularly, the role of DNA methylation, histone hyperacetylation and non-coding RNA such as long-chain noncoding (lnc) RNAs, circular RNAs and miRNA in the disease progression are summarized.","Kashyap, Mahendra Pratap; Sinha, Rajesh; Mukhtar, M Shahid; Athar, Mohammad",Semin. cancer biol,,178

Therefore, we sought to investigate the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and following a single dose of AZD2221, in Sri Lankan individuals. MethodsUsing Luminex assays, we characterized the IgG and IgA responses in patients with varying severity of illness and following a single dose of the vaccine at 4 weeks and 12 weeks since onset of illness or following vaccination. Haemagglutination test (HAT) was used to assess the antibodies to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT), B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 (VOCs) and surrogate neutralizing test to measure ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies. ResultsThose with mild illness and in vaccinees, the IgG responses to S1, S2, RBD and N protein increased from 4 weeks to 12 weeks, while it remained unchanged in those with moderate/severe illness. Those who had a febrile illness in 2017 and 2018 (controls) also gave IgG and IgA high responses to the S2 subunit. In the vaccinees, the most significant rise was seen for the IgG antibodies to the S2 subunit (p<0.0001). Vaccinees had several fold lower IgA antibodies to all the SARS-CoV-2 proteins tested than those with mild and moderate/severe illness at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks the HAT titres were significantly lower to the B.1.1.7 in vaccinees and significantly lower in those with mild illness, and in vaccinees to B.1.351 and for B.1.617.2. No such difference was seen in those with moderate/severe illness. ConclusionsVaccinees had significantly less IgA to SARS-CoV-2, but comparable IgG responses to those with natural infection. However, following a single dose, vaccinees had reduced antibody levels to the variants of concern (VOC), which further declined with time, compared to natural infection.","Jayathilaka, Deshni; Jeewandara, Chandima; Gomes, Laksiri; Jayadas, Tibutius; Kamaladasa, Achala; Guruge, Dinuka; Pushpakumara, Pradeep; Ranasinghe, Thushali; Abayratne, Inoka; Danasekara, Saubhagya; Gunathilaka, Buddhini; Kuruppu, Heshan; Wijewickrama, Ananda; Wijayamuni, Ruwan; Schimanski, Lisa; Tan, Tiong; Ogg, Graham; Townsend, Alain; Malavige, Gathsaurie Neelika",,,178
374200,Efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Clinical Investigations Center of Saint-Louis Hospital (CIC-1427) is a structure dedicated to clinical trials and mainly early phase trials (first-in-man administration, phase 1 and 2). These trials are conducted in a French Regional Health Agency (ARS) authorized structure. In March 2020, faced to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the French national lockdown measures, the CIC-1427 had to rapidly adapt its operating procedures to ensure the safety of both patients and staff. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Ensuring optimal management of patients included in early phase clinical trials, while respecting the good clinical and professional practices (GCP/GPP) of the CICs protocol sponsors' requirements, patients' safety and clinical research multidisciplinary staff safety (nurses, caregivers' assistants (AS), clinical research assistants (CRA), clinical trial coordinators (CTC), project leaders, health executive and investigating physicians), in the context of the health crisis related to COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Due to their activity, requiring on-site presence, each staff member of the CIC-1427 clinical research team had to adapt their daily activity to the constraints of the health crisis. New specific procedures were quickly developed to deal with the pandemic. Most of the on-site medical visits were replaced by virtual consults with biological assessments in the local laboratories. ""Remote monitoring"" replaced on-site monitoring visits. Treatments were sent to each patient's home via couriers after agreement of the CPPs of each protocol (Committee for the Protection of Persons). The essential visits were maintained on site thanks to the unfailing involvement of our clinical care team, with implementation of a specific sanitary protocol. CONCLUSION: The involvement of our entire multidisciplinary research team ensured that each patient was able to benefit from a personalized follow-up and to continue the treatment on-trial. The newly introduced procedures also allowed collection of a maximum of safety and efficacy data for clinical trial sponsors while complying with good regulatory practices. This set of procedures developed during the first epidemic wave, fundamentally helped setting the frame for a better coping during the subsequent pandemic waves.","Ghrieb, Zineb; Allaoua, Souhil; Huang, Jin; Langner, Nathalie; François, Florène; Maréchal, Corinne; Jebali, Majdi; Lebbé, Céleste; Chellah, Abdennour; Bergeron, Anne; Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques; Daltro De Oliveira, Rafael; Soret-Dulphy, Juliette; Benajiba, Lina",Therapie,,178

378828,Spontaneous pneumothorax in an elderly patient with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak in France is disturbing our health system. Urologists in training who are already known to have burnout, are in the front line to face this disease. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young French urologists in training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire evaluating the pandemic added stress, and its negative impact on work and training quality, was e-mailed to the members of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF). The association includes all French junior and senior residents. The survey lasted 3 days. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was performed to identify the predictive factors. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five (55.5%) of the 495 AFUF members responded to the questionnaire. More than 90% of responders felt more stressed by the pandemic. Fellows and senior residents were more likely to feel that the crisis had an important impact on their work quality (OR=1.76, IC95=[1.01-3.13]), even more when COVID 19 patients were present in their department (OR=2.31, IC95=[1.20-4.65]). Past medical history of respiratory disease (OR=2.57, IC95=[1.31-5.98]) and taking in charge COVID19 patients (OR=1.85, IC95=[0.98-3.59]) were additional risk factors. CONCLUSION: COVID19 pandemic has a negative impact on young French urologists in training and on their work and training quality. Managing their psychosocial well-being during this time is as important as managing their physical health.

Hypercoagulation conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, factor V Leiden and protein C and S deficiency are all recognised risk factors. It is also a known complication during pregnancy often presenting with fever and lower abdominal pain within weeks after delivery. Its incidence is exceedingly rare, occurring in 0.05% of all pregnancies that result in live births and peaking around 2-6 days after delivery. Its preferential involvement of the right ovarian vein may be explained by the compression of the inferior vena cava and the right ovarian vein due to dextrorotation of the uterus during pregnancy. Furthermore, antegrade flow of blood and multiple incompetent valves in the right ovarian vein favours bacterial infection. Complications may include sepsis and thrombus extension to the inferior vena cava or left renal vein and rarely, pulmonary embolism. The authors present the case of a 27-year-old woman with lower abdominal pain 5 weeks after an elective caesarean section. Although the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis was initially considered, a CT suggested a right OVT. She commenced treatment with low-molecular weight heparin. A high index of clinical suspicion is required in order to establish the diagnosis of this rare cause of abdominal pain, which can mimic an acute abdomen.","Dunphy, Louise; Tang, Aie Wei",BMJ case reports,,178

This is particularly important for COVID-19, where many individuals are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms but can still spread the disease. Current systems for controlling transmission rely on patients to report their symptoms to medical professionals and be able to recall and trace all their contacts from the previous few days. This is unrealistic in the modern world. However, existing smartphone-based GPS and social media technology may provide a suitable alternative. We, therefore, developed a mini-program within the app WeChat. This analyzes data from all users and traces close contacts of all patients. This permits early tracing and quarantine of potential sources of infection. Data from the mini-program can also be merged with other data to predict epidemic trends, calculate individual and population risks, and provide recommendations for individual and population protection action. It may also improve our understanding of how the disease spreads. However, there are a number of unresolved questions about the use of smartphone data for health surveillance, including how to protect individual privacy and provide safeguards against data breaches.","Wang, Shaoxiong; Ding, Shuizi; Xiong, Li",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,178

Governments have implemented lockdown measures, blocked international travel, and enforced other public containment measures to mitigate the virus morbidity and mortality. As of today, no drug has the power to fight the infection and bring normalcy to the utter chaos. This leaves us with only one choice namely an effective and safe vaccine that shall be manufactured as soon as possible and available to all countries and populations affected by the pandemic at an affordable price. There has been an unprecedented fast track path taken in Research & Development by the World community for developing an effective and safe vaccine. Platform technology has been exploited to develop candidate vaccines in a matter of days to weeks, and as of now, 108 such vaccines are available. Six of these vaccines have entered clinical trials. As clinical trials are ""rate-limiting"" and ""time-consuming"", many innovative methods are in practice for a fast track. These include parallel phase I-II trials and obtaining efficacy data from phase IIb trials. Human ""challenge experiments"" to confirm efficacy in humans is under serious consideration.

A biphasic course has been described in some infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), beginning with a flu-like illness followed by an intense inflammatory response characterized by elevated c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality. The exuberant and possibly dysregulated immune response has prompted interest in therapeutic agents that target the cytokines involved, particularly IL-6. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist with a record of use for a variety of rheumatologic conditions and cytokine release syndrome due to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy but experience in solid organ and composite tissue transplant recipients (SOT/CTTRs) with SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS has not been previously reported in detail.

395876,Coronary artery bypass grafting after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction,2021,"INTRODUCTION: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak globally, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. Danoprevir boosted by ritonavir (Ganovo) is a potent hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor, which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. METHODS: This is an open-label, single arm study evaluating the effects of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir on treatment naïve and experienced COVID-19 patients for the first time. Patients received danoprevir boosted by ritonavir (100âmg/100âmg, twice per day). The primary endpoint was the rate of composite adverse outcomes and efficacy was also evaluated. RESULTS: The data showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. No patient had composite adverse outcomes during this study. After initiation of danoprevir/ritonavir treatment, the first negative reverse real-time PCR (RT-PCR) test occurred at a median of 2 days, ranging from 1 to 8 days, and the obvious absorption in CT scans occurred at a median 3 days, ranging from 2 to 4 days. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all enrolled 11 patients were discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.","Chen, Hongyi; Zhang, Zhicheng; Wang, Li; Huang, Zhihua; Gong, Fanghua; Li, Xiaodong; Chen, Yahong; Wu, Jinzi J",Medicine (Baltimore),,178

397420,Coping with Mental Health Challenges During COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily known as a respiratory illness; however, a wide variety of symptoms and complications of the central nervous system (CNS), such as ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) have been reported. Hereby, we provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, investigating the incidence of ischemic CVA and the mortality due to it in the setting of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our search databases included Google Scholar, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus. We searched the databases up to July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases, while the secondary outcomes were the ratio of mortality in these cases. Standard meta-analysis methods used to measure the pooled incidence and mortality rates of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: After excluding studies with reasons, only 20 articles were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were evaluated quantitatively in our meta-analysis. Included studies reported a pooled average incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA, ranging from 1.3% to 2.3%. Mortality in patients of ischemic CVA to all COVID-19 cases was 0.5%, ranging from 0.4% to 0.6%. The mortality rate of patients with CVA to those who suffered from COVID-19 infection and ischemic CVA simultaneously was 29.2% ranging from 21.6% to 38.2%. Overall, the heterogeneity of the studies was high. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed a pooled incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection, with a mortality rate of 29.2% amongst the COVID-19 patients who are suffering ischemic CVA.","Parsay, Sina; Vosoughi, Armin; Khabbaz, Aytak; Sadigh-Eteghad, Saeed",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,178

399930,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19-Infected Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is largely caused by airborne transmission, a phenomenon that rapidly gained the attention of the scientific community. Social distancing is of paramount importance to limit the spread of the disease, but to design social distancing rules on a scientific basis the process of dispersal of virus containing respiratory droplets must be understood. Here, we demonstrate that available knowledge is largely inadequate to make predictions on the reach of infectious droplets emitted during a cough and on their infectious potential. We follow the position and evaporation of thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough. We find that different initial distributions of droplet size taken from literature and different ambient relative humidity lead to opposite conclusions: (1) most vs none of the viral content settles in the first 1-2 m; (2) viruses are carried entirely on dry nuclei vs on liquid droplets; (3) small droplets travel less than 2.5 m vs more than 7.5 m. We point to two key issues that need to be addressed urgently in order to provide a scientific foundation to social distancing rules: (I1) a careful characterisation of the initial distribution of droplet sizes; (I2) the infectious potential of viruses carried on dry nuclei vs liquid droplets.","Rosti, M.

400158,Prevention and Control of Acute Respiratory Viral Infections in Adult Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Ginseng-Based Clinical Trials,2021,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the subject of a numerous research projects over the past year. In cases with a severe disease course or threatening long-term impairment due to disease, the German health care system offers insured persons the possibility of medical rehabilitation. In contrast to what was observed and expected at the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity are represented in rehabilitation. To date, there is no common consensus on the content and aftercare of rehabilitation nor is there any knowledge about the short- and long-term effects of such a rehabilitation programme. In addition, these aspects were not considered with regard to the varying severity of the course of the disease. The present research project investigates this question. METHODS: The study sample will consist of N = 350 rehabilitants after COVID-19 and a comparison group (CG) with N = 230 rehabilitants suffering from an obstructive respiratory disease. The participants will be recruited at five German rehabilitation facilities and undergo medical rehabilitation. This prospective, exploratory, multicentre, mixed-methods study will be evaluated as follows: (A) The quantitative portion includes questionnaires at different points in time (at the beginning and end of rehabilitation, after six and twelve months) and contains standardised measurement instruments. For example, participation limitations, quality of life, health status, fatigue, psychomental limitations and disorders, performance in different areas of life and ability to work are measured. (B) Qualitative interviews are held at different times (end of rehabilitation, after six and twelve months), and an expert workshop is conducted. Topics are rehabilitation content, satisfaction and aftercare as well as different outcomes on subjective health and participation impairments. DISCUSSION: Studies on other indications have already shown that pneumological rehabilitation has positive effects. Thus, it is expected that an improvement in different dimensions will be observed at the end of rehabilitation in both groups. With regard to the different severities of COVID-19, this study evaluates the long-term developments. Subsequently, the authors will elaborate concrete recommendations for medical rehabilitation after different courses of disease with regard to existing pneumological rehabilitation concepts.

Their caregivers must now adapt to increased stressors such as lack of access to needed therapies, medical supplies, and nursing care. Prior to COVID-19 these families were already marginalized, and this has only worsened during the pandemic. As a vulnerable population, children with disabilities have not been the focus of much discussion during the pandemic, likely because the disease disproportionately impacts older individuals. Nonetheless, children with disabilities should be a focus of evaluation and intervention to mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19 and the resulting containment strategies. Their needs should be included in future crisis planning, as well. In order to raise awareness of pediatric rehabilitation professionals, health care administrators, policy makers, and advocates, this manuscript provides a discussion of the following topics: the immediate and ongoing impacts on children with disabilities and their families, the ethical concerns and implications of triage protocols for scarce resources that consider disability in their scoring systems, and optimizing medical care and educational needs in the time of COVID.","Houtrow, Amy; Harris, Debbi; Molinero, Ashli; Levin-Decanini, Tal; Robichaud, Christopher",J Pediatr Rehabil Med,,178

401387,"Editorial Comment on ""Multicenter Study of Temporal Changes and Prognostic Value of a CT Visual Severity Score in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)""",2021,"Population detonation and rapid industrialization are the major factors behind the reduction in cultivable land that affects crop production seriously. This situation is further being deteriorated due to the negative effects of abiotic stresses. Under such conditions, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are found to improve crop production which is essential for sustainable agriculture. This study is focused on the isolation of potent arsenic (As)-resistant PGPR from the agricultural land of West Bengal, India, and its application to reduce As translocation in rice seedlings. After screening, an As-resistant PGPR strain AS18 was identified by phenotypic characters and 16S rDNA sequence-based homology as Pantoea dispersa. This strain displayed nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) activity, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, in addition to As (III) resistance up to 3750 µg/mL. The As removal efficiency of this strain was up to 93.12% from the culture medium as evidenced by AAS. The bioaccumulation property of AS18 strain was further validated by TEM-EDAX-XRD-XRF-FTIR studies. This strain showed significant morpho-biochemical improvements including antioxidant enzymatic activities and As-minimization in plant (rice) cells. Thus, being an As-resistant potent PGPR, AS18 strain is expected to be applied in As-spiked agricultural fields for bioremediation and phytostimulation.","Ghosh, Antara; Pramanik, Krishnendu; Bhattacharya, Shatabda; Mondal, Sayanta; Ghosh, Sudip Kumar; Ghosh, Pallab Kumar; Maiti, Tushar Kanti",,,178

We consider a general incidence rate function with a non-monotonicity property to interpret the psychological effect in the susceptible population. After we propose the model, we provide the well-posedness property and calculate the effective reproduction number R E . Then, we obtain the threshold dynamics of the system with respect to R E by studying the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium when R E < 1 and the system persistence when R E > 1 . For the endemic equilibrium, we use the semi-discretization method to analyze its linear stability. Then, we discuss the critical vaccination coverage rate that is required to eliminate the disease. Numerical simulations are provided to implement a case study regarding data of influenza patients, study the local and global sensitivity of R E < 1 , construct approximate stability charts for the endemic equilibrium over different parameter spaces and explore the sensitivity of the proposed model solutions.","Al-Darabsah, Isam",Nonlinear Dyn,,178

Societal measures against the spread of COVID-19 can have both short-term and long-term consequences on IAS. In the short-term, reduced human disturbance on natural habitats can increase the activity of IAS and accelerate their spread. Furthermore, management agencies have reduced control activities, sometimes allowing IAS to thrive, and ongoing monitoring programs have been interrupted, hindering rapid identification and management of biological invasions. Long-term impacts could include global modifications to wildlife trade and increased releases of captive-bred species because of the fear of zoonotic diseases and also greater public awareness of the risks of pathogens being spread among animal populations.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) provide the first line of defense against any disease outbreak. Thus, the present study is designed to assess HCWs' attitudes towards, knowledge of, and awareness of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using an online survey on social media; the participants were 597 adults. The study was conducted from March to April 2020. The questionnaire was randomly administered on Arabic-language social media applications; the 26-item survey assessed knowledge levels, attitudes, and practices. RESULTS: The analysis includes 597 complete responses from HCWs; participants included physicians, nurses, medical students, and pharmacists. Most participants were females aged 18 to 25 years. Most participants agreed that the virus can spread via direct and indirect contact. Most participants indicated that they wash their hands; avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth; and avoid crowded places to protect themselves against infection. Most indicated that a bat was the original source of the virus. Most participating HCWs indicated that the symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Most of the participants also indicated that there is no specific treatment for patients infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this work can support the design of effective measures to prevent and control COVID-19 infections during the pandemic.

Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drug's P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.","Arutyunova, Elena; Khan, Muhammad Bashir; Fischer, Conrad; Lu, Jimmy; Lamer, Tess; Vuong, Wayne; van Belkum, Marco J; McKay, Ryan T; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Vederas, John C; Young, Howard S; Lemieux, M Joanne",J Mol Biol,,178

Its long-term cardiac manifestations, however, remain unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a Caucasian patient with a mild and self-limited presentation of COVID-19, with subsequent development, months later, of exertional dyspnea and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, long after resolution of his illness and after returning to aerobic exercise. The patient had normal screening tests including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram 4 months after his illness. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated epicardial and pericardial fibrosis of the right ventricle free wall and outflow tract and the pericardium over the anterior wall, 6 months following the initial infection. First abnormal ECG was recorded at month 7 following illness. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests an insidious and possible long-term cardiac involvement and reflects the challenges in traditional workups and screening modalities in identifying cardiac involvement in COVID-19.","Solaimanzadeh, Jonathan; Freilich, Aaron; Sood, Michael R",J Med Case Rep,,178

This phenomenon, termed COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, is now considered a major component of the pathophysiology of this novel infectious disease, leading to widespread thrombosis. While at first, the vascular insults may be limited to the pulmonary microvasculature, as the disease progresses, systemic involvement occurs, culminating in distant organ thrombosis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. In this review article, we discuss recent insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and review the clinical, histopathologic, and laboratory evidence, which leads us to conclude that COVID-19 is both a pulmonary and vascular disorder.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Lavie, Carl J; Henry, Brandon M",Mayo Clin Proc,,178

The new coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2 by scientists spreads rapidly, causing fear, deaths, and threats for the economy of several countries. This work aimed to describe the clinical characterization of the first cases of a new Brazilian variant of SARS-CoV-2 (P1) in the State of Alagoas, which occurred on February 16th, 2021. Two cases are described: first, a person infected in Amazonas State, where the new variant P1 was first described, who migrated to Alagoas State, and second, a case of probable community transmission within Alagoas, since the patient had no history of recent travel. In both confirmed cases the symptoms were mild. Further studies are necessary to better understand the clinical behavior of P1 SARS-CoV-2 variant and also the associated sequelae in the context of COVID-19.","da Silva, José Claudio; Félix, Valtuir Barbosa; Leão, Sura Amélia Barbosa Felix; Trindade-Filho, Euclides Maurício; Scorza, Fulvio Alexandre",Braz J Infect Dis,,178
413429,Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy for a Patient with Severe COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: There has been no systematic comparison of how the policy response to past infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics was funded. This study aims to collate and analyse funding for the Ebola epidemic and Zika outbreak between 2014 and 2019 in order to understand the shortcomings in funding reporting and suggest improvements. METHODS: Data were collected via a literature review and analysis of financial reporting databases, including both amounts donated and received. Funding information from three financial databases was analysed: Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation's Development Assistance for Health database, the Georgetown Infectious Disease Atlas and the United Nations Financial Tracking Service. A systematic literature search strategy was devised and applied to seven databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, HMIC, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and EconLit. Funding information was extracted from articles meeting the eligibility criteria and measures were taken to avoid double counting. Funding was collated, then amounts and purposes were compared within, and between, data sources. RESULTS: Large differences between funding reported by different data sources, and variations in format and methodology, made it difficult to arrive at precise estimates of funding amounts and purpose. Total disbursements reported by the databases ranged from $2.5 to $3.2 billion for Ebola and $150-$180 million for Zika. Total funding reported in the literature is greater than reported in databases, suggesting that databases may either miss funding, or that literature sources overreport. Databases and literature disagreed on the main purpose of funding for socioeconomic recovery versus outbreak response. One of the few consistent findings across data sources and diseases is that the USA was the largest donor. CONCLUSION: Implementation of several recommendations would enable more effective mapping and deployment of outbreak funding for response activities relating to COVID-19 and future epidemics.","Quirk, Emily Jade; Gheorghe, Adrian; Hauck, Katharina",,,178
413430,Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy for a Patient with Severe COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a worldwide epidemic, and various countries have responded with different containment measures to reduce disease transmission, including stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns. Comparative studies have not yet been conducted to investigate the impact of these containment measures; these studies are needed to facilitate public health policy-making across countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the impact of national containment measures and policies (stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns) on decelerating the increase in daily new cases of COVID-19 in 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the pandemic in different jurisdictions worldwide. METHODS: We reviewed the effective dates of the national containment measures (stay-at-home order, curfew, or lockdown) of 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wuhan, New York State, Lombardy, and Madrid), and we searched cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and daily new cases provided by health authorities. Data were drawn from an open, crowdsourced, daily-updated COVID-19 data set provided by Our World in Data. We examined the trends in the percent increase in daily new cases from 7 days before to 30 days after the dates on which containment measures went into effect by continent, World Bank income classification, type of containment measures, effective date of containment measures, and number of confirmed cases on the effective date of the containment measures. RESULTS: We included 122,366 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 54 countries and 24,071 patients from 4 epicenters on the effective dates on which stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns were implemented between January 23 and April 11, 2020. Stay-at-home, curfew, and lockdown measures commonly commenced in countries with approximately 30%, 20%, or 10% increases in daily new cases. All three measures were found to lower the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within one month. Among the countries studied, 20% had an average percent increase in daily new cases of 30-49 over the seven days prior to the commencement of containment measures; the percent increase in daily new cases in these countries was curbed to 10 and 5 a maximum of 15 days and 23 days after the implementation of containment measures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Different national containment measures were associated with a decrease in daily new cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns curbed the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within a month. Resurgence in cases within one month was observed in some South American countries.","Wong, Carlos K H; Wong, Janet Y H; Tang, Eric H M; Au, Chi Ho; Lau, Kristy T K; Wai, Abraham K C",J Med Internet Res,,178

419547,Patients with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and Surgery: Guidelines and Checklist Proposal,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The high mortality of severe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is mainly caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barriers, pulmonary oedema and consequently inflammatory tissue damage. Some but not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process. We focused on crucial roles of lung progenitor cells in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment and aimed to uncover a possible mechanism of lung repair after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients was analysed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Transplantation of a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung and time-course scRNA-seq analysis was performed. RESULTS: In severe (or critical) COVID-19 patients, there is a remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. The transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engraft into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: This work uncovered the mechanism by which various lung progenitor cells work in concert to prevent and replenish alveoli loss post-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhao, Zixian; Zhao, Yu; Zhou, Yueqing; Wang, Xiaofan; Zhang, Ting; Zuo, Wei",Cell Prolif,,178

422398,Achieving a Popliteal Venous Access for RRT in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patient in Prone position,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Currently, diabetes mellitus (DM) as well as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are major public health issues worldwide. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that patients with DM are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suffer from more severe forms of the disease. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus and Google search engines. RESULTS: Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in the human host. The differential expression of ACE2 in the lungs of patients with DM makes them more susceptible to COVID-19. Additionally, acute or chronic hyperglycemia renders individuals in an immune-suppressive state, with impaired innate and adaptive immunity function, contributing also to the severity of COVID-19 infection among patients with DM. Other factors contributing to a more severe course of COVID-19 include the co-existence of obesity in T2DM; the endothelial inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which aggravates the endothelial dysfunction observed in both T1DM and T2DM; and the hypercoagulability presented in COVID-19 infection that increases the thrombotic tendency in DM. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the co-existence of both pandemics as well as the current recommendations and future perspectives regarding optimal treatment of inpatients and outpatients with DM in the era of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the current recommended drugs for the treatment of severe COVID-19, dexamethasone and remdesivir, may cause hyperglycemia, an adverse effect that physicians should bear in mind, when caring for patients with DM and COVID-19.","Vallianou, Natalia G; Evangelopoulos, Angelos; Kounatidis, Dimitris; Stratigou, Theodora; Christodoulatos, Gerasimos Socrates; Karampela, Irene; Dalamaga, Maria",Curr. diabetes rev.

Of 317 research articles generated from our initial search on PubMed and preprint archives on 21 February 2020, 41 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Current evidence suggests that it takes about 3-7 days for the epidemic to double in size. Of 21 estimates for the basic reproduction number ranging from 1.9 to 6.5, 13 were between 2.0 and 3.0. The incubation period was estimated to be 4-6 days, whereas the serial interval was estimated to be 4-8 days. Though the true case fatality risk is yet unknown, current model-based estimates ranged from 0.3% to 1.4% for outside China.

427262,Tracheostomy in Critically Ill Children-Bypassing the Hurdle and Running into More!,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discoveries. Current platforms available for the distribution of scientific and clinical research data and information include preprint repositories and traditional peer-reviewed journals. In recent times, social media has emerged as a helpful platform to share scientific and medical discoveries. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively analyze activity on social media (specifically, Twitter) and that related to publications in the form of preprint and peer-reviewed journal articles in the context of COVID-19 and gastroenterology during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID-19-related data from Twitter (tweets and user data) and articles published in preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv) as well as in the PubMed database were collected and analyzed during the first 6 months of the pandemic, from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ-specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity. Any relationship between Twitter activity and preprint articles published and that between Twitter activity and PubMed articles published overall, by organ system, and by geographic location were identified using Spearman's rank-order correlation. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7164 journal publications, and 4702 preprint publications were retrieved. Twitter activity (ie, number of tweets) peaked in March 2020, whereas preprint and publication activity (ie, number of articles published) peaked in April 2020. Overall, strong correlations were identified between trends in Twitter activity and preprint and publication activity (P<.001 for both). COVID-19 data across the three platforms mainly concentrated on pulmonology or critical care, but when analyzing the field of gastroenterology specifically, most tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal gastroenterology. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between trends in Twitter and publication activity for all gastroenterology topics (luminal gastroenterology: P=.009; hepatology and inflammatory bowel disease: P=.006; gastrointestinal endoscopy: P=.007), except pancreatology (P=.20), suggesting that Twitter activity did not correlate with publication activity for this topic. Finally, Twitter activity was the highest in the United States (7331 tweets), whereas PubMed activity was the highest in China (1768 publications). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential of social media as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis. Sharing and spreading information on COVID-19 in a timely manner during the pandemic has been paramount; this was achieved at a much faster pace on social media, particularly on Twitter. Future investigation could demonstrate how social media can be used to augment and promote scholarly activity, especially as the world begins to increasingly rely on digital or virtual platforms. Scientists and clinicians should consider the use of social media in augmenting public awareness regarding their scholarly pursuits.","Taneja, Sonia L; Passi, Monica; Bhattacharya, Sumona; Schueler, Samuel A; Gurram, Sandeep; Koh, Christopher",J Med Internet Res,,178

In addition to the ability to filter particles (e.g. filtration efficiency, FE), the standards address breathability (e.g. differential pressure), how well the mask seals to a worker's face (e.g. fit test), the level of protection from a fluid splash, and other factors. Standards used in the USA, European Union (EU), and China were compared with respect to testing methods and certification criteria. Although there are substantial similarities in standards for respirators, such as surgical N95, FFP2, and KN95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), there are differences with respect to who performs that testing and fit-testing requirements that influence certification. There is greater variation in test methods between countries for surgical (USA) or medical (EU and China) masks than for FFRs. Surgical/medical masks can be certified to different levels of protection. The impact of the similarities and differences in testing methods and certification criteria on FFR and mask performance for protecting healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 are discussed, as well as the value of a new standard in the EU for testing fabrics for masks used by the public. Health and safety personnel in healthcare settings must understand the differences between standards so that they can select respirators and masks that provide appropriate protection for healthcare workers.","Jones, Rachael M; Rempel, David",Ann Work Expo Health,,178

A wealth of information about drug and small molecule structure, targets, indications and side effects; induced gene expression signatures; and other attributes are publicly available through web-based tools, databases and repositories. By processing, abstracting and aggregating information from these resources into drug set libraries, knowledge about novel properties of drugs and small molecules can be systematically imputed with machine learning. In addition, drug set libraries can be used as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis. Here, we present Drugmonizome, a database with a search engine for querying annotated sets of drugs and small molecules for performing drug set enrichment analysis. Utilizing the data within Drugmonizome, we also developed Drugmonizome-ML. Drugmonizome-ML enables users to construct customized machine learning pipelines using the drug set libraries from Drugmonizome. To demonstrate the utility of Drugmonizome, drug sets from 12 independent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro screens were subjected to consensus enrichment analysis. Despite the low overlap among these 12 independent in vitro screens, we identified common biological processes critical for blocking viral replication. To demonstrate Drugmonizome-ML, we constructed a machine learning pipeline to predict whether approved and preclinical drugs may induce peripheral neuropathy as a potential side effect. Overall, the Drugmonizome and Drugmonizome-ML resources provide rich and diverse knowledge about drugs and small molecules for direct systems pharmacology applications.

Medline and Embase were searched for nursing homes, long-term care facilities, respiratory tract infections, disease transmission, infection control, mortality, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. For seniors, there is strong evidence to vaccinate against influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and pneumococcal disease, and evidence is awaited for effectiveness against COVID-19 variants and when to revaccinate. There is strong evidence to promptly introduce comprehensive infection control interventions in LCFTs: no admissions from inpatient wards with COVID-19 patients;quarantine and monitor new admissions in single-patient rooms;screen residents, staff and visitors daily for temperature and symptoms;and staff work in only one home. Depending on the vaccination situation and the current risk situation, visiting restrictions and meals in the residents’ own rooms may be necessary, and reduce crowding with individual patient rooms. Regional LTCF administrators should closely monitor and provide staff and PPE resources. The CDC COVID-19 tool measures 33 infection control indicators. Hand washing, social distancing, PPE (gowns, gloves, masks, eye protection), enhanced cleaning of rooms and high-touch surfaces need comprehensive implementation while awaiting more studies at low risk of bias.

430977,Critical Illness and Systemic Inflammation Are Key Risk Factors of Severe Acute Kidney Injury in Patients With COVID-19,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronovirus, urges a focused search for the underlying mechanisms and treatment options. The lung is the major target organ of COVID-19, wherein the primary cause of mortality is hypoxic respiratory failure, resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome, with severe hypoxemia, often requiring assisted ventilation. While similar in some ways to acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to other causes, lungs of some patients dying with COVID-19 exhibit distinct features of vascular involvement, including severe endothelial injury and cell death via apoptosis and/or pyroptosis, widespread capillary inflammation, and thrombosis. Furthermore, the pulmonary pathology of COVID-19 is characterized by focal inflammatory cell infiltration, impeding alveolar gas exchange resulting in areas of local tissue hypoxia, consistent with potential amplification of COVID-19 pathogenicity by hypoxia. Vascular endothelial cells play essential roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses, and are considered to be ""conditional innate immune cells"" centrally participating in various inflammatory, immune pathologies. Activated endothelial cells produce cytokines/chemokines, dynamically recruit and activate inflammatory cells and platelets, and centrally participate in pro-thrombotic processes (thrombotic microangiopathies). Initial reports presented pathological findings of localized direct infection of vascular endothelial cells with SARS-CoV-2, yet emerging evidence does not support direct infection of endothelial or other vascular wall cell and thus widespread endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation may be better explained as secondary responses to epithelial cell infection and inflammation. Endothelial cells are also actively engaged in a cross-talk with the complement system, the essential arm of innate immunity. Recent reports present evidence for complement deposition in SARS-CoV-2-damaged lung microcirculation, further strengthening the idea that, in severe cases of COVID-19, complement activation is an essential player, generating destructive hemorrhagic, capillaritis-like tissue damage, clotting, and hyperinflammation. Thus, complement-targeted therapies are actively in development. This review is intended to explore in detail these ideas.","Stenmark, K. R.; Frid, M. G.; Gerasimovskaya, E.; Zhang, H.; McCarthy, M.

There are two major elements to immunity that are necessary to model: primary immune tissues and peripheral tissues with immune components. Here, we systematically review progress made along three strategies to modeling immunity: ex vivo cultures, which preserve native tissue structure; microfluidic devices, which constitute a versatile approach to providing physiologically relevant fluid flow and environmental control; and engineered tissues, which provide precise control of the 3D microenvironment and biophysical cues. While many models focus on disease modeling, more primary immune tissue models are necessary to advance the field. Moving forward, we anticipate that the expansion of patient-specific models may inform why immunity varies from patient to patient and allow for the rapid comprehension and treatment of emerging diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019.

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the delivery of clinical placements in primary care; GPs are currently delivering the majority of consultations using telephone or video methods and difficulties in attaining placement experience are being encountered by medical students. Virtual remote consultations are an appropriate adjunct to conventional face-to-face patient encounters and could facilitate students to attain core learning outcomes. This article describes some of the approaches that enable remote (home) virtual patient encounters in Primary Care for medical students. These are categorised as methods that a) enable remote access into GP clinical systems, b) enable remote access into individual patient consultations and c) enable an observational-only experience. Key considerations are highlighted to enable safe and effective implementation of remote virtual consultations, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each method. These include patient consent, confidentiality, data sharing and protection, professionalism, student agreements and data gathering templates. It is hoped that sharing of these methods of virtual consulting will support the ongoing delivery of Primary Care education across medical schools.","Taggar, Jaspal; Saha, Runa; Hopwood-Carr, Paula; Patel, Bakula; Johnson, Christine",Educ Prim Care,,178

First, despite genuine desire and goodwill, and the Paris and Accra declarations, global health remains insufficiently country-centred. COVID-19 has provoked impressive examples of global solidarity, but it has also shown that individual decisions at the national level matter more for health than regional and multilateral institutions and mechanisms, including global health treaties and strategies. Global health practice often fails to fully engage with the individual context, policy cycles, and political economy of national health and social systems. Second, COVID-19 has already questioned and reworked the tools of global health. Resolutions, special sessions, high-level commissions, reports, frameworks, and global action plans can still be useful, but too often global health practice is delivered using the same means as were being used many decades ago. COVID-19, with its limitations on travel, has shown that a strong physical presence within countries is more important than ever. Third, COVID-19 has brought to the boil the already simmering discontent about who gets to make decisions in global health and their relationship to global health's intended beneficiaries. The discourse on the need to decolonise global health has become prominent and persuasive (although still itself dominated by those based in high-income countries), and the struggle for greater gender equality in its practice and leadership has made important gains. Moreover, the poor performance of many high resource contexts, including in preventing inequities in outcomes of COVID-19, has made prominent the shifting poles of where public health excellence actually occurs and questioned why global health leadership continues to be dominated by and concentrated in a handful of countries. Fourth, COVID-19 has again shown the limitations of global and national governance in stewarding multisectoral action to tackle complex problems, notwithstanding prominent national exceptions. Finally and most importantly, the dismal performance in terms of equity for COVID-19's impacts demands a reckoning. Whether in terms of the distribution of commodities such as vaccines, the sadly predictable concentration of mortality in disadvantaged groups within countries, the social and economic impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions, or access to health care, COVID-19 has shown that, despite decades of rhetoric on the importance of health equity, little has been achieved in terms of mainstreaming its priority within approaches to health. It has never been clearer that attention to the social determinants of health is neither utopian nor abstract but instead fundamental to the effectiveness of public health practice.","Rasanathan, K.",Lancet,,178

METHODS: We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic variables, working conditions, family dynamics, and mental health variables in nurses working in healthcare settings, in Portugal, during the Covid-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Portuguese nurses presented higher depression, anxiety and stress levels, when compared to the Portuguese general population, during the outbreak. Overall, nurses who did not consider the quantity and quality of personal protective equipment as adequate presented significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.

446051,Effective Chest CT-Based Diagnosis for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2020,"The genetic code contains information that impacts the efficiency and rate of translation. Translation elongation plays a crucial role in determining the composition of the proteome, errors within a protein contributes towards disease processes. It is important to analyze the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) at the codon level to find similarities and variations in hosts to compare with other human coronavirus (CoVs). This requires a comparative and comprehensive study of various human and zoonotic nature CoVs relating to codon usage bias, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), proportions of slow codons, and slow di-codons, the effective number of codons (ENC), mutation bias, codon adaptation index (CAI), and codon frequencies. In this work, seven different CoVs were analyzed to determine the protein synthesis rate and the adaptation of these viruses to the host cell. The result reveals that the proportions of slow codons and slow di-codons in human host of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV found to be similar and very less compared to the other five coronavirus types, which suggest that the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have faster protein synthesis rate. Zoonotic CoVs have high RSCU and codon adaptation index than human CoVs which implies the high translation rate in zoonotic viruses. All CoVs have more AT% than GC% in genetic codon compositions. The average ENC values of seven CoVs ranged between 38.36 and 49.55, which implies the CoVs are highly conserved and are easily adapted to host cells. The mutation rate of 2019-nCoV is comparatively less than MERS-CoV and NL63 that shows an evidence for genetic diversity. Host-specific codon composition analysis portrays the relation between viral host sequences and the capability of novel virus replication in host cells. Moreover, the analysis provides useful measures for evaluating a virus-host adaptation, transmission potential of novel viruses, and thus contributes to the strategies of anti-viral drug design.","Dasari, Chandra Mohan; Bhukya, Raju",Infect Genet Evol,,178

Method: 13 patients with mild COVID-19 who were confirmed without diabetes and another group of 18 healthy individuals with available CGM data were well matched and enrolled into the final analysis. Results: We noticed significantly higher TARs of > 140 mg/dL (median 13.9% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.006), > 160 mg/dL (median 4.7% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.011) and > 180 mg/dL (median 1.9% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.007) among non-diabetic patients with COVID-19 than those among healthy individuals. There was no significant difference in TBR of < 70 mg/dL or < 54 mg/dL (all P > 0.1). Consequently, the TIR of 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL was significantly lower in non-diabetic patients with COVID-19 than that in healthy individuals (median 80.1% vs. 93.1%, P = 0.001). Significant postprandial glycemic fluctuations were observed among patients with COVID-19. There was a remarkable difference in CV in non-diabetic patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy individuals (median 25.6% vs. 15.7%, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Significant higher glycemic fluctuation and exposure to hyperglycemia was associated with COVID-19 among previously normoglycemic individuals, characterized with potentially impaired glucose tolerance.","Shen, Yun; Zhang, Lei; Fan, Xiaohong; Zhou, Jian",Obes Med,,178

There were 6 males and 5 females, aged from 17 to 64 years old, with the mean age of 42.27±15.67. Results A majority of the patients fell into mild type and only one was of severe type. Clinical manifestations were mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough. For laboratory tests, the patients' lymphocyte and eosinophil counts decreased, while their C-reactive protein concentration increased. In terms of CT findings, 7 patients showed bilateral subpleural involvement. The ground glass opacity (GGO) was common in CT findings. Typical crazy paving sign, air bronchogram and halo sign were also found. During the progression of the disease, GGO might be associated with pulmonary consolidation. No enlarged lymph nodes or pleural effusion were seen in all the patients. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 have distinctly characteristic chest CT manifestations and laboratory examination findings, which play a vital role in diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.","Xiang, Ying; Yu, Dexin; Qin, Xingru; Li, Xiaohui; Zhang, Qiujuan",J.

In this essay, a patient recovering from COVID-19 analyzes how histories of epidemics often follow the logic proposed by the discipline of epidemiology itself: a focus on acute cases and on a tracking of the ""peak(s)"" often means that longer temporalities of suffering are hidden. In contrast, this essay follows ""Long Covid""-an illness collectively made and named by patients, which changed how the natural history of a new disease (COVID-19) was being mapped out by conventional scientific experts. Long Covid conceptualizes time differently from common categories and prefixes used in medicine and epidemiology, such as the ""chronic"" or the ""post-."" The collective labor of ill people thinking from the sickbed-both those with Long Covid and those working to bring to visibility other illnesses and the sequelae of other epidemics-has allowed other possible arrangements of sick bodies, symptoms, and diagnostic classifications to come into view. These arrangements hold potential for historians of medicine, as well as for clinical scientists.","Callard, Felicity",Bull Hist Med,,178

This article discusses issues related to (science) communication at different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic timeline. We consider the role of communication for prevention from the ecological perspective, taking into consideration that many emerging pathogens, including COVID-19, likely arise in part due to anthropogenic changes to natural environments. Communication forms part of the early response setting the scene for public buy-in of public health interventions at the start of an outbreak, as well as to maintain precautions over time. Finally, communication is a key element in increasing acceptance for new tools that require mass uptake to be effective, as seen with roll-out challenges for the COVID-19 vaccines, which faced heightened concerns of efficacy and safety while mired with rampant misinformation. Ultimately, strategies for prevention of viral epidemics such as COVID-19 must include communication strategies at the forefront to reduce the risk of the emergence of new diseases and enhance efforts to control their spread and burden. Despite key themes emerging, what constitutes effective communication strategies for different people and contexts needs to be investigated further.","Mohd Hanafiah, Khayriyyah; Ng, Celine; Wan, Abdul Matiin",Viruses,,178

This study aimed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur from presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.MethodsãWe surveyed all directors of Japanese public health centers for index cases and secondary patients who possibly contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individual who came under their care before June 20, 2020. The professional staff at the centers routinely perform contact tracing of infected persons based on the guidelines of the Infection Control Act. Four authors independently reviewed reports of 9 index cases of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with 17 secondary patients from 8 prefectures and examined the cases to determine whether transmission from a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual in the presymptomatic or asymptomatic state occurred.ResultsãWe reported 7 index cases with 13 secondary patients. 1) An elderly woman acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from her sustained asymptomatic granddaughter at home, 2) 4 guests and 1 accompanying child waiting at a hair salon acquired infection from the presymptomatic female hair stylist, 3) 2 inpatients acquired infection from a presymptomatic nurse while providing nursing care in close contact, 4) an elderly couple acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from their presymptomatic relative who was in the 50s during household care at their home, 5) a man acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic adult neighbor in an enclosed space with poor ventilation, 6) a presymptomatic man had transmitted infection to another man at a coffee shop while having a discussion on business, and 7) a man in his 50s acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic man during 50 minutes of close contact at their office and in a car. These secondary patients had no other likely routes of infection. The interval between the date of symptom onset in the presymptomatic index case and the secondary patient ranged from 2 to 6 days. The incidence rates at the time these infections occurred in the corresponding prefectures ranged from 0.00 to 6.56 cases/1 million person-days.ConclusionãWe report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from a sustained asymptomatic index case in Japan.

The objectives were to analyse the prevalence of low serum testosterone (LT) and impaired fertility potential (Leydig and Sertoli cells dysfunction, respectively) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) male survivors and to evaluate acute infection-related associated factors. Also, we explore its association with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and quality of life (QOL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male adults recovered from polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 were offered a structured evaluation 8-12 weeks after recovery. The main outcome measure(s) were as follows: LT, defined as total testosterone (TT) < 2 ng/ml or if TT levels 2-4 ng/ml as calculated free testosterone < 6.36 ng/dl; Sertoli cell dysfunction was defined as inhibin-B < 89 pg/ml. Secondary outcome-associated factors were analysed by multiple logistic regression (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval [CI]). QOL was evaluated by SF-36 v.2. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients were evaluated at a median (interquartile range) of 77 days (72-83) after disease onset; 72% of them recovered from severe pneumonia. LT was detected in 41 patients (28.7%; 95% CI: 21.8-36.5). Low levels of inhibin-B were detected in 25 patients (18.1%; 95% CI: 12.5-25.3). After multivariate adjustment, obesity and hypokalaemia were associated with LT, whereas age more than 65 was an independent predictor of Sertoli cell dysfunction. LT or Sertoli cell dysfunction was not associated with PCS. Patients with LT had a lower score in four domains of QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of male LT and impaired fertility potential in COVID-19 survivors is high in the medium term.

Given this backdrop, this research investigates the effects of the pandemics-related uncertainty on household consumption. For this purpose, we construct a simple theoretical model to study the effects of the pandemics-related uncertainty on household consumption. To estimate the theoretical model, we consider the panel dataset of 138 countries for the period from 1996 to 2017. We also use the Pandemic Uncertainty Index to measure the pandemics-related uncertainty. The theoretical model and the empirical findings from the Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) estimations indicate that the gross fixed capital formation, government consumption, balance of trade, and the Pandemic Uncertainty Index negatively affect household consumption. The results are also valid in the panel dataset of 42 high-income economies and the remaining 96 emerging economies.","Wu, Shuiting",Front Public Health,,178

In particular, there is the argument that collective selfishness, thoughtless behaviour, and over-reaction would make the effects of COVID-19 much worse. The same kinds of claims have been made in relation to other kinds of emergencies, such as fires, earthquakes, and sinking ships. We argue that in these cases as well as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, other factors are better explanations for fatalities - namely under-reaction to threat, systemic or structural factors, and mismanagement. Psychologizing disasters serves to distract from the real causes and thus from who might be held responsible. Far from being the problem, collective behaviour in emergencies - including the solidarity and cooperation so commonly witnessed among survivors - is the solution, one that should be harnessed more effectively in policy and practice.","Drury, John; Reicher, Stephen; Stott, Clifford",Br J Soc Psychol,,178

This potentially puts the surgeon and other operating theatre personnel at risk of acquiring the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 from contact with droplets or aerosols. The use of an additional drape designed to limit the spread of droplets and aerosols has been described; such drapes include the 'Southampton Tent' and 'OtoTent'. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of a novel drape 'tent' that has advantages over established 'tent' designs in terms of having: (1) a CE marking; (2) no requirement for modification during assembly; and (3) no obstruction to the surgical visual field. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: During mastoid surgery, the dispersion of macroscopic droplets and other particulate matter was confined within the novel drape 'tent'. Use of this drape 'tent' had no adverse effects upon the surgeon's manual dexterity or efficiency, the view of the surgical field, or the sterility. Hence, our findings support its use during mastoid surgery in the coronavirus disease 2019 era.","Lawrence, R J; O039,; Donoghue, G M; Kitterick, P; Hartley, D E H",J Laryngol Otol,,178

RESEARCH QUESTION: What street reallocation interventions were implemented, and what were the socio-spatial equity patterns? METHODS: We collected data on street reallocations (interventions that expand street space for active transportation or physical distancing) from April 1 to August 15, 2020 from websites and media. For each city, we summarized length of street reallocations (km) and described implementation strategies and communications. We assessed socio-spatial patterning of interventions by comparing differences in where interventions were implemented by area-level mobility, accessibility, and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Two themes motivated street reallocations: supporting mobility, recreation, and physical distancing in populous areas, and bolstering COVID-19 recovery for businesses. The scale of responses ranged across cities, from Halifax adding an additional 20% distance to their bicycle network to Kelowna closing only one main street section. Interventions were located in downtown cores, areas with high population density, higher use of active transportation, and close proximity to essential destinations. With respect to socio-demographics, interventions tended to be implemented in areas with fewer children and areas with fewer visible minority populations. In Victoria, the interventions were in areas with lower income populations and higher proportions of Indigenous people. CONCLUSION: In this early response phase, some cities acted swiftly even in the context of massive uncertainties. As cities move toward recovery and resilience, they should leverage early learnings as they act to create more permanent solutions that support safe and equitable mobility.","Fischer, Jaimy; Winters, Meghan",Can J Public Health,,178

After the correction for multiple tests, we identified 13 factors - including male sex, lower age, blood group B, and the larger household size - that increased the risk of infection and 16 factors - including mask wearing, borreliosis in the past, use of vitamin D supplements, or rooibos drinking - that decreased it. We also identified 23 factors that increased the risk of a severe course of Covid-19 and 12 factors that decreased the risk.","Flegr, Jaroslav; Flegr, Pavel; Priplatova, Lenka",,,178

The most severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also leads to life-threatening ARDS. Neutrophil counts are positively correlated with disease severity in ARDS. Neutrophil activation not only plays a significant role in immune defense against infections, but also causes tissue damage and leads to inflammatory diseases. Activated neutrophils rapidly migrate to inflamed lung tissue, releasing toxic granular contents and generating neutrophil extracellular traps. In the last few decades, it has become apparent that neutrophils occupy a central role in ARDS pathology. In this review, we summarize the neutrophil inflammatory responses and their relationships to ARDS. According to the current literature, understanding the function of neutrophils may be helpful in the treatment of ARDS.","Yang, Shun-Chin; Tsai, Yung-Fong; Pan, Yen-Lin; Hwang, Tsong-Long",Biomed. j.

Safe, effective vaccines are needed to protect this population, facilitate in-person learning and socialization, and contribute to herd immunity. METHODS: In this ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive two injections, 21 days apart, of 30 µg of BNT162b2 or placebo. Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-to-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19; onset, &#8805;7 days after dose 2) in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79 to 86% of participants], fatigue [in 60 to 66%], and headache [in 55 to 65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants relative to 16-to-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no Covid-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100). CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 vaccine in 12-to-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against Covid-19.

470604,Identification of Patients with Heart Failure in Large Datasets,2020,"In this paper we explore a time-depended SEIR model, in which the dynamics of the infection in four groups from a selected target group (population), divided according to the infection, are modeled by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Several basic parameters are involved in the model: coefficients of infection rate, incubation rate, recovery rate. The coefficients are adaptable to each specific infection, for each individual country, and depend on the measures to limit the spread of the infection and the effectiveness of the methods of treatment of the infected people in the respective country. If such coefficients are known, solving the nonlinear system is possible to be able to make some hypotheses for the development of the epidemic. This is the reason for using Bulgarian COVID-19 data to first of all, solve the so-called""inverse problem""and to find the parameters of the current situation. Reverse logic is initially used to determine the parameters of the model as a function of time, followed by computer solution of the problem. Namely, this means predicting the future behavior of these parameters, and finding (and as a consequence applying mass-scale measures, e.g., distancing, disinfection, limitation of public events), a suitable scenario for the change in the proportion of the numbers of the four studied groups in the future. In fact, based on these results we model the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Bulgaria and make a two-week forecast for the numbers of new cases per day, active cases and recovered individuals. Such model, as we show, has been successful for prediction analysis in the Bulgarian situation. We also provide multiple examples of numerical experiments with visualization of the results.","Margenov, Svetozar; Popivanov, Nedyu; Ugrinova, Iva; Harizanov, Stanislav; Hristov, Tsvetan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10360v1.pdf,178

No studies have yet summarized the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. CONCLUSION: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.","Alqahtani, Jaber S; Oyelade, Tope; Aldhahir, Abdulelah M; Alghamdi, Saeed M; Almehmadi, Mater; Alqahtani, Abdullah S; Quaderi, Shumonta; Mandal, Swapna; Hurst, John R",PLoS One,,178

During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, people in these two countries are encouraged to work to sustain economic activities and therefore travel normally. A sound understanding of travel behavior in these two countries, however, has remained unknown during the global pandemic. This study explored the travel behavior of commuters for key destinations (i.e., workplace, market, and hospital) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia and Laos. The study used the primary dataset of 217 observations collected online from 29 March through 4 April 2020 using the simple random sampling technique. The multinomial logit model (MNL) was used for statistical data analysis. The results showed that males were more likely than females to go to work by motorcycle, followed by car and walking/cycling. Private/industry employees and state officials/public servants were likely to go to work, but academics/researchers, the self-employed, and the jobless/students were inclined not to travel. People living in cities had a higher preference to travel to work by car and motorcycle. People living in Laos were least likely to travel to the three key destinations by motorcycle and most likely to travel to the workplace and market by car, as compared to people living in Cambodia. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic leads to changes in people's lifestyles as well as travel behavior. People preferred modes of private transport to public transport to obey social distancing, thereby avoiding getting infected with the virus.

Stroke is a major neurological disease contributing to death and disability worldwide, and is still an ongoing issue during the pandemic. Here we investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on stroke manifestations, treatment courses, the outcome of stroke patients, and the hospitalization rate in a referral center for stroke management in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 31 stroke patients (10 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019) and compared the demographic and pathological characteristics of the patients with or without coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The association of demographic/pathological characteristics of stroke patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a corresponding period during the previous year (49 patients) and an earlier period during the same year as the pandemic (50 patients) was also evaluated. RESULTS: The absolute number of admissions decreased about 40% during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Except for the stroke severity (P = 0.002), there were no significant changes in the demographic and pathological characteristics of the stroke patients during the three studied periods. A significantly higher mean of age (75.60 ± 9.54 versus 60.86 ± 18.45; P = 0.007), a significant difference in the type of stroke (P = 0.046), and significantly higher stroke severity (P = 0.024) were observed in stroke patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with those of stroke patients without coronavirus disease 2019. Treatment approaches, duration of hospitalization, and mortality rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the pandemic caused the number of acute stroke admissions to plummet compared to other periods. Although the pandemic did not affect the treatment plans and care of the patients, stroke cases with coronavirus disease 2019 had higher age, more large vessel ischemic stroke, and more severe stroke. Further studies are urgently needed to realize the probable interaction of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the neurologic disease.","Mehrpour, M; Shuaib, A; Farahani, M; Hatamabadi, H R; Fatehi, Z; Ghaffari, M; Moghadam, N B; Aghamiri, S H; Mansouri, B; Assarzadegan, F; Lima, B S; Hesami, O",Int J Stroke,,178

Pharmacists play an important role in conveying accurate information about COVID-19 to the community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes among hospital pharmacists about COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to pharmacists participating in the 7thNational Hospital and Institution Pharmacists Congress. The questions included in this questionnaire were created using the Turkish COVID-19 Scientific Committee guideline (COVID-19 Guideline). Results: Analysis of 237 questionnaires (72.6% completed by women) showed that the media (television, newspaper), internet (nonscientific resources), internet (scientific resources), and social media were the most popular sources of information (60.3%, 53.6%, 53.2%, and 41.4%, respectively). The participants’ age and the source of information that they used had an important influence on their knowledge of and attitudes towards COVID-19 infection. The majority of the participants (72.6%) stated that they were not wearing any kind of mask. Transmission of the disease by airborne route was well known by the participants (91.1%), as well as the main symptoms such as fever (92.4%), cough (84.4%), and dyspnea (60.3%). The participants were aware of the risk groups for COVID-19 infection such as advanced age (84.8%) and having comorbidities (80.2%). Washing hands with soap (92.0%), using hand disinfectants (80.6%), and avoiding contact with sick people (81.9%) were popular answers for protection from the disease, but wearing an N95 mask was also mentioned by 59.1% of the participants. Prevention of the disease by rinsing the nose with saline solution was believed in by 43.9% of the participants. Conclusion: Classical media and social media affect the attitudes of both the public and health professionals.

Utilizing nationally representative data, this analysis indicates that the families of children with autism spectrum disorder and co-occurring intellectual disabilities are twice as likely to experience food insecurity than families of children without disabilities after adjusting for various factors. Several factors, ranging from state-level policies such as Medicaid expansion to individual-level factors such as higher utilization of emergency room services, were associated with the higher prevalence of food insecurity in families of children with autism spectrum disorder and co-occurring intellectual disabilities. Implications of these findings on programs and policies supporting families in the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Karpur, Arun; Vasudevan, Vijay; Lello, Angela; Frazier, Thomas W; Shih, Andy",Autism,,178

479838,A randomized double-blind controlled trial of convalescent plasma in adults with severe COVID-19,2021,"In a scenario where there is no vaccine for COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to contain the spread of the virus and the collapse of the health system in the affected regions. One of these measures is social distancing, which aims to reduce interactions in the community by closing public and private establishments that involve crowds of people. The lockdown presupposes a drastic reduction in community interactions, representing a more extreme measure of social distancing. Based on geolocation data provided by Google for six categories of physical spaces, this article identifies the variations in the circulation of people in South America for different types of social distancing measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, population mobility trends for a group of countries between February 15, 2020 and May 16, 2020 were analyzed. To summarize these trends in a single metric, a general circulation index was created, and to identify regional mobility patterns, descriptive analyzes of spatial autocorrelation (global and local Moran index) were used. The first hypothesis of this study is that countries with a lockdown decree can achieve greater success in reducing the mobility of the population, and the second hypothesis is that Argentina, Brazil and Colombia have regional mobility patterns. The first hypothesis was partially confirmed (considering 10 countries in South America), and the results obtained in the spatial analyzes confirmed the second hypothesis. In general, the observed data shows that less rigid lockdown or social distancing measures are necessary, however, they are not sufficient to achieve a significant reduction in the circulation of people during the pandemic.","Oliveira, Gisliany Lillian Alves de; Lima, Luciana Conceiccao de; Silva, Ivanovitch; Ribeiro-Dantas, Marcel da Camara; Monteiro, Kayo Henrique; Endo, Patricia Takako",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04985v1.pdf,178

A Single-Center Cohort Study,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges of evidence-based health policymaking, as critical precautionary decisions, such as school closures, had to be made urgently on the basis of little evidence. As primary and secondary schools once again close in the face of surging infections, there is an opportunity to rigorously study their reopening. School-aged children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults, yet schools may drive community transmission of the virus. Given the impact of school closures on both education and the economy, schools cannot remain closed indefinitely. But when and how can they be reopened safely? We argue that a cluster randomized trial is a rigorous and ethical way to resolve these uncertainties. We discuss key scientific, ethical, and resource considerations both to inform trial design of school reopenings and to prompt discussion of the merits and feasibility of conducting such a trial.","Weijer, Charles; Hemming, Karla; Phillips Hey, Spencer; Fernandez Lynch, Holly",Clin Trials,,178

Results: The average confidence level of the students was found to be 2.17 in a 4-point scale. A two-sample test indicated that there is a significant difference in the overall level of confidence between female and male students (p value = 0.004). Moreover, a nonparametric correlation analysis revealed that there is no significant correlation between the overall level of confidence of each student and patient satisfaction regarding student performance, level of satisfaction of patients regarding dentures, and the quality of dentures as assessed by the clinicians (p value = 0.545, 0.877, and 0.801, respectively). Conclusions: Students' level of confidence in carrying out complete denture procedures is satisfactory. Male students exhibited a better overall level of confidence than female students.

The stability and success of these institutions depends, in part, on popular support. Times of crisis can introduce novel dynamics that alter popular support for protective institutions, particularly among those who do not benefit from those protections. We explore this possibility in the context of Title IX's gender equality requirements and infrastructure to address sexual harassment in college sports. We conduct a large survey of college student-athletes to study their attitudes on these issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant financial challenges affecting college sports. We find that male student-athletes and those with sexist attitudes exhibit alarmingly low levels of support for ensuring the maintenance of equality and sexual harassment policy under Title IX during the COVID-19 crisis and eventual recovery. The results accentuate the vulnerability of certain populations during crises and the importance of maintaining strong institutional policy support during such times.","Druckman, James N.; Sharrow, Elizabeth A.",Polit.

484802,Key Strategies for Clinical Management and Improvement of Healthcare Services for Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes Patients in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Settings: Recommendations From the REPROGRAM Consortium,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In connection with a hospital stay, patients have to make important health-related decisions. They need to find, understand, assess and apply health-related information, and therefore, require health literacy. Adequately responding to the needs of patients requires promoting the communication skills of healthcare professionals within healthcare organisations. Health-literate healthcare organisations can provide an environment strengthening professionals' and patients' health literacy. When developing health-literate healthcare organisations, it has to be considered that implementing organisational change is typically challenging. In this study, a communication concept based on previously evaluated communication training is codesigned, implemented and evaluated in four clinical departments of a university hospital. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: In a codesign phase, focus group interviews among employees and patients as well as a workshop series with employees and hospital management are used to tailor the communication concept to the clinical departments and to patients' needs. Also, representatives responsible for the topic of health literacy are established among employees. The communication concept is implemented over a 12-month period; outcomes studied are health literacy on the organisational and patient levels. Longitudinal survey data acquired from a control cohort prior to the implementation phase are compared with data of an intervention cohort after the implementation phase. Moreover, survey data from healthcare professionals before and after the implementation are compared. For formative evaluation, healthcare professionals are interviewed in focus groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Oldenburg and is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Study participants are asked to provide written informed consent. The results are disseminated via direct communication within the hospital, publications and conference presentations.

487256,Hematological characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in intensive care unit,2021,"BACKGROUND: At the global level and in the Arab world, particularly in low-income countries, COVID-19 remains a major public health issue. As demonstrated by an incredible number of COVID-19-related publications, the research science community responded rapidly. Therefore, this study was intended to assess the growing contribution of the Arab world to global research on COVID-19. METHODS: For the period between December 2019 and March 2021, the search for publications was conducted via the Scopus database using terms linked to COVID-19. VOSviewer 1.6.16 software was applied to generate a network map to assess hot topics in this area and determine the collaboration patterns between different countries. Furthermore, the research output of Arab countries was adjusted in relation to population size and gross domestic product (GDP). RESULTS: A total of 143,975 publications reflecting the global overall COVID-19 research output were retrieved. By restricting analysis to the publications published by the Arab countries, the research production was 6131 documents, representing 4.26% of the global research output regarding COVID-19. Of all these publications, 3990 (65.08%) were original journal articles, 980 (15.98%) were review articles, 514 (8.38%) were letters and 647 (10.55%) were others, such as editorials or notes. The highest number of COVID-19 publications was published by Saudi Arabia (n = 2186, 35.65%), followed by Egypt (n = 1281, 20.78%) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), (n = 719, 11.73%). After standardization by population size and GDP, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Lebanon had the highest publication productivity. The collaborations were mostly with researchers from the United States (n = 968), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 661). The main research lines identified in COVID-19 from the Arab world are related to: public health and epidemiology; immunological and pharmaceutical research; signs, symptoms and clinical diagnosis; and virus detection. CONCLUSIONS: A novel analysis of the latest Arab COVID-19-related studies is discussed in the current study and how these findings are connected to global production. Continuing and improving future collaboration between developing and developed countries will also help to facilitate the sharing of responsibilities for COVID-19 in research results and the implementation of policies for COVID-19.","Zyoud, Sa039; ed, H",Global Health,,178

VC allows continuation of patient care while adhering to government advised restrictions and social distancing measures. Multidisciplinary pain management programmes (PMPs) are a core element of many pain services and utilising virtual methods to deliver PMPs has allowed them to continue to provide care. This systematic review aimed to explore the content of existing virtually delivered PMPs and discuss if and how these findings can be used to guide clinical delivery.Eligible studies included adults (aged ⩾18 years) with persistent musculoskeletal pain and any virtually delivered intervention that was described as a PMP or that had components of PMPs. Databases were searched from inception until July 2020. We performed a content analysis comparing existing interventions with established evidence-based clinical guidelines published by the British Pain Society (BPS). Intervention reporting quality was assessed using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist: an established checklist developed to improve the completeness of the reporting of interventions.Eight studies were included. One intervention included six of the seven components recommended by the BPS;none included all seven. ‘Skills training and activity management’ was present in all eight interventions;‘education’ and ‘cognitive therapy methods’ were present in six interventions;‘graded activation’ and ‘methods to enhance acceptance, mindfulness and psychological flexibility’ were present in four interventions;‘physical exercise’ was present in two interventions and ‘graded exposure’ was present in one intervention. None of the studies described all 12 items of the TIDieR checklist adequately enough for replication.Published virtual PMPs partially meet established clinical guidelines. Future virtual PMPs should be based on evidence-based clinical guidelines, and more research is needed to explore the effectiveness of virtually delivered PMPs and each recommended component.

491936,Case study of a critically ill person with COVID-19 on ECMO successfully treated with leronlimab,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced many teachers around the world to make a sudden switch from face-to-face to online teaching This shift in practice has provided an opportunity to reconsider how technology use in mathematics education can be utilised to improve student engagement In this study, we explore four case studies of Australian secondary mathematics classrooms conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how teachers are using blended learning approaches and how their students perceive these pedagogical practices Findings across all four sites indicate that technology use expands student opportunities to engage with mathematics learning through the provision of multiple pathways and methods of access Specifically, we find evidence supporting the use of blended classroom teaching strategies to provide differentiation and personalised learning approaches;visualisation and dynamic manipulation of mathematics concepts;and alternative methods for teacher-student feedback and communication We argue that the student learning experience in mathematics can be enhanced through a variety of blended learning approaches by allowing for diverse points of access to learning opportunities which are more closely aligned to individual learning needs and free from the temporal constraints of the classroom","Attard, Catherine Holmes Kathryn",Mathematics Education Research Journal,,178
492530,Plasma exchange in critically ill COVID-19 patients,2020,"The application of point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) in the first diagnosis and management of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gained a great interest during a pandemic that is undermining even the most advanced health systems. LUS demonstrated high sensitivity in the visualization of the interstitial signs of the typical pneumonia complicating the infection. However, although this disease gives typical lung alterations, the same LUS signs observed in COVID-19 pneumonia can be detected in other common pulmonary conditions. While being non-specific when considered separately, the analysis of the distribution of the sonographic typical signs allows the assignment of 4 LUS patterns of probability for COVID-19 pneumonia when the whole chest is examined and attention is paid to the presence of other atypical signs. Moreover, the combination of LUS likelihood with the clinical phenotype at presentation increases the accuracy. This mini-review will analyze the LUS signs of COVID-19 pneumonia and how they can be combined in patterns of probability in the first approach to suspected cases.","Volpicelli, Giovanni; Cardinale, Luciano; Fraccalini, Thomas",Praxis (Bern 1994),,178

The lockdown caused various lifestyle changes that might have affected mental health. The study aimed to assess the effect of lockdown on stress level of Indian urban population. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire-based exploratory survey was conducted. A prevalidated Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) was used. A total of 120 questionnaires were sent via online social media using snowball sampling technique. PSQ Index scores were calculated for each participant. On the basis of these scores, participants were grouped into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe. The Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to check data for normality. Independent t-test was applied to find the difference of PSQ scores between males and females. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to find the difference in PSQ scores between various occupational groups and between various age groups, followed by post hoc Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test. Results: Completely filled 100 responses were analyzed to form results. About 44% population was found to have moderate stress. Mean PSQ index was 0.35 for sample population with standard deviation of 0.17. Pearson’s correlation between age and PSQ score was –0.452. Values of PSQ scores were higher for female participants, but the difference was not statistically significant. PQS scores were the highest in healthcare workers when compared with other occupations. Results of one-way ANOVA for various age groups were significant (F = 6.73, p = 0.001). Post hoc Tukey’s analysis revealed that only group of senior citizens is significantly different from others. Results of one-way ANOVA for various occupational groups are significant (F = 3.79, p = 0.01), and the result of post hoc Tukey’s HSD test suggests that only group of healthcare workers is significantly different from other groups. Conclusion: Results suggest prevalence of moderate stress level in studied sample population. More stress level was observed in females than males but the difference was not statistically significant. The stress level was higher among healthcare workers when compared with participants with other occupations. Stress was found to be negatively correlated with age of participants. The stress level was lowest in senior citizen participants when compared with other participants.","Dagli, Namrata Dagli Rushabh",Journal of Health Research and Reviews in Developing Countries,,178

The main subject of this article is to present a method to evaluate the applicability of building environmental assessment method in a given country. Here, when we say that a method is applicable in a given country, it means that it could be widely used and that it could produce the expected effects in terms of energy savings, environmental impact minimization, economic gain, etc. So, for this applicability evaluation purpose, the main criteria that affect the building environmental assessment method applicability were identified and were weighted by studying different scenarios. Then, the evaluation method was applied to the Tunisian case. Moreover, in order to contribute to a better understanding of the importance of building environmental assessment method implementation, stakes related thereto are reviewed. It was reported that building environmental assessment method would concur to improve building energy efficiency, enhance social capital, and contribute to environmental, social, and economic stability. In addition, it could be one of the major solutions for the collection of statistical data, which in turn would contribute to the success of projects undertaken as part of the green economy. Eventually, the building environmental assessment could be one of the major green marketing tools and should be taken into account by a company to improve profitability. The developed method and the presented stakes could be a good management and decision making tools and could help legislators and policy-makers for the best implementation of building environmental assessment method.","Zainine, Mohamed Amine; Mezni, Taoufik; Baeshen, Yasser; Rahmoun, Mbarek; Guizani, Amenallah",,,178
501940,The Meaning of D-Dimer value in Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic, countries have been mirroring each other's policies to mitigate the spread of the virus. Whether current measures alone will lead to behavioral change such as social distancing, washing hands, and wearing a facemask is not well understood. The objective of this study is to better understand individual variation in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by exploring the influence of beliefs, motivations and policy measures on public health behaviors. We do so by comparing The Netherlands and Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our final sample included 2,637 respondents from The Netherlands and 1,678 from Flanders. The data was nationally representative along three dimensions: age, gender, and household income in both countries. Our key outcome variables of interest were beliefs about policy effectiveness; stated reasons for complying with public rules; and changes in behavior. For control variables, we included a number of measures of how severe the respondent believed Covid-19 to be and a number of negative side effects that the person may have experienced: loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and conflicts with friends and neighbors. Finally, we controlled for socio-demographic factors: age, gender, income (categorical), education (categorical) and the presence of Covid-19 risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, allergies). The dependent variable for each of the estimation models is dichotomous, so we used Probit models to predict the probability of engaging in a given behavior. We found that motivations, beliefs about the effectiveness of measures, and pre-pandemic behavior play an important role. The Dutch were more likely to wash their hands than the Flemish (15.4%, p<0.01), visit family (15.5%, p < .01), run errands (12.0%, p<0.05) or go to large closed spaces such as a shopping mall (21.2%, p<0.01). The Dutch were significantly less likely to wear a mask (87.6%, p<0.01). We also found that beliefs about the virus, psychological effects of the virus, as well as pre-pandemic behavior play a role in adherence to recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that policymakers should consider behavioral motivations specific to their country in their COVID-19 strategies. In addition, the belief that a policy is effective significantly increased the probability of the behavior, so policy measures should be accompanied by public health campaigns to increase adherence.","van den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Atherly, Adam",PLoS One,,178

509601,Risk of adverse coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes for people living with HIV,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease has moved rapidly around the globe, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used and misused to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, is dominated by a small number of individuals, and is driven by super-spreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features, such as high stochasticity under low prevalence, and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics, should not be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties and night clubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity that outbreak can be effectively contained with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the potential types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.","Althouse, Benjamin M.; Wenger, Edward A.; Miller, Joel C.; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Allard, Antoine; H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Hu, Hao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13689v1.pdf,178

509603,Risk of adverse coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes for people living with HIV,2021,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe, life threatening form of respiratory failure characterized by pulmonary edema, inflammation, and hypoxemia due to reduced alveolar fluid clearance (AFC). Alveolar fluid clearance is required for recovery and effective gas exchange, and higher rates of AFC are associated with reduced mortality. Thyroid hormones play multiple roles in lung function, and L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) has multiple effects on lung AT2 cells. T3 enhances AFC in normal adult rat lungs when administered intramuscularly and in normal or hypoxia-injured lungs when given intratracheally. The safety of a commercially available formulation of liothyronine sodium (synthetic T3) administered intratracheally was assessed in an IND-enabling toxicology study in healthy rats. Instillation of the commercial formulation of T3 without modification rapidly caused tracheal injury and often mortality. Intratracheal instillation of T3 that was reformulated and brought to a neutral pH at the maximum feasible dose of 2.73 µg T3 in 300 µL for five consecutive days had no clinically relevant T3-related adverse clinical, histopathologic or clinical pathology findings. There were no unscheduled deaths that could be attributed to the reformulated T3 or control articles, no differences in the lung weights, and no macroscopic or microscopic findings considered to be related to treatment with T3. This preclinical safety study has paved the way for a phase I/II study to determine the safety and tolerability of a T3 formulation delivered into the lungs of ARDS patients, including COVID-19-asssociated ARDS, and to measure the effect on extra-vascular lung water in these patients Significance Statement There is growing interest in treating lung disease with thyroid hormone (T3) in pulmonary edema and ARDS. However, there is not any published experience on the impact of direct administration of T3 into the lung. An essential step is to determine the and safety of multiple doses of T3 administered in a relevant animal species. This study enabled FDA approval of a phase I/II clinical trial of T3 instillation in patients with ARDS, including COVID-19-asssociated ARDS (T3-ARDS ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04115514).","Flory, Craig M; Norris, Beverly J; Larson, Nicole A; Coicou, Lia G; Koniar, Brenda L; Mysz, Margaret; Rich, Timothy P; Ingbar, David H; Schumacher, Robert J",J. pharmacol. exp. ther,,178
510639,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Perspective from Immunosenescence,2021,"ObjectiveTo develop a comprehensive post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptom lexicon from clinical notes to support PASC symptom identification and research. MethodsWe identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive patients from the Mass General Brighams electronic health records (EHR) and extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day 51-110 from first positive COVID-19 test). The PASC symptom lexicon incorporated Unified Medical Language System(R) (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output. We assessed the comprehensiveness of the lexicon and the NLP performance using a validation dataset and reported the symptom prevalence across the entire corpus. ResultsThe PASC symptom lexicon included 355 symptoms consolidated from 1,520 UMLS concepts. NLP achieved an averaged precision of 0.94 and an estimated recall of 0.84. Symptoms with the highest frequency included pain (43.1%), anxiety (25.8%), depression (24.0%), fatigue (23.4%), joint pain (21.0%), shortness of breath (20.8%), headache (20.0%), nausea and/or vomiting (19.9%), myalgia (19.0%), and gastroesophageal reflux (18.6%). Discussion and ConclusionPASC symptoms are diverse. A comprehensive PASC symptom lexicon can be derived using a data-driven, ontology-driven and NLP-assisted approach. By using unstructured data, this approach may improve identification and analysis of patient symptoms in the EHR, and inform prospective study design, preventative care strategies, and therapeutic interventions for patient care.","Wang, Liqin; Foer, Dinah; MacPhaul, Erin; Lo, Ying-Chih; Bates, David W.; Zhou, Li",,,178

The high prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for other indications. SUBJECT AND METHOD: SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the ClinicalTrials.gov webpage listed n=479 clinical trials related to the antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (01.04.2020, ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""antivirals,"" ""therapy""), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January 2021 (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the CTG webpage, this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir, tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated in clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and results often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is deployed in nearly 70% of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirine, and sofosbuvir. DISCUSSION: This review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background and questions the rationale and study design of clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide. Proposals are made for future study design and drug repositioning of approved antiretroviral compounds.","von Hentig, Nils",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,178

VAS2870 and ML171 showed neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions reversing the AMPA induced reduction of bNOS expressing amacrine cells and attenuating macro/microglial activation. GLX7013114 (10-4â¯M) did not protect bNOS expressing amacrine cells, but it did attenuate the AMPA induced increase in nitrotyrosine positive cells and activation of glial cells. These results suggest that NOX1, NOX4 and possibly NOX2 (due to the actions of VAS2870) play an important role in the pathophysiology of the retina and that NOX inhibitors are putative neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents against retinal abnormalities caused by excitotoxicity.","Dionysopoulou, Stavroula; Wikstrom, Per; Walum, Erik; Thermos, Kyriaki",Exp Eye Res,,178

If effective interventions to address racial disparities in transplantation, including those magnified by COVID-19, are to be designed and implemented at the national level, it is first critical to understand the complex mechanisms by which structural, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized racism influence the presence of racial disparities in healthcare and transplantation. Specifically, we must deeply re-evaluate how scientists and clinicians think about race in the transplant context, and we must actively shift our efforts from merely observing disparities to acknowledging and acting on racism as a root cause underlying the vast majority of these disparities. We must do better to ensure equitable access and outcomes for all transplant patients, including within the current COVID-19 pandemic.

An Official American Thoracic Society Workshop Report,2021-03-30,"Background: As an emergent public health event, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on mental health, particularly causing anxiety. Some cognitive-affective related studies have demonstrated that attentional control is related to levels of anxiety. More specifically, recent research has shown that anxiety sensitivity is uniquely associated with mental health responses to COVID-19. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of anxiety sensitivity during COVID-19 outbreak period, especially physical and cognitive concerns, in relation to attentional control and anxiety. Methods: It is a questionnaire study. A total of 464 participants were recruited through online sampling between February and March, 2020. They were surveyed by the Attentional Control Scale (ATTC), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. We also tested the mediating effect. Results: The results showed that attentional control is negatively correlated with physical concern, cognitive concern and anxiety. And results support that physical and cognitive concerns play a mediating role between attentional control and anxiety. Conclusions: Anxiety sensitivity plays a mediating role between attentional control and anxiety. These findings can help effective prevention and intervention of anxiety.","Guo, Yawen; Yang, Haibo; Elhai, Jon; McKay, Dean",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456768/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.713279,178

In addition, information was collected on animal characteristics and herd-management practices. The probability of detecting each one of five enteropathogens given a calf with ‘custard-like’ faeces or diarrhoea was estimated using Bayes’ rule and was based on the predicted probabilities from a multinominal model including each of five enteropathogens as independent variables. In addition, putative risk factors for the presence of each of five enteropathogens were analysed using logistic regression models with random herd effects. Fifty-seven percent of calves had faeces of normal colour (brownish) and consistency (firm), 23.8% (95%CI: 19.8–28.2%) had ‘custard-like’ faeces and 19.1% (95%CI: 15.5–23.2%) had diarrhoea. E. coli was the least detected enteropathogen (2.6% (95%CI: 1.3–4.6%) of calves, 9% (95%CI: 5–16%) of herds) and Cl. perfringens was most detected (54.0% (95%CI: 49.1–58.8%) of calves, 85% (95%CI: 77–91%) of herds). E. coli and Coronavirus were detected incidentally in only one or two calves per herd, whereas C. parvum and Cl. perfringens were frequently detected in up to four calves per herd. For calves with ‘custard-like’ faeces, the probability of detecting Rotavirus from a calf in its first week of age was 0.31 whereas for a calf in its second week, there was a 0.66 probability of detecting C. parvum. The probabilities of detecting E. coli, Rotavirus and C. parvum in calves with diarrhoea in their first week of age were 0.10, 0.20 and 0.43, respectively. In calves with diarrhoea between 1 and 2 weeks of age, the probability of detecting enteropathogens was 0.43 for C. parvum. None of the tested enteropathogens were related to ‘custard-like’ faeces or diarrhoea in the third week of age. Putative risk factors for E. coli, Coronavirus and C. parvum included the presence of peer-calves shedding Coronavirus, C. parvum or Rotavirus, respectively. Additionally, managerial risk factors such as non-optimal hygienic housing (for Coronavirus) and the routine use of antibiotics for diarrhoeic calves (for C. parvum) were found. No animal or managerial factors were associated with shedding of Cl. perfringens.","Bartels, Chris J.M.; Holzhauer, Menno; Jorritsma, Ruurd; Swart, Wim A.J.M.; Lam, Theo J.G.M.",Prev Vet Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758770900292X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758770900292X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.09.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19819574/,178

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Crucial treatments were delayed for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, over concerns for hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. To protect cancer patients whose survival depended on timely surgery, a “COVID-minimal pathway” was created. METHODS: Patients who underwent a surgical procedure on the pathway between April and May 2020 were evaluated. The “COVID-minimal surgical pathway” consisted of: (A) evolving best-practices in COVID-19 transmission-reduction, (B) screening patients and staff, (C) preoperative COVID-19 patient testing, (D) isolating pathway patients from COVID-19 patients. Patient status through 2 weeks from discharge was determined as a reflection of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: After implementation, pathway screening processes excluded 7 COVID-19-positive people from interacting with pathway (4 staff and 3 patients). Overall, 122 patients underwent 125 procedures on pathway, yielding 83 admissions (42 outpatient procedures). The median age was 64 (56–79) and 57% of patients were female. The most common surgical indications were cancer affecting the uterus, genitourinary tract, colon, lung or head and neck. The median length of admission was 3 days (1–6). Repeat COVID-19 testing performed on 27 patients (all negative), including 9 patients evaluated in an emergency room and 8 readmitted patients. In the postoperative period, no patient developed a COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-minimal pathway comprised of physical space modifications and operational changes may allow urgent cancer treatment to safely continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, even during the surge-phase.","Boffa, Daniel J.; Judson, Benjamin L.; Billingsley, Kevin G.; Del Rossi, Erin; Hindinger, Kasey; Walters, Samantha; Ermer, Theresa; Ratner, Elena; Mitchell, Marci R.; Laurans, Maxwell S.; Johnson, Dirk C.; Yoo, Peter S.; Morton, John M.; Zurich, Holly B.; Davis, Kimberly; Ahuja, Nita",Ann Surg,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086321/,178

The knowledge of clinically relevant markers distribution might become a useful tool in COVID-19 therapy using personalized approach in the lack of unified recommendations for COVID-19 patients management during pandemic. We aimed to identify the frequencies and distribution patterns of rs11385942 and rs657152 polymorphic markers, associated with severe COVID-19, among populations of the world, as well at the national level within Russia. The study was also dedicated to reveal whether population frequencies of both polymorphic markers are associated with COVID-19 cases, recovery and death rates. Methods. We genotyped 1883 samples from 91 ethnic populations from Russia and neighboring countries by rs11385942 and rs657152 markers. Local populations which were geographically close and genetically similar were pooled into 28 larger groups. In the similar way we compiled a dataset on the other regions of the globe using genotypes extracted or imputed from the available datasets (32 populations worldwide). The differences in alleles frequencies between groups were estimated and the frequency distribution geographic maps have been constructed. We run the correlation analysis of both markers frequencies in various populations with the COVID-19 epidemiological data on the same populations. Findings. The cartographic analysis revealed that distribution of rs11385942 follows the West Eurasian pattern: it is frequent in Europeans, West Asians, and particularly in South Asians but rare or absent in all other parts of the globe. Notably, there is no abrupt changes in frequency across Eurasia but the clinal variation instead. The distribution of rs657152 is more homogeneous. Higher population frequencies of both risk alleles correlated positively with the death rate. For the rs11385942 we can state the tendency only (r=0.13, p=0.65), while for rs657152 the correlation was significantly high (r=0.59, p=0.02). These reasonable correlations were obtained on the Russian dataset, but not on the world dataset. Interpretation. Using epidemiological statistics on Russia and neighboring countries we revealed the evident correlation of the risk alleles frequencies with the death rate from COVID-19. The lack of such correlations at the world level should be attributed to the differences in the ways epidemiological data have been counted in different countries. So that, we believe that genetic differences between populations make small but real contribution into the heterogeneity of the pandemic worldwide. New studies on the correlations between COVID-19 recovery/mortality rates and population's gene pool are urgently needed.","Balanovsky, O.; Petrushenko, V.; Mirzaev, K.; Abdullaev, S.; Gorin, I.; Chernevskiy, D.; Agdzhoyan, A.; Balanovska, E.; Kryukov, A.; Sychev, D.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.22.20236414; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.22.20236414v1?rss=1,178

We have earlier introduced highly effective antiviral siRNA swarms against herpes simplex virus (HSV), targeting 653 bp of the essential UL29 viral gene. Here, we report a method for enzymatic production and antiviral use of 2’-fluoro-modified siRNA swarms. Utilizing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from bacteriophage phi6, we produced 2’-F-siRNA swarms containing either all or a fraction of modified adenosine, cytidine or uridine residues in the antisense strand of the UL29 target. The siRNA containing modified pyrimidines demonstrated high resistance to RNase A and the antiviral potency of all the UL29-specific 2’-F-siRNA swarms was 100-fold in comparison with the unmodified counterpart, without additional cytotoxicity. Modest stimulation of innate immunity signaling, including induced expression of both type I and type III interferons, as well as interferon-stimulated gene 54, by 2’-F-cytidine and 2’-F-uridine modified siRNA swarms occurred at early time points after transfection while the 2’-F-adenosine-containing siRNA was similar to the unmodified antiviral siRNA swarm in this respect. The antiviral efficacy of the 2’-F-siRNA swarms and the elicited cellular innate responses did not correlate suggesting that innate immunity pathways do not significantly contribute to the observed enhanced antiviral activity of the modified siRNAs. The results support further applications of enzymatically produced siRNA molecules with incorporated adenosine nucleotides, carrying fluoro-modification on ribose C2’ position, for further antiviral studies in vitro and in vivo.","Levanova, Alesia A.; Kalke, Kiira M.; Lund, Liisa M.; Sipari, Nina; Sadeghi, Mohammadreza; Nyman, Marie C.; Paavilainen, Henrik; Hukkanen, Veijo; Poranen, Minna M.",Antiviral Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104916; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220303302?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32798603/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220303302,178

As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we present a decision tree-based machine learning model trained on electronic health records from patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a single center within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We then externally validate our model by predicting the likelihood of critical event or death within various time intervals for patients after hospitalization at four other hospitals and achieve strong performance, notably predicting mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and identification of key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making effective patient management decisions.","Vaid, A.; Somani, S.; Russak, A.

We used a microsimulation activity-based model for Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area, to evaluate the power of SD and FM in controlling the pandemic under numerous scenarios. The hypothetical scenarios are designed to picture feasible futures under different assumptions. Assuming that the isolation of infected cases and the quarantining of close contacts are in place, different numerical tests are conducted and a full factorial two-way MANOVA test is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the FM and SD control strategies.

There are few published estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in children or from subtropical regions. Methods We conducted a test-negative year-round study between October 2009 and September 2013, recruiting children 6months to 17years of age admitted to two hospitals in Hong Kong with a febrile acute respiratory infection. Cases were tested for influenza A and B and conditional logistic regression was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness comparing influenza vaccination history of the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) among patients testing positive versus negative for influenza, adjusting for age and sex and matching by calendar week of recruitment. Results Overall vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B was estimated to be 61.7% (95% CI: 43.0%, 74.2%). The estimated vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) was 36.6% (95% CI: −25.5%, 67.9%) compared to 71.5% (95% CI: 39.4%, 86.6%) for A(H1N1)pdm09 and 68.8% (95% CI: 41.6%, 83.3%) for B. Conclusions Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in children varied from year to year, but was moderate to high overall even in an area with influenza activity throughout the year.","Cowling, Benjamin J.; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Feng, Shuo; Chan, Eunice L.Y.; Lo, Janice Y.C.; Peiris, J.

Six of PCP-‘cysteine’ (C457A, C459A, C471A, C472A, C481A and C483A) and three ‘histidine’ (H443L, H497L and H590L) mutants were lethal. Further, a highly conserved ‘glycine-triad’ (G815-G816-G817) in downstream X-domain, homologous to rubella virus protease-substrate (G1299-G1300-G1301) was identified where two of X-mutants (G816V and G817V) turned lethal. However, all ORF1 sequential nucleotide-mutants conserving the amino acids were viable, which clearly showed post-translational regulation of HEV replication by PCP- and X-domains. Moreover, while vector-expressed ORF1-fusion polyprotein yielded a ∼191 kDa band in vitro, it produced ∼78 and ∼35 kDa fragments ex vivo.

596321,Severe COVID-19 in Third Trimester Pregnancy: Multidisciplinary Approach,2020-10-14,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are mitigation strategies used to reduce the spread of transmissible diseases. The relative effectiveness of specific NPIs remains uncertain. METHODS: We used state-level Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case and mortality data between January 19, 2020 and March 7, 2021 to model NPI policy effectiveness. Empirically derived breakpoints in case and mortality velocities were used to identify periods of stable, decreasing, or increasing COVID-19 burden. The associations between NPI adoption and subsequent decreases in case or death velocities were estimated using generalized linear models accounting for weekly variability shared across states. State-level NPI policies included: stay at home order, indoor public gathering ban (mild >10 or severe ≤10), indoor restaurant dining ban, and public mask mandate. RESULTS: 28,602,830 cases and 511,899 deaths were recorded. The odds of a decrease in COVID-19 case velocity were significantly elevated for stay at home (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.63–2.52), indoor dining ban (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25–2.10), public mask mandate (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.47–3.23), and severe gathering ban (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.31–2.16). In mutually adjusted models, odds remained elevated for stay at home (AOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04–2.07) and public mask mandate (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.51–3.41). Stay at home (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.53–2.62; AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25–2.87) was also associated with greater likelihood of decrease in death velocity in unadjusted and adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: NPIs employed in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, most significantly stay at home orders, were associated with decreased COVID-19 burden.","Ahlers, Michael J.; Aralis, Hilary J.; Tang, Wilson L.; Sussman, Jeremy B.; Fonarow, Gregg C.; Ziaeian, Boback",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611668/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.26.21264142v1?rss=1,178
596743,Bacterial pulmonary superinfections are associated with longer duration of ventilation in critically ill COVID-19 patients,2021-03-14,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections at the primary care level represents the major source of antibiotic misuse in healthcare, and is a major driver for antimicrobial resistance worldwide. In this study we will develop, pilot and evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive antibiotic stewardship programme in China’s primary care hospitals to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections among all ages. METHODS: We will use a parallel-group, cluster-randomised, controlled, superiority trial with blinded outcome evaluation but unblinded treatment (providers and patients). We will randomise 34 primary care hospitals from two counties within Guangdong province into the intervention and control arm (1:1 overall ratio) stratified by county (8:9 within-county ratio). In the control arm, antibiotic prescribing and management will continue through usual care. In the intervention arm, we will implement an antibiotic stewardship programme targeting family physicians and patients/caregivers. The family physician components include: (1) training using new operational guidelines, (2) improved management and peer-review of antibiotic prescribing, (3) improved electronic medical records and smart phone app facilitation. The patient/caregiver component involves patient education via family physicians, leaflets and videos. The primary outcome is the proportion of prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (excluding pneumonia) that contain any antibiotic(s). Secondary outcomes will address how frequently specific classes of antibiotics are prescribed, how frequently key non-antibiotic alternatives are prescribed and the costs of consultations. We will conduct a qualitative process evaluation to explore operational questions regarding acceptability, cultural appropriateness and burden of technology use, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis and a long-term benefit evaluation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months, with another 24 months’ post-trial long-term follow-up. DISCUSSION: Our study is one of the first trials to evaluate the effect of an antibiotic stewardship programme in primary care settings in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC). All interventional activities will be designed to be embedded into routine primary care with strong local ownership. Through the trial we intend to impact on clinical practice and national policy in antibiotic prescription for primary care facilities in rural China and other LMICs.

Effective market segmentation improves the communication and efficacy of health advice. Travel frequency is an important basis for health-related consumer segmentation, as it is closely related to risk of greater exposure to infectious diseases. Theoretically grounded studies of tourist biosecurity behavior and travel frequency have largely been neglected, although insights into practices and attitudes are especially relevant for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) health responses. Therefore, this research constructed and tested a conceptual model applying Value–Attitude–Behavior theory to US travelers to see whether the frequency of international travel affected tourist COVID-19 related biosecurity behavior. US respondents were drawn from a panel using a quota sampling technique according to the age and gender of American outbound tourists. An online survey was administered in September 2020. The responses (n = 395) of those who traveled internationally within five years were analyzed utilizing partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group analysis. Travel frequency significantly affects biosecurity behavior. High travel frequency (≥8 trips) has the strongest effect of value on biosecurity attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and biosecurity social norms, leading to biosecurity behaviors. Biosecurity behaviors pertaining to medium travel frequency (4–7 trips) are significantly influenced by personal norms. At low travel frequency (1–3 trips) levels, biosecurity behaviors are stimulated by biosecurity attitudes and social norms, showing the highest predictive power among the three groups. This work provides insights into international travel consumer biosecurity practices and behavior. From a market segmentation perspective, the levels of international travel frequency have various influences on biosecurity values, attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and behaviors. The biosecurity behaviors of low-frequency travelers are found to be the most significant of the three groups, suggesting that individuals who travel less frequently are more likely to practice responsible COVID-19 biosecurity behavior.","Kim, Myung Ja; Hall, C.

Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. METHODS: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation. RESULTS: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves. Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days. In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days. In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings. We recommend that schools implement a post-fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID-19.","Burns, Adam; Gutfraind, Alexander",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511602/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750,178

However, the assessment and selection of right S3PRLP is a complex uncertain decision-making problem due to involvement of numerous conflicting attributes, imprecise human mind and lack of information. Recently, Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS) has been recognized as one of the suitable tools to tackle the uncertain and inaccurate information. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid methodology based on CRITIC and EDAS methods with Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) to solve the S3PRLP selection problem in which the attributes and decision makers’ weights are completely unknown. In this framework, CRITIC approach is applied to calculate the attribute weight and EDAS method is used to evaluate the priority order of S3PRLP options. To do this, a new improved generalized score function (IGSF) is developed with its elegant properties. Also, a formula is discussed to calculate the decision makers’ weights based on the developed IGSF. Next, developed framework is applied to assess a case study of S3PRLP selection problem with Fermatean fuzzy information, which elucidates the usefulness and practicality of the proposed method. Finally, comparative study is implemented to show the strength of introduced framework with extant approaches. The outcomes of the work confirm that the introduced approach is more feasible and well-consistent with the other extant approaches.","Mishra, Arunodaya Raj; Rani, Pratibha; Pandey, Kiran",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-02902-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584868/,178

The negative role of this immune suppression on the outcome raises the question on immune therapies that might improve patient's condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Important positive effects of active immune therapies, such as IL-7 or thymosin-α are already described and warrant confirmation in larger prospective trials. For other therapies, such as interferons, firm conclusions for critically ill COVID-19 patients are lacking as those patients were often excluded from the published trials. Treatment with immunoglobulins or convalescent plasma is a passive strategy to provide specific immunity. Unfortunately, results from large RCTs do not support their use presently. SUMMARY: In this article, we provide a review on active and passive immune boosting strategies that might help treating the most severe COVID-19 patients. We mainly focus on active strategies that include IL-7, thymosin-α, interferons, and vitamin D.

Namibia is not spared from this disease. On the early days of the pandemic in Namibia, the government instituted a four-stage strategy--from a full lockdown in Stage One with gradual relaxation of restrictions in Stage Two and ending with Stage Four. This was proven to be effective since the number of daily new cases were minimal by the time the restrictions were lifted in Stage Four, which allowed many non-essential businesses to resume, and borders to reopen. However, following this, the cases jumped in an alarming pace. The situation was also exacerbated partly by obliviousness of the people to restrictions due to their economic issues. At present, the government struggles to bring the situation back under control. Thus, the government reintroduced new restrictions to mitigate the situation. The country is facing paucity of facilities like personal protective equipment (PPE), health workers, intensive care unit (ICU) equipment and testing kits. To avoid further explosion of cases, Namibia needs to determine relaxation of restrictions based on the indicators of the situation of COVID-19. Assistance to the population and addressing insufficiency of facilities by the government through innovative solutions are of utmost importance in tussling the virus.","Amesho, Josephine Ndapewoshali; Ahmadi, Attaullah; Lucero-Prisno III, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456649/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.37.25.25697,178

PRISMA checklist and modified population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework were used to perform the review. Of the 24 identified studies, 17 met our inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies were conducted during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in oral, pharyngeal, sinusonasal human mucosa. The following cell types expressed ACE2: basal, apical, goblet, minor salivary, and endothelial cells. TMPRSS2 was found in goblet and apical respiratory cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were found in the olfactory region, especially in sustentacular non-neural and neural stem cells. Animal studies suggested that ACE2 expression may vary regarding age. There was an important heterogeneity between studies in the methods used to detect ACE2 and TMPRSS2, leading to a potential identification bias.

The tertiary structure of the protease consists of two distinct folds. One is the N-terminal chymotrypsin-like fold that consists of two structural domains and constitutes the catalytic machinery; the other is the C-terminal helical domain, which has an unclear function and is not found in other RNA virus main proteases. To understand the functional roles of the two structural parts of the SARS-CoV main protease, we generated the full-length of this enzyme as well as several terminally truncated forms, different from each other only by the number of amino acid residues at the C- or N-terminal regions. The quaternary structure and K(d) value of the protease were analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The results showed that the N-terminal 1–3 amino acid-truncated protease maintains 76% of enzyme activity and that the major form is a dimer, as in the wild type. However, the amino acids 1–4-truncated protease showed the major form to be a monomer and had little enzyme activity. As a result, the fourth amino acid seemed to have a powerful effect on the quaternary structure and activity of this protease. The last C-terminal helically truncated protease also exhibited a greater tendency to form monomer and showed little activity. We concluded that both the C- and the N-terminal regions influence the dimerization and enzyme activity of the SARS-CoV main protease.","Hsu, Wen-Chi; Chang, Hui-Chuan; Chou, Chi-Yuan; Tsai, Pui-Jen; Lin, Pei-In; Chang, Gu-Gang",J Biol Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820614417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831489/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820614417,178

Consequently, unprecedently large numbers of individuals are significantly stressed and many are at risk for relapse of mental health problems, exacerbations of existing mental and behavioral health problems, and new onset clinical problems. Because of the scope of the problem, a population-based public health perspective is needed, which in the context of disasters has well-established theories and prevention approaches. Public health approaches to disasters and pandemics focus on preventing subclinical problems from becoming clinical disorders, in comparison to clinical care approaches that focus on treating established disorders. Fortunately, specialty care clinicians who typically think about assessing and treating established disorders have the training and clinical competencies to deliver prevention-focused interventions. This paper is designed to help specialty care clinicians who use cognitive-behavioral strategies to understand the biopsychosocial impacts and resource deficits associated with COVID-19-related stressors and the public health perspective to address them. We also provide ways clinicians can help people who are suffering from significant stress and resource deficits bounce back and regain functioning.

Methods: A retrospective, real-world analysis was conducted in IIM-ILD patients who regularly received outpatient visit or hospitalization from January 2018 to March 2020 in three centers. And the patients were divided into two groups depending on presence or absence of nintedanib therapy. Comparisons, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and propensity score matching were made to identify difference in time to death from any cause, incidence of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) and comorbidity of pulmonary infection between the two groups. The following logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses were used to verify the therapeutic value of nintedanib as well as clinical significance of other factors. Adverse events were descriptively recorded. Results: Thirty-six patients receiving nintedanib therapy and 115 patients without use of nintedanib were included. Before and after propensity score matching, the primary comparisons revealed better survival (P = 0.015, P = 0016, respectively) and lower incidence of RP-ILD (P = 0.017, P = 0.014, respectively) in patients with nintedanib therapy. Logistic regression analysis identified that disease activity (P < 0.001), percent-predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%, P = 0.036), nintedanib therapy (P = 0.004, OR value = 0.072) and amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM, P = 0.012) were significantly correlated with RP-ILD. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis suggested that disease activity (P < 0.001), anti-MDA5 antibody (P < 0.001) and nintedanib therapy (P = 0.013, HR value=0.268) were significantly associated with survival of IIM-ILD patients. Similar results can also be seen in analyses after propensity score matching. In the 36 patients with nintedanib therapy, diarrhea was the most common adverse event (44.4%) and hepatic insufficiency contributed to most dosage reduction (44.4% of nine patients) or therapy discontinuation (60.0% of five patients). Conclusions: Nintedanib was found to reduce incidence of RP-ILD and improve survival in IIM-ILD patients in a real-world setting. Anti-MDA5 antibody could be taken as a risk factor for unfavorable outcome. ADM was significantly correlated with occurrence of RP-ILD. In addition to the most frequent diarrhea, hepatic insufficiency was closely related to dosage reduction or therapy discontinuation.","Liang, Junyu; Cao, Heng; Yang, Yang; Ke, Yini; Yu, Ye; Sun, Chuanyin; Yue, Lihuan; Lin, Jin",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.626953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614683/,178

Then, IBV-induced apoptosis was observed through a cell viability assay, morphological changes, and flow cytometry. The activity of caspases, the inhibitory efficacy of caspase-inhibitors and the expression of apoptotic genes further suggested the activation of apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in IBV-infected HD11 cells. Additionally, ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) pretreated HD11 cells blocked IBV from entering cells and inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis. UV-inactivated IBV also lost the ability of apoptosis induction.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: A prospective observational study was conducted to assess sterile compounding time and workforce requirements in a hospital pharmacy, resulting in development of staff benchmarking metrics. METHODS: The study was conducted in the IV room of a quaternary hospital over a total of 7 weeks. Compounding was directly observed and timing data collected for each compounded sterile preparation (CSP). The primary objective was to assess CSP workload, compounding time requirements, and workforce requirements to enable development of a data-driven staffing benchmark. RESULTS: A total of 320 sterile product preparations were directly observed during the study. Overall, the average time to compound 1 CSP (including small- and large-volume parenteral solutions, chemotherapy CSPs, batched CSPs, and syringes) was 3.25 minutes. Chemotherapy CSPs had the longest average preparation time (17.74 minutes); batched CSPs had the shortest preparation time, at 1.90 minutes per unit. A safe workload analysis indicated that in an 8-hour shift, 1 pharmacy technician can safely prepare 253 batched CSPs; 148 preparations of SVP solutions, LVP solutions, and syringes combined; 31 parenteral nutrition solutions prepared using an automated device; or 29 chemotherapy preparations. Through extrapolation of these results, it was calculated that a hospital with a capacity of 100 beds would require 1.4 pharmacist full-time equivalents (FTEs) and 2.7 technician FTEs to meet its sterile compounding needs, with proportionate increases in those estimates for a 300-bed hospital. CONCLUSION: Organizations wishing to use external benchmarking information need to understand data characterization, pharmacy services offered, automation, workflows, and workload before utilizing that information for workforce planning.","Chaker, Ahmed; Omair, Israa; Mohamed, Weam Hazem; Mahomed, Shuaib Haroon; Siddiqui, Mohammad Aslam",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34605883/,178

The new model takes into account the hierarchic structure of social clusters in the human society. We apply the well developed theory of random walk on the energy landscapes represented mathematically with ultrametric spaces. This theory was created for applications to spin glasses and protein dynamics. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing (with respect to hierarchy's levels) barriers. This structure of barriers matches with a rather soft regulations imposed in Sweden in March 2020. In this model, the infection spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This model's feature matches with the real situation during the covid-19 epidemy, with its cluster spreading structure. Clusters need not be determined solely geographically, they are based on a number of hierarchically ordered social coordinates. The model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. In particular, our model describes such a specialty of spread of covid-19 virus as the presence of ""super-spreaders"" who by performing a kind of random walk on a hierarchic landscape of social clusters spreads infection. In future, this model will be completed by adding the SIR-type counterpart. But, the latter is not a specialty of covid-19 spreading.","Khrennikov, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.04.20146209; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.04.20146209v1?rss=1,178

To overcome these barriers, we have developed nimbolide liposomes conjugated with iRGD peptide (iRGD-NIMLip) for targeting lung inflammation. It was observed that iRGD-NIMLip treatment significantly inhibited oxidative stress and cytokine storm compared to nimbolide free-drug (f-NIM), nimbolide liposomes (NIMLip), and exhibited superior activity compared to dexamethasone (DEX). iRGD-NIMLip abrogated the LPS induced p65 NF-κB, Akt, MAPK, Integrin β3 and β5, STAT3, and DNMT1 expression.

METHODS: We performed an observational study during the peak of pandemic in our intensive care unit, dosing D-dimer, C-reactive protein, troponin T, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, transferrin soluble receptor, lymphocyte count and NK, CD3, CD4, CD8 and B subgroups of 31 patients during the first 2 weeks of their ICU stay. Correlation with mortality and severity at the time of admission was tested with the Spearman coefficient and Mann–Whitney test. Trends over time were tested with the Kruskal–Wallis analysis. RESULTS: Lymphopenia is severe and constant, with a nadir on day 2 of ICU stay (median 0.555 10(9)/L; interquartile range (IQR) 0.450 10(9)/L); all lymphocytic subgroups are dramatically reduced in critically ill patients, while CD4/CD8 ratio remains normal. Neither ferritin nor lymphocyte count follows significant trends in ICU patients. Transferrin saturation is extremely reduced at ICU admission (median 9%; IQR 7%), then significantly increases at days 3 to 6 (median 33%, IQR 26.5%, p value 0.026). The same trend is observed with serum iron levels (median 25.5 μg/L, IQR 69 μg/L at admission; median 73 μg/L, IQR 56 μg/L on days 3 to 6) without reaching statistical significance. Hyperferritinemia is constant during intensive care stay: however, its dosage might be helpful in individuating patients developing haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. D-dimer is elevated and progressively increases from admission (median 1319 μg/L; IQR 1285 μg/L) to days 3 to 6 (median 6820 μg/L; IQR 6619 μg/L), despite not reaching significant results. We describe trends of all the abovementioned parameters during ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: The description of iron metabolism and lymphocyte count in Covid-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit provided with this paper might allow a wider understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology.","Bolondi, Giuliano; Russo, Emanuele; Gamberini, Emiliano; Circelli, Alessandro; Meca, Manlio Cosimo Claudio; Brogi, Etrusca; Viola, Lorenzo; Bissoni, Luca; Poletti, Venerino; Agnoletti, Vanni",World J Emerg Surg,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13017-020-00323-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605582/,178

Paired saliva and plasma samples were collected from 101 eligible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors >14 days since PCR+ confirmed diagnosis. Concordance was evaluated using positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement, overall percent agreement (PA), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient. The range between salivary and plasma EIAs for SARS-CoV-2-specific N was PPA: 54.4–92.1% and NPA: 69.2–91.7%, for RBD was PPA: 89.9–100% and NPA: 50.0–84.6%, and for S was PPA: 50.6–96.6% and NPA: 50.0–100%. Compared to a plasma nAb assay, the multiplex salivary assay PPA ranged from 62.3% (N) and 98.6% (RBD) and NPA ranged from 18.8% (RBD) to 96.9% (S). Combinations of N, RBD, and S and a summary algorithmic index of all three (N/RBD/S) in saliva produced ranges of PPA: 87.6–98.9% and NPA: 50–91.7% with the three EIAs and ranges of PPA: 88.4–98.6% and NPA: 21.9–34.4% with the nAb assay. A multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay demonstrated comparable performance to three commercially-available plasma EIAs and a nAb assay, and may be a viable alternative to assist in screening CCP donors and monitoring population-based seroprevalence and vaccine antibody response.","Heaney, Christopher D.; Pisanic, Nora; Randad, Pranay R.; Kruczynski, Kate; Howard, Tyrone; Zhu, Xianming; Littlefield, Kirsten; Patel, Eshan U.; Shrestha, Ruchee; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Shoham, Shmuel; Sullivan, David; Gebo, Kelly; Hanley, Daniel; Redd, Andrew D.; Quinn, Thomas C.; Casadevall, Arturo; Zenilman, Jonathan M.; Pekosz, Andrew; Bloch, Evan M.; Tobian, Aaron A.

While it is clear that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of hypertension, several novel discoveries have been made within the past decade that have advanced the field and have provided new mechanistic insights. First, recent studies have identified a central role of sodium-induced immune cell activation in the pathogenesis of hypertension by altering the gut microbiome and formation of products of lipid oxidation known as isolevuglandins. Second, cytokine elaboration by the inflammasome leading to end-organ dysfunction and immune activation has been found to play a role in the genesis of hypertension. Third, novel techniques have identified previously uncharacterized immune cell populations that may play a functional role in these processes. Finally, the role of inflammation in hypertension may be an important mediator of severe COVID-19 infections. In this review, we discuss these recent advances in the study of inflammation and hypertension and highlight topics for future studies.","Patrick, David M; Van Beusecum, Justin P; Kirabo, Annet",Curr Opin Physiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867320301279?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073072/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468867320301279; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cophys.2020.09.016,178
610786,A systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of infectious diseases of Duck: A world perspective,2021-05-24,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted people’s lives across a broad spectrum of psychosocial domains. We report the development and psychometric evaluation of the self-report COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ), which assesses COVID-19 contamination anxiety, countermeasure necessity and compliance, mental health impact, stressor impact, social media usage, interpersonal conflicts, paranoid ideations, institutional & political trust, conspiracy beliefs, and social cohesion. Further, we illustrate the questionnaire’s utility in an applied example investigating if higher SARS-Cov-2 infection rates in psychiatric patients could be explained by reduced compliance with preventive countermeasures. METHODS: A group of 511 non-clinical individuals completed an initial pool of 111 CoPaQ items (Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/3evn9/) and additional scales measuring psychological distress, well-being, and paranoia to assess construct validity and lifetime mental health diagnosis for criterion validity. Factor structure was determined by exploratory factor analyses and validated by conducting confirmatory factor analysis in the accompanying longitudinal sample (n = 318) and an independent psychiatric inpatient sample primarily admitted for major depressive-, substance abuse-, personality-, and anxiety disorders (n = 113). Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach’s Alpha and McDonald’s Omega. For the applied research example, Welch t-tests and correlational analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Twelve out of 16 extracted subscales were retained in the final questionnaire version, which provided preliminary evidence for adequate psychometric properties in terms of factor structure, internal consistency, and construct and criterion validity. Our applied research example showed that patients exhibited greater support for COVID-19 countermeasures than non-clinical individuals. However, this requires replication in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the CoPaQ is a comprehensive and valid measure of the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and could allow to a degree to disentangle the complex psychosocial phenomena of the pandemic as exemplified by our applied analyses.

Elective surgeries have been canceled or delayed in order to reallocate resources to the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Currently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bariatric and metabolic surgical practice remains unclear. METHODS: An internet-based online survey was performed among bariatric surgeons worldwide. The survey was sent to bariatric surgeons via the International Bariatric Club Facebook group and by electronic mail via the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and metabolic disorders (IFSO) secretariat to members of the associated national IFSO societies. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-nine (n = 169) bariatric surgeons participated in the survey. The majority of the respondents postponed preoperative upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopies, appointments in the outpatient clinic and bariatric operations. Most surgeons performed video calls for follow-up appointments instead of meeting the patients in the outpatient clinics. Laparoscopy was still the preferred treatment for surgical emergencies, but a trend towards conservative treatment of acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis was shown. Rapid preoperative COVID-19 testing availability was poor; therefore, routine screening of emergency bariatric cases was not widely provided. A wide variance occurred regarding precautions and personal protection equipment among the participants. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic showed a strong impact on bariatric surgical practice regarding surgical and outpatient planning as well as personnel management. Coordinated effort from the national bariatric societies should focus on strict implementation of the current recommendations regarding precaution measures and personal protection equipment. Further studies should evaluate how this impact will evolve in the near future.","Lazaridis, Ioannis I.; Kraljević, Marko; Schneider, Romano; Klasen, Jennifer M.; Schizas, Dimitrios; Peterli, Ralph; Kow, Lilian; Delko, Tarik",Obes Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654018/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04830-8,178
614599,Convalescence From COVID Research: Lessons From the Heart Failure Community,2020-09-28,"The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D(3) for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D(3) doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.","Grant, William B.; Lahore, Henry; McDonnell, Sharon L.; Baggerly, Carole A.; French, Christine B.; Aliano, Jennifer L.; Bhattoa, Harjit P.",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12040988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252338/,178

615896,A manifesto of collaborative longitudinal cardiovascular care in heart failure,2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, can lead to weight loss, resulting in dramatic improvements in overall health and chronic disease risk. However, while many traditional dieting, food tracking and weight loss coaching programs result in short-term weight loss, there is less evidence of their effectiveness on sustaining weight loss over time. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,740 adults with obesity who used Foodsmart, a digital personalized dietary assessment, meal planning and food purchasing platform. Participants reported age, gender, at least three measures of weight, and their diet using a food frequency questionnaire. We defined sustained weight loss as participants who lost 5 % of initial weight between their first and second reported weights and lost weight or maintained weight between second and third reported weights. A healthy eating score, Nutriscore, was calculated to assess overall diet quality. We used multivariate logistic regression models to examine the association between user characteristics and odds of sustained weight loss. RESULTS: Over a median of 25 months, the mean (standard deviation) change in weight among participants was − 6.2 (19.8) pounds. In total, 39.3 % (684/1,740) of participants lost at least 5 % of their initial weight, and 22.4 % percent (389/1,740) of participants sustained weight loss. In the fully-adjusted logistic regression model, we found that obesity class 2 (odds ratio, OR: 1.69, 95 % confidence interval, CI: 1.27–2.24, P < 0.001), obesity class 3 (OR: 2.23, 95 % CI: 1.68–2.97, P < 0.001), baseline diet quality (OR: 1.06, 95 % CI: 1.02–1.09, P < 0.001), and greater change in diet quality (OR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 1.07–1.14, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with sustained weight loss.

619364,Efficacy and safety of yinqiao powder combined with western medicine in the treatment of pneumonia: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-12-16,"One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other social controls during epidemic outbreaks is trust—or rather distrust. Much like news reporting and social media, popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can influence people’s trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in ‘scientific fact’ by societies. As well as providing information on the ‘correct science’ behind disease transmission, spread and illness in films and literature, popular culture can also inform societies about how to feel and how to react during epidemics—that is to say create some expectations about the kinds of societal responses that could potentially occur. In this article we closely analyse three films that centre around epidemic diseases—Contagion (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), Blindness (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006)—in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health: institutional, social and interpersonal. These films raise two key issues about trust and social responses during epidemics. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society—based on race, gender or wealth—to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities.","Han, Qijun; Curtis, Daniel R",Med Humanit,https://doi.org/10.1136/medhum-2020-011871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467302/,178

In this observational retrospective study, the patients of our Obesity Unit were invited to answer to a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire relative to weight changes, working activity, exercise, dietary habits, and conditions potentially impacting on nutritional choices. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations among weight/BMI changes and the analyzed variables. A total of 150 subjects (91.5%) completed the questionnaire. Mean self-reported weight gain was ≈1.5 kg (p < 0.001). Lower exercise, self-reported boredom/solitude, anxiety/depression, enhanced eating, consumption of snacks, unhealthy foods, cereals, and sweets were correlated with a significantly higher weight gain. Multiple regression analyses showed that increased education (inversely, β = −1.15; 95%CI −2.13, −0.17, p = 0.022), self-reported anxiety/depression (β = 1.61; 0.53, 2.69, p = 0.004), and not consuming healthy foods (β = 1.48; 0.19, 2.77, p = 0.026) were significantly associated with increased weight gain. The estimated direct effect of self-reported anxiety/depression on weight was 2.07 kg (1.07, 3.07, p < 0.001). Individuals with obesity significantly gained weight 1 month after the beginning of the quarantine.

We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the following triage tools: the WHO algorithm, NEWS2, CURB-65, CRB-65, PMEWS and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We analysed data from 20892 adults, of whom 4672 (22.4%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2614 (12.5%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.96 and 0.95 respectively), at the expense of specificity (0.31 and 0.27 respectively). NEWS2 showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. Conclusion: CURB-65, PMEWS and NEWS2 provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.","Thomas, Ben; Goodacre, Steve; Lee, Ellen; Sutton, Laura; Loban, Amanda; Waterhouse, Simon; Simmonds, Richard; Biggs, Katie; Marincowitz, Carl; Schutter, Jose; Connelly, Sarah; Sheldon, Elena; Hall, Jamie; Young, Emma; Bentley, Andrew; Challen, Kirsty; Fitzsimmons, Chris; Harris, Tim; Lecky, Fiona; Lee, Andrew; Maconochie, Ian; Walter, Darren",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.20185892; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.02.20185892v1?rss=1,178
623550,Key Considerations for Radiologists When Diagnosing the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2020-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a highly pathogenic and transmissible virus in swine, was first detected in the U.S. in May, 2013, and has caused tremendous losses to the swine industry. Due to the difficulty in isolating and growing this virus in cell culture, few vaccine studies using cell culture propagated PEDV have been performed on U.S. strains in pigs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the humoral immune response to the selected inactivated PEDV vaccine candidate in a dose-titration manner. RESULTS: PEDV was isolated from a pig with diarrhea and complete genome sequencing found >99% nucleotide identity to other U.S. PEDV. Inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccines were administered intramuscularly to five week old pigs in a dose titration experimental design, ranging from 6.0-8.0 log(10) tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)/mL), to evaluate immunogenicity using a fluorescent foci neutralization assay (FFN), fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on sera. Pigs vaccinated with 8.0 log(10) TCID(50)/mL inactivated virus showed significantly higher FFN titers as well as FMIA and ELISA values than 6.0 log(10) TCID(50)/mL vaccinates and the negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the immunogenicity of a PEDV inactivated viral vaccine with a U.S. strain via dose-titration. A future vaccination-challenge study would illustrate the efficacy of an inactivated vaccine and help evaluate protective FFN titers and ELISA and FMIA responses.","Collin, Emily A; Anbalagan, Srivishnupriya; Okda, Faten; Batman, Ron; Nelson, Eric; Hause, Ben M",BMC Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0357-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881296/,178

OBJECTIVE: The current study used Reddit social media data to examine how foster families are faring in the pandemic. Discussion topics were identified and examined for changes before and after COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Comments were collected from three Reddit online discussion boards dedicated to foster families (N = 11,830). METHODS: We used machine learning techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, for topic modeling and textual analysis for qualitative coding of the Reddit comments. RESULTS: Results showed that three main topics had both significant quantitative and meaningful qualitative changes before and after COVID-19. There were significant increases in conversation about becoming a foster parent (F = 5.75, p = 0.02) and activities for foster children (F = 10.61, p = 0.001), whereas there was a significant decrease in discussing permanency (F = 9.46, p = 0.003) before and after the onset of COVID-19. Qualitative coding showed that regarding the topic of becoming a parent, excitement over approval of foster care license before COVID-19 shifted to foster families' increased anxieties about delays in their licensing cases after COVID-19. For permanency, content changed from the best interest of the child and reunifications before COVID-19 to concerns over family separations and permanency challenges after COVID-19. Regarding activities for foster children, content related to everyday activities before COVID-19 changed to specific activities foster children and families could do during lockdowns. Results suggest areas child welfare workers may focus on to better support foster families during and after the pandemic.","Lee, Joyce Y.; Chang, Olivia D.; Ammari, Tawfiq",Child Abuse Negl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411874/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145213421003355; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213421003355; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105262,178

This long period of lockdown greatly disrupted routine life and likely affecting citizens psychological well-being. The psychological toll of the pandemic on Indians is documented. However, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, showed that anxiety ({beta}=0.81, CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress ({beta}=0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms ({beta}=0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with the psychological outcomes. This suggests that the state needs to address the current mental health impacts of a long-drawn out lockdown and its long-term sequelae. Disproportionate burden on women needs immediate attention.

LHQW has been used in routine influenza treatment for decades and plays a role in a broad-spectrum therapy on various influenza viruses. Aims of the study: The therapeutic effects of LHQW in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been fully elucidated. A retrospective study was conducted in patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the influence of LHQW on laboratory results related to the disease, and to provide evidence for the clinical practice of TCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected 248 patients who met the moderate type COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, and received treatment in Tongji Hospital. Patients were divided into control (158 cases, standard treatment) and LHQW treatment (90 cases, standard treatment combined with LHQW) groups according to the different treatments administered. All laboratory data were obtained after 5–7 days’ treatment. RESULTS: In this study, the average patient age was 58.95 years and 131 patients were male. The two groups were comparable in demographic characteristics, symptoms, and treatment. Compared with in the control group, D-dimer and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly lower in the LHQW treatment group (2.47±4.67 vs. 1.68±3.61; 44.47±30.24 vs. 35.39±27.43; both P<0.05).

Evidence for Significant Geographical Disparities,2020-09-10,"Button batteries (BB) are found in common household items and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population when ingested. BBs are made of various chemistries and have a unique size and shape that yield significant injury when lodged in the pediatric esophagus. BBs create a local tissue pH environment of 10 to 13 and can induce liquefactive necrosis at the negative pole. This initial injury can progress with further tissue breakdown even after removal. Unfortunately, patients may present with vague symptoms similar to viral illnesses and there is not always a known history of ingestion. Plain film X‐ray can be diagnostic. Exposure can lead to caustic injury within 2 hours. Thus, timely endoscopic removal is the mainstay of treatment. Novel mitigation and neutralization strategies have been implemented into treatment guidelines. These include the preremoval ingestion of honey or sucralfate and intraoperative irrigation with acetic acid. Depending on the severity of injury following removal, careful consideration should be given for potential delayed complications including fistulization into major vessels which often leads to death. The National Button Battery Taskforce and several industry members have implemented prevention strategies such as educational safety outreach campaigns, child‐resistant packaging changes, and warning labels. Governmental regulation and industry changes are key to limit not only the amount of BB ingestions, but also the devastating consequences that can result. Anonymous reporting of BB injuries through the Global Injury Research Collaborative has been made convenient and centralized through the advent of a user‐friendly smartphone iOS/App Store and Android/GooglePlay application called the “GIRC App”; all specialists who manage foreign body cases should contribute their cases to help prevent future injuries. BB ingestion must be recognized and treated promptly using a multidisciplinary approach to optimize outcomes for these patients. Ultimately, a safer BB technology is critically needed to reduce or eliminate the severe and life‐threatening injuries in children.

The level of knowledge could prompt individuals to take precautionary measures and reduce the spread. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of community members in Ibadan on COVID-19. METHODS: using a descriptive cross-sectional study design, an interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain information from adult community members. Multistage sampling methods were used to select respondents from four local government areas (LGAs). Knowledge scores of causes, mode of spread, signs and symptoms and preventive measures were computed. Scores above the mean were categorized as satisfactory. Bivariate chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were performed on respondents' characteristics and knowledge of COVID-19. RESULTS: respondents interviewed were 480 with a median age of 32 years (range: 18-80 years), and 191 (39.8%) aged between 25 and 34 years. Females were 275 (57.3%), 18 (3.8%) had never heard of COVID-19. The main source of information was radio 88.1% and television 54.3%.

629220,Considerations for Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND: Despite worldwide calls for precautionary measures to combat COVID-19, the public’s preventive intention still varies significantly among different regions. Exploring the influencing factors of the public’s preventive intention is very important to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Previous studies have found that fear can effectively improve the public’s preventive intention, but they ignore the impact of differences in cultural values. The present study examines the combined effect of fear and collectivism on the public’s preventive intention towards COVID-19 through the analysis of social media big data. METHODS: The Sina microblog posts of 108,914 active users from Chinese mainland 31 provinces were downloaded. The data was retrieved from January 11 to February 21, 2020. Afterwards, we conducted a province-level analysis of the contents of downloaded posts. Three lexicons were applied to automatically recognise the scores of fear, collectivism, and preventive intention of 31 provinces. After that, a multiple regression model was established to examine the combined effect of fear and collectivism on the public’s preventive intention towards COVID-19. The simple slope test and the Johnson-Neyman technique were used to test the interaction of fear and collectivism on preventive intention. RESULTS: The study reveals that: (a) both fear and collectivism can positively predict people’s preventive intention and (b) there is an interaction of fear and collectivism on people’s preventive intention, where fear and collectivism reduce each other’s positive influence on people’s preventive intention. CONCLUSION: The promotion of fear on people’s preventive intention may be limited and conditional, and values of collectivism can well compensate for the promotion of fear on preventive intention. These results provide scientific inspiration on how to enhance the public’s preventive intention towards COVID-19 effectively.","Huang, Feng; Ding, Huimin; Liu, Zeyu; Wu, Peijing; Zhu, Meng; Li, Ang; Zhu, Tingshao",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198699/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09674-6,178

Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules. METHODS: Here we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code. RESULTS: We recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.","Berrio, Alejandro; Gartner, Valerie; Wray, Gregory A.",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33088633/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10234,178

This paper reviews the methods used in predicting, designing, and analyzing air distributions in the cabins, among which experimental measurements and numerical simulations are the two popular ones. The experimental measurements have usually been seen as more reliable although they are more expensive and time consuming. Most of the numerical simulations use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that can provide effectively detailed information. Numerous applications using the two methods can be found in the literature for studying air distributions in aircraft cabins, including investigations on more reliable and accurate models. The review in the paper shows that the studies using both experimental measurements and computer simulations are becoming popular. And it is necessary to use a full-scale test rig to obtain reliable and high quality experimental data. What’s more, the hybrid CFD models are found to be rather promising for simulating air distributions in airliner cabins.","Liu, Wei; Mazumdar, Sagnik; Zhang, Zhao; Poussou, Stephane B.; Liu, Junjie; Lin, Chao-Hsin; Chen, Qingyan",Build Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132311002137; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132311002137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288018/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.07.005,178
630679,Predictive value of neutrophil to lymphocyte and platelet to lymphocyte ratio in COVID-19,2020-08-28,"Abstract The Covid 19 pandemic will be remembered for the rapidity with which it spread, the morbidity and mortality associated with it and the paucity of evidence-based management guidelines. One of the major concerns of hospitals was to limit spread of infection to health care workers. Since the virus is spread mainly by respiratory droplets and aerosolized particles, procedures which may potentially disperse viral particles, the so called “aerosol-generating procedures” or AGPs were avoided whenever possible. Included in this category were non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and awake (non-intubated) proning. Accordingly, at many health care facilities, patients who had increasing oxygen requirements were emergently intubated and mechanically ventilated to avoid exposure to AGPs. With experience, clinicians realized that mortality of invasively ventilated patients was high and it was not easy to extubate many of these patients. This raised the concern that HFNC and NIV were being underutilized to avoid intubation and to facilitate extubation. In this article, we attempt to separate fact from fiction and perception from reality pertaining to the aerosol dispersion with NIV, HFNC and AP. We describe precautions that hospitals and health care providers must take to mitigate risks with these devices. Finally, we take a practical approach in describing how we use the three techniques, including the common indications, contraindications and practical aspects of application.","Raoof, Suhail; Nava, Stefano; Carpati, Charles; Hill, Nicholas S.",Chest,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369220319103; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.07.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220319103?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681847/,178

631015,The effect of corticosteroid treatment on patients with coronavirus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-04-10,"Background: Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has caused significant global outbreaks outside China. Many countries have closed their borders with China and performed obligate protective procedures, however, this disease was still rising worldwide. In this report, we aim to identify transmission patterns from China to other countries, along with describing the disease control situation of countries. Methods: We retrospectively collected information about infected cases with COVID-19 from WHO situation reports, official notification websites of health ministries and reliable local newspapers from each country. Descriptive and cluster analysis was performed to describe the transmission characteristics while the logistic regression test was used to estimate the risk factors for the occurrence of an infected individual with an unknown source. Results: A total of 446 infected cases were recorded from 24 countries outside China until 12 February 2020, with the number of reported infected cases were doubled every 3.08 days (range from 2.6 to 3.9). Besides the spread from China, the transmission was originated from sub-endemic countries (Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, France, German). Out of 6 countries got occurrence of an infected individual with unknown source and possible potential factors contributed to this occurrence was a time of epidemic circulating, number of patients and number of clusters when the occurrence still has not happened, and notably, the unreported situation of Chinese tourists information. Conclusions: The situational reports of each country about COVID-19 should be more detailed mentioning the transmissions routes with keeping contact tracing of the unknown cases to increase the control of this disease.","Nguyen-Tran, M.-D.; Abozaid, A.

Psychological health seemed to be a controversial determinant of vaccine hesitancy and remained to be investigated. This study attempted to measure parental psychological distress, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and to explore the potential associations. METHODS: An online survey using convenience sampling method was conducted among parents within the school public health network of Shenzhen. Demographic information and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination were collected. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) was applied to measure psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, 4,748 parents were included (average age: 40.28, standard deviation: 5.08). More than one fifth of them demonstrated psychological distress, in which only 3.3% were moderate to severe symptom. The proportions of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for themselves, their spouses, and their children were 25.2%, 26.1%, and 27.3%, respectively. Parents with psychological distress were more likely to suffer vaccine hesitancy for themselves (OR: 1.277, 95%CI: 1.091∼1.494), for their spouses (OR:1.276, 95%CI: 1.088∼1.496) and children (OR:1.274, 95%CI: 1.092∼1.486). These associations tended to be more significant among parents with mild or severe psychological distress. LIMITATION: Non-random sampling limited the generalization of our findings to all parents. CONCLUSION: Parents had a low level of psychological distress but relatively high willingness of COVID-19 vaccination when there was no local epidemic but persistent risk of imported cases. Targeted health education and intervention strategies should be provided to people with vaccine hesitancy, especially for those who were susceptible to psychological distress.","Xu, Yucheng; Zhang, Ruiyin; Zhou, Zhifeng; Fan, Jingjie; Liang, Jing; Cai, Lin; Peng, Lin; Ren, Fangmei; Lin, Wei",J Affect Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721005784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147967/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721005784?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.003,178

Our aim was to investigate the clinical course and outcome of those patients and to identify factors associated with the need for prolonged ECMO therapy. METHODS: A retrospective single-center study on patients with VV ECMO for COVID-19-associated ARDS was performed. Baseline characteristics, ventilatory and ECMO parameters, and laboratory and virological results were evaluated over time. Six months follow-up was assessed. RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (68.8%) survived to 6 months follow-up with four patients requiring short-term (<28 days) and seven requiring prolonged (⩾28 days) ECMO support. Lung compliance before ECMO was higher in the prolonged than in the short-term group (28.1 (28.8–32.1) ml/cmH(2)O vs 18.7 (17.7–25.0) ml/cmH(2)O, p = 0.030). Mechanical ventilation before ECMO was longer (19 (16–23) days vs 5 (5–9) days, p = 0.002) and SOFA score was higher (12.0 (10.5–17.0) vs 10.0 (9.0–10.0), p = 0.002) in non-survivors compared to survivors. Low viral load during the first days on ECMO tended to indicate worse outcomes. Seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2 occurred in all patients, but did not affect outcome. CONCLUSIONS: VV ECMO support for COVID-19-induced ARDS is justified if initiated early and at an experienced ECMO center. Prolonged ECMO therapy might be required in those patients. Although no relevant predictive factors for the duration of ECMO support were found, the decision to stop therapy should not be made dependent of the length of ECMO treatment.","Dreier, Esther; Malfertheiner, Maximilian Valentin; Dienemann, Thomas; Fisser, Christoph; Foltan, Maik; Geismann, Florian; Graf, Bernhard; Lunz, Dirk; Maier, Lars Siegfried; Müller, Thomas; Offner, Robert; Peterhoff, David; Philipp, Alois; Salzberger, Bernd; Schmidt, Barbara; Sinner, Barbara; Lubnow, Matthias",Perfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612020/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659121995997,178

India is endemic for dengue disease and both of these vector mosquitoes are well established throughout India. Since, Aedes mosquitoes breeds in containers, WHO recommends to do a regular immature surveillance and implement appropriate control measures. Owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic, most of the countries have implemented continuous shutdown/lockdown, which affected the routine Aedes surveillance and vector control measures. In India, the first nation-wide lockdown was implemented on 24(th), March 2020. As of now, Government of India has extended the lockdown till 30th, June 2020. In the present study, two rounds of Aedes surveillance was carried out in two localities of Bangalore City (urban) of Karnataka State, India during the COVID-19 lockdown days and results were compared with pre- lockdown surveillance data to assess the impact of lockdown on Aedes larval indices, breeding habitats and dengue vector control programme. The recorded house index (HI) and Breteau index (BI) were 6.6 and 9.3 in K.P. Agrahara and 4.0 and 5.3 in Palace Guttahalli during pre-lockdown survey. The house index (HI) and Breteau index (BI) were found to be increased to 26.6 and 34.6 in K.P. Agrahara and 21.3 and 28.0 in Palace Guttahalli during the COVID-19 lockdown second survey. Aedes immature density has drastically increased in both the localities due to temporarily discontinued Aedes surveillance, larval control activities like source reduction and anti-larval measures during COVID-19 lockdown. The high indices show that the dengue virus transmission will be increasing in the coming days. The results highly recommend to implement the Aedes vector control programme with limited health staffs following the physical distance and other protectives measures to prevent dengue outbreaks.","Reegan, Appadurai Daniel; Gandhi, Munusamy Rajiv; Asharaja, Antony Cruz; Devi, Chitra; Shanthakumar, Shanmugam Perumal",Heliyon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020320247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043162/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020320247?v=s5,178

For field‐ or laboratory‐based courses in ecological curricula, this presents unique challenges. Fortunately, a diverse set of active learning techniques exists, and these techniques translate well to online settings. However, limited guidance and resources exist for developing, implementing, and evaluating active learning assignments that fulfill specific objectives of ecology‐focused courses. To address these informational gaps, we (a) identify broad learning objectives across a variety of ecology‐focused courses, (b) provide examples, based on our collective online teaching experience, of active learning activities that are relevant to the identified ecological learning objectives, and (c) provide guidelines for successful implementation of active learning assignments in online courses. Using The Wildlife Society's list of online higher education ecology‐focused courses as a guide, we obtained syllabi from 45 ecology‐focused courses, comprising a total of 321 course‐specific learning objectives. We classified all course‐specific learning objectives into at least one of five categories: (a) Identification, (b) Application of Concepts/Hypotheses/Theories, (c) Management of Natural Resources, (d) Development of Professional Skills, or (e) Evaluation of Concepts/Practices. We then provided two examples of active learning activities for each of the five categories, along with guidance on their implementation in online settings.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes atypical infiltrated pneumonia with many neurological symptoms, and major sleep changes. The exposure of people to stress, such as social confinement and changes in daily routines, is accompanied by various sleep disturbances, known as ‘coronasomnia’ phenomenon. Sleep disorders induce neuroinflammation, which promotes the blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and entry of antigens and inflammatory factors into the brain. Here, we review findings and trends in sleep research in 2020–2021, demonstrating how COVID-19 and sleep disorders can induce BBB leakage via neuroinflammation, which might contribute to the ‘coronasomnia’ phenomenon. The new studies suggest that the control of sleep hygiene and quality should be incorporated into the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients. We also discuss perspective strategies for the prevention of COVID-19-related BBB disorders. We demonstrate that sleep might be a novel biomarker of BBB leakage, and the analysis of sleep EEG patterns can be a breakthrough non-invasive technology for diagnosis of the COVID-19-caused BBB disruption.","Semyachkina-Glushkovskaya, Oxana; Mamedova, Aysel; Vinnik, Valeria; Klimova, Maria; Saranceva, Elena; Ageev, Vasily; Yu, Tingting; Zhu, Dan; Penzel, Thomas; Kurths, Jürgen",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203143/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136917,178

We determined whether dysfunction is global or regional, and whether it is associated with the cytokine milieu, microangiopathy, or severity of shock. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed echocardiographic parameters of myocardial deformation and compared global and segmental left ventricular strain between 43 cases with MIS‐C ≤18 years old and 40 controls. Primary outcomes included left ventricular global longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain), and left atrial strain. We evaluated relationships between strain and profiles of 10 proinflammatory cytokines, microangiopathic features (soluble C5b9), and vasoactive‐inotropic requirements. Compared with controls, cases with MIS‐C had significant impairments in all parameters of systolic and diastolic function. 65% of cases with MIS‐C had abnormal left ventricular function (|global longitudinal strain|<17%), although elevations of cytokines were modest. All left ventricular segments were involved, without apical or basal dominance to suggest acute stress cardiomyopathy. Worse global longitudinal strain correlated with higher ratios of interleukin‐6 (ρ −0.43) and interleukin‐8 (ρ −0.43) to total hypercytokinemia, but not absolute levels of interleukin‐6 or interleukin‐8, or total hypercytokinemia. Similarly, worse right ventricular free wall strain correlated with higher relative interleukin‐8 expression (ρ −0.59). There were no significant associations between function and microangiopathy or vasoactive‐inotropic requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial function is globally decreased in MIS‐C and not explained by acute stress cardiomyopathy. Cardiac dysfunction may be driven by the relative skew of the immune response toward interleukin‐6 and interleukin‐8 pathways, more so than degree of hyperinflammation, refining the current paradigm of myocardial involvement in MIS‐C.","Chang, Joyce C.; Matsubara, Daisuke; Morgan, Ryan W.; Diorio, Caroline; Nadaraj, Sumekala; Teachey, David T.; Bassiri, Hamid; Behrens, Edward M.; Banerjee, Anirban",J Am Heart Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365798/; https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.121.021428,178

We estimated the values of key infection-related quantities that determine the course of natural infection from viral load data, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The data were placebo group viral load measurements collected during volunteer challenge studies, conducted by Roche, as part of the oseltamivir trials. We calculated the values of the quantities for each patient and the correlations between the quantities, symptom severity and body temperature. The greatest variation among individuals occurred in the viral load peak and area under the viral load curve. Total symptom severity correlated positively with the basic reproductive number. The most sensitive endpoint for therapeutic trials with the goal to cure patients is the duration of infection.

However, the exact mechanism has been unknown. To assess the effectiveness of skeletal muscles in reducing neuronal injury after the initial damage owing to cardiac arrest, we investigated the relationship between estimated lean body mass (LBM) and the prognosis of postcardiac arrest patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with ROSC after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from January 2015 to March 2020. The enrolled patients were allocated into good- and poor-outcome groups (cerebral performance category (CPC) scores 1–2 and 3–5, respectively). Estimated LBM was categorized into quartiles. Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate the association between LBM and a good CPC score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was assessed. Results: In total, 155 patients were analyzed (CPC score 1–2 vs. 3–5, n = 70 vs. n = 85). Patients’ age, first monitored rhythm, no-flow time, presumed cause of arrest, BMI, and LBM were different (p < 0.05).

641883,"Relations between demographic, geographic, and environmental statistics, and the spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy",2020-09-18,"Vaccination is the current strategy for control and prevention of severe rotavirus infections, a major cause of acute, dehydrating diarrhoea in young children worldwide. Public health interventions aimed at improving water, food and sanitation are unlikely adequately to control the disease. The development of vaccines against severe rotavirus diarrhoea is based upon homotypic or heterotypic protection provided against either a single common G serotype (monovalent vaccines) or against multiple serotypes (multivalent vaccines). Rotavirus strain surveillance has a high priority in disease control programmes worldwide. The continued identification of the most common G and P serotypes for inclusion in vaccines is an important priority. And subsequent to the introduction of a vaccine candidate, not only monitoring of circulating strains is recommended, but also surveillance of potential reassortment of animal rotavirus genes from the vaccine into human rotavirus strains is critical. Conventional methods used in the characterisation of rotavirus strains, such as enzyme immunoassay serotyping and reverse‐transcription PCR‐based genotyping often fail to identify uncommon and newly appearing strains. The application of newer molecular approaches, including sequencing and oligonucleotide microarray hybridisation, may be required to characterise such strains. The present paper presents a brief overview of the variety of standard methods available, followed by suggestions for a systematic approach for routine rotavirus strain surveillance as well as for characterisation of incompletely typed rotavirus strains. Improved detection and characterisation of incompletely typed strains will help to develop a comprehensive strain surveillance that may be required for tailoring effective rotavirus vaccines.

METHODS: This study is a retrospective, multicenter analysis of general surgery emergency operations performed during the period from 1 March to 15th 2020 lockdown and in the same time period of 2019 in three medical centers providing emergency surgical care to the area Salzburg-North, Austria. RESULTS: In total 165 emergency surgeries were performed in the study period of 2020 compared to 287 in 2019. This is a significant decrease of 122 (42.5%) emergency surgeries during the COVID-19 lockdown (p = 0.005). The length of hospital stay was reduced to 3 days in 2020 compared to 4 in 2019. Appendectomy remained the most performed emergency surgery for both periods; however the number of surgeries was reduced to less than a half, with 72 cases in 2019 and 33 cases in 2020 (p = 0.118). Emergency colon surgery observed the strongest decrease of 75% from 17 cases in 2019 to 4 in 2020. In addition, the emergency abdominal wall hernia, cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis, small surgeries and proctological emergencies recorded drops of 70%, 39%, 33% and 47% respectively. The strongest reduction in frequencies of emergency surgeries was reported from the designated COVID center in the examined region. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency general surgery is an essential service that continues to run under all circumstances. Our data show that COVID-19-related restrictions have resulted in a significant decrease in the utilization of acute surgical care.","Presl, Jaroslav; Varga, Martin; Mittermair, Christof; Mitterwallner, Stefan; Weitzendorfer, Michael; Gabersek, Ana; Borhanian, Kurosch; Heuberger, Andreas; Weiss, Helmut; Emmanuel, Klaus; von Rahden, Burkhard; Koch, Oliver Owen",Eur Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686347/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10353-021-00692-1,178

This study aims to characterize the pattern of PPE use among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the first wave of coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) in Egypt and to determine the factors associated with compliance to the proper use of PPE. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Egyptian HCWs using an online self-administered questionnaire. Participants were classified as “Compliant” or “Non-compliant” according to their score. RESULTS: A total of 404 responses were analyzed, with a mean age of 36.6 ± 8.4 years, and 56.4% were females. Non-compliant HCWs represented 53.2% of participants. The majority reported shortage in N95 respirators (91.3%) and practiced extended PPE use (88.1%). Better compliance to proper PPE use was reported: females (51.3%, p = 0.05), Physicians (54.2 %, p = 0.005), medical specialities (34.7 %, p < 0.001), <10 years’ work experience (42.9%, p = 0.05) and working > eight hours/day (71.3%, p < 0.001). The significant predictors for compliance were; receiving prior training on the proper use of PPE (OR: 4.59, CI: 2.22–9.47, p ≤ 0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (OR: 2.75, CI: 1.19–6.35, p = 0.02) and performing procedures that pose HCWs at a high risk of exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (OR: 2.21, CI: 1.04–4.71, p = 0.04).

Anesthesiologists were one of the key professionals fighting the pandemic and have been highly exposed at their multiple sites of clinical practice. Thus, the importance of determining the nature of the infection in this population that provides care to SARS-CoV-2 patients. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study administering an online questionnaire to examine the demographic and epidemiological profile of these professionals in Brazil, and to describe the risk factors for viral infection during the pandemic. Results A total of 1,127 anesthesiologists answered the questionnaire, 55.2% were men, more than 90% with age below 60 years, with infection and reinfection rates of 14.7% and 0.5%, respectively, and 47.2% reported a significant income reduction. The predictors of COVID-19 contamination were practicing in operating rooms (OR = 0.42; 95% CI 0.23–0.78), direct contact with infected patients (OR = 5.74; 95% CI 3.05–11.57), indirect contact with infected patients (OR = 2.43; 95% CI 1.13–5.33), working in a pre-hospital setting (OR = 2.36; 95% CI 1.04–5.03), and presence of immunosuppression, except for cancer (OR = 4.89; 95% CI 1.16–19.01).

Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system is a multi-component and multipronged immune effector, activated by viral RNA that previously has not been repurposed for disease detection owing in part to the complex enzyme reconstitution process and functionality. Here, we describe the construction and application of a virus detection method, based on an in vivo-reconstituted Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system. This system harnesses both RNA- and transcription-activated dual nucleic acid cleavage activities as well as internal signal amplification that allow virus detection with high sensitivity and at multiple settings. We demonstrate the use of the Type III-A system-based method in detection of SARS-CoV-2 that reached 2000 copies/µl sensitivity in amplification-free and 60 copies/µl sensitivity via isothermal amplification within 30 min and diagnosed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in both settings. The high sensitivity, flexible reaction conditions, and the small molecular-driven amplification make the Type III-A system a potentially unique nucleic acid detection method with broad applications.","Sridhara, Sagar; Goswami, Hemant N; Whyms, Charlisa; Dennis, Jonathan H; Li, Hong",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25977-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580296/,178

METHODS: This study was accepted in Research Ethics Committee in July 2019 (number 3469402). Healthy patients (n = 20) aged 3–9 years, with at least one primary molar with occlusal dentine caries without cusp involvement were randomly allocated to either the ART + Brix3000™ group or the ART-only group. The sample was characterised by sex, age, tooth location and caries experience. Time spent and pain experience scores were recorded at prophylaxis, caries removal and restoration. The pain experience (intense, moderate, or mild) was evaluated by the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability-revised scale (FLACC-r). Acceptability was assessed by a five-point hedonic facial scale (dichotomised into ‘like’ and ‘indifferent/dislike’ bins) and by an open-question interview. Mann–Whitney, Chi-square, and Fisher’s exact tests were applied to discern differences in time, pain/sample characterisation and acceptability, respectively. RESULTS: The ART + Brix3000™ group required 8.6 ± 3.1 min to remove caries tissue, whereas the ART group required only 4.8 ± 2.0 min (p = 0.03). The total time spent with treatments was 13.1 ± 4.0 min for ART + Brix3000™, and 9.8 ± 2.7 min for ART (p = 0.03). There was no difference in pain experience and acceptability found among the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although the ART + Brix3000™ technique demanded more treatment time than the ART alone, there were no differences in either pain experience or acceptability.","de Souza, T.

This disorder affects the connective tissue and is characterized by severe bone resorption. Hajdu-Cheney syndrome most frequently affects the head and feet bones (acroosteolysis). Case report: We present an extremely rare case of a 34-year-old male with Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. The patient was admitted to the Department of Oral Surgery, Medical University of Gdańsk, in order to perform the extraction of three teeth. These teeth were not eligible for conservative treatment and prosthetic reconstruction. The patient was treated with denosumab (angiogenesis and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB RANK ligand inhibitor, RANKL). Discussion: Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL. This drug works through a suppression of osteoclast activity. In cases of patients in which the pathway of the RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin is dysregulated, denosumab has been approved for the treatment off-label. In patients receiving denosumab, a delayed wound healing in the oral cavity and osteonecrosis may occur. Dental procedures involving the alveolar bone process (tooth extractions and bone alveoloplasty) may be a risk factor for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Spontaneous osteonecrosis is rarely observed. MRONJ consists of the destruction of exposed bone, with the exposure persisting for a minimum of 6–8 weeks. This is the first article about an HCS patient treated with denosumab who underwent invasive oral surgery procedures. This case report highlights the difficulties for professionals occurring during the oral surgery procedures in such patients.","Kaczoruk-Wieremczuk, Magdalena; Adamska, Paulina; Adamski, Łukasz Jan; Wychowański, Piotr; Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara Alicja; Starzyńska, Anna",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501688/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179099,178

However, the information found on the internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms “Prevention coronavirus,” “Prevention COVID-19,” “Prevención coronavirus,” and “Prevención COVID-19”. A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was “wash your hands frequently” (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to “stay home if you feel unwell” (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as “wash your hands frequently” (OR 9.82), “cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze” (OR 4.59), or “stay home if you feel unwell” (OR 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the internet. In this way, users will be able to obtain high-quality information more frequently, and such websites may improve their accessibility and positioning, given that search engines justify the positioning of links obtained in a search based on the frequency of access to them.","Hernández-García, Ignacio; Giménez-Júlvez, Teresa",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/18717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217507/,178

OBJECTIVES: To investigate antibiotic prescribing practices in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an international web-based survey and investigated the pattern of antibiotic use as reported by physicians involved in treatment of COVID-19. SPSS Statistics version 25 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 166 participants from 23 countries and 82 different hospitals. Local guidelines for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients were reported by 61.8% (n = 102) of participants and for 82.9% (n = 136) they did not differ from local community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. Clinical presentation was recognized as the most important reason for the start of antibiotics (mean score = 4.07 and SD = 1.095 on grading scale from 1 to 5). When antibiotics were started, most respondents rated as the highest the need for coverage of atypical pathogens (mean score = 2.8 and SD = 0.99), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (mean score = 2.67 and SD = 1.05 on bi-modal scale, with values 1 and 2 for disagreement and values 3 and 4 for agreement). In the patients on the ward, 29.1% of respondents chose not to prescribe any antibiotic. Combination of β-lactams and macrolides or fluoroquinolones was reported by 52.4% (n = 87) of respondents. In patients in the ICU, piperacillin/tazobactam was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic. The mean reported duration of antibiotic treatment was 7.12 (SD = 2.44) days.

DESIGN: This was a qualitative study deploying face-to-face, semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was carried out to analyse the data. SETTING: Paediatric respiratory clinics in three tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 16 caregivers providing unpaid asthma-related care and assistance to children under 14 years who had been diagnosed with asthma for more than 1 year and were not only treated with short-acting β2-agonists. RESULTS: Six main themes were identified: (1) improved asthma control; (2) decreased willingness to seek medical care driven by fear; (3) increased adherence due to enhanced awareness of asthma control; (4) coping strategies for changes caused by COVID-19; (5) a new opportunity and (6) managing new challenges in asthma control. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak and the measures in response to it have had significant impacts on asthma control among children. Children with asthma are advised to continue good asthma management, take their prescribed asthma medications as normal, wash their hands regularly and wear face masks. Regularly supported self-management and remote consultations should be provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, supporting people financially, providing continued medical support and alleviating any fear and anxiety should be considered.

656875,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Pregnancy: A narrative review,2021,"There is an increasing evidence that meteorological (temperature, humidity, dew) and air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO) are affecting the COVID-19 transmission rate and the number of deaths in many countries around the globe. However, there are contradictory results due to limited observations of these parameters and absence of conclusive evidence on such relationships in cold or hot arid tropical and subtropical desert climate of Gulf region. This is the first study exploring the relationships of the meteorological (temperature, humidity, dew) and air quality indicators (PM10, CO, and SO2) with daily COVID-19 infections and death cases for a period of six months (1st March to August 31, 2020) in six selected cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by using generalized additive model. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to assess factors affecting the infections rate and deaths through the selection of best model whereas overfitting of multivariate model was avoided by usingcross-validation. Spearman correlation indicated that exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) temperature and humidity (R > 0.5, P < 0.0001) are the main variables affecting the daily COVID-19 infections and deaths. EWMA temperature and humidity showed non linear relationships with the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths (DF > 1, P < 0.0001). Daily COVID-19 infections showed a positive relationship at temperature between 23 and 34.5 °C and humidity ranging from 30 to 60%; a negative relationship was found below and/or above these ranges. Similarly, the number of deaths had a positive relationship at temperature ˃28.7 °C and with humidity ˂40%, showing higher number of deaths above this temperature and below this humidity rate. All air quality indicators had linear relationships with the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths (P < 0.0001). Hence, variation in temperature, humidity and air pollution indicators could be important factors influencing the COVID-19 spread and mortality. Under the current scenario with rising temperature and humidity, the number of cases is increasing, hence it justifies an active government policy to lessen COVID-19 infection rate.","Ismail, Iqbal M.I.; Rashid, Muhammad Imtiaz; Ali, Nadeem; Saeed Altaf, Bothinah Abdullah; Munir, Muhammad",Environ Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121013669; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112071; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121013669?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562487/,178

It is unknown whether these patients are more susceptible to poor outcomes and recurrence of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We report a retrospective analysis of outcomes of 15 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies who experienced COVID-19 and subsequently underwent autologous (n=8) or allogeneic (n=7) HCT between 6/17/20 and 2/17/21. The reported cohort included patients with asymptomatic past infections or symptomatic COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Data were obtained from chart review. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics. RESULTS: Among eight patients who underwent autologous HCT, four had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma while the rest had a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Four of the eight patients did not test positive for anti-SARS- CoV-2 IgG antibody at any point during their course. The remaining four patients had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies prior to autologous HCT but only two of these patients remained anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody-positive at their last follow-up. One patient died from progression of disease. Seven patients with prior COVID-19 underwent allogeneic HCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=3); acute myeloid leukemia (n=1); chronic myeloid leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis (n=1); myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1); and myelofibrosis (n=1). Three of the seven patients tested positive for anti-SARS- CoV-2 IgG antibodies following the initial COVID-19 diagnosis; however, only one of these patients retained anti-SARS- CoV-2 IgG antibody following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. One patient died of infections (fungal and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) occurring in the context of ongoing treatment for GVHD. None of the 15 patients developed recurrence of COVID-19 infection.

The guidelines were drafted with the assistance of a working group of experts in infectious diseases, transplantation, and public health. For the purposes of this report, HSCT is defined as any transplantation of blood-or marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, regardless of transplant type (i.e., allogeneic or autologous) or cell source (i.e., bone marrow, peripheral blood, or placental or umbilical cord blood). Such OIs as bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and helminth infections occur with increased frequency or severity among HSCT recipients. These evidence-based guidelines contain information regarding preventing OIs, hospital infection control, strategies for safe living after transplantation, vaccinations, and hematopoietic stem cell safety. The disease-specific sections address preventing exposure and disease for pediatric and adult and autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. The goal of these guidelines is twofold: to summarize current data and provide evidence-based recommendations regarding preventing OIs among HSCT patients. The guidelines were developed for use by HSCT recipients, their household and close contacts, transplant and infectious diseases physicians, HSCT center personnel, and public health professionals. For all recommendations, prevention strategies are rated by the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation. Adhering to these guidelines should reduce the number and severity of OIs among HSCT recipients.

The aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n = 111 patients. Cardiac biomarkers subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range. RESULTS: Increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38 and 56% of the cases, respectively. As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and d-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n = 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP (p = 0.02), whereas right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p = 0.022 and p = 0.03, respectively). Both hs-Troponin and NP were higher in patients with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). On multivariable analysis, independent associations were found of hs-Troponin with age, PaO2/FIO2 and d-dimer (B = 0.419, p = 0.001; B = − 0.212, p = 0.013; and B = 0.179, p = 0.037, respectively) and of NP with age and previous CVD (B = 0.480, p < 0.001; and B = 0.253, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial involvement at admission is common in COVID-19 pneumonia. Independent associations of hs-Troponin with markers of disease severity and of NP with underlying CVD might point toward existing different mechanisms leading to their elevation in this setting.

658176,The Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Use in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients,2021-03-11,"Rising drug spending has led to increased calls to curtail drug costs. However, it is unclear where to target policy solutions. We estimated excess returns (the extent to which a firm’s profits are higher than expected given the risk associated with their investments) for manufacturers and middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain to determine who is making excessive profits. Excess returns were calculated as the difference between return on invested capital and the expected returns given risk, which is known as the weighted average cost of capital. We compared excess returns for manufacturers and middlemen to the average for S&P 500 companies. We find that both manufacturers and middlemen have higher excess returns in 2013–2018 compared with the S&P 500. However, if we treat research and development (R&D) as an investment rather than an expense, we find that excess returns for pharmaceutical manufacturers are lower than the S&P 500 (1.7% vs. 3.6%), but biotech manufacturers (9.6%), wholesalers (8.1%), and insurers/PBM/retailers (5.9%) continue to have significantly higher excess returns compared to the S&P 500. Our findings suggest public policies that promote competition in all areas of the pharmaceutical supply chain are important avenues for curtailing drug spending.

659241,"Heart failure in COVID-19: the multicentre, multinational PCHF-COVICAV registry",2021,"Given the manifold ways that depression impairs Darwinian fitness, the persistence in the human genome of risk alleles for the disorder remains a much debated mystery. Evolutionary theories that view depressive symptoms as adaptive fail to provide parsimonious explanations for why even mild depressive symptoms impair fitness-relevant social functioning, whereas theories that suggest that depression is maladaptive fail to account for the high prevalence of depression risk alleles in human populations. These limitations warrant novel explanations for the origin and persistence of depression risk alleles. Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection. Depression risk alleles identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies were found to be regularly associated with immune responses to infection that were likely to enhance survival in the ancestral environment. Moreover, data support the role of specific depressive symptoms in pathogen host defense including hyperthermia, reduced bodily iron stores, conservation/withdrawal behavior, hypervigilance and anorexia. By shifting the adaptive context of depression risk alleles from relations with conspecifics to relations with the microbial world, the Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how depression can be nonadaptive in the social realm, whereas its risk alleles are nonetheless represented at prevalence rates that bespeak an adaptive function.","Raison, C L; Miller, A H",Mol Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290120/; https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2012.2,178
660238,"Pentoxifylline effects on hospitalized patients with COVID19: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial",2021-10-06,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is stretching medical resources internationally, sometimes creating ventilator shortages that complicate clinical and ethical situations. The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns in addition to clinical conditions needing treatment. Wherever ventilators are employed, additional tubing and splitting adaptors may be available. Adjustable flow-compensating resistance for differences in lung compliance on individual limbs may not be readily implementable. By exploring a number and range of possible contributing factors using computational simulation without risk of patient harm, this paper attempts to define useful bounds for ventilation parameters when compensatory resistance in limbs of a shared breathing circuit is not possible. This desperate approach to shared ventilation support would be a last resort when alternatives have been exhausted. METHODS: A whole-body computational physiology model (using lumped parameters) was used to simulate each patient being ventilated. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. In addition to lung mechanics or estimation of CO(2) and pH expected for set ventilation parameters (considerations of lung physiology alone), full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. FINDINGS: To be useful for clinicians, attention has been directed to clinically available parameters. These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and end-tidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 mL/cmH(2)O, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. INTERPRETATION: In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if that option is unavailable and ventilator sharing using limbs without flow resistance compensation is the only available alternative, these simulations provide a conceptual framework and guidelines for clinical patient selection.","Webb, Jeffrey B.; Bray, Aaron; Asare, Philip K.; Clipp, Rachel B.; Mehta, Yatin B.; Penupolu, Sudheer; Patel, Aalpen A.; Poler, S.

660273,High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation for Adult Patients With ARDS,2015-12-18,"Traditional diagnostic assays often lack sensitivity and can be difficult to multiplex across many pathogens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can overcome some of these problems but has limited application in the detection of low-copy-number pathogens in complex samples. Targeted genome capture (TGC) utilizes oligonucleotide probes to enrich specific nucleic acids in heterogeneous extracts and can therefore increase the proportion of NGS reads for low-abundance targets. While earlier studies have demonstrated the utility of this technology for detection of novel pathogens in human clinical samples, the capacity and practicality of TGC-NGS in a veterinary diagnostic setting have not yet been evaluated. Here we report the use of TGC-NGS assays for the detection and characterization of diverse feline pathogen taxa. We detected 31 pathogens comprising nine pathogen taxa in 28 felid samples analyzed. This included 20 pathogens detected via traditional PCR and 11 additional pathogens that had not been previously detected in the same samples. Most of the pathogens detected were sequenced at sufficient breadth and depth to confidently classify them at the species or subspecies level. Target nucleic acids were enriched from a low of 58-fold to 56 million-fold relative to host nucleic acids. Despite the promising performance of these assays, a number of pathogens detected by conventional PCR or serology were not isolated by TGC-NGS, suggesting that further validation is required before this technology can be used in lieu of quality-controlled standard assays. We conclude that TGC-NGS offers great potential as a broad multiplex pathogen characterization assay in veterinary diagnostic and research settings.","Lee, Justin S.; Mackie, Ryan S.; Harrison, Thomas; Shariat, Basir; Kind, Trey; Kehl, Timo; Löchelt, Martin; Boucher, Christina; VandeWoude, Sue",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28330894/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01463-16,178

The aim of this study was to evaluate factors related to weight gain during lockdown in patients with a sleeve gastrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 48 obese subjects with previous bariatric surgery was enrolled. After a 7-week confinement, a telephone interview was conducted. In this phone call, self-reported body weight gain and different factors were recorded. In order to obtain the basal and pre-surgical data, biochemical and anthropometric parameters were recorded from electronic medical record. RESULTS: The mean age was 45.3±8.0 years (range: 23–61) and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.5±7.5 kg/m(2) (range: 28.6–34.2). Gender distribution was 38 females (79.2%) and 10 males (20.8%). The increase in self-reported body weight was 3.8±2.1 kg during the 7 weeks of confinement. And the self-reported body weight gain was lower in subjects with regular exercise (4.6±0.9 vs 1.1±0.3 kg; p=0.02). The number of face-to-face visits to the nutrition office that did not attend was 0.61±0.81 (range: 0–4) per patient. In the multiple regression analysis with self-reported body weight gain as a dependent variable, the physical activity (minutes/week) remained as a protective factor with a beta coefficient of −0.09 (95% CI: −0.001 to 0.016; p=0.03) and number of face-to-face appointments in the nutrition consultation missed as a risk factor with a beta coefficient of 9.65 (95% CI: 1.17–18.12; p=0.03).

However, lockdown measures during COVID-19 have limited people’s opportunity to exercise regularly. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of Fitness and Dance training, followed by four weeks of COVID-19-induced detraining, on cardiac adaptations and physical performance indicators in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Twelve older adults (6 males and 6 females) with MCI (age, 73 ± 4.4 y; body mass, 75.3 ± 6.4 kg; height, 172 ± 8 cm; MMSE score: 24–27) participated in eight weeks of a combined Fitness-Dance training intervention (two sessions/week) followed by four weeks of training cessation induced by COVID-19 lockdowns. Wireless Polar Team Pro and Polar heart rate sensors (H10) were used to monitor covered distance, speed, heart rate (HR min, avg and max), time in HR zone 1 to 5, strenuousness (load score), beat-to-beat interval (max RR and avg RR) and heart rate variability (HRV-RMSSD). One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data of the three test sessions (T1: first training session, T2: last training session of the eight-week training program, and T3: first training session after the four-week training cessation). Statistical analysis showed that eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training induced beneficial cardiac adaptations by decreasing HR (HR min, HR avg and HR max) with p < 0.001, ES = 0.5–0.6 and Δ = −7 to−9 bpm, and increasing HRV related responses (max and avg RR and RMSSD), with p < 0.01 and ES = 0.4. Consequently, participants spent more time in comfortable HR zones (e.g., p < 0.0005; ES = 0.7; Δ = 25% for HR zone 1) and showed reduced strenuousness (p = 0.02, Δ = −15% for load score), despite the higher covered total distance and average speed (p < 0.01; ES = 0.4). However, these changes were reversed after only four weeks of COVID-19 induced detraining, with values of all parameters returning to their baseline levels. In conclusion, eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training seems to be an efficient strategy to promote cardioprotective benefits in older adults with MCI. Importantly, to maintain these health benefits, training has to be continued and detraining periods should be reduced. During a pandemic, home-based exercise programs may provide an effective and efficient alternative of physical training.","Ammar, Achraf; Boukhris, Omar; Halfpaap, Nicole; Labott, Berit Kristin; Langhans, Corinna; Herold, Fabian; Grässler, Bernhard; Müller, Patrick; Trabelsi, Khaled; Chtourou, Hamdi; Zmijewski, Piotr; Driss, Tarak; Glenn, Jordan M.; Müller, Notger G.; Hoekelmann, Anita",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073051/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115930,178

Seven variables were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality: age (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.07–1.09), male sex (HR 1.62, 95%CI 1.30–2.00), duration of symptoms before hospital admission <10 days (HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.39–2.12), diabetes (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.02–1.45), coronary heart disease (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.09–1.80), chronic liver disease (HR 1.78, 95%CI 1.16–2.72), and lactate dehydrogenase levels at admission (HR 1.0003, 95%CI 1.0002–1.0005). The AUC was 0.822 (95%CI 0.722–0.922) in the derivation cohort and 0.820 (95%CI 0.724–0.920) in the validation cohort with good calibration. The prediction rule is freely available as a web-app (COVID-CALC: https://sites.google.com/community.unipa.it/covid-19riskpredictions/c19-rp). CONCLUSIONS: A validated simple clinical prediction rule can promptly and accurately assess the risk for in-hospital mortality, improving triage and the management of patients with COVID-19.","Magro, Bianca; Zuccaro, Valentina; Novelli, Luca; Zileri, Lorenzo; Celsa, Ciro; Raimondi, Federico; Gori, Mauro; Cammà, Giulia; Battaglia, Salvatore; Genova, Vincenzo Giuseppe; Paris, Laura; Tacelli, Matteo; Mancarella, Francesco Antonio; Enea, Marco; Attanasio, Massimo; Senni, Michele; Di Marco, Fabiano; Lorini, Luca Ferdinando; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Bruno, Raffaele; Cammà, Calogero; Gasbarrini, Antonio",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444411/,178

As governments have pushed physical and social distancing as protective strategies, this study explores the extent to which this approach is relevant for Syrian refugees living in Lebanon and Turkey. METHODS: This qualitative study draws on 11 interviews with refugee experts and development practitioners (3) and Syrian refugee families (4 from Turkey, 4 from Lebanon) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a review of recent literature. In addition, it draws on 71 semi-structured interviews with staff at NGOs supporting refugees (48 from Turkey, 23 from Lebanon) collected in 2018. Qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti 8 was used to perform content-based thematic analysis using both deductive and inductive coding. FINDINGS: The study finds that distancing—physically and socially—can be ineffective as a disease protection strategy in Syrian refugee communities. This is influenced by six major interconnected dimensions of refugee vulnerability—political, material, spatial, physiological, psychological and sociocultural—which collectively form an interdisciplinary framework to guide more relevant COVID-19 interventions in refugee communities. The inability to distance is not necessarily rooted in lack of knowledge. Rather, when the inside conditions of living are crowded and unhygienic, but also include cultural expectations of familial care, and the outside conditions of survival-necessitated work are perpetuated through precarious political protections, distancing becomes impractical in application, despite the sense of internalized responsibility to keep one another safe. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that more relevant COVID-19 interventions and protection measures must consider the non-physiological manifestations of disease across multiple dimensions of vulnerability to mitigate decreased distancing abilities in settings of refugee life.","Munajed, Dima Al; Ekren, Elizabeth",J Migr Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405174/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmh.2020.100023,178

This study aims to investigate the relationship of obesity, as defined by the body mass index (BMI), with morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Data from 5628 confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Korea. The hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality in the BMI groups were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for covariates. The odds ratios (ORs) of morbidity and diabetes in the BMI groups were analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for the same covariates. Both underweight and obesity were associated with a higher HR for mortality (adjusted HR = 2.28, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] = 1.23–4.25, p = 0.009 for underweight and adjusted HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.10–2.66, p = 0.017 for obese). Obesity was related to higher odds of morbidity (adjusted OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.32–2.21, p < 0.001).

However, whilst chickens may be acutely susceptible, ducks appear to be asymptomatic to H5N1. The mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are not well understood and the variation between different species requires investigation to help explain these species differences. Here we investigated the expression of several key proinflammatory cytokines of chickens and ducks following infection with 2 highly pathogenic H5N1 (A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/453/2004 (Vt453) and A/Duck/Indramayu/BBVW/109/2006 (Ind109)) and a low-pathogenic H5N3 influenza virus (A/Duck/Victoria/1462/2008 (Vc1462)). H5N1 viruses caused fatal infections in chickens as well as high viral loads and increased production of proinflammatory molecules when compared to ducks. Cytokines, including Interleukin 6 (IL6) and the acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA), were rapidly induced at 24 h post infection with H5N1. In contrast, low induction of these cytokines appeared in ducks and only at later times during the infection period. These observations support that hypercytokinemia may contribute to pathogenesis in chickens, whilst the lower cytokine response in ducks may be a factor in their apparent resistance to disease and decreased mortality.","Burggraaf, Simon; Karpala, Adam J.; Bingham, John; Lowther, Sue; Selleck, Paul; Kimpton, Wayne; Bean, Andrew G.D.",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214001191; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657784/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214001191,178

Using a survey experiment fielded in the midst of contentious public debate over flying fox management in urban and suburban areas of Australia, we find that stories with characters (i.e., narratives) are more effective than descriptive information at mobilizing support for different forms of bat management, including legal protection, relocation, and habitat restoration. We use conditional process analysis to show that narratives, particularly with accompanying images, are effective because they cause emotional reactions that influence risk perception, which in turn drives public opinion about strategies for risk mitigation. We find that prior attitudes towards bats matter in how narrative messages are received, in particular in how strongly they generate shifts in affective response, risk perception, and public opinion. Our results suggest that those with warm prior attitudes towards bats report greater support for bat dispersal when they perceive impacts from bats to be more likely, while those with cool priors report greater support for bat protection when they perceive impacts from bats to be more positive, revealing 1) potential opportunities for targeted messaging to boost public buy-in of proposals to manage risks associated with human-wildlife interactions, and 2) potential vulnerabilities to disinformation regarding risk.","Guenther, Sara K.; Shanahan, Elizabeth A.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370410/,178

Clinical recurrence of COVID-19 in convalescent patients has been reported, which immune mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Presence of neutralizing antibodies suggests other types of immune response are involved. Methods. We assessed the innate type I/III IFN response, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 with IFN{gamma} ELISPOT, binding and neutralizing antibody assays, in two monozygotic twin pairs with one COVID-19 recurrence case. Results. In pair 1, four months after a first mild episode of infection for both siblings, one displayed severe clinical recurrence of COVID-19. Twin pair 2 of siblings underwent non-recurring asymptomatic infection. All fours individuals presented similar overall responses, except for remarkably difference found in specific cellular responses. Recurring sibling presented a reduced number of recognized T cell epitopes as compared to the other three including her non-recurring sibling. Conclusions. Our results suggest that an effective SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune response is key for complete viral control and avoidance of clinical recurrence of COVID-19. Besides, adaptive immunity can be distinct in MZ twins. Given the rising concern about SARS-CoV-2 variants that evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection, our study stresses the importance of T cell responses in protection against recurrence/reinfection.","Castro, M.

This research attempts to reveal and characterize the patterns of China's policy against COVID-19. Bibliometric methods are applied for studying policy evolution, with the aim of discovering the transitions of the policies over time, the collaborations among policy makers, and the effects of the policies. A total of 366 policies of epidemic prevention are collected. Policy topic shifting, the cooperation of policy-issuing agencies, and the policy content of agencies are analyzed. According to the results, China's policies are implemented in four stages. Moreover, the policy's foci against COVID-19 shifted from medical support in the early stage to economic development in the late stage. Agencies involved in the policymaking can be categorized into three types: leading agencies, key agencies, and auxiliary agencies, with their corresponding administrative influence ranked in this order. Especially, the Chinese government adopted a multi-agency, joint epidemic prevention and control mechanism to ensure the efficiency of the policymaking cooperation. Furthermore, aside from ensuring cooperation among the policy-issuing agencies, they each had their own primary focus of policies in the early stage, but their foci were gradually shared as the epidemic situation changed.

They are at more risk of contracting the infection. This study was planned to assess potential risk factors of 2019-novel coronavirus infection among HCWs working in a health facility and to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among them. METHODS: A study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital among HCWs who were directly or indirectly involved in the management of a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. The socio-demographic characteristics, history of exposure, IPC measures followed and clinical symptoms were compared between health care workers in COVID and non-COVID areas. RESULTS: Majority (45%) of HCWs were nurses, followed by hospital/sanitary/technical attendants (30%) and doctors (24%). Out of a total of 256 HCWs, 2% tested positive. Around 80% of HCWs had ever attended any IPC training. A statistically significant association was found between posting area of HCWs and their exposure to COVID patients (duration of exposure, PPE has worn by HCWs, direct contact of HCWs with the patient’s material) and COVID positivity (P value <.001).

Associated complications have added to the negative prognosis. Nevertheless, many have fully recovered, even among the most fragile. Factors associated with their survival was investigated. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged ≥90 years admitted for COVID-19 to the Internal Medicine wards of two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. RESULTS: Among 34 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 33 (97.1%) had respiratory failure. Eighteen patients (52.9%) survived and 16 (47.1%) died during hospital stay. Survivors compared to deceased had a significantly longer hospitalization (19 vs. 10 days respectively; p = 0.02), a better PaO2:FiO2 ratio (241 vs. 171 respectively; p = 0.003), higher lymphocyte counts (p = 0.01) and lower serum LDH levels (p < 0.001) at admission. At multivariate analysis only higher PaO2:FiO2 was associated with survival (OR 1.06 [95%CI 1.0–1.03]; p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference in event-free survival between patients treated or not with LMWH (p < 0.0001) and between those treated or not with beta-blockers (p = 0.008). Cox regression, performed in the subgroup of patients who received LMWH, did not show significant difference for sex (HR 2.7 [95% CI 0.53–14.3], p = 0.23), CCI (HR 0.7 [95% CI 0.37–1.45], p = 0.38), PaO2:FiO2 ratio (HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.97–1.0], p = 0.07), corticosteroid therapy (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.22–4.5], p = 0.99) and beta-blocker therapy (HR 2.8 [95% CI 0.56–14,7], p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher mortality in elderly, treatment with LMWH and betablockers might be associated with better survival. Dedicated studies are required to confirm our result.","Saifi, Erkin Saeed; Giorgi-Pierfranceschi, Matteo; Salvetti, Massimo; Maninetti, Letizia; Cavalli, Ilaria; Muiesan, Maria L.",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33508512/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2021.104349; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167494321000121; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167494321000121?v=s5,178

Because of increasing number of cases day by day, it takes time to interpret the laboratory findings thus the limitations in terms of both treatment and findings are emerged. Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we perform clinical predictive models that estimate, using deep learning and laboratory data, which patients are likely to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, precision, F1-score, recall, AUC, and accuracy scores calculated. Models were tested with 18 laboratory findings from 600 patients and validated with 10 fold cross-validation and train-test split approaches. The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 86.66%, F1-score of 91.89%, precision of 86.75%, recall of 99.42%, and AUC of 62.50%. It is observed that predictive models trained on laboratory findings could be used to predict COVID-19 infection, and can be helpful for medical experts to prioritize the resources correctly.

Understanding factors associated with adherence to mask-wearing and physical distancing may help guide future control efforts. We conducted an observational study using Systematic Observation of Mask Adherence and Distancing (SOMAD) in August 2020 in parks, playgrounds and commercial streets in each of 10 City Council Districts in Philadelphia, PA. Wearing a mask correctly varied by setting with highest adherence in commercial areas and lowest in playgrounds. Almost 17% wore visible masks that did not cover the nose and/or mouth. There were multiple disparities in correct mask use. Females had higher rates than males (unadjusted relative risk = 1.40, p < .0001) and seniors higher than any other age group (unadjusted chi-square p < .0001). Asians wore masks correctly the most often [adjusted log odds ratio (LOR) = 0.53 compared with non-Hispanic white, p = 0.02]. Correct mask-wearing was higher in areas with a higher population density (adjusted LOR = 0.03 per one thousand/square mile, p = 0.02) and lower in higher poverty areas (adjusted LOR = −0.01, p = .03). Disparities in adherence to mask wearing and physical distancing likely reflect differences in perception of risk by gender, age group, and race/ethnicity. While the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower in outdoor settings, it is unlikely to be zero. The lower rates of mask use by males and minority groups suggest increased efforts are needed to enhance adherence to recommended guidelines.","Cohen, Deborah A.; Talarowski, Meghan; Awomolo, Olaitan; Han, Bing; Williamson, Stephanie; McKenzie, Thomas L.",Prev Med Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101449; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221133552100139X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221133552100139X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155476/,178

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study participants were 20 women who were instructed to wear a mask for at least 6 hours a day for 4 weeks. Measurements of skin wrinkles and pores were obtained before and after the 4 weeks of mask wear. The effects of application of a moisturizer were assessed by applying moisturizer within the mask‐wearing area. They completed a questionnaire about skin changes at the end of the study period. RESULTS: After wearing the mask for 4 weeks, there was a significant increase in the skin wrinkles and pores; both variables decreased significantly in skin areas where a moisturizer had been applied. The results of the questionnaire‐based survey indicated the study participants considered that long‐term wearing of a mask had affected their skin.

To understand the key factors shaping HCWs' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination in the UK. Design: This study was designed as a rapid qualitative appraisal integrating data from a review of UK policies and guidance on COVID-19 vaccination with data from in-depth semi-structured telephone interviews with frontline HCWs in the UK. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Participants: Interviews were carried out with a purposive sample of HCWs from two large London-based hospital Trusts (n=24) and 24 government policies and guidelines on the vaccination programme were reviewed. Results: The level of uncertainty about the vaccines' long-term safety and efficacy against mutant strains made it difficult for HCWs to balance the benefits against the risks of vaccination. HCWs felt that government decisions on vaccine rollout had not been supported by evidence-based science and this impacted their level of trust and confidence in the programme. The spread of misinformation online also impacted HCWs' attitudes towards vaccination, particularly among junior level and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) HCWs. Most HCWs felt encouraged to promote vaccination to their patients and the majority said they would advocate vaccination or engage in conversations about vaccination with others when relevant. Conclusion: In order to improve HCWs' trust and confidence in the UK's COVID-19 vaccination programme, there needs to be clarity about what is known and not known about the vaccines and transparency around the evidence-base supporting government decisions on vaccine rollout. Effort is also needed to dispel the spread of vaccine-related misinformation online and to address specific concerns, particularly among BAME and junior level HCWs.","Manby, L.; Dowrick, A.; Karia, A.; Maio, L.; Buck, C.; Singleton, G.; Lewis-Jackson, S.; Uddin, I.; Vanderslott, S.; Martin, S.; Vindrola-Padros, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.21254459v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.30.21254459,178

Foodborne pathogens form biofilms as a survival strategy in various unfavorable environments, which also become a frequent source of recurrent contamination and outbreaks of foodborne illness. Instead of focusing on bacterial biofilm formation and their pathogenicity individually, this review discusses on a molecular level how these two physiological processes are connected in several common foodborne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli. In addition, biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is discussed because it aids the persistence of many foodborne pathogens forming polymicrobial biofilms on food contact surfaces, thus significantly elevating food safety and public health concerns.

680860,Reply to: Coronavirus disease 2019 and ethical considerations for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation,2020-07-22,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the parent and staff experience of a secure video messaging service as a component of neonatal care. DESIGN: Multicentre evaluation incorporating quantitative and qualitative items. SETTING: Level II and level III UK neonatal units. POPULATION: Families of neonatal inpatients and neonatal staff. INTERVENTION: Use of a secure, cloud-based asynchronous video messaging service to send short messages from neonatal staff to families. Evaluation undertaken July–November 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parental experience, including anxiety, involvement in care, relationships between parents and staff, and breastmilk expression. RESULTS: In pre-implementation surveys (n=41), families reported high levels of stress and anxiety and were receptive to use of the service. In post-implementation surveys (n=42), 88% perceived a benefit of the service on their neonatal experience. Families rated a positive impact of the service on anxiety, sleep, family involvement and relationships with staff. Qualitative responses indicated enhanced emotional closeness, increased involvement in care and a positive effect on breastmilk expression. Seventy-seven post-implementation staff surveys were also collected. Staff rated the service as easy to use, with minimal impact on workload. Seventy-one percent (n=55) felt the service had a positive impact on relationships with families. Staff identified the need to manage parental expectations in relation to the number of videos that could be sent. CONCLUSIONS: Asynchronous video messaging improves parental experience, emotional closeness to their baby and builds supportive relationships between families and staff. Asynchronous video supports models of family integrated care and can mitigate family separation, which could be particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kirolos, Sandy; Sutcliffe, Lynsey; Giatsi Clausen, Maria; Abernethy, Carolyn; Shanmugalingam, Shanthi; Bauwens, Nicole; Orme, Judith; Thomson, Kirsty; Grattan, Rosemary; Patel, Neil",Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-319353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928897/,178
681541,Feasibility of using a handheld ultrasound device to detect and characterize shunt and deep vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19: an observational study,2020-11-30,"In December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause first started to appear in Wuhan in China; subsequently, a new coronavirus was soon identified as the cause of the illness, now known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since then, infections have been confirmed worldwide in numerous countries, with the number of cases steadily rising. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, in particular, to deduce from it potential risks and complications for pregnant patients. For this purpose, the available literature on cases of infection in pregnancy during the SARS epidemic of 2002/2003, the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic ongoing since 2012, as well as recent publications on cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are reviewed and reported. Based on the literature available at the moment, it can be assumed that the clinical course of COVID-19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate. It may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in utero is unlikely. Breastfeeding is possible once infection has been excluded or the disease declared cured.","Stumpfe, Florian M.; Titzmann, Adriana; Schneider, Michael O.; Stelzl, Patrick; Kehl, Sven; Fasching, Peter A.; Beckmann, Matthias W.; Ensser, Armin",Geburtshilfe Frauenheilkd,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1134-5951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322107/,178

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase on original articles, research letters, and short reports which have data about the number of fractures, site of fracture, mechanism of injury, location where injury was sustained, percentage of operative intervention, mortality during the pandemic compared to a specified period of time before the pandemic. The search was finalized in October 14, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 11,936 participants from 16 studies were included in our study. The pooled analysis indicated a higher 30-days mortality associated with fractures during the pandemic (9% vs 4%, OR 1.86 [1.05, 3.27], p = 0.03; I(2): 36%, p = 0.15). The number of fractures presenting to hospitals has declined 43% (35–50%) compared to pre-pandemic. Hand fracture was fewer during the pandemic (18% vs 23%, OR 0.75 [0.58, 0.97], p = 0.03; I(2): 69%, p = 0.002). Work-related traumas, high-energy falls, and domestic accidents were more common during the pandemic, while sports-related traumas were found to be less. Injuries that occurred in the sports area were lower than before the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of fractures has decreased, but there is a higher mortality rate associated with fractures.","Lim, Michael Anthonius; Mulyadi Ridia, Ketut Gede; Pranata, Raymond",J Clin Orthop Trauma,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.12.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976566220305919?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0976566220305919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398227/,178
686430,Risk of adverse coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes for people living with HIV,2021-03-15,"For patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilation strategies that limit end-expiratory derecruitment and end-inspiratory overdistension are the only interventions to have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality. For this reason, the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was considered to be an ideal protective strategy, given its reliance on very low tidal volumes cycled at very high rates. However, results from clinical trials in adults with ARDS have demonstrated that HFOV does not improve clinical outcomes. Recent experimental and computational studies have shown that oscillation of a mechanically heterogeneous lung with multiple simultaneous frequencies can reduce parenchymal strain, improve gas exchange, and maintain lung recruitment at lower distending pressures compared to traditional “single-frequency” HFOV. This review will discuss the theoretical rationale for the use of multiple oscillatory frequencies in ARDS, as well as the mechanisms by which it may reduce the risk for ventilator-induced lung injury.","Kaczka, David W",Curr Opin Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898903/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468867321000493; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cophys.2021.03.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867321000493?v=s5,178
686590,The Role of Therapeutic Anticoagulation in COVID-19,2020-08-27,"In an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, Germany has gradually implemented mobility restrictions culminating in a partial lockdown and contact restrictions on 22 March. The easing of the restrictions began 1 month later, on 20 April. Analysis of the consequences of these measures for mobility and infection incidence is of public health interest. A dynamic cohort of about 2,000 individuals in Germany aged 16–89 years provided individual information on demographic variables, and their continuous geolocation via a smartphone app. Using interrupted time series analysis, we investigated mobility by age, sex, and previous mobility habits from 13 January until 17 May 2020, measured as median daily distance traveled before and after restrictions were introduced. Furthermore, we have investigated the association of mobility with the number of new cases and the reproduction number. Median daily distance traveled decreased substantially in total and homogeneously across all subgroups considered. The decrease was strongest in the last week of March followed by a slight increase. Relative reduction of mobility developed parallel with number of new cases and the daily estimated reproduction number in the weeks after contact restrictions were implemented. The increase in mobility from mid-April onwards, however, did not result in increased case numbers but in further decrease. Other behavioral changes, e.g., wearing masks, individual distancing, or general awareness of the COVID-19 hazards may have contributed to the observed further reduction in case numbers and constant reproduction numbers below one until mid-July.","Bönisch, Sebastian; Wegscheider, Karl; Krause, Linda; Sehner, Susanne; Wiegel, Sarah; Zapf, Antonia; Moser, Silke; Becher, Heiko",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134239/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.568287,178

Although it will differ from country to country, the return to sport for professional football players will follow a forced lockdown never experienced and longer than the normal annual season break. Moreover, in addition to an obvious decrease in performance, the lockdown will possibly lead to an increase of the injury risk. In fact, preseason is always a period with a specific football injury epidemiology, with an increase in the incidence and prevalence of overuse injuries. Therefore, it seems appropriate to recommend that specific training and injury prevention programmes be developed, with careful load monitoring. Training sessions should include specific aerobic, resistance, speed and flexibility training programmes. The aerobic, resistance and speed training should respect some specific phases based on the progressiveness of the training load and the consequent physiological adaptation response. These different phases, based on the current evidence found in the literature, are described in their practical details. Moreover, injury prevention exercises should be incorporated, especially focusing on overuse injuries such as tendon and muscle lesions. The aim of this paper is to provide practical recommendations for the preparation of training sessions for professional footballers returning to sport after the lockdown.","Bisciotti, Gian Nicola; Eirale, Cristiano; Corsini, Alessandro; Baudot, Christophe; Saillant, Gerard; Chalabi, Hakim",Biol Sport,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879554/; https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2020.96652,178

The present cross-national study investigated potential factors that can reduce the burden by COVID-19 in China and Germany. Cross-sectional and longitudinal (China: N = 474, baseline, BL: 2015, follow-up, FU: 2020; Germany: N = 359, BL: 2019, FU: 2020) data on physical activity (e.g., jogging) (BL/FU), positive mental health (PMH) (BL/FU), and burden by COVID-19 (FU) were collected via online surveys. In both countries, physical activity was positively associated with PMH, and both variables were negatively related to burden by COVID-19. Furthermore, PMH mediated the link between physical activity and burden. The mediation model was significant when physical activity and PMH were assessed at the BL, while burden was measured at the FU; and it was also significant when all variables were assessed at the FU. The present findings reveal that physical activity in combination with PMH can reduce the experience of burden by COVID-19. Conscious fostering of physical activity and PMH is supported as an effective strategy to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic outbreak on mental and physical health. Additional benefits such as increased adherence to governmental measures around COVID-19 are discussed.","Brailovskaia, J.; Zhang, X. C.; Cai, D.; Lu, S.; Gao, Z.

Genetic syndromes associated with immunity disorders are common and represent an interesting model for a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of autoimmunity predisposition. Among these conditions, Down syndrome (DS) certainly deserves special attention as it represents the most common genetic syndrome associated with immune dysregulation, involving both innate and adaptive immunity. Autoimmunity represents a well-known complication of DS: it is estimated that people affected by this disease present a risk four to six times higher than the normal population to develop autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Several factors have been considered as possible etiology, including genetic and epigenetic modifications and immune dysregulation. In times in which the life expectancy of people with DS has been extremely prolonged, thanks to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease and infectious complications, knowledge of the mechanisms and proper management of autoimmune diseases within this syndrome has become essential. In this short review, we aim to report the current literature regarding the genetic, immune, and environmental factors that have been proposed as the possible underlying mechanism of autoimmunity in individuals with DS, with the intent to provide insight for a comprehensive understanding of these diseases in genetic syndromes.","Ferrari, Marta; Stagi, Stefano",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668420/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12020268,178

Of the extracellular vesicles, exosomes are the most widely sorted and extensively explored for their contents and function. The size of the nanovesicular structures (exosomes) range from 30 to 140 nm and are present in various biological fluids such as saliva, plasma, urine etc. These cargo-laden extracellular vesicles arise from endosome-derived multivesicular bodies and are known to carry proteins and nucleic acids. Exosomes are involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes, including cellular senescence. Exosomes mediate signaling crosstalk and play a critical role in cell–cell communications. Exosomes have evolved as potential biomarkers for aging-related diseases. Aging, a physiological process, involves a progressive decline of function of organs with a loss of homeostasis and increasing probability of illness and death. The review focuses on the classic view of exosome biogenesis, biology, and age-associated changes. Owing to their ability to transport biological information among cells, the review also discusses the interplay of senescent cell-derived exosomes with the aging process, including the susceptibility of the aging population to COVID-19 infections.","Saheera, Sherin; Potnuri, Ajay Godwin; Krishnamurthy, Prasanna",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9091974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32859053/,178
