400,400,400,Structural Optimization and De Novo Design of Dengue Virus Entry Inhibitory Peptides,8.248566,8.462324,2010-06-22,"Viral fusogenic envelope proteins are important targets for the development of inhibitors of viral entry. We report an approach for the computational design of peptide inhibitors of the dengue 2 virus (DENV-2) envelope (E) protein using high-resolution structural data from a pre-entry dimeric form of the protein. By using predictive strategies together with computational optimization of binding “pseudoenergies”, we were able to design multiple peptide sequences that showed low micromolar viral entry inhibitory activity. The two most active peptides, DN57opt and 1OAN1, were designed to displace regions in the domain II hinge, and the first domain I/domain II beta sheet connection, respectively, and show fifty percent inhibitory concentrations of 8 and 7 µM respectively in a focus forming unit assay. The antiviral peptides were shown to interfere with virus:cell binding, interact directly with the E proteins and also cause changes to the viral surface using biolayer interferometry and cryo-electron microscopy, respectively. These peptides may be useful for characterization of intermediate states in the membrane fusion process, investigation of DENV receptor molecules, and as lead compounds for drug discovery.","Costin, Joshua M.; Jenwitheesuk, Ekachai; Lok, Shee-Mei; Hunsperger, Elizabeth; Conrads, Kelly A.; Fontaine, Krystal A.; Rees, Craig R.; Rossmann, Michael G.; Isern, Sharon; Samudrala, Ram; Michael, Scott F.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28
475,475,475,Responses of Human Endothelial Cells to Pathogenic and Non-Pathogenic Leptospira Species,8.18723,8.392574,2010-12-14,"Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic infection that primarily affects residents of tropical regions, but causes infections in animals and humans in temperate regions as well. The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira, which also includes non-pathogenic, saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, non-specific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans, however, did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that, through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells, the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function, promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition, supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis.","Martinez-Lopez, Denise G.; Fahey, Mark; Coburn, Jenifer",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,11
610,610,610,Inflammatory Cytokine Expression Is Associated with Chikungunya Virus Resolution and Symptom Severity,8.368616,8.368444,2011-08-16,"The Chikungunya virus infection zones have now quickly spread from Africa to parts of Asia, North America and Europe. Originally thought to trigger a disease of only mild symptoms, recently Chikungunya virus caused large-scale fatalities and widespread economic loss that was linked to recent virus genetic mutation and evolution. Due to the paucity of information on Chikungunya immunological progression, we investigated the serum levels of 13 cytokines/chemokines during the acute phase of Chikungunya disease and 6- and 12-month post-infection follow-up from patients of the Italian outbreak. We found that CXCL9/MIG, CCL2/MCP-1, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 were significantly raised in the acute phase compared to follow-up samples. Furthermore, IL-1β, TNF-α, Il-12, IL-10, IFN-γ and IL-5 had low initial acute phase levels that significantly increased at later time points. Analysis of symptom severity showed association with CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10 and IgG levels. These data give insight into Chikungunya disease establishment and subsequent convalescence, which is imperative to the treatment and containment of this quickly evolving and frequently re-emerging disease.","Kelvin, Alyson A.; Banner, David; Silvi, Giuliano; Moro, Maria Luisa; Spataro, Nadir; Gaibani, Paolo; Cavrini, Francesca; Pierro, Anna; Rossini, Giada; Cameron, Mark J.; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F.; Paquette, Stéphane G.; Xu, Luoling; Danesh, Ali; Farooqui, Amber; Borghetto, Ilaria; Kelvin, David J.; Sambri, Vittorio; Rubino, Salvatore",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28
778,778,778,Early Clinical Features of Dengue Virus Infection in Nicaraguan Children: A Longitudinal Analysis,8.344478,8.441347,2012-03-06,"BACKGROUND: Tens of millions of dengue cases and approximately 500,000 life-threatening complications occur annually. New tools are needed to distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses. In addition, the natural history of pediatric dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. METHODS: Data from the multi-year, ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study of approximately 3,800 children aged 2–14 years in Managua, Nicaragua, were used to examine the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms by day of illness and to generate models for the association of signs and symptoms during the early phase of illness and over the entire course of illness with testing dengue-positive. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measures, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: One-fourth of children who tested dengue-positive did not meet the WHO case definition for suspected dengue. The frequency of signs and symptoms varied by day of illness, dengue status, and disease severity. Multivariable GEE models showed increased odds of testing dengue-positive associated with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, petechiae, positive tourniquet test, vomiting, leukopenia, platelets ≤150,000 cells/mL, poor capillary refill, cold extremities and hypotension. Estimated ORs tended to be higher for signs and symptoms over the course of illness compared to the early phase of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs and symptoms together with longitudinal statistical analysis showed significant associations with testing dengue-positive and important differences during the early phase of illness compared to the entire course of illness. These findings stress the importance of considering day of illness when developing prediction algorithms for real-time clinical management.","Biswas, Hope H.; Ortega, Oscar; Gordon, Aubree; Standish, Katherine; Balmaseda, Angel; Kuan, Guillermina; Harris, Eva",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28
803,803,803,Detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans by the Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method,8.412267,8.562483,2012-04-03,"BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) has emerged as an important public health problem in several rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. Presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in the low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent. METHODOLOGY: We compared conventional and pocket warmer loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods (using a heat block and a pocket warmer respectively as heat source for amplification reaction) for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. The effect of purified and crude DNA preparations on the detection rate of the LAMP assays were also investigated and compared with that of IS2404 PCR, a reference assay for the detection of M. ulcerans. Thirty clinical specimens from suspected BU cases were examined by LAMP and IS2404 PCR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limit of both LAMP methods at 60°C was 300 copies of IS2404 and 30 copies of IS2404 for the conventional LAMP at 65°C. When purified DNA extracts were used, both the conventional LAMP and IS2404 PCR concordantly detected 21 positive cases, while the pocket warmer LAMP detected 19 cases. Nine of 30 samples were positive by both the LAMP assays as well as IS2404 PCR when crude extracts of clinical specimens were used. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The LAMP method can be used as a simple and rapid test for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. However, obtaining purified DNA, as well as generating isothermal conditions, remains a major challenge for the use of the LAMP method under field conditions. With further improvement in DNA extraction and amplification conditions, the pwLAMP could be used as a point of care diagnostic test for BU","Ablordey, Anthony; Amissah, Diana Ackon; Aboagye, Isaac Frimpong; Hatano, Ben; Yamazaki, Toshio; Sata, Tetsutaro; Ishikawa, Koichi; Katano, Harutaka",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,1
824,824,824,Development of a Humanized Antibody with High Therapeutic Potential against Dengue Virus Type 2,8.278151,8.428451,2012-05-01,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant public health threat in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. A therapeutic antibody against the viral envelope (E) protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated seventeen novel mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high reactivity against E protein of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). The mAbs were further dissected using recombinant E protein domain I-II (E-DI-II) and III (E-DIII) of DENV-2. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and mouse protection assay with lethal doses of DENV-2, we identified four serotype-specific mAbs that had high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection. Of the four, E-DIII targeting mAb DB32-6 was the strongest neutralizing mAb against diverse DENV-2 strains. Using phage display and virus-like particles (VLPs) we found that residue K310 in the E-DIII A-strand was key to mAb DB32-6 binding E-DIII. We successfully converted DB32-6 to a humanized version that retained potency for the neutralization of DENV-2 and did not enhance the viral infection. The DB32-6 showed therapeutic efficacy against mortality induced by different strains of DENV-2 in two mouse models even in post-exposure trials. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We used novel epitope mapping strategies, by combining phage display with VLPs, to identify the important A-strand epitopes with strong neutralizing activity. This study introduced potential therapeutic antibodies that might be capable of providing broad protection against diverse DENV-2 infections without enhancing activity in humans.","Li, Pi-Chun; Liao, Mei-Ying; Cheng, Ping-Chang; Liang, Jian-Jong; Liu, I-Ju; Chiu, Chien-Yu; Lin, Yi-Ling; Chang, Gwong-Jen J.; Wu, Han-Chung",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28
1253,1253,1253,A Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody Targeting the Acid-Sensitive Region in Chikungunya Virus E2 Protects from Disease,8.267471,8.30537,2013-09-12,"The mosquito-borne alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has recently reemerged, producing the largest epidemic ever recorded for this virus, with up to 6.5 million cases of acute and chronic rheumatic disease. There are currently no licensed vaccines for CHIKV and current anti-inflammatory drug treatment is often inadequate. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of two human monoclonal antibodies, C9 and E8, from CHIKV infected and recovered individuals. C9 was determined to be a potent virus neutralizing antibody and a biosensor antibody binding study demonstrated it recognized residues on intact CHIKV VLPs. Shotgun mutagenesis alanine scanning of 98 percent of the residues in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV envelope showed that the epitope bound by C9 included amino-acid 162 in the acid-sensitive region (ASR) of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. The ASR is critical for the rearrangement of CHIKV E2 during fusion and viral entry into host cells, and we predict that C9 prevents these events from occurring. When used prophylactically in a CHIKV mouse model, C9 completely protected against CHIKV viremia and arthritis. We also observed that when administered therapeutically at 8 or 18 hours post-CHIKV challenge, C9 gave 100% protection in a pathogenic mouse model. Given that targeting this novel neutralizing epitope in E2 can potently protect both in vitro and in vivo, it is likely to be an important region both for future antibody and vaccine-based interventions against CHIKV.","Selvarajah, Suganya; Sexton, Nicole R.; Kahle, Kristen M.; Fong, Rachel H.; Mattia, Kimberly-Anne; Gardner, Joy; Lu, Kai; Liss, Nathan M.; Salvador, Beatriz; Tucker, David F.; Barnes, Trevor; Mabila, Manu; Zhou, Xiangdong; Rossini, Giada; Rucker, Joseph B.; Sanders, David Avram; Suhrbier, Andreas; Sambri, Vittorio; Michault, Alain; Muench, Marcus O.; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Simmons, Graham",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28
1610,1610,1610,"The Evolutionary History and Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Fever, Thrombocytopenia and Leukocytopenia Syndrome Virus (FTLSV) in China",8.301443,8.270902,2014-10-16,"BACKGROUND: In 2007, a novel bunyavirus was found in Henan Province, China and named fever, thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia syndrome virus (FTLSV); since then, FTLSV has been found in ticks and animals in many Chinese provinces. Human-to-human transmission has been documented, indicating that FTLSV should be considered a potential public health threat. Determining the historical spread of FTLSV could help curtail its spread and prevent future movement of this virus. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To examine the pattern of FTLSV evolution and the origin of outbreak strains, as well to examine the rate of evolution, the genome of 12 FTLSV strains were sequenced and a phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of all available FTLSV sequences in China were performed. Analysis based on the FTLSV L segment suggests that the virus likely originated somewhere in Huaiyangshan circa 1790 (95% highest probability density interval: 1756–1817) and began spreading around 1806 (95% highest probability density interval: 1773–1834). Analysis also indicates that when FTLSV arrived in Jiangsu province from Huaiyangshan, Jiangsu Province became another source for the spread of the disease. Bayesian factor test analysis identified three major transmission routes: Huaiyangshan to Jiangsu, Jiangsu to Liaoning, and Jiangsu to Shandong. The speed of FTLSV movement has increased in recent decades, likely facilitated by modern human activity and ecosystem changes. In addition, evidence of RNA segment reassortment was found in FTLSV; purifying selection appears to have been the dominant force in the evolution of this virus. CONCLUSION: Results presented in the manuscript suggest that the Huaiyangshan area is likely be the origin of FTLSV in China and identified probable viral migration routes. These results provide new insights into the origin and spread of FTLSV in China, and provide a foundation for future virological surveillance and control.","Huang, Xueyong; Liu, Licheng; Du, Yanhua; Wu, Weili; Wang, Haifeng; Su, Jia; Tang, Xiaoyan; Liu, Qi; Yang, Yinhui; Jiang, Yongqiang; Chen, Weijun; Xu, Bianli",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28

Here we describe the characterization of human mAbs from the plasmablasts of an acutely infected patient. One of the 18 mAbs had the unusual feature of binding to and neutralizing ZIKV despite not appearing to have been diversified by affinity maturation. This mAb neutralized ZIKV (Neut(50) ~ 2 μg/ml) but did not react with any of the four dengue virus serotypes. Except for the expected junctional diversity created by the joining of the V-(D)-J genes, there was no deviation from immunoglobulin germline genes. This is a rare example of a human mAb with neutralizing activity in the absence of detectable somatic hypermutation. Importantly, binding of this mAb to ZIKV was specifically inhibited by human plasma from ZIKV-exposed individuals, suggesting that it may be of value in a diagnostic setting.","Magnani, Diogo M.; Silveira, Cassia G.

2756,2756,2756,Challenges in developing methods for quantifying the effects of weather and climate on water-associated diseases: A systematic review,8.2334585,8.359558,2017-06-12,"Infectious diseases attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene (e.g. Cholera, Leptospirosis, Giardiasis) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in low-income countries. Climate and weather factors are known to affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases and statistical and mathematical modelling are continuously developing to investigate the impact of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods. We conducted a systematic review of English-language papers published from 2000 to 2015. Search terms included concepts related to water-associated diseases, weather and climate, statistical, epidemiological and modelling methods. We found 102 full text papers that met our criteria and were included in the analysis. The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures. Furthermore, the methods often did not distinguish among the multiple sources of time-lags (e.g. patient physiology, reporting bias, healthcare access) between environmental drivers/exposures and disease detection. Key areas of future research include: disentangling the complex effects of weather/climate on each exposure-health outcome pathway (e.g. person-to-person vs environment-to-person), and linking weather data to individual cases longitudinally.","Lo Iacono, Giovanni; Armstrong, Ben; Fleming, Lora E.; Elson, Richard; Kovats, Sari; Vardoulakis, Sotiris; Nichols, Gordon L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,27
4204,4204,4204,IL-4/IL-13 polarization of macrophages enhances Ebola virus glycoprotein-dependent infection,8.615303,8.496798,2019-12-11,"BACKGROUND: Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreaks, while sporadic, cause tremendous morbidity and mortality. No therapeutics or vaccines are currently licensed; however, a vaccine has shown promise in clinical trials. A critical step towards development of effective therapeutics is a better understanding of factors that govern host susceptibility to this pathogen. As macrophages are an important cell population targeted during virus replication, we explore the effect of cytokine polarization on macrophage infection. METHODS/MAIN FINDINGS: We utilized a BSL2 EBOV model virus, infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding EBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/EBOV GP) in place of its native glycoprotein. Macrophages polarized towards a M2-like anti-inflammatory state by combined IL-4 and IL-13 treatment were more susceptible to rVSV/EBOV GP, but not to wild-type VSV (rVSV/G), suggesting that EBOV GP-dependent entry events were enhanced by these cytokines. Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors that bind and internalize filoviruses demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 stimulated expression of the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN in human macrophages and addition of the competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhanced infection. Two murine DC-SIGN-like family members, SIGNR3 and SIGNR5, were upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in murine macrophages, but only SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting that murine SIGNR3 plays a similar role to human DC-SIGN. In vivo IL-4/IL-13 administration significantly increased virus-mediated mortality in a mouse model and transfer of ex vivo IL-4/IL-13-treated murine peritoneal macrophages into the peritoneal cavity of mice enhanced pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: These studies highlight the ability of macrophage polarization to influence EBOV GP-dependent virus replication in vivo and ex vivo, with M2a polarization upregulating cell surface receptor expression and thereby enhancing virus replication. Our findings provide an increased understanding of the host factors in macrophages governing susceptibility to filoviruses and identify novel murine receptors mediating EBOV entry.","Rogers, Kai J.; Brunton, Bethany; Mallinger, Laura; Bohan, Dana; Sevcik, Kristina M.; Chen, Jing; Ruggio, Natalie; Maury, Wendy",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28

Fruit bats have long been purported as the potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses, however several studies provide evidence that Mops condylurus, an insectivorous microbat, is also an ebolavirus reservoir. NPC1 receptor expression in the context of ebolavirus replication in microbat cells remains unstudied. In order to study Ebola virus (EBOV) cellular entry and replication in M. condylurus, we derived primary and immortalized cell cultures from 12 different organs. The NPC1 receptor expression was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry comparing the expression levels of M. condylurus primary and immortalized cells, HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney cells and cells from a European microbat species. EBOV replication kinetics was studied for four representative cell cultures using qRT-PCR. The aim was to elucidate the suitability of primary and immortalized cells from different tissues for studying NPC1 receptor expression levels and their potential influence on EBOV replication. The NPC1 receptor expression level in M. condylurus primary cells differed depending on the organ they were derived from and was for most cell types significantly lower than in human cell lines. Immortalized cells showed for most cell types higher expression levels than their corresponding primary cells. Concluding from our infection experiments with EBOV we suggest a potential correlation between NPC1 receptor expression level and virus replication rate in vitro.","Bokelmann, Marcel; Edenborough, Kathryn; Hetzelt, Nicole; Kreher, Petra; Lander, Angelika; Nitsche, Andreas; Vogel, Uwe; Feldmann, Heinz; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Kurth, Andreas",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,173,28

We developed ""REDIAL-2020"", a suite of machine learning models for estimating small molecule activity from molecular structure, for a range of SARS-CoV-2 related assays. Each classifier is based on three distinct types of descriptors (fingerprint, physicochemical, and pharmacophore) for parallel model development. These models were trained using high throughput screening data from the NCATS COVID19 portal (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/index.html), with multiple categorical machine learning algorithms. The “best models” are combined in an ensemble consensus predictor that outperforms single models where external validation is available. This suite of machine learning models is available through the DrugCentral web portal (http://drugcentral.org/Redial). Acceptable input formats are: drug name, PubChem CID, or SMILES; the output is an estimate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. The web application reports estimated activity across three areas (viral entry, viral replication, and live virus infectivity) spanning six independent models, followed by a similarity search that displays the most similar molecules to the query among experimentally determined data. The ML models have 60% to 74% external predictivity, based on three separate datasets.

Objective: To develop a predictive model to classify heart failure (HF) patients according to their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), by using available data from Electronic Health Records (EHR). Subjects and methods: 2854 subjects over 25 years old with a diagnosis of HF and LVEF, measured by echocardiography, were selected to develop an algorithm to predict patients with reduced EF using supervised analysis. The performance of the developed algorithm was tested in heart failure patients from Primary Care. To select the most influentual variables, the LASSO algorithm setting was used, and to tackle the issue of one class exceeding the other one by a large amount, we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Finally, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost models were constructed. Results: The full XGBoost model obtained the maximum accuracy, a high negative predictive value, and the highest positive predictive value. Gender, age, unstable angina, atrial fibrillation and acute myocardial infarct are the variables that most influence EF value. Applied in the EHR dataset, with a total of 25,594 patients with an ICD-code of HF and no regular follow-up in cardiology clinics, 6170 (21.1%) were identified as pertaining to the reduced EF group. Conclusion: The obtained algorithm was able to identify a number of HF patients with reduced ejection fraction, who could benefit from a protocol with a strong possibility of success. Furthermore, the methodology can be used for studies using data extracted from the Electronic Health Records.","Lopez, Cristina; Holgado, Jose Luis; Cortes, Raquel; Sauri, Inma; Fernandez, Antonio; Calderon, Jose Miguel; Nuñez, Julio; Redon, Josep",Bioengineering (Basel),173,16

Significant variations in plasma mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported in sepsis according to the outcome. The impact of lung stretch during MV was addressed in a model of pneumonia. Healthy or S. pneumoniae infected rabbits were submitted to MV or kept spontaneously breathing (SB). Bacterial burden, cytokines release, mitochondrial DNA levels, integrity and transcription were assessed along with 48-hour mortality. Compared with infected SB rabbits, MV rabbits developed more severe pneumonia with greater concentrations of bacteria in the lungs, higher rates of systemic dissemination, higher levels of circulating inflammatory mediators and decreased survival. Pulmonary mtDNA levels were significantly lower in infected animals as compared to non-infected ones, whenever they were SB or MV. After a significant early drop, circulating mtDNA levels returned to baseline values in the infected SB rabbits, but remained low until death in the MV ones. Whole blood ex-vivo stimulation with Streptococcus pneumoniae resulted in a reduction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes mitochondrial density and plasma mtDNA concentrations. Thus, persistent mitochondrial depletion and dysfunction in the infected animals submitted to MV could account for their less efficient immune response against S. pneumoniae.","Blot, Mathieu; Pauchard, Laure-Anne; Dunn, Irène; Donze, Jennifer; Malnuit, Stéphanie; Rebaud, Chloé; Croisier, Delphine; Piroth, Lionel; Pugin, Jérôme; Charles, Pierre-Emmanuel",Scientific reports,173,29

METHODS AND RESULTS We enrolled 692 consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 in 13 Italian cardiology centres between 1st March and 9th April, 2020. Mean age was 67.4 ± 13.2 years, 69.5% patients were males, 90 (13.0%) had a history of HF, median hospitalization length was 14 days, interquartile range, 9-24. In-hospital death occurred in 37 of 90 patients (41.1%) with HF history versus 126 of those with no HF history (20.9%). The increased risk of death associated with HF history remained significant after adjustment for clinical variables related to COVID-19 and HF severity, including comorbidities, oxygen saturation, lymphocyte count and plasma troponin (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death, 2.25; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.26-4.02; p=0.006 at multivariable Cox regression model including 404 patients). Patients with a history of HF also had more in-hospital complications including acute HF (33.3% vs 5.1%, p<0.001), acute renal failure (28.1% vs 12.9%, p<0.001), multiorgan failure (15.9% vs 5.8%, p=0.004) and sepsis (18.4% vs 8.9%, p=0.006). Other independent predictors of outcome were age, sex, oxygen saturation and oxygen partial pressure at arterial gas analysis/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2). In hospital treatment with corticosteroids and heparin had beneficial effects (adjusted HR for death, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.74; p=0.001; N=404 for corticosteroids and adjusted HR, 0.41; 95%CI, 0.25-0.67; p< 0.001; N=364 for heparin). CONCLUSIONS Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a history of HF have an extremely poor outcome with higher mortality and in-hospital complications. HF history is an independent predictor of increased in-hospital mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

Oxidized phospholipids cause vascular and nonvascular cells to initiate an inflammatory reaction. Metabolites of arachidonic acid, such as 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, can mimic some of the inflammatory properties of oxidized phospholipids. In vitro and in vivo normal high-density lipoprotein (HDL), normal apolipoprotein A-I, and apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptides, each likely acting in a different manner, prevent the inflammatory reaction characteristic of atherosclerosis, and this is associated with decreased levels of oxidized lipids in tissues and cells. HDL from animal models of atherosclerosis or from humans with atherosclerosis or from humans or animals with other chronic inflammatory diseases does not prevent the inflammatory reaction characteristic of atherosclerosis and may even enhance the inflammatory reaction. In mice and perhaps humans, ≈30% of the steady-state plasma HDL-cholesterol pool is derived from the small intestine. The metabolism of phospholipids by gut bacteria has been recently implicated in atherosclerosis in both mice and humans. Studies with apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptides suggest that the small intestine is a major tissue regulating systemic inflammation in mouse models of atherosclerosis and may be important for determining the functionality of HDL.","Navab, Mohamad; Reddy, Srinivasa T; Van Lenten, Brian J; Buga, Georgette M; Hough, Greg; Wagner, Alan C; Fogelman, Alan M","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",173,5

This overview was conducted to summarize and critically evaluate the current systematic reviews (SRs) on HM for the treatment of AD. Methods Through comprehensive searches, all relevant SRs on HM for AD published until May 2020 were included. The quality of included SRs was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Moreover, original randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the SRs were resynthesized to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral HM for AD. The quality of evidence for the main findings was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results Nine SRs were included in this overview. HM showed significantly better efficacy in terms of total effective rate (TER), itching and sleep symptom scores, quality of life, and the dose of topical treatment used compared with placebo. HM as a monotherapy and/or an adjunctive therapy to conventional medication (CM) showed significantly better results on the efficacy, symptom relief, and some laboratory parameters related to the inflammatory response. The methodological quality was generally low. When 58 original RCTs were reanalyzed, HM showed significantly lower SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score and higher TER than the placebo or CM. In terms of the safety profile, HM was not significantly different from the placebo and was better than CM. The quality of evidence ranged from ""moderate"" to ""very low."" Conclusion The results suggested that HM as a monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy is promising for the treatment of AD. However, due to low methodological quality and low quality of evidence, further rigorous, well-designed, high-quality SRs, and RCTs are needed to make clinical recommendations on HM use.","Kwon, Chan-Young; Lee, Boram; Kim, Suran; Lee, Jaesuk; Park, Minjung; Kim, Namkwen",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,173,31

Despite profound health consequences, the impacts of diarrhea-causing microbes on the evolutionary history of host species are largely unknown. We investigated patterns of genetic variation in mammalian Guanylate Cyclase-C (GC-C), an intestinal receptor frequently targeted by bacterial enterotoxins, to determine how hosts might adapt in response to diarrheal infections. Under normal conditions, GC-C interacts with endogenous guanylin peptides to promote water secretion in the intestine, but signaling can be hijacked by bacterially-encoded heat-stable enterotoxins (STa) during infection, which leads to overstimulation of GC-C and diarrhea. Phylogenetic analysis in mammals revealed evidence of recurrent positive selection in the GC-C ligand-binding domain in primates and bats, consistent with selective pressures to evade interactions with STa. Using in vitro assays and transgenic intestinal organoids to model STa-mediated diarrhea, we show that GC-C diversification in these lineages results in substantial variation in toxin susceptibility. In bats, we observe a unique pattern of compensatory coevolution in the endogenous GC-C ligand uroguanylin, reflecting intense bouts of positive selection at the receptor-ligand interface. These findings demonstrate control of water physiology as a previously unrecognized interface for genetic conflict and reveal diarrheal pathogens as a source of selective pressure among diverse mammals.","Carey, Clayton M.; Apple, Sarah E.; Hilbert, Zoё A.; Kay, Michael S.; Elde, Nels C.",bioRxiv,173,1

It has been a great challenge for teachers and students alike, especially for children. The area of education has reimagined itself. Children began to actively learn through the screens of their computers, tablets, and some, even cellphones. This article brings an experience report about strategies involving the principals and themes of Role-Playing Games used for online classes of English aimed at Brazilian children around the ages of five to nine years old. Role-playing games (at times also spelled as roleplaying games;abbreviated to RPG or RPGs) are games in which the people participating in them (players) assume the roles of characters within a fictional setting. The idea of using RPG strategies to retain the attention of children while teaching from afar, via Zoom, Skype or any other platform that allows the direct interaction between educator and student comes from RPGs' incredible capacity of transporting the mind of children to a different space, a space of attention and entertainment. As perceived by Tolomei (2017) and also shown in this experience report, motivation and engagement are enhanced through game mechanics.

While the potential social value of HCSs in the context of a pandemic is clear, bioethicists are divided on the ethics, given that effective treatment for COVID-19 has eluded us to date. While compelling ethics arguments have been offered on both sides of the debate, scientific and regulatory complexities may not have been fully appreciated. Furthermore, accelerated development of efficacious vaccine candidates in traditional clinical trials has diluted some of the arguments in favour of HCSs. In low- and middle-income country settings, including South Africa, the need for robust patient care conditions for the conduct of HCSs, coupled with considerations such as perceptions of risk, consent processes, remuneration, vaccine hesitancy, fear of exploitation and access to vaccines, makes HCSs challenging to justify.","Moodley, K; Maasdorp, E; Rennie, S",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,173,26

Thus, targeting TMPRSS2 is a promising strategy for therapies against both prostate cancer and coronavirus infection. Although Nafamostat and Camostat have been identified as TMPRSS2 inhibitors, severe side effects such as cerebral hemorrhage, anaphylactoid reaction, and cardiac arrest shock greatly hamper their clinical use. Therefore, more potent and safer drugs against this serine protease should be further developed. In this study, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based platform for effectively screening of inhibitors against TMPRSS2 protease activity. The disruption of FRET between green and red fluorescent proteins conjugated with the substrate peptide, which corresponds to the cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, was measured to determine the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2. Through an initiate pilot screening with around 100 compounds, Flupirtine, a selective neuronal potassium channel opener, was identified as a potential TMPRSS2 inhibitor from an FDA-approved drug library by using this screening platform, and showed inhibitory effect on the TMPRSS-dependent infection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles. This study describes a platform proven effective for rapidly screening of TMPRSS2 inhibitors, and suggests that Flupirtine may be worthy of further consideration of repurposing to treat COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Yeh; Huang, Wei-Chien; Yang, Chia-Shin; Cheng, Fang-Ju; Chiu, Yi-Fang; Chen, Hsiao-Fan; Huynh, Thanh Kieu; Huang, Chih-Feng; Chen, Chia-Hung; Wang, Hsueh-Chun; Hung, Mien-Chie",American journal of cancer research,173,20

METHODS: Case numbers from calendar weeks 1 through 22 of the two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 were obtained from 29 university hospitals and 7 non-university hospitals in Germany. Information was also obtained on the patients' age, sex, and urgency, along with the type of case (outpatient/inpatient), admitting ward, and a small number of tracer diagnoses (I21, myocardial infarction; J44, COPD; and I61, I63, I64, G45, stroke /TIA), as well as on the number of COVID-19 cases and of tests performed for SARS-CoV-2, as a measure of the number of cases in which COVID-19 was suspected or at least included in the differential diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 1 022 007 emergency room consultations were analyzed, of which 546 940 took place in 2019 and 475 067 in 2020. The number of consultations with a positive test for the COVID-19 pathogen was 3122. The total number of emergency room consultations in the observation period was 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a maximum drop by 38% coinciding with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (calendar week 14; 572 cases). After the initiation of interpersonal contact restrictions in 2020, there was a marked drop in COVID-19 case numbers, by a mean of -240 cases per week per emergency room (95% confidence interval [-284; -128]). There was a rise in case numbers thereafter, by a mean of 17 patients per week [14; 19], and the number of cases of myocardial infarction returned fully to the level seen in 2019. CONCLUSION: In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in medical emergencies of all kinds presenting to the nation's emergency departments. A recovery effect began to be seen as early as calendar week 15, but the levels seen in 2019 were not yet reached overall by calendar week 22; only the prevalence of myocardial infarction had renormalized by then. The reasons for this require further investigation.","Slagman, Anna; Behringer, Wilhelm; Greiner, Felix; Klein, Matthias; Weismann, Dirk; Erdmann, Bernadett; Pigorsch, Mareen; Möckel, Martin",Dtsch Arztebl Int,173,1

The diagnosis of infectious disease at the genomic level using nucleic acid disease biomarkers has proven to be the most effective approach to date. Such methods rely heavily on enzymes to specifically amplify or detect nucleic acids in complex samples, and significant effort has been exerted to harness the power of enzymes for in vitro nucleic acid diagnostics. Unfortunately, significant challenges limit the potential of enzyme-assisted nucleic acid diagnostics, particularly when translating diagnostic technologies from the lab toward the point-of-use or point-of-care.

Referring to the COVID-19 pandemic as a sustainability crisis that has sensitized consumers and other stakeholders to corporate responsibility for social and sustainability issues, a conceptual framework for stakeholder integration is developed from which implications for designing the potential, process and result quality are derived. Design/methodology/approach: In this conceptual paper, design options for stakeholder integration are derived from open innovation and service management research. Specific crisis-related determinants of stakeholder integration are derived from current corporate social responsibility (CSR) and crisis research taking into account the opportunities and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design options and crisis-related determinants are then combined to a conceptual framework for stakeholder integration in sustainability project partnerships in times of crisis. Based on this framework, research propositions are derived that provide insights into the design of the potential, process and result quality of stakeholder integration. Findings: This paper shows that the COVID-19 pandemic can be viewed as a sustainability crisis, which places special entrepreneurial demands on stakeholder integration in sustainability project partnerships. The pandemic offers potential for integrating a large number of stakeholders and has emphasized the need for integrating a broad range of stakeholders. Higher skepticism of stakeholders toward companies' CSR engagement in the pandemic has raised stakeholder demands for early integration. Higher skepticism and CSR involvement have rendered active forms of integration even more relevant, which, however, should still be adapted to the respective stakeholder prerequisites. The pandemic has increased the need for constant and comprehensive exchange of data on project results between stakeholders and the project leading organization. Measurement of target achievement can be promoted by establishing stakeholder commitment with regard to the target measures on the collective and relationship levels of the partnership. Finally, the pandemic has reinforced the need for more dialogical forms of communicating sustainability project results. Originality/value: Solving problems and exploiting opportunities in times of crisis require a high degree of entrepreneurship and creative leadership in order to gain new ideas and overcome resource deficits. Sustainability project partnerships in which various stakeholders contribute resources and knowledge to collaborate on idea development and finding solutions to sustainability issues are suitable for this. However, previous approaches to stakeholder integration in open innovation and service management research largely neglect the crisis context and only a few are related to sustainability. In CSR and crisis research, stakeholder-related approaches to coping with crises tend to be underrepresented, and the comprehensive concept of stakeholder integration has so far hardly been considered as an approach to crisis management. By taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic as a sustainability crisis, this paper provides new impulses for the integration of stakeholders in sustainability project partnerships in times of crisis. Recommendations for the design of the potential, process and result quality are derived, which provide insights for project leaders and stakeholders alike. In addition, implications for public policymakers are derived, who are assigned an increasingly active role in the pandemic and who can contribute to the success of sustainability project partnerships by setting suitable framework conditions. The developed concept can be expanded to include further company-related determinants and offers a starting point for empirical analysis in the still underexplored research fields of sustainability-oriented relationship marketing and sustainability crises. © 2021, E er ld Publishing Limited.","Grunwald, G.; Schwill, J.; Sassenberg, A.

We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. The National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices of Argentina has recently authorized the use of this method.","Genoud, V.; Stortz, M.; Waisman, A.; Berardino, B.

However, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of the pandemic on functional prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients hospitalised due to acute ischaemic stroke in Aragon (Spain). METHODS: We reviewed the data of all patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke to any hospital in our regional healthcare system between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020. We compared modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in patients hospitalised before and after the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 318 patients with acute ischaemic stroke met our inclusion criteria. No differences were observed between periods in global or specific characteristics, with the exception of a higher proportion of patients older than 80 years during the first period (42.2% vs 29.0%, P = .028). In the comparative analysis, we found no significant differences in mortality (12.3 vs 7.9, P = .465) or in the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale scores &#8804;â¯2 (57.7% vs 57.1%, P = .425) at 3 months. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients with ischaemic stroke. In our region, there has been no increase in rates of mortality or disability at 3 months in patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke during the pandemic.","Tejada Meza, H; Lambea Gil, Á; Villar Yus, C; Pérez Lázaro, C; Navarro Pérez, M P; Campello Morer, I; Giménez Muñoz, Á; Artal Roy, J; Alberti González, O; Hernando Quintana, N; Ruiz Palomino, P; Crespo Burillo, J A; García Arguedas, C; Ballester Marco, L; Palacin Larroy, M; Seral Moral, M; Marta Moreno, J",,173,16

METHODS: Through an online survey, participants were asked about presence or absence of mental health disorders. In addition, they answered the Brunel Mood Scale and the Impact of Event Scale. The mean percentile of mood swing indicators and psychological impact scores were estimated, and data were analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS: 13,248 people participated (70.5% women, mean age 35.4 years, 31.2% with history of mental health disorder). Women and younger people were more likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorder. All participants had significant changes in mood due to the pandemic. Anger, depressed mood, mental confusion, and fatigue were higher among individuals with bipolar disorder or with combined disorders. Individuals with mental health disorders had a greater subjective distress, especially the group with bipolar disorder (OR = 4.89 [3.64-6.56]) and combined disorders (OR = 6.89 [5.21-9.10]). CONCLUSION: Individuals previously diagnosed with mental health disorders at some point in life are more vulnerable to psychological impact from the pandemic.","Campos, Juliana Alvares Duarte Bonini; Campos, Lucas Arrais; Martins, Bianca Gonzalez; Valadão Dias, Filomena; Ruano, Rodrigo; Maroco, João",Psychol Rep,173,13

METHODS: We conducted a 10-year retrospective analysis of VNS implantations at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Relevant data were collected within 12â¯months of VNS implantation and at six months, one, two, and four years after VNS implantation. RESULTS: This analysis included 99 patients ages 0-3 (nâ¯=â¯40) and 4-6 (nâ¯=â¯59) at first VNS implantation. Eighty-six patients followed up for &#8805;4â¯years. There were no significant differences between age at VNS implant (0-3 vs. 4-6) and seizure etiology or most seizure semiologies. Patients took an average of 3.01â¯±â¯1.29 AEDs prior to VNS and 3.84â¯±â¯1.68 AEDs at their latest follow-up. The overall response to VNS therapy (&#8805;50% seizure reduction) at one year, two years, and four years after VNS implantation was 55%, 60%, and 52%, respectively. At two years, 59% of 0- to 3-year-old patients responded to VNS and 52% of 4- to 6-year-old patients responded to VNS. The overall major complication rate was 5.6%, consistent with VNS use for older age groups. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of VNS for children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) younger than six. One, two, and four years after VNS implantation, 55%, 60%, and 52% of these patients, respectively, achieved &#8805;50% reduction in seizure frequency. The safety of VNS is also comparable with older, better studied, age groups. Based on these data, VNS therapy should be considered for children younger than six.","Muthiah, Nallammai; Zhang, Jun; Remick, Madison; Welch, William; Sogawa, Yoshimi; Jeong, Jong-Hyeon; Abel, Taylor J",Epilepsy Behav,173,16

COVID-19 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome in a subset of patients and is a primary driver of acute morbidity in infected persons. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives dysfunction and pathology outside the lungs, including reports of renal, cardiac, and neurological complications. In this study, we summarize the known incidence and evidence of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and other pathogenic coronaviruses. These studies describe a poorly understood spectrum of COVID-19 central nervous system symptoms, ranging from common and subclinical issues such as anosmia and headache to more concerning reports of stroke and encephalopathy. We discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis, including a discussion of how the understanding of neurological complications known to occur in HIV-1 patients may provide insight into SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. Specifically, three hypotheses are discussed that are informed by decades of knowledge about HIV pathogenesis in the brain, which include a potential direct viral effect, an indirect viral effect, and/or a neuroimmune axis effect. Individually or in combination these potential effects may contribute to COVID-19 neurological complications.","Al-Harthi, Lena; Campbell, Edward; Schneider, Julie A; Bennett, David A",AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,173,10

In the era of information explosion, it is challenging for users to find interesting and valuable information in massive videos rapidly. As valuable tools to solve information overload, recommendation algorithms can provide users with exciting information from a large amount of data. However, the traditional recommendation algorithms either recommend items according to the user's attribute information (e.g., content-based recommendation algorithm) or according to the user's history score (e.g., collaborative filtering algorithm). Without considering the COVID-19 epidemic situation, how to recommend effective prevention and control of epidemic knowledge. Users who hardly pay attention to the new coronavirus information need to recommend the necessary prevention and control knowledge and the latest epidemic development. For users who often view the relevant videos, it is also needed to control the recommendation list's contents to ensure diversity. Methods: To solve the above problem, we propose a novel adaptive recommendation algorithm that can consider user preferences and the epidemic situation's development and recommend valuable videos to users. Results: We have tested on four different datasets, and we choose two classic recommendation algorithms, namely user-based collaborative filtering algorithm and item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, to compare with our adaptive recommendation algorithm. The results show that, compared with the traditional algorithm, our algorithm can not only recommend videos that meet the user's taste but also consider the transmission of widespread science knowledge in the case of an epidemic situation. The recommended video information can be dynamically adjusted according to the user characteristics to ensure the recommendation list's diversity. Conclusion: We have conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Compared with state-of- the- art recommendation algorithms, the recommendation results can match user preferences and give reasonable consideration to the epidemic's information, demonstrating our algorithm's effectiveness.","Wang, D.",Basic and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology,173,16

One clear difference between these pandemics has been the ability to test for the presence of the virus or for evidence of infection. This review examined the performance characteristics of sample types via PCR detection of the virus, of antibody testing, of rapid viral antigen detection kits and computerised tomography (CT) scanning. It was found that combined detection approaches, such as the incorporation of CT scans, may reduce the levels of false negatives obtained by PCR detection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, while sputum and oral throat washing sample types should take precedence over swabbing when available. Rt-PCR assays for detection of the virus remain the gold-standard method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and can be used effectively on pooled samples for widespread screening. The novel Oxford antibody assay was found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity of four currently available commercial antibody kits but should only be used during a specific timeframe post-symptom onset. Further research into transmission modes between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is needed. Analysis of the performance characteristics of different sampling and detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 showed that timing of sampling and testing methods used can greatly influence the rate of false-positive and false-negative test results, thereby influencing viral spread.","Keaney, Daniel Whelan Shane Finn Karen Lucey Brigid",Medical Sciences,173,16

However, only about 75% of people in Canada plan to receive one of the vaccines. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the reasons why people in Canada feel hesitant toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We screened 3915 tweets from public Twitter profiles in Canada by using the search words ""vaccine"" and ""COVID."" The tweets that met the inclusion criteria (ie, those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy) were coded via content analysis. Codes were then organized into themes and interpreted by using the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Overall, 605 tweets were identified as those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy stemmed from the following themes: concerns over safety, suspicion about political or economic forces driving the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccine development, a lack of knowledge about the vaccine, antivaccine or confusing messages from authority figures, and a lack of legal liability from vaccine companies. This study also examined mistrust toward the medical industry not due to hesitancy, but due to the legacy of communities marginalized by health care institutions. These themes were categorized into the following five Theoretical Domains Framework constructs: knowledge, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, social influence, and emotion. CONCLUSIONS: With the World Health Organization stating that one of the worst threats to global health is vaccine hesitancy, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind this reluctance. By using a behavioral science framework, this study adds to the emerging knowledge about vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing public discourse in tweets in real time. Health care leaders and clinicians may use this knowledge to develop public health interventions that are responsive to the concerns of people who are hesitant to receive vaccines.","Griffith, Janessa; Marani, Husayn; Monkman, Helen",J Med Internet Res,173,21

In soccer, practitioners are concerned about the effects of long-term detraining on players' conditioning, and caution is required when activities return. This study assessed body composition, jump and sprint performance, hamstring eccentric strength, and intermittent cardiorespiratory fitness of 23 male professional soccer players who returned to training activities after 63 days of quarantine. The results were compared with their physical condition assessed before a pre-season phase as soon as they returned to training after a regular 24-day off-season period. In comparison with after off-season assessments, the quarantine induced significant increases in body mass, body fat mass, 10- and 20-m sprint times as well as decreases in countermovement jump height (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in hamstring eccentric strength, squat jump height, and cardiorespiratory fitness (p > 0.05).

Design: Brief report. Setting: ICUs at a single-center teaching hospital. Patients: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients under contact and special droplet precautions. Interventions: Relocation of IV pumps for coronavirus disease 2019 patients from bedside to outside the patient room using extension tubing. Measurements and Main Results: Infusion pumps secured to a rolling IV pole are moved immediately outside the patient room with extension tubing, reaching the patient through a closed door. It is anticipated that this practice may reduce unnecessary coronavirus disease 2019 exposure for healthcare professionals, reduce the consumption of personal protective equipment, and promote patient safety by limiting delays of donning personal protective equipment to initiate or adjust medications. Conclusions: Risks of situating IV pumps outside the patient room must be carefully weighed against the benefits. Relocation of IV pumps outside the patient room may be considered given shortages of personal protective equipment and high risk of healthcare professional exposure. Institutional review-approved studies investigating the measured impact on decreased exposure, personal protective equipment usage, and patient safety are required.","Shah, Ami G; Taduran, Chris; Friedman, Seana; Sarosky, Kimberly; Jones, Mila; Victory-Stewart, Marcelina; Dunau, Frederick; Liesenfeld, Meghan; Pasqualini, Darla; Mandel, Sarah; Fiol, Natalie; Ghia, Samit; Puskas, John D; Bhatt, Himani V; Shapiro, Janet; Tomey, Matthew I; Yimen, Mekeleya",Crit Care Explor,173,21

Whereas the model has been developed in the context of COVID-19, it is general enough to be applicable with such changes as necessary to other diseases as well. Our fundamental modeling philosophy consists of a decoupling of public health intervention effects, immune response effects and intrinsic infection properties into separate terms. All parameters in the model are directly related to the disease and its management;we can measure or calculate their values a priori basis our knowledge of the phenomena involved, instead of having to extrapolate them from solution curves. Our model can accurately predict the effects of applying or withdrawing interventions, individually or in combination, and can quickly accommodate any newly released information regarding, for example, the infection properties and the immune response to an emerging infectious disease. After demonstrating that the baseline model can successfully explain the COVID-19 case trajectories observed all over the world, we systematically show how the model can be expanded to account for heterogeneous transmissibility, detailed contact tracing drives, mass testing endeavours and immune responses featuring different combinations of temporary sterilizing immunity, severity-reducing immunity and antibody dependent enhancement.

As the death toll rises, scientists begin to fall toward new avenues of research, with novelty showing itself to be an incredible and so far, underrated resource. In this case, the use of biosurfactants in dealing with this pandemic justifies extensive study with their potential applications being in the prevention of viral spread; dealing with the symptoms that develop after the incubation period; directly targeting viral infected cells and preventing the spread of the virus throughout the host, all in addition to also acting as potential drug delivery systems and cleaning agents. This extensive avenue of biosurfactants owes to the simplicity in their amphiphilic structure which permits them to interact directly with the lipid membrane of the coronavirus, in a way which wouldn't be of significant threat to the host. Although it could possibly interact and affect the virus, it could also affect human internal organs/cells by interacting with lipid membrane, if (biosurfactant is) ingested, and it still needs further studies in human models. The structure of the coronavirus, in this case SARS-CoV-2, is detrimentally dependent on the integrity of its lipid membrane which encloses its vital proteins and RNA. Biosurfactants possess the innate ability to threaten this membrane, a result of their own hydrophobic domains across their amphiphilic structure. With biosurfactants additionally being both natural and sustainable, while also possessing a remarkably low cytotoxicity, it is of no doubt that they are going to be of increasing significance in dealing with the current pandemic.","Smith, Matthew L.; Gandolfi, Stefano; Coshall, Philippa M.; Rahman, Pattanathu K.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in service delivery, working practices and decision-making role of diagnostic radiographers during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey of diagnostic radiographers working in CT during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was open for 6-weeks, with radiographers from all geographical regions encouraged to respond. The questionnaire explored social distancing, patient scheduling and departmental organisation; PPE usage; recognition and escalation of COVID-19 changes, patient management pathways and any training. Additionally, we sought the personal perspectives of radiographers through free text comments. RESULTS: Following exclusions, 180 responses were analysed. Service delivery changes included social distancing (59.4%; n= 107), restriction of referrals to those considered time-critical (63.3%; n=114) and dedicated COVID-19 scanners (66.1%; n=119). Working practices were impacted by a need to implement PPE, although variation in PPE worn for different scenarios was seen. Half of the radiographers were routinely reviewing asymptomatic outpatient images for common COVID-19 signs, despite 63.5% of respondents not receiving formal training. Ad hoc patient pathways were in place in 90.5% of cases with 35% indicating that this was radiographer-led. CT staff had experienced anxiety, fatigue, and low morale, but praised teamwork. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographers were able to reduce the risk of transmission through social distancing, designated scanners, and PPE. This study has demonstrated that despite variance in practice, radiographers play a key role in identifying and triaging high-risk patients.","Harris, Martine A; Adamson, Helen K; Foster, Beverley",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),173,24

Outpatient fever clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003, were upgraded to serve for COVID-19 screening and prevention of disease transmission in large tertiary hospitals in China. FCs were hoped to relieve some of the healthcare burden from emergency departments (EDs). We aimed to evaluate the effect of upgrading the FC system on rates of nosocomial COVID-19 infection and ED patient attendance at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6365 patients were screened in the FC. METHODS: The FC of PUMCH was upgraded on 20 January 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between 12 December 2019 and 29 February 2020. The date when COVID-19 was declared an outbreak in Beijing was 20 January 2020. Two groups of data were collected and subsequently compared with each other: the first group of data was collected within 40 days before 20 January 2020; the second group of data was collected within 40 days after 20 January 2020. All necessary data, including patient baseline information, diagnosis, follow-up conditions and the transfer records between the FC and ED, were collected and analysed. RESULTS: 6365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2912 patients were screened before 21 January 2020, while 3453 were screened afterward. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of patients who were transferred from the FC to the ED decreased significantly (39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001), and patients generally spent more time in the FC (55 vs 203 min, p<0.001), compared with before the outbreak. For critically ill patients waiting for their screening results, the total length of stay in the FC was 22 min before the outbreak, compared with 442 min after the outbreak (p<0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critically ill patients in the FC was 9 out of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 out of 38 after the outbreak (p<0.05). Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the FC during the period of this study. However, no other patients nor any healthcare providers were cross-infected. CONCLUSION: The workload of the FC increased significantly after the COVID-19 outbreak. New protocols regarding the use of FC likely helped prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital. The upgraded FC also reduced the burden on the ED.","Wang, Jiangshan; Zong, Liang; Zhang, Jinghong; Sun, Han; Harold Walline, Joseph; Sun, Pengxia; Xu, Shengyong; Li, Yan; Wang, Chunting; Liu, Jihai; Li, Fan; Xu, Jun; Li, Yi; Yu, Xuezhong; Zhu, Huadong",BMJ Open,173,20

This article presents ""spheres of influence"" as a concept that can help physicians think strategically about how to build upon their clinical work and expertise to promote equity in medicine. The physician's primary sphere of influence is in direct patient care. However, physicians today often have many other roles, especially within larger health care institutions in which physicians often occupy positions of authority. Physicians are therefore well-positioned to act within these spheres in ways that draw upon the ethical principles that guide patient care and contribute materially to the cause of equity for colleagues and patients alike. By making changes to the ways they already work within their clinical spaces, institutional leadership roles, and wider communities, physicians can counteract the structural problems that undermine the health of the patients they serve.","Karches, Kyle; DeCamp, Matthew; George, Maura; Prochaska, Micah; Saunders, Milda; Thorsteinsdottir, Bjorg; Dzeng, Elizabeth",J. gen. intern. med,173,7

Walk-DMC has been shown to be related to patient outcomes and there has been an increasing interest from motion analysis centers regarding using this metric in their own practice. However, the methods for computing the index reported in the literature are not consistent. Here we propose a standardized method and investigate if this leads to results that are consistent between laboratories. METHOD: Comparisons between three sets of typically developing controls contributed by three independent motion analysis centers are made. Comparisons are also made between the proposed and previously published methods. A program script to compute the walk-DMC was used for this study and is made freely available with this manuscript. RESULTS: Using this script, results are highly consistent between three participating centers. The currently proposed method results in a wider distribution of walk-DMC values than those previously reported. INTERPRETATION: Using consistent processing methods, synergy measures are equivalent between centers. The major differences between current and published data are attributed to the use of concatenation of several walking trials.","MacWilliams, Bruce A; McMulkin, Mark L; Rozumalski, Adam; Schwartz, Michael H",Gait Posture,173,15

The mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied to assess the effectiveness of umifenovir for COVID-19. A total of 12 studies with 1052 patients were included in our final studies.

Very few studies have fully investigated the CSF correlates of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis. METHODS: Patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and encephalitis (COV-Enc), encephalitis without SARS-CoV-2 infection (ENC) and healthy controls (HC) underwent an extended panel of CSF neuronal (NfL, T-tau), glial (GFAP, TREM2, YKL-40) and inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1ß, IL-6, Il-8, TNF- &#945;, CXCL-13 and ß2-microglobulin). RESULTS: Thirteen COV-Enc, 21 ENC and 18 HC entered the study. In COV-Enc cases, CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR but exhibited increased IL-8 levels independently from presence of pleocytosis/hyperproteinorracchia. COV-Enc patients showed increased IL-6, TNF- &#945;, and ß2-microglobulin and glial markers (GFAP, sTREM-2, YKL-40) levels similar to ENC but normal CXCL13 levels. Neuronal markers NfL and T-Tau were abnormal only in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2-related encephalitis were associated with prominent glial activation and neuroinflammatory markers, whereas neuronal markers were increased in severe cases only. The pattern of CSF alterations suggested a cytokine-release syndrome as the main inflammatory mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 related encephalitis.","Pilotto, Andrea; Masciocchi, Stefano; Volonghi, Irene; De Giuli, Valeria; Caprioli, Francesca; Mariotto, Sara; Ferrari, Sergio; Bozzetti, Silvia; Imarisio, Alberto; Risi, Barbara; Premi, Enrico; Benussi, Alberto; Focà, Emanuele; Castelli, Francesco; Zanusso, Gianluigi; Monaco, Salvatore; Stefanelli, Paola; Gasparotti, Roberto; Zekeridou, Anastasia; McKeon, Andrew; Ashton, Nicholas J; Blennov, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Padovani, Alessandro",Clin. infect. dis,173,1

We characterized the pandemic's influence on healthcare delivery, behavioral health, and financial stress in cancer patients. Methods: We included data from N = 1,253 adult cancer patients, who visitedHCI in the last 4 years, consented to the Total Cancer Care study, and completed a COVID-19 survey as part of the COPES consortium. The survey was administered between Aug and Sept 2020 and included questions on change/cancellation of medical visits, change in exercise and alcohol consumption, daily life, social interactions, and financial stress sinceMarch 2020. Results:The cohort'smean agewas 60.4 (19-92) years, with 54% female, 68% non-Hispanic White, 41% retired, 43% employed full or part-time, and 24% living in rural counties.Among the 27% of patients who reported receiving current treatment at HCI, 30% had to change or cancel a medical visit due to the pandemic, with 2% reported a change/cancellation in a biopsy, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy;5% reported a change/cancellation in imaging;and 3% and 23%reported a change/cancellation in cancer screening and doctor's visit, respectively. 18% rescheduled an appointment to a telehealth visit. Changes in exercise habits due to the pandemic were common (47%), with 10% no longer exercising regularly, 21% exercising less, and 11% exercising more than before. 5% reported increased alcohol consumption, while 6% reported a decrease. Most patients (84%) experienced a change in their daily lives (ranging from somewhat to a lot of change). 69% had fewer social interactions, and 49% reported financial stress due to the pandemic, with 11% reporting being quite a bit/very much financially stressed. Conclusions: These findings suggest that within approximately the first 6 months, the COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on cancer patients' lives, with adverse effects on health behaviors and financial stress.

Systems rapidly adapted to meet public health requirements aimed at preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including quarantine procedures, travel restrictions, border closures, physical distancing and ""stay-at-home"" orders. Although these changes have impacted all stakeholders in maternity services, arguably the women at the center of this care have been most affected. This study aimed to explore women's experiences of receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A national cross-sectional online survey, including fixed choice and open-ended questions, was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia; pregnant and postnatal women were recruited through social media networks. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 3364 women. Women felt distressed and alone due to rapid changes to their maternity care. Limited face-to-face contact with health practitioners and altered models of care often required women to accommodate significant changes and to coordinate their own care. Women felt that they were often ""doing it alone,"" due to public health restrictions on support people and visitors, both within and outside health services. Women described some benefits of visitor restrictions, such as, more time for rest, breastfeeding establishment, and bonding with their baby. CONCLUSIONS: This large nationwide Australian study provides unique data on women's experiences of receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lessons learned provide an opportunity to rebuild and reshape the maternity sector to best meet the needs of women and their families during current and future public health crises.","Wilson, Alyce N; Sweet, Linda; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Hauck, Yvonne; Wynter, Karen; Kuliukas, Lesley; Szabo, Rebecca A; Homer, Caroline S E; Bradfield, Zoe",Birth,173,1

ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7. Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACEâAngiotensin IIâAT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the 'adverse' ACEâAngiotensin IIâAT1 receptor axis and the 'protective' ACE2âAngiotensin1-7âMas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Verdecchia, Paolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Spanevello, Antonio; Angeli, Fabio",Eur J Intern Med,173,20

Gut hypoxia or ischemia is one possible contributing factor to gastrointestinal tract barrier dysfunction that may be associated with the development of systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, the principal cause of death after sepsis. Monitoring gut perfusion during experimental and clinical sepsis may provide valuable insights over new interventions and therapies highly needed to reduce multiple organ dysfunction and sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. We present our experience with gas tonometry as a monitor of the adequacy of gastrointestinal mucosal perfusion in experimental models sepsis and with the use of vasoactive agents for hemodynamic management in patients with septic shock.","Silva, Eliezer; Francisco Poli de Figueiredo, Luiz; Jorge Cruz Jr, Ruy; Rocha e Silva, Maurício",Acta cir. bras.,173,30

Exclusion criteria were <16 years old, pregnancy, acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute respiratory failure from an alternative diagnosis to SARS-CoV-2. Early intubation strategy was previously fiercely advocated due to concerns of exceedingly high NIV failure rate in MERS, infection transmission risks and poorer outcomes with delayed intubation.4-6 In a non-SARS-CoV-2 population, the LUNGSAFE study showed higher ICU mortality with NIV use in patients with PaO2/FiO2 <150 mmHg compared with early intubation.6 Data in SARS-CoV-2 are not available.","Raharja, Antony Kwan Jonathan T.

Previous work has explored the benefits of effective veterinary teamwork for multiple stakeholders. In this teaching tip article, we outline the underlying educational theories and tips for developing inter-professional teaching to foster students' appreciation of the different roles and responsibilities of veterinarians and veterinary nurses/vet techs. Inter-professional education (IPE) requires students to learn with, about, and from each other and implies recognition of social learning as an underpinning approach. It involves developing learning opportunities to address students' potential misunderstandings of each other's motivations, to allow them to explore issues present in the other profession's practice, and to clarify sometimes overlapping roles and responsibilities. Students are given opportunities to explore the complexity of inter-professional teamwork in a safe environment using real-life topics as context for their collaboration. Two veterinary examples of IPE at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) are provided to explore different teaching methods and topics that have proved successful in our context: dentistry and directed learning scenarios. We describe how RVC has developed an IPE team consisting of faculty members who champion IPE, which has, in turn, inspired students to create a student-led IPE club, hosting extracurricular educational events. This is an example of an effective student-teacher partnership. A number of challenges exist in embedding IPE, but the benefits it offers in integrating clinical and professional elements of the curricula make it worthy of consideration.","Lumbis, Rachel; Langridge, Alison; Serlin, Ruth; Kinnison, Tierney",J Vet Med Educ,173,33

Different drug interventions acting at multiple stages of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 can substantially reduce infection-induced mortality. The current within-host mathematical modeling studies deals with the optimal combined drug intervention strategy and its efficacy in reducing the burden of COVID-19. The drug interventions considered here include Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the first BCG vaccine dose, and a booster dose of BCG administered at a later stage. In this work, we consider two scenarios involving the administration of these interventions. The findings of these studies include the following: the average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when both the HCQ and BCG interventions were applied together in both scenarios. On the other hand, the average susceptible cell count decreased the best when HCQ alone was administered in both these scenarios. From the comparative effectiveness study it was observed that the basic reproduction number and viral count decreased the best when HCQ and BCG booster interventions were applied together, reinstating the fact obtained earlier in the optimal control setting. These findings may help physicians with decision making in the treatment of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.

However, it is unknown whether sarcopenia, a common geriatric syndrome, is associated with poor prognosis among older COVID-19 patients. The aim of our prospective cohort study is to investigate the association between sarcopenia risk and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged &#8805;60 years. METHOD: A prospective cohort study of 114 hospitalized older patients (&#8805;60 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia between 7 February, 2020 and 6 April, 2020. Epidemiological, socio-demographic, clinical and laboratory data on admission and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records. All patients were assessed for sarcopenia on admission using the SARC-F scale and the outcome was the development of the severe disease within 60 days. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to identify the association between sarcopenia and progression of disease defined as severe cases in a total of 2908 person-days. RESULT: Of 114 patients (mean age 69.52 ± 7.25 years, 50% woman), 38 (33%) had a high risk of sarcopenia while 76 (67%) did not. We found that 43 (38%) patients progressed to severe cases. COVID-19 patients with higher risk sarcopenia were more likely to develop severe disease than those without (68% versus 22%, p < 0.001). After adjustment for demographic and clinical factors, higher risk sarcopenia was associated with a higher hazard of severe condition [hazard ratio = 2.87 (95% CI, 1.33-6.16)]. CONCLUSION: We found that COVID-19 patients with higher sarcopenia risk were more likely to develop severe condition. A clinician-friendly assessment of sarcopenia could help in early warning of older patients at high-risk with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ma, Yao; He, Min; Hou, Li-Sha; Xu, Shen; Huang, Zhi-Xin; Zhao, Na; Kang, Yan; Yue, Ji-Rong; Wu, Chenkai",BMC Geriatr,173,26

However, the countermeasures must be applied against the infection in this period until the targeted drugs became available. In this regard, the non-specific, broad-spectrum anti-viral means could be considered as a compromise allowing overcoming the period of trial. One way to enhance the ability to resist the infection is to activate the nonspecific immunity using a suitable driving-up agent, such as plant polysaccharides, particularly our drug Panavir isolated from the potato shoots. Earlier, we have shown the noticeable anti-viral and anti-bacterial activity of Panavir. Here we demonstrate the pro-inflammation activity of Panavir, which four-to-eight times intensified the ATP and MIF secretion by HL-60 cells. This effect was mediated by the active phagocytosis of the Panavir particles by the cells. We hypothesized the physiological basis of the Panavir proinflammatory activity is mediated by the indol-containing compounds (auxins) present in Panavir and acting as a plant analog of serotonin.","Stovbun, Sergey V; Kalinina, Tatiana S; Zlenko, Dmitry V; Kiselev, Aleksei V; Litvin, Alexander A; Bukhvostov, Alexander A; Usachev, Sergey V; Kuznetsov, Dmitry A",Int J Biol Macromol,173,21

Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a crew of 4779 personnel. METHODS: We obtained clinical and demographic data for all crew members, including results of testing by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). All crew members were followed up for a minimum of 10 weeks, regardless of test results or the absence of symptoms. RESULTS: The crew was predominantly young (mean age, 27 years) and was in general good health, meeting U.S. Navy standards for sea duty. Over the course of the outbreak, 1271 crew members (26.6% of the crew) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by rRT-PCR testing, and more than 1000 infections were identified within 5 weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed infection. An additional 60 crew members had suspected Covid-19 (i.e., illness that met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists clinical criteria for Covid-19 without a positive test result). Among the crew members with laboratory-confirmed infection, 76.9% (978 of 1271) had no symptoms at the time that they tested positive and 55.0% had symptoms develop at any time during the clinical course. Among the 1331 crew members with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, 23 (1.7%) were hospitalized, 4 (0.3%) received intensive care, and 1 died. Crew members who worked in confined spaces appeared more likely to become infected. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly among the crew of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Transmission was facilitated by close-quarters conditions and by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected crew members. Nearly half of those who tested positive for the virus never had symptoms.","Kasper, Matthew R; Geibe, Jesse R; Sears, Christine L; Riegodedios, Asha J; Luse, Tina; Von Thun, Annette M; McGinnis, Michael B; Olson, Niels; Houskamp, Daniel; Fenequito, Robert; Burgess, Timothy H; Armstrong, Adam W; DeLong, Gerald; Hawkins, Robert J; Gillingham, Bruce L",N Engl J Med,173,1

Here we present the lessons learned and recommendations that have emerged from these webinars. METHODS: Fifteen international health care experts from different global regions and oncology disciplines participated in one of the six 1-hour webinars to discuss the latest data, share their experiences, and provide recommendations to manage cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions include didactic presentations followed by a moderated discussion and questions from the audience. All recommendations have been transcribed, categorized, and reviewed by the experts, who have also approved the consensus recommendations. RESULTS: The summary recommendations are divided into different categories, including risk minimization; care prioritization of patients; health care team management; virtual care; management of patients with cancer undergoing surgical, radiation, and systemic therapy; clinical research; and recovery plans. The recommendations emphasize the protection of patients and health care teams from infections, delivery of timely and appropriate care, reduction of harm from the interruption of care, and preparation to handle a surge of new COVID-19 cases, complications, or comorbidities thereof. CONCLUSION: The recommendations from the ASCO Global Webinar Series may guide practicing oncologists to manage their patients during the ongoing pandemic and help organizations recover from the crisis. Implementation of these recommendations may improve understanding of how COVID-19 has affected cancer care and increase readiness to manage the current and any future outbreaks effectively.","Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Chan, Stephen L; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Dickson, Natalie; Eaton, Vanessa; Garcia-Foncillas, Jesus; Gilmore, Terry; Horn, Leora; Kerr, David J; Lee, Jeeyun; Mathias, Clarissa; Nogueira-Rodrigues, Angélica; Pierce, Lori; Rogado, Alvaro; Schilsky, Richard L; Soria, Jean-Charles; Warner, Jeremy L; Yoshida, Kazuhiro",JCO Glob Oncol,173,24

One major challenge in achieving these goals is the paucity of suitable preclinical animal models. Mice constitute ~70% of all the laboratory animal species used in biomedical research. Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 infects mice only if they have been genetically modified to express human ACE2. The inherent resistance of wild-type mice to SARS-CoV-2, combined with a wealth of genetic tools that are available only for modifying mice, offers a unique opportunity to create a versatile set of genetically engineered mouse models useful for COVID-19 research. We propose three broad categories of these models and more than two dozen designs that may be useful for SARS-CoV-2 research and for fighting COVID-19.","Gurumurthy, Channabasavaiah B; Quadros, Rolen M; Richardson, Guy P; Poluektova, Larisa Y; Mansour, Suzanne L; Ohtsuka, Masato",Nat Protoc,173,24

Occupational hazards exist in every. Workplace, only the type of the hazard or the intensity of the hazard might differ. Recent trends reveal that there has been a huge jump in the number of occupational injuries despite various legal reforms being introduced. Understanding the impact of these hazards on the workers is the need of the hour. This chapter aims to identify these risk factors about which every worker needs to be aware to take immediate actions to avoid any workplace fatalities. These risks have been categorized into various categories like biological, chemical, physiological hazards, etc. The second aim of the chapter is to discuss the basic hierarchical strategic model to overcome these hazards in the workplace or at least reduce them in few cases. However, it has been observed that these strategies or legal reforms are not enough to eliminate workplace hazards. Hence, the idea of equipping workers with wearable technology for real-time monitoring of the workers and eliminating the potential hazards from workplaces is crucial. Several existing devices which have been proven to be effective for ensuring workplace safety have been discussed in this chapter.","Rajendran, Sindhu Giridhar Swathi Chaudhari Surabhi Gupta Praveen Kumar",Measurement: Sensors,173,20

There are only few works targeted pathological x-ray images. Most of the works targeted only single disease detection which is not good enough. Some works have provided for all classes however the results suffer due to lack of data for rare classes and data unbalancing problem. METHODS: Due to arise of COVID-19 virus medical facilities of many countries are overwhelmed and there is a need of intelligent system to detect it. There have been few works regarding detection of the coronavirus but there are many cases where it can be misclassified as some techniques do not provide any goodness if it can only identify type of diseases and ignore the rest. This work is a deep learning-based model to distinguish between cases of COVID-19 from other chest diseases which is need of today. RESULTS: A Deep Neural Network model provides a significant contribution in terms of detecting COVID-19 and provide effective analysis of chest related diseases with respect to age and gender. Our model achieves 87% accuracy in terms of Gan based synthetic data and four different types of deep learning- based models which provided state of the art comparable results.

METHODS: cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Criança Com Câncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiaí, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc. Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (χ(2) or Fisher's exact test). RESULTS: 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12 ± 5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Co-detection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43.

This systematic review aimed to assess the extent of adoption, efficacy, and safety of NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of the literature. Electronic databases and Google Scholar were queried for studies that applied NOM of acute appendicitis during COVID-19. The main outcome measures were the rates of NOM application during the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period, failure and complication rates of NOM. Failure was defined as the need for appendectomy during NOM and complications included development of appendicular mass or abscess. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (2140 patients) were included. The male to female ratio was 1.44:1 and median age was 34. Nine hundred fifty-nine (44.8%) patients had a trial of NOM. The weighted mean rate of NOM application was 50.1% (95%CI: 29.8–70.5%). The application of NOM during the pandemic was significantly more likely than its application before COVID-19 (OR = 6.7, p < 0.001). The weight mean failure rate of NOM was 16.4% (95%CI: 9.4–23.4). NOM failure was more likely in children and patients with complicated appendicitis. The weighted mean complication rate after NOM was 4.5% (95%CI: 1.4–7.7). NOM had significantly lower odds for complications than appendectomy (OR = 0.36, p = 0.03). There was no mortality after application of NOM. CONCLUSION: NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19 may be a safe, short-term alternative to surgery with acceptably low failure and complication rates.

This has created a heated debate in particular regarding how effective the different measures applied by the governments are in limiting the spread of the disease and ultimately deaths. It would be of considerable interest to pinpoint the factors that determine a country’s susceptibility to a pandemic such as COVID-19. Here we present data demonstrating that mortality due to COVID-19 in a given country could have been predicted to some extent even before the pandemic hit Europe, simply by looking at longitudinal variability of death rates in the years preceding the current outbreak. The variability in death rates during the winter influenza seasons of 2015–2019 correlates to excess mortality in 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak (Spearman’s ρ = 0.68, 95 % CI = 0.40–0.84, p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no correlation with age, population density, latitude, GNP, governmental health spending, number of intensive care beds, degree of urbanization, or rates of influenza vaccination.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can uncover rare subpopulations, explore genetic and functional heterogeneity, and reveal the uniqueness of each cell. It provides us a new approach to reveal biological issues from a more detailed and microscopic perspective. Here, we utilize this revolutionary technology to identify the changes of gene expression patterns between ectopic lesions and the eutopic endometrium at the single-cell level and explore a potential novel pathogenesis of AM. METHODS: A control endometrium (sample with leiomyoma excluding endometrial disorders, n = 1), eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesion (from a patient with adenomyosis, n = 1) samples were analysed by scRNA-seq, and additional leiomyoma (n = 3) and adenomyosis (n = 3) samples were used to confirm colocalization and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation. Protein colocalization was visualized by immunofluorescence, and CD34-periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) double staining was used to assess the formation of VM. RESULTS: The scRNA-seq results suggest that cancer-, cell motility- and inflammation- (CMI) associated terms, cell proliferation and angiogenesis play important roles in the progression of AM. Moreover, the colocalization of EPCAM and PECAM1 increased significantly in the ectopic endometrium group (P < 0.05), cell subpopulation with high copy number variation (CNV) levels possessing tumour-like features existed in the ectopic lesion sample, and VNN1- and EPCAM-positive cell subcluster displayed active cell motility in endometrial epithelial cells. Furthermore, during the transformation of epithelial cells to endothelial cells, we observed the significant accumulation of VM formation (positively stained with PAS but not CD34, P < 0.05) in ectopic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, our results support the theory of adenomyosis derived from the invasion and migration of the endometrium. Moreover, cell subcluster with high CNV level and tumour-associated characteristics is identified. Furthermore, epithelial-endothelial transition (EET) and the formation of VM in tumours, the latter of which facilitates the blood supply and plays an important role in maintaining cell growth, were also confirmed to occur in AM. These results indicated that the inhibition of EET and VM formation may be a potential strategy for AM management.

This study assessed the infective viral etiologies by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations. In addition, infective etiologies were assessed for association with the clinical outcome of the patients. METHODS: Adults admitted with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations between August 2016 and July 2017 were recruited. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were obtained from the patients within 1–2 days of admission and subjected to pathogen detection and human rhinovirus (HRV) typing. RESULTS: Altogether 402 patients with AECOPD, 80 stable COPD, 100 asthma exacerbation and 21 stable asthma subjects were recruited. Among those admitted for AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, 141(35.1%) and 45(45.0%) respectively had pathogens identified in the NPA specimens. The commonest virus identified was influenza A followed by HRV. HRV typing identified HRV-A and HRV-C as the more common HRV with a wide variety of genotypes. Identification of pathogens in NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect clinical outcomes including the hospital length of stay, readmission rates and mortality except that identification of pathogens in asthma exacerbation was associated with a lower rate of readmissions at 30 and 60 days. CONCLUSIONS: Many respiratory viruses were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation. HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV associated with exacerbations. Identification of pathogens in NPA was associated with less readmissions for asthma patients at 30 and 60 days. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02866357.

HGP must not be restricted to the human genome and should include model organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm. The completed or ongoing genome projects will provide enormous opportunities for the discovery of novel vaccines and drug targets against human pathogens as well as the improvement of diagnosis and discovery of infectious agents and the development of new strategies for invertebrate vector control. The polysaccharide capsule is important for meningococci to escape from complement-mediated killing. With the completion of the genome sequence of a virulent MenB strain, a “reverse vaccinology” approach was applied for the development of a universal MenB vaccine by Novartis. The indispensable fatty acid synthase (FAS) pathway in bacteria has been regarded as a promising target for the development of antimicrobial agents. Through a systematic screening of 250,000 natural product extracts, a Merck team identified a potent and broad-spectrum antibiotic, platensimycin, which is derived from Streptomyces platensis. Vector Biology Network was formed to achieve three goals (1) to develop basic tools for the stable transformation of anopheline mosquitoes by the year 2000; (2) to engineer a mosquito incapable of carrying the malaria parasite by 2005; and (3) to run controlled experiments to test how to drive the engineered genotype into wild mosquito populations by 2010. The most immediate impact of a completely sequenced pathogen genome is for infectious disease diagnosis.","Liu, Yu-Tsueng",Genetics and Evolution of Infectious Disease,173,1

One hundred ten (27%) of the sera were positive for IgG and/or IgM. The earliest age at which fetuses tested positive for IgM and IgG was estimated to be 100 and 120 days, respectively. Ig concentration increased with increased age of the fetus. Sera that were positive for Ig were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to five different infectious agents. Bovine parvovirus antibodies were found in 99 of 110 sera (90%) by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. However, only 35 (31.8%) of these sera were positive by serum neutralization (SN) test. Antibodies to parainfluenza-3 virus were detected in 30 sera (27%) by HI test and in 20 sera (18%) by SN test. Five (4%) sera contained SN antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea virus. Only one (0.9%) serum sample contained SN antibodies to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus. None of the sera had antibodies against five Leptospira spp. Results of this study suggest that bovine parvovirus may be a potential cause of reproductive problems in cattle.","Virakul, P.; Vahdat, F.; Joo, H.

Interestingly, the spread of the disease in Africa seems to have been delayed and initially slower than in many parts of the world. Here we report on two cases of respiratory distress in our region before the official declaration of the disease in December 2019, cases which in the present times would be suspect of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: These two cases (one 55-year-old man and one 25-year-old woman) of acute respiratory distress secondary to atypical pneumonia were seen in Bukavu, in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), between September and December 2019. One patient had returned from China and the other had close contacts with travellers from China in the 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. In either case, the aetiology could not be accurately determined. However, the two cases presented a clinical picture (progressive dyspnoea, preceded by dry cough and fever) and laboratory changes (procalcitonin within the normal range, slight inflammation, and lymphopenia) compatible with a viral infection. The chest X-ray series of the first patient showed lesions (reticulations, ground glass, and nodules ≤6 mm) similar to those currently found in COVID-19 patients. In addition, unlike the 25-year-old female patient who had no comorbidity, the 55-year-old male patient who had hypertension as comorbidity, developed a more severe acute respiratory distress which progressed to death. CONCLUSION: These cases bring to the attention the fact that COVID-19-like syndromes may have already been present in the region months before the official beginning of the pandemic. This also brings to question whether a prior presence of the disease or infections with related virus may account for the delayed and less extensive development of the pandemic in the region.","Mateso, Guy-Quesney; Baguma, Marius; Mwene-Batu, Pacifique; Balemba, Ghislain Maheshe; Nzabara, Fabrice; Makali, Samuel; Bedha, Aline; Furaha, Bonheur; Minani, Jimmy; Muhindo, Christian Tshongo; Malembaka, Espoir Bwenge; Masimango, Mannix Imani; Shindano, Tony Akilimali; Cikomola, Justin Cirhuza; Mubagwa, Kanigula",Trop Dis Travel Med Vaccines,173,1

Health and public health are essentials for development. The weak global economy has hindered progress toward the sustainable development goals. Many people are still living in poverty with poor health status and inadequate healthcare. Poor health and pharmaceutical sectors in a country will increase the vulnerability of the country and leaves the society at risk. Effective public health interventions can save hundreds of millions of lives. Pharmacy system is one of the core components in a healthcare system, and pharmacists play a very important role. This book sheds light on various topics that individually and in combination determine the status of pharmacy practice in individual countries. This book incorporates multiple data sources and when outliers are discovered, that may be called to the attention of the reader.

In this study, a novel NLLC-forming lipid, mono-O-(5, 9, 13-trimethyl-4-tetradecenyl) glycerol ester (C17MGE), and a model drug with a middle molecule weight, leuprolide acetate (LA), were used to confirm the usefulness of C17MGE as an excipient for depot formulations with sustained release properties. METHODS: A self-constructed depot formulation was prepared by mixing C17MGE and different types of phospholipids. The constructed NLLC structure was evaluated using small angle X-ray analysis and cryo-transmission electron microscopy. In vitro release and blood concentration profiles of LA were investigated. RESULTS: The NLLC structure was confirmed by small angle X-ray analysis. LA release was able to be modified by adding different ratios of various phospholipids to C17MGE. Formulations containing 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol sodium salt with a mixing ratio of 12% or 24% (M(DOPG12) or M(DOPG24), respectively) exhibited sustained release profiles of LA. In addition, the blood concentration of LA was detected over 21 days or more after administration of M(DOPG12), and the absolute bioavailability was calculated to be about 100%. CONCLUSIONS: A depot formulation using C17MGE was useful to achieve sustained release of LA.","Okada, Akie; Todo, Hiroaki; Itakura, Shoko; Hijikuro, Ichiro; Sugibayashi, Kenji",Pharm Res,173,16

METHODS: This is a retrospective, non-randomized study that included patients diagnosed with bronchospasm, who received a helium-oxygen mixture at three time points (30, 60, and 120 minutes) according to the organization protocol singular, and were admitted to the intensive care unit, from January 2012 to December 2013. This protocol includes patients with bronchospasm who sustained a modified Wood score of moderate to severe, even after one hour of conventional treatment. RESULTS: Twenty children were included in the study. The mean score of severity of the disease at the initial moment was 5.6 (SD:2.0), and at moment 120 minutes, it was 3.4 (SD: 2.0). The severity score showed a significant improvement as of 30 minutes (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of helium-oxygen mixture proved to be effective in diminishing the respiratory distress score for children with airway obstructions; it should be considered a supplementary therapeutic option, together with drug therapy, in specific clinical situations.","Nascimento, Milena Siciliano; Santos, Érica; do Prado, Cristiane",Einstein (Sao Paulo),173,16

We review outcomes in patients with NDD and COVID-19 and discuss the hypothesis that due to putative commonalities of neuropathogenesis, COVID-19 may unmask or trigger NDD in vulnerable individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on a systematic review of published literature, patients with NDD, including dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) make up a significant portion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Such patients are likely to present with altered mental status or worsening of their preexisting neurological symptoms. Patients with NDD and poor outcomes often have high-risk comorbid conditions, including advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart/lung disease. Patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death, whereas those with preexisting Parkinson's disease are not. MS patients have good outcomes and disease modifying therapies do not increase the risk for severe disease. Viral infections and attendant neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and MS, suggesting that COVID-19 may have the potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration. SUMMARY: Since patients with Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death in the setting of COVID-19, additional precautions and protective measures should be put in place to prevent infections and optimize management of comorbidities in this vulnerable population. Further studies are needed to determine whether COVID-19 may lead to an increased risk of developing NDD in susceptible individuals.","McAlpine, Lindsay S.; Fesharaki-Zadeh, Arman; Spudich, Serena",Curr Opin Psychiatry,173,16

An entire batch of sows was followed during two successive reproduction cycles. Nasal, tonsillar and oro-pharyngeal swabs and blood samples were taken from each sow 9 and 4 weeks before farrowing and 1 and 4 weeks after farrowing. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis were detected from swab samples using PCR assays. Blood samples were tested for antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae, A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-9-11 and 2, Porcine Circovirus type-2 (PCV-2) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) by ELISA tests. Antibodies against H(1)N(1), H(1)N(2) and H(3)N(2) Swine Influenza Viruses (SIV) of European lineages were tested by hemagglutination inhibition assay. The results indicated that S. suis is widespread among sows (67.1% of PCR-positive sows). A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida, and H. parasuis were detected by PCR in 30.9%, 24.6% and 23.4% of the sows, respectively. Antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae were recovered from more than 55% of the sows in all herds whereas the micro-organism was detected in 2.4% of the sows. Although PCV-2 and SIV infections were highly prevalent, the PRRSV infection patterns ranged from no infection in farms mildly affected by respiratory diseases to active circulation in more severely affected herds. The sow population thus constitutes a reservoir for a continuous circulation of respiratory pathogens and needs to be properly considered in control strategies.","Fablet, C.; Marois, C.; Kuntz-Simon, G.; Rose, N.; Dorenlor, V.; Eono, F.; Eveno, E.; Jolly, J.P.; Le Devendec, L.; Tocqueville, V.; Quéguiner, S.; Gorin, S.; Kobisch, M.; Madec, F.",Vet Microbiol,173,2

When combined with antibody libraries, phage display allows for rapid in vitro selection of antigen-specific antibodies and recovery of their corresponding coding sequence. Large non-immune and synthetic human libraries have been constructed as well as smaller immune libraries based on capturing a single individual’s immune repertoire. This completely in vitro process allows for isolation of antibodies against poorly immunogenic targets as well as those that cannot be obtained by animal immunization, thus further expanding the utility of the approach. Phage antibody display represents the first developed methodology for high throughput screening for human therapeutic antibody candidates. Recently, other methods have been developed for generation of fully human therapeutic antibodies, such as single B-cell screening, next-generation genome sequencing and transgenic mice with human germline B-cell genes. While each of these have their particular advantages, phage display has remained a key methodology for human antibody discovery due its in vitro process. Here, we review the continuing role of this technique alongside other developing technologies for therapeutic antibody discovery.","Chan, Conrad E. Z.; Lim, Angeline P.

Obesity, a state of chronic inflammation, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for severe SARS‐CoV‐2. Metformin is one of the most commonly used antidiabetic medications that displayed immunomodulatory activity through AMP-activated protein kinase. Metformin has sex-specific immunomodulatory and cytokine-reducing activities. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize the protective roles of Metformin and its possible molecular mechanisms for use in COVID-19 patients. To include studies, publications related to Metformin and its possible molecular mechanisms for COVID-19 were searched from the databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Elsevier, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS, via English key terms. Maintaining proper blood glucose levels using oral antidiabetic drugs like Metformin reduced the detrimental effects of COVID-19 by different possible mechanisms such as Metformin-mediated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities; effect on viral entry and ACE2 stability; inhibition of virus infection; alters virus survival and endosomal pH; mTOR inhibition; and influence on gut microbiota. Fascinatingly, in diabetic patients with COVID-19, treatment with Metformin was associated with a noticeable reduction in mortality rates and disease severity among infected patients. Metformin was comprehensively investigated for its anti-inflammatory, antiviral capabilities, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant, which would elucidate its capability to confer vascular and cardiopulmonary protection in COVID-19.","Kifle, Zemene Demelash; Woldeyohanis, Alem Endeshaw; Demeke, Chilot Abiyu",Metabol Open,173,21

Furthermore, they are a key factor in outbreak control where active case finding in combination with isolation and contact tracing are crucial. AIM: With the objective to inform the public health and laboratory responses to the pandemic, we reviewed current published knowledge on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection as assessed by RNA molecular detection in a wide range of clinical samples. METHODS: We performed an extensive search on studies published between 1 December 2019 and 15 May 2020, reporting on molecular detection and/or isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in any human laboratory specimen. RESULTS: We compiled a dataset of 264 studies including 32,515 COVID-19 cases, and additionally aggregated data points (n = 2,777) from sampling of 217 adults with known infection timeline. We summarised data on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, blood, oral fluid, tears, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, semen, vaginal fluid; where provided, we also summarised specific observations on SARS-CoV-2 detection in pregnancy, infancy, children, adolescents and immunocompromised individuals. CONCLUSION: Optimal SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing relies on choosing the most appropriate sample type, collected with adequate sampling technique, and with the infection timeline in mind. We outlined knowledge gaps and directions for future well-documented systematic studies.","Stanoeva, Kamelia R.; van der Eijk, Annemiek A.; Meijer, Adam; Kortbeek, Laetitia M.; Koopmans, Marion P.G.; Reusken, Chantal B.E.M.",Euro Surveill,173,26

A service evaluation was performed to capture hospice professionals' (HPs) and patients' experiences of VC. METHODS Online or postal surveys were sent to HPs and patients, who had participated in VC between March and July 2020, focusing on their experience and satisfaction with the service. RESULTS 31 responses from HPs were received. 19 (61.3%) rated their experience of VC as good, despite 29 (93.5%) having no prior VC experience. One-third of HPs had undertaken potentially sensitive consultations, including resuscitation discussions. 23 (74.2%) undertook a VC that included a family member and 18 (58.1%) had included an external healthcare professional. 25 (80.6%) wanted to offer VC as an option going forward. Well-being staff successfully provided multiple group support sessions via video. 26 responses from patients (23) and carers (3) were received. 22 (84.6%) had access to a smartphone. 8 (30.8%) included a family member in their consultation. All patients/carers reported satisfaction with their VC, although 10 (38.5%) expressed a preference for face-to-face consultations. 22 (84.6%) patients would be happy to receive care via VC going forward and 21 (80.8%) stated they would recommend the use of VC to others. CONCLUSION Patients reported VC to be an acceptable way to receive support from a hospice service and HPs would like to continue to offer VC in the future.

While COVID‐19 patients consistently generate a T lymphocyte response to SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens, evidence of significant immune dysregulation in these patients continues to accumulate. In this study, next generation sequencing of the T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) repertoire was conducted in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients to determine if immunogenetic differences of the TRB repertoire contribute to disease course severity. Clustering of highly similar TRB CDR3 amino acid sequences across COVID‐19 patients yielded 781 shared TRB sequences. The TRB sequences were then filtered for known associations with common diseases such as EBV and CMV. The remaining sequences were cross‐referenced to a publicly accessible dataset that mapped COVID‐19 specific TCRs to the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome. We identified 158 SARS‐CoV‐2 specific TRB sequences belonging to 134 clusters in our COVID‐19 patients. Next, we investigated 113 SARS‐CoV‐2 specific clusters binding only one peptide target in relation to disease course. Distinct skewing of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific TRB sequences toward the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) encoded within ORF1a/b of the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome was observed in clusters associated with critical disease course when compared to COVID‐19 clusters associated with a severe disease course. These data imply that T‐lymphocyte reactivity towards peptides from NSPs of SARS‐CoV‐2 may not constitute an effective adaptive immune response and thus may negatively affect disease severity.","Assmann, Jorn L.J.C.; Kolijn, P.

The Morningside Group, a global consortium of interdisciplinary experts advocating for the ethical use of neurotechnology, suggests achieving this by treating legally ND as a body organ (i.e. protecting them through bodily integrity). Although the proposal is currently shaping ND-related policies (most notably, a Neuroprotection Bill of Law being discussed by the Chilean Senate), it is not clear what its conceptual and legal basis is. Treating legally something as something else requires some kind of analogical reasoning, which is not provided by the authors of the proposal. In this paper, I will try to fill this gap by addressing ontological issues related to neurocognitive processes. The substantial differences between ND and body organs or organic tissue cast doubt on the idea that the former should be covered by bodily integrity. Crucially, ND are not constituted by organic material. Nevertheless, I argue that the ND of a subject s are analogous to neurocognitive properties of her brain. I claim that (i) s’ ND are a ‘medium independent’ property that can be characterized as natural semantic personal information about her brain and that (ii) s’ brain not only instantiates this property but also has an exclusive ontological relationship with it: This information constitutes a domain that is unique to her neurocognitive architecture.","Wajnerman Paz, Abel",Minds Mach (Dordr),173,8

There are several challenges facing endovascular therapy for stroke, including shortages of medical staff who may be deployed for COVID-19 coverage or who may have contracted the infection and are thus quarantined, patients avoiding early medical care, a lack of personal protective equipment, delays in door-to-puncture time, anesthesia challenges, and a lack of high-intensity intensive care unit and stroke ward beds. As a leading regional neurovascular organization, the Middle East North Africa Stroke and Interventional Neurotherapies Organization (MENA-SINO) has established a task force composed of medical staff and physicians from different disciplines to establish guiding recommendations for the implementation of acute care pathways for various neurovascular emergencies during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

In Australia, group model building, a participatory method from systems science, has been applied in various locations to engage communities in systems-based health promotion projects. To date there is limited evidence regarding GMB use with Australian Aboriginal communities. This study aimed to determine the value and acceptability of group model building (GMB) as a methodological approach in research with Aboriginal communities and identify any adaptations required to optimise its utility. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 18 Aboriginal health and university staff who had prior experience with a GMB research project. Interview transcripts were inductively analysed using thematic analysis and key themes were organised using an Indigenous research framework. Participants reported that GMB methods generally aligned well with Aboriginal ways of knowing, being, and doing. Participants valued the holistic, visual and collaborative nature of the method and its emphasis on sharing stories and collective decision-making. Group model building was viewed as a useful tool for identifying Aboriginal-led actions to address priority issues and advancing self-determination. Our findings suggest that by bringing together Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal knowledge, GMB is a promising tool, which Aboriginal communities could utilise to explore and address complex problems in a manner that is consistent with their worldviews. In adapting group model building methods, non-Aboriginal researchers should aspire to move beyond co-design processes and enable Aboriginal health research to be entirely led by Aboriginal people.","Browne, Jennifer; Walker, Troy; Brown, Andrew; Sherriff, Simone; Christidis, Rebecca; Egan, Mikaela; Versace, Vincent; Allender, Steven; Backholer, Kathryn",SSM Popul Health,173,22

METHODS: A qualitative study design using semistructured interviews via virtual conferencing was conducted with consultant clinical leads and lead nurses covering 21 PCCUs. Interviews were conducted over a period of 2 weeks, 2 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 surge. Interview notes underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed six themes: leadership, management and planning; communication; workforce development and training; innovation; workforce experience; and infection prevention and control. Leadership was facilitated through clinician-led local autonomy for decision-making and services were better delivered when the workforce was empowered to be flexible in their response. Communication was preferred through collaborative management structures. Further lessons include recognising workforce competencies in surge preparations, the use of virtual technology in facilitating training and meetings, the importance of supporting the well-being of the workforce and the secondary consequences of personal protective equipment use. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an agile response to a rapidly changing situation was enabled through effective clinical leadership and an adaptive workforce. Open systems of communication across senior clinical and management teams facilitated service planning. Support for all members of the workforce through implementation of appropriate and innovative education and well-being solutions was vital in sustaining resilience. This learning supports planning for future surge capacity across paediatric critical care locally and nationally.","Roche, Emma; Lim, Chun; Sayma, Meelad; Navaratnam, Annakan; Davis, Peter J; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Fraser, James; Kenny, Simon",Arch Dis Child,173,1

This study aimed to explore the psychometric properties and criterion validity of the widely used 9-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS) in young gamers. Methods: Three independent samples were drawn from socio-demographically representative cross-sectional telephone surveys collected in the years 2016 (N = 762), 2017 (N = 777), and 2018 (N = 784) and analyzed separately. Results: The IGDS revealed psychometric properties suitable for screening in large samples. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.563, 0.724, and 0.778. The unidimensionality assumption was challenged. At-risk and pathological gamers compared to normal gamers reported longer digital media use and more emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention with clinical relevance to medium effect sizes. The comparison of at-risk and pathological gamers indicated a partial distinction between the two problematic gaming groups. Conclusions: The IGDS could be shown to be an overall suitable and valid tool to identify pathological gamers in childhood and adolescence according to the DSM-5 criteria on a population level. However, the polythetic structure limits comparability with the recent ICD-11 criteria.

Meanwhile, the ecological impacts must be considered by researchers to minimize the hazardous effects of research laboratories. Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral agent recently approved for treatment of COVID-19 infections during 2020 pandemic crisis, so the size of its production by international pharmaceutical corporations evolved dramatically within the past few months. Two novel simple, sensitive, and green methods were developed and validated for FAV determination based on solvent-free micellar LC and spectrofluorimetry techniques. To improve FAV native fluorescence, several factors were studied including solvent type, buffering, pH and added surfactants. The best sensitivity for FAV fluorescence was obtained in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4) at 436 nm after excitation at 323 nm within concentration range of 20-350 ng mL-1. Another HPLC method was validated using C18-RP (5µm, 250 x 4.6 mm) stationary phase and solvent-free mobile phase consisting of (0.02M Brij-35, 0.15M SDS, and 0.02M disodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 5.0) isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 and detection wavelength of 323nm. LC method was validated across concentration range of 10-100 µg mL-1 and FAV eluted in 3.8 min. The methods were validated according to the FDA guidelines and were applied successfully for determination of FAV in its marketed tablet dosage forms and in spiked human plasma samples. The proposed methods are eco-friendly since they are typically based on biodegradable reagents in aqueous solvent-free phases, which was proven by their assessment on two recent greenness metrics (GAPI and AGREE) to prove their eco-friendly properties.","Mikhail, Ibraam E.; Elmansi, Heba; Belal, Fathalla; Ehab Ibrahim, Adel",Microchem J,173,1

Sensitivity of antigen tests has been shown to be lower than that of rRT-PCR; however, data to evaluate epidemiologic characteristics that affect test performance are limited. METHODS: Paired mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected from university students and staff and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using both Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) and rRT-PCR assay. Specimens positive by either rRT-PCR or antigen FIA were placed in viral culture and tested for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate characteristics associated with antigen results, rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, sgRNA, and viral culture. RESULTS: Antigen FIA sensitivity was 78.9% and 43.8% among symptomatic and asymptomatic participants respectively. Among rRT-PCR positive participants, negative antigen results were more likely among asymptomatic participants (OR 4.6, CI:1.3-15.4) and less likely among participants reporting nasal congestion (OR 0.1, CI:0.03-0.8). rRT-PCR-positive specimens with higher Ct values (OR 0.5, CI:0.4-0.8) were less likely, and specimens positive for sgRNA (OR 10.2, CI:1.6-65.0) more likely, to yield positive virus isolation. Antigen testing was >90% positive in specimens with Ct values <29. Positive predictive value of antigen test for positive viral culture (57.7%) was similar to that of rRT-PCR (59.3%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antigen test advantages include low cost, wide availability and rapid turnaround time, making them important screening tests. The performance of antigen tests may vary with patient characteristics, so performance characteristics should be accounted for when designing testing strategies and interpreting results.","Ford, Laura; Lee, Christine; Pray, Ian W; Cole, Devlin; Bigouette, John Paul; Abedi, Glen R; Bushman, Dena; Delahoy, Miranda J; Currie, Dustin W; Cherney, Blake; Kirby, Marie; Fajardo, Geroncio; Caudill, Motria; Langolf, Kimberly; Kahrs, Juliana; Zochert, Tara; Kelly, Patrick; Pitts, Collin; Lim, Ailam; Aulik, Nicole; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Jing; Whitaker, Brett; Browne, Hannah; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Shewmaker, Patricia; Bonenfant, Gaston; Zhou, Bin; Folster, Jennifer; Bankamp, Bettina; Bowen, Michael D; Thornburg, Natalie J; Goffard, Kimberly; Limbago, Brandi; Bateman, Allen; Tate, Jacqueline E; Gieryn, Douglas; Kirking, Hannah L; Westergaard, Ryan; Killerby, Marie",Clin Infect Dis,173,16

Since then, it has spread worldwide with new mutations being reported. The aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in genetic diversity and track non-synonymous substitutions (dN) that could be implicated in the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 and its spread in different regions between December 2019 and November 2020. We analyzed 2213 complete genomes from six geographical regions worldwide, which were downloaded from GenBank and GISAID databases. Although SARS-CoV-2 presented low genetic diversity, there has been an increase over time, with the presence of several hotspot mutations throughout its genome. We identified seven frequent mutations that resulted in dN substitutions. Two of them, C14408T>P323L and A23403G>D614G, located in the nsp12 and Spike protein, respectively, emerged early in the pandemic and showed a considerable increase in frequency over time. Two other mutations, A1163T>I120F in nsp2 and G22992A>S477N in the Spike protein, emerged recently and have spread in Oceania and Europe. There were associations of P323L, D614G, R203K and G204R substitutions with disease severity.

The pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear, but endothelial damage secondary to systemic vasculitis and the onset of anticoagulation therapy, both associated with severe forms of the infection, have been proposed to play a role in the development of this complication. We present the case of a 66-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, hypotension and decrease of consciousness, a few hours after being discharged after a prolonged hospitalisation of 26 days due to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Initial resuscitation was carried out and, when haemodynamic stabilisation was achieved, a computed tomography scan showed contrast extravasation at the topography of the greater omentum. Urgent angiography revealing contrast extravasation originating in a pseudoaneurysm dependent on the right gastroepiploic artery was done, and embolisation with cyanoacrylate was performed at the bleeding point. Owing to persistent haemodynamic instability despite angiographic treatment and aggressive resuscitation, emergency laparotomy was indicated. Partial resection of the greater omentum was carried out and histopathologic examination showed a 5cm×4cm×6cm haematoma, with no signs of abnormalities such as aneurysm or malignancy. No rebleeding occurred. Spontaneous haemorrhage of the greater omentum associated with haemoperitoneum is a serious condition, with reported mortality rates exceeding 30%.

Previous research has shown that higher temperatures led to lower virus survival rates in the laboratory. We develop a model of survival of HeV in the environment as influenced by temperature. We used 20 years of daily temperature at six locations spanning the geographic range of reported HeV incidents to simulate the temporal and spatial impacts of temperature on HeV survival. At any location, simulated virus survival was greater in winter than in summer, and in any month of the year, survival was higher in higher latitudes. At any location, year-to-year variation in virus survival 24 h post-excretion was substantial and was as large as the difference between locations. Survival was higher in microhabitats with lower than ambient temperature, and when environmental exposure was shorter. The within-year pattern of virus survival mirrored the cumulative within-year occurrence of reported HeV cases, although there were no overall differences in survival in HeV case years and non-case years.

Risk factors of pneumonia in pregnancy relate to anatomic and physiologic respiratory changes and immune changes. Aspiration can occur during labor, can cause life-threatening disease, and is more common in cesarean deliveries. Influenza pneumonia can cause severe disease, increasing the risk of preterm delivery, abortion, cesarean section, maternal respiratory failure, and death. CAP treatment requires considering antimicrobial appropriateness and safety, choosing therapy in line with guidelines, but considering maternal and fetal risk.","Brito, Veronica; Niederman, Michael S.",Clin Chest Med,173,1

Introduction: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained blanket testing rate of [≥] 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of [≥] 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of [≥] 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion: Our model predicts that the current testing rates of {approx} 150/100,000 population are inadequate to control transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in Lusaka. Active isolation of COVID-19 cases including asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis between three university health systems in the Chicago metropolitan area: Loyola University Health System (LUHS): comprised of one tertiary and two community hospitals, Rush University System for Health (RUSH): comprised of one tertiary and two community hospitals, and University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC): a tertiary hospital. All patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing and were hospitalized for COVID-19. PE, DVT or arterial thrombosis were confirmed by supportive imaging modalities. Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to test the associations of continuous variables; Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test were used to test the associations of categorical variables. All analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 and two-sided p-value < .05 were deemed statistically significant. Results: Between March and May 2020, 2,180 patients from LUHS, RUSH and UIC were hospitalized for COVID-19 and were included in our analysis. Baseline patient demographics are described in Table 1. Race/ethnicity demographics are as follows: Hispanics (H)/ African Americans (AA) represented 47%/17% of LUHS patients, 32%/42% of RUSH patients, and 36%/51% of UIC patients, respectively (Figure 1). Intensive care admissions were needed in 33% of all patients. Documented total thrombotic events are as follows: LUHS = 5.4% (41 VTE/PE, 10 arterial and 5 with both venous and arterial); RUSH = 9.7% (70 VTE/PE, 7 arterial and 4 with both venous/arterial); UIC = 6% (14 VTE/PE, 4 arterial and 0 with both venous/arterial). Patients that developed a thrombotic event were similar by age, sex, and BMI to those without a thrombotic event. Anticoagulation prophylaxis was given to 82% of pts at LUHS and UIC at time of admission. Collectively, those with thrombotic events (N=156) had higher incidence of intensive care admission, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and a d-dimer >5X upper limit normal (ULN) at presentation. Furthermore, a higher proportion of pts that had a thrombotic event were diabetic at LUHS and RUSH (Table 2). Mortality in COVID-19 patients was 13-16% and patients that had a thrombotic event had a higher risk of death in the RUSH and UIC cohorts. Conclusions: In a racially diverse, multi-institutional cohort of patients, we demonstrate that 7.2% of COVID-19 patients had a thrombotic event. Consistent risk factors for thrombosis across the different centers included an initial d-dimer levels >5X ULN, elevated initial WBC count, diabetes, and being critically ill. Mortality differences and anticoagulation practices between the institutions as well as race/ethnicity differences regarding thrombosis will be explored in future combined multivariate analyses. Finally, based off these risk factors, identification of patients at most risk for thrombosis is needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality when diagnosed with COVID-19. References -Tang et. al.

OBJECTIVE: To assess 7-day healthcare use following telephone triage by NPs compared to RNs. We hypothesized that NP clinical decision ability may reduce follow-up healthcare. DESIGN: Retrospective observational comparative effectiveness study of clinical and administrative databases. NP routed calls were matched to RN calls based on chief complaint with propensity score matching and multivariate count data models, adjusting for differences in call severity and patient comorbidity. PARTICIPANTS: Callers to a VHA regional call center, April 2015 to March 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Primary care, specialty care, and emergency department (ED) visits plus hospitalizations within 7 days. KEY RESULTS: NP-handled calls (N = 1554) were matched to RN calls (N = 48,024) for the same chief complaint. NP-handled calls, compared to RNs, had lower comorbidities, fewer hospitalizations, and less urgent complaints. Seven-day healthcare use was lower for NP compared to RN calls for specialty care (0.15 vs. 0.20 visits per person [VPP]; p < 0.001), ED (0.11 vs. 0.27 VPP; p < 0.001), and hospitalizations (0.01 vs. 0.04 VPP; p < 0.001), but not primary care (0.43 vs. 0.42 VPP; p = 0.80). In adjusted analyses, estimated avoided in-person visits per 100 calls routed to NPs were 0.7 primary care visits (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4, 1.0), 2.6 specialty care visits (95% CI 0.0, 5.1), 5.9 ED visits (95% CI 2.7, 9.1), and 1.4 hospital stays (95% CI 0.1, 2.6). Propensity score–matched models comparing NP (N = 1533) to RN (N = 2646) calls had adjusted odds ratios for 7-day healthcare use of 0.75 (primary care), 0.75 (specialty care), and 0.73 (ED) (all p < 0.003).

A severe course with fatal outcome is possible and unpredictable. OBJECTIVES: Which organ systems are predominantly involved? Which diseases are predisposed for a fatal course? Which organ changes are found with lethal outcome? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from published autopsy studies (28 cases by our group) with respect to organ changes and possible cause of death. RESULTS: The most severe alterations are found in the lungs by diffuse alveolar damage as a symptom of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in part with fibrosis. Thrombosis of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries is associated with hemorrhagic lung infarction. Frequent complications are bacterial pneumonias and less frequently fungal pneumonias by aspergillus. Pulmonary thromboembolism is found in 20–30% of lethal courses, also in the absence of deep venous thrombosis. Intestinal involvement of COVID-19 can be associated with intestinal ischemia, caused by shock or local thrombosis. In most cases, the kidneys display acute tubular injury reflecting acute renal failure, depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen, and hyperplastic adrenal glands. The liver frequently reveals steatosis, liver cell necrosis, portal inflammation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells. Important preexisting diseases in autopsy studies are arterial hypertension with hypertensive and ischemic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus but large population-based studies reveal increased risk of mortality only for diabetes mellitus not for arterial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the pulmonary circulation with pulmonary arterial thrombosis, infarction, and bacterial pneumonia are important and often lethal complications of COVID-19-associated ARDS. Findings from autopsy studies have influenced therapy and prophylaxis.","Lax, Sigurd F.; Skok, Kristijan; Zechner, Peter M.; Setaffy, Lisa; Kessler, Harald H.; Kaufmann, Norbert; Vander, Klaus; Cokić, Natalija; Maierhofer, Urša; Bargfrieder, Ute; Trauner, Michael",Pathologe,173,1

This is an infectious and even life-threatening disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has rapidly spread to other countries from its originating place infecting millions of people globally. To understand future phenomena, strong mathematical models are required with the least prediction errors. In the present study, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models are applied to the data consisting of daily confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the most affected five countries of the world for modeling and predicting one-month confirmed cases of this disease. To validate these models, the prediction results were tested by comparing it with testing data. The results revealed better accuracy of the LS-SVM model over the ARIMA model and also suggested a rapid rise of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in all the countries under study. This analysis would help governments to take necessary actions in advance associated with the preparation of isolation wards, availability of medicines and medical staff, a decision on lockdown, training of volunteers, and economic plans.","Singh, Sarbjit; Parmar, Kulwinder Singh; Makkhan, Sidhu Jitendra Singh; Kaur, Jatinder; Peshoria, Shruti; Kumar, Jatinder",Chaos Solitons Fractals,173,16

This study aimed to assess whether YouTube videos sufficiently serve as an adjunctive tool for learning how to perform an ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block (BPB). Methods: All YouTube videos were classified, based on their sources, as either academic, manufacturer, educational, or individual videos. The metrics, accuracy, utility, reliability (using the Journal of American Medical Association Score benchmark criteria (JAMAS)), and educational quality (using the Global Quality Score (GQS) and Brachial Plexus Block Specific Quality Score (BSQS)) were validated. Results: Here, 175 videos were included. Academic (1.19 ± 0.62, mean ± standard deviation), manufacturer (1.17 ± 0.71), and educational videos (1.15 ± 0.76) had better JAMAS accuracy and reliability than individual videos (0.26 ± 0.67) (p < 0.001).
