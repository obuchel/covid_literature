Although effective in achieving immediate restoration of blood flow, the long-term re-endothelialization and inflammation induced by mechanical stents are difficult to diagnose or treat. Here we present nanomaterial designs and integration strategies for the bioresorbable electronic stent with drug-infused functionalized nanoparticles to enable flow sensing, temperature monitoring, data storage, wireless power/data transmission, inflammation suppression, localized drug delivery, and hyperthermia therapy. In vivo and ex vivo animal experiments as well as in vitro cell studies demonstrate the previously unrecognized potential for bioresorbable electronic implants coupled with bioinert therapeutic nanoparticles in the endovascular system.","Son, Donghee; Lee, Jongha; Lee, Dong Jun; Ghaffari, Roozbeh; Yun, Sumin; Kim, Seok Joo; Lee, Ji Eun; Cho, Hye Rim; Yoon, Soonho; Yang, Shixuan; Lee, Seunghyun; Qiao, Shutao; Ling, Daishun; Shin, Sanghun; Song, Jun-Kyul; Kim, Jaemin; Kim, Taeho; Lee, Hakyong; Kim, Jonghoon; Soh, Min; Lee, Nohyun; Hwang, Cheol Seong; Nam, Sangwook; Lu, Nanshu; Hyeon, Taeghwan; Choi, Seung Hong; Kim, Dae-Hyeong",ACS nano,913,19

Herein, we engineer regular swabs by using a microneedle (MN) patch to significantly improve the quality and quantity of virus collection. The combination of MNs with different crosslinking levels endows the patches with dual capability of mucus penetration and virus extraction. Moreover, the antibody (Ab) against viral spike protein was integrated into the patch, conferring MNs with an active virus capture potential.

The hyper-reactive TB patients have suffered from chronic inflammation which could cause deleterious effects on their bodies. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an adjunctive therapy based on inflammatory modulation during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. The present study aims to investigate the immune regulatory effects of Andrographolide (Andro) on Mtb-infected macrophages and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that Andro inhibits the production of IL-1ß and other inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. The down-regulation of IL-1ß expression causes the declining expression of IL-8 and MCP-1 in lung epithelial cells which were co-cultured with Mtb-infected macrophages. The inhibition of the activation of NF-&#954;B pathway, but not the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway, accounts for the anti-inflammatory role of Andro. Further studies elucidated that Andro could evoke the activation of autophagy to degrade NLRP3, which ultimately inhibited inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1ß production. Finally, the relevant results demonstrated that Andro inhibited the Notch1 pathway to down-regulate the phosphorylation of Akt/mTOR and NF-&#954;B p65 subunit. Taken together, Andro has been found to suppress the Notch1/Akt/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. Both Akt inhibition-induced autophagy and inhibition of the NF-&#954;B pathway contributed to restraining the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1ß production. Then, the decreased production of IL-1ß influenced chemokine expression in lung epithelial cells. Based on these results, anti-inflammatory effect of Andro in TB infection is merit further investigation.","He, Weigang; Sun, Jinxia; Zhang, Qingwen; Li, Yinhong; Fu, Yan; Zheng, Yuejuan; Jiang, Xin",J. leukoc. biol,913,17

There is little evidence about smoking and risk of infection. We aim to examine association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality. Methods: This was a prospective study with participants from the UK Biobank cohort. Participants who lived in England were followed up from 01/02/2020 to 28/06/2020 with data linked to hospital episode statistics, Office for National Statistics and Public Health England PCR tests. We compared current-smokers, previous-smokers with never-smokers and estimated risk ratio (RR) of COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality using Poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index and socio-economic status. Interactions between smoking status and age and sex were tested for using multiplicative interactions, and analyses were stratified by median age (49-68 years, 69-86 years) and sex. Results: In total, 402,978 participants were included in the analyses. The majority were never smokers, 226,294 (56.2%), 140,090 (34.8%) were previous smokers, and 39,974 (9.9%) current smokers. COVID-19 infection was identified in 1591 (0.39%) people, and 372/1591 (23.4%) died. Amongst the younger participants, smokers were nearly twice as likely to become infected with COVID-19 than never smokers (RR 1.88 [1.49-2.38]) whereas there was no difference for those aged 69+ (RR 1.05 [0.82-1.34]). In contrast, amongst the older participants, smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 compared to non-smokers (RR 2.15 [1.11-4.16]) whereas there was no difference for those under the age of 69 (RR 1.22[0.83-1.79]). Similar patterns were observed for previous smokers. The impact of smoking was similar in men and women. Conclusion: The association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent death is modified by age. Smokers and previous smokers aged under 69 were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, suggesting the risk is associated with increased exposure to SARS-COV-2 virus. Once infected, older smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than never smokers, possibly mediated by increased risk of chronic conditions/illnesses.","Prats-Uribe, A.; Xie, J.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.; Petersen, I.",Clinical Epidemiology,913,17

Multiplatform solutions provide a hybrid model of care, which can include mobile and online platforms accompanied by direct clinician input and feedback. Desirable components to be included are discussed, including symptom tracking, patient education, well-being support, and bidirectional communication between patients and clinicians. Customizable and scalable digital health platforms not only can be readily adapted to further meet the needs of employers and public health stakeholders during the ongoing pandemic, but also hold relevance for flexibly meeting broader care management needs into the future.","Willems, Sofie H; Rao, Jyotsna; Bhambere, Sailee; Patel, Dipu; Biggins, Yvonne; Guite, Jessica W",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,913,17

Tongue diagnosis is an important component of TCM, but also plays a role in Western medicine, for example in dermatology. However, the procedure of obtaining tongue images has not been standardized and the reliability of tongue diagnosis by smartphone tongue images has yet to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this study was to develop an operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis. The second and main objective of this study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of tongue coating diagnosis using the operating classification scheme. METHODS: An operating classification scheme for tongue coating was developed using a stepwise approach and a quasi-Delphi method. First, tongue images (n=2023) were analyzed by 2 groups of assessors to develop the operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis. Based on clinicians' (n=17) own interpretations as well as their use of the operating classification scheme, the results of tongue diagnosis on a representative tongue image set (n=24) were compared. After gathering consensus for the operating classification scheme, the clinicians were instructed to use the scheme to assess tongue features of their patients under direct visual inspection. At the same time, the clinicians took tongue images of the patients with smartphones and assessed tongue features observed in the smartphone image using the same classification scheme. The intra-rater agreements of these two assessments were calculated to determine which features of tongue coating were better retained by the image. Using the finalized operating classification scheme, clinicians in the study group assessed representative tongue images (n=24) that they had taken, and the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of their assessments was evaluated. RESULTS: Intra-rater agreement between direct subject inspection and tongue image inspection was good to very good (Cohen &#954; range 0.69-1.0). Additionally, when comparing the assessment of tongue images on different days, intra-rater reliability was good to very good (&#954; range 0.7-1.0), except for the color of the tongue body (&#954;=0.22) and slippery tongue fur (&#954;=0.1). Inter-rater reliability was moderate for tongue coating (Gwet AC2 range 0.49-0.55), and fair for color and other features of the tongue body (Gwet AC2=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study has shown that tongue images collected via smartphone contain some reliable features, including tongue coating, that can be used in mHealth analysis. Our findings thus support the use of smartphones in telemedicine for detecting changes in tongue coating.","Wang, Zhi Chun; Zhang, Shi Ping; Yuen, Pong Chi; Chan, Kam Wa; Chan, Yi Yi; Cheung, Chun Hoi; Chow, Chi Ho; Chua, Ka Kit; Hu, Jun; Hu, Zhichao; Lao, Beini; Leung, Chun Chuen; Li, Hong; Zhong, Linda; Liu, Xusheng; Liu, Yulong; Liu, Zhenjie; Lun, Xin; Mo, Wei; Siu, Sheung Yuen; Xiong, Zhoujian; Yeung, Wing Fai; Zhang, Run Yun; Zhang, Xuebin",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,913,17

It was initially declared as public health emergency if international concern by WHO followed by Pandemic on 12th March 2020. As of 10th April 2020, more than 1.5 million people are affected globally with around 95,000 deaths. Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy. The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article. Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals. Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging. Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research. The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.","Salvi, Rachana; Patankar, Panini",Biomed Pharmacother,913,17

clinics (PoVs) should provide influenza vaccination to all persons aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and do not have contraindications No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate product is available Considering the situation of globally pandemic of COVID-19, to decrease the risk of influenza virus infection and minimize the impact on COVID-19 prevention and control, we recommend the following priority for seasonal influenza vaccination: (1) healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, quarantine professionals;(2) Vulnerable groups living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staffs who take care those vulnerable groups;(3) People in some key places, such as teachers and students in kindergartens, primary and secondary school, prisoners and staffs of prisons;(4) Other high risk group of influenza, including adults ≥60 years of age, children aged 6-59 months, persons with specific chronic diseases, the family members and caregivers of infants &lt;6 months of age, and pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant during the influenza season Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection People whoever get IIV or LAIV all apply to the principle If they were vaccinated in 2019-2020 influenza season or a prior season, 1 dose is recommended People more than 8 years old require 1 dose of influenza vaccine It is recommended that people receive their influenza vaccination by the end of October Influenza vaccination should be offered as soon as the vaccination is available For the people unable to be vaccinated before the end of October, influenza vaccination will continue to be offered for the whole season Influenza vaccine is also recommended for use in pregnant women during any trimester These guidelines are intended for use by staff members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at all levels who work on influenza control and

METHODS: To evaluate aerosol-spread we nebulized ultraviolet sensitive detergents into the artificial airway of a resuscitation dummy and performed CPR. The spread of the visualized aerosol was documented by a camera. In a further approach we applied nebulized detergents into the airways of human cadavers and detected the simulated spread on the same way. Among others we did recordings with undergoing compression-only-CPR, with a surgical mask or an oxygen mask on the patients face and with an inserted supraglottic airway device with and without a connected airway filter. RESULTS: Most aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask and of an oxygen mask on the patient's face deflected the spread. Inserting a supraglottic airway device connected to an airway filter lead to a remarkable reduction of aerosol-spread. CONCLUSION: The early insertion of a supraglottic airway device connected to an airway filter before starting chest compression may be beneficial for staff protection during CPR.","Ott, Matthias; Milazzo, Alfio; Liebau, Stefan; Jaki, Christina; Schilling, Tobias; Krohn, Alexander; Heymer, Johannes",Resuscitation,913,17

We present three lines of evidence using methods that have increasing model dependency, including an inverse model to estimate relative emissions changes in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019. The March decrease (25%) in Washington DC/Baltimore is largely supported by a drop in natural gas consumption associated with a warm spring whereas the decrease in April (33%) correlates with changes in gasoline fuel sales. In contrast, only a fraction of the March (17%) and April (34%) reduction in Los Angeles is explained by traffic declines.

The correct diagnosis relies on careful morphologic evaluation, cytogenetic/molecular results, and excluding reactive conditions mimicking MDS. We present the clinical, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of a case of MDS with excess blasts-2 (MDS-EB-2) in a 30-year-old male who was found to have pancytopenia during his hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and discuss the diagnostic challenges of MDS in patients with COVID-19. Case presentation A 30-year-old man presented to an outside hospital with fever, chills, weakness, coughing spells, dizziness and shortness of breath and was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia due to COVID-19. At the outside hospital, he was found to be pancytopenic, and a subsequent bone marrow aspiration and biopsy raised concern for a COVID-19 induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In addition, MDS could not be ruled out. The patient was thus referred to our institute for further management. The patient's peripheral blood showed pancytopenia with occasional dysplastic neutrophils and a few teardrop cells. Given the diagnostic uncertainty, a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy were repeated revealing a hypercellular bone marrow with erythroid hyperplasia, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, trilineage dysplasia, increased blasts (13%), many ring sideroblasts, and mild to moderate myelofibrosis, consistent with MDS-EB-2. Chromosomal analysis revealed isochromosome 14. Next generation sequencing demonstrated SF3B1 K700E mutation. Discussion and conclusion The diagnosis of MDS can be challenging, particularly in young patients. Cytopenia and myelodysplastic features have been reported in COVID-19 patients, making the diagnosis of MDS more elusive. A careful pathologic examination of the bone marrow with ancillary studies including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetic and molecular studies in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation, leads to the accurate diagnosis.","Qing, Xin; Cai, Jennifer; Rock, Adam",Autops.

This study aims to determine the relationship between soluble ST2 (sST2), a profibrotic biomarker, and AF recurrence after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). METHODS: AF patients referred for RFCA were consecutively included from October 2017 to May 2019. Baseline characteristics were collected, and sST2 levels were determined before ablation. Left atrial substrate mapping was performed after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation under sinus rhythm, and substrate was modified in low-voltage zones. A second procedure was recommended under recurrence. RESULTS: 258 patients (146 males, average age 61.0 ± 8.8) were included. After a medium follow-up of 13.5 months, 52 patients (20.2%) had recurrence and received a second procedure. Preoperative sST2 level in patients with recurrence was significantly higher than that in patients without (31.3 ng/ml vs. 20.3 ng/ml, p < 0.001). In those undergoing second ablation, sST2 level in patients with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping was significantly higher than that in patients without (43.0 ng/ml vs. 22.1 ng/ml, p < 0.001). An sST2 level over 26.9 ng/ml could predict AF recurrence with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75.9%. Multiple logistic analysis showed that sST2 level was an independent predictor of AF recurrence with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: S: sST2 level was associated with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping and recurrence of AF after ablation. It might have significance in choosing treatment strategies for AF.

Using comprehensive daily air quality data in China, we evaluated the impacts of these measures in terms of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM 2.5). To infer their causal relationships, we employed difference-in-differences models that compare cities with and without lockdown policies. We found that city lockdowns led to a sizeable improvement in air quality. Within weeks, the AQI in the locked-down cities was brought down by 19.84 points (PM 2.5down by 14.07 µg m − 3) relative to the control group. In addition, air quality in cities without formal lockdowns also improved because of the enforcement of other types of counter-virus measures. The AQI in those cities was brought down by 6.34 points (PM 2.5down by 7.05 µg m − 3) relative to the previous year. The lockdown effects are larger in colder, richer and more industrialized cities. Despite these improvements, PM 2.5concentrations during the lockdown periods remained four times higher than the World Health Organization recommendations, suggesting much further effort is needed. Existing environmental policies could obtain similar air quality improvements at a much lower economic cost, making city lockdowns an unsustainable option to address environmental issues.","He, Guojun; Pan, Yuhang; Tanaka, Takanao",Nature Sustain.,913,17

In both cases, the patients were discharged but later developed symptoms of cough and dyspnea, which were later diagnosed as PILS. Persistent cough and dyspnea are common symptoms in both PILS and the recovery phase of severe COVID-19. For this reason, PILS should be considered in the differential diagnosis post-COVID-19 patients. In addition, the prevalence of PILS may be greater than that of other critical diseases in severe COVID-19 patients.","Miwa, Maki; Nakajima, Mikio; H Kaszynski, Richard; Hamada, Syoichiro; Nakano, Tomotsugu; Shirokawa, Masamitsu; Goto, Hideaki; Yamaguchi, Yoshihiro",Intern Med,913,17

Disruptions in the drug market are expected and shortages might worsen. Community pharmacies can contribute to early identification and report of medicines' supply and demand issues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on outpatient medicines' sales and shortages. METHODS: A retrospective, time-trend analysis of medicine sales, shortages and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases was performed from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and its homologous period (regarding sales only). A detailed analysis of 6 pharmaceutical substances was performed. All data were subjected to rescaling using the min-max normalization method, in order to become comparable. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft® Excel. RESULTS: The pandemic resulted in an increase in medicines' demand and reported shortages during the early stage of the outbreak. The maximum proportion of medicine sales was registered on March 13th, 2020, 4 days after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By the end of March, sales have already dropped to proportions similar to those of 2019. The maximum proportion of drug shortages was reached about one week after the sales peak and by the end of the study period were below those recorded in the pre-COVID-19 period. The analyzed drugs were paracetamol, ascorbic acid, dapagliflozin plus metformin, rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe, formoterol, and hydroxychloroquine, as these pharmaceutical substances registered the highest growth rate in sales and shortages when compared to the same period in the previous year. Hydroxychloroquine showed the most different pattern trends on sales and shortages of these medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies can provide timely and real-world data regarding sales and shortages. The adopted measures to guarantee the continuous supply of the medicine market seem to have worked. The long-term impacts of this pandemic are unknown and should continue to be closely monitored.","Romano, Sónia; Galante, Heloísa; Figueira, Débora; Mendes, Zilda; Rodrigues, António Teixeira",Res. soc. adm. pharm,913,17

Also, whether there are any differences in preferred consultation methods between adults who were referred for an assessment of Autism as opposed to ADHD. 117 service users who undertook assessment by the ADHD and Autism Service at South West Yorkshire NHS Partnership Foundation Trust from April to September 2020 completed an adapted version of the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). Results demonstrated that service users found remote telecommunication to be useful, effective, reliable and satisfactory. Despite this, almost half of service users stated a general preference for face to face consultations. There was no difference in the choice of methods of contact between Autism and ADHD pathways.

Here we apply the SIR model and study analytically and numerically the epidemic spread on a recently developed spatial modular model imitating the structure of cities in a country. The model assumes that inside a city the infection channels connect many different locations, while the infection channels between cities are less and usually directly connect only a few nearest neighbor cities in a two-dimensional plane. We find that the model experience two epidemic transitions. The first lower threshold represents a local epidemic spread within a city but not to the entire country and the second higher threshold represents a global epidemic in the entire country.

One example is cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals, measured by transcranial Doppler, which are susceptible to large errors from patient motion. In this paper we propose a method to remove artifacts and impute sections of missing data in these signals. METHODS: The method exploits the low-order dynamical relationship between CBFV, arterial blood pressure, and, where available, intracranial pressure. It enhances the measured signals by fitting them to a low-order dynamical model, using convex regularization terms that improve robustness to large deviations and missing data. The method is based on a convex optimization formulation, and utilizes recent work in trace norm approximation and subspace system identification. RESULTS: Simulations demonstrate that the method successfully removes real CBFV artifacts, and can impute missing data with reasonable accuracy. Performance was improved when intracranial pressure data was available. CONCLUSION: The methods presented can be used by researchers to remove artifacts and estimate missing sections in CBFV signals. The general approach may be applied to other biomedical signal processing settings. SIGNIFICANCE: This low-order dynamical approach has ongoing applications in noninvasive intracranial pressure estimation.","Gunn, Cameron Allan; Hu, Xiao; Vandenberghe, Lieven",Physiol. meas,913,17

Drawing on the transactional theory of stress and coping, this study aims to investigate when hospitality workers' COVID-19 risk perception affects their likelihood of having depressive symptoms. Using data from 211 hospitality workers in 76 hotels in Peru, we examined the effects of perceived COVID-19 risk on the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms. We posited that this relationship is moderated by the workers' environment at work (job satisfaction) and at home (the number of children). The results indicate that job satisfaction weakens the link between hospitality workers' COVID-19 risk perception and their likelihood of depressive symptoms while the number of children exacerbates this link. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on COVID-19 risk perception and offer practical implications for hospitality workers under COVID-19 crisis.","Yan, JiaQi Kim Sunghoon Zhang S.
