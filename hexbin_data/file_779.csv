33705,Lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin: Various toxicities following off-label treatment: case report,2020-06-06,"In this paper I explore several issues related to how the COVID‐19 pandemic might impact consumer demand for food. These impacts relate to the structure of preferences in the context of a pandemic, income and time constraints, and price effects. Discussion includes accounting for differential impacts of COVID‐19 on demand for food across sociodemographic characteristics, and several high‐level issues and observations related to where and how consumers shop and what they buy. My own thinking leads me to conclude that demand‐side factors will account for most of the changes we see in retail food market. These demand‐side effects will be dominated by income effects, the opportunity cost of time, and longer planning horizons on the part of consumers.","Cranfield, John A.

37172,"Multiple drugs: Haemodynamic instability, supraventricular tachycardia and lack of efficacy : case report.",2020-07-25,"This paper investigates how expansionary monetary policy after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has affected the U.S. banking sector. In response to the GFC, the Federal Reserve first lowered the overnight federal funds rate from 5.25% in August 2007 to zero in December 2008. It then turned to quantitative easing, purchasing housing agency debt, mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury bonds to stimulate the economy. While these policies helped the overall economy to recover, they may have harmed the banking sector. Banks accept safe short-term deposits and transform these into risky longer-term loans. They make a profit on the difference between the interest rate they earn on longer-term assets and the rate they pay of short-term deposits (the net interest margin). Low short-term interest rates and compressed spreads between long- and short-term interest rates may impair bank profitability. Bernanke and Gertler (J Econ Perspect 4:27–48, 1995) showed that reduced bank profitability can hinder their ability to extend loans. Bernanke (FRBNY Q Rev 18:50–70, 1993) noted that this is problematic because banks play a special role in channeling savings to promising borrowers. Financial markets are plagued by information imperfections. Savers release funds today for the promise of obtaining funds later. Whether they get repaid depends on the character of the borrower, the quality of the investment, the collateral that the borrower can provide, and other factors. The lender needs to consider these items and not just interest rates. Asymmetric information can thus hinder the flow of funds from savers to small businesses and other borrowers whose quality is hard to evaluate. Banks can bridge imperfect information problems because they have a comparative advantage because of the following reasons: (1) economies of specialization, as lending officers gain expertise in a particular industry; (2) economies of scale, as it is cheaper for bank to evaluate a loan than for small savers to; and (3) economies of scope, as it is cheaper to provide lending services together with other services. This paper investigates how lower short-term rates and falls in the spread between long-and short-term rates affect bank profitability. To do this, it investigates how these variables affect bank stock prices. Stock prices provide valuable information since they are the expected present value of future cash flows. The results indicate that falls in short rates and in the spread have caused large drops in bank stock returns after the GFC. Banks are also facing competitive pressures from Fin Tech firms and big technology firms. Their performance after the GFC has lagged other parts of the U.S. economy. They are thus vulnerable to negative shocks that could arise during a downturn or a crisis. The Fed should take account of the impact of their policies on the banking sector, since an interruption on the flow of credit through the financial system could prevent funds from going to the most promising firms. This misallocation of resources could then hinder long-term economic growth.","Thorbecke, Willem",IJEPS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372741/,779

37194,Multiple drugs: Various toxicites and off-label use: case report,2020-07-25,"This article proposes a research agenda for situations of coexistence of territorial agricultural and food models. Indeed, new agricultural and food models are being deployed at the territorial scale in response to criticisms of existing models and to meet new challenges. These new models embody archetypes of observed diversity, actors’ projects or standards. We use a bibliographic review and six seminars organized between 2015 and 2017 to propose an analytical framework based on four major dimensions of territorial development: the tension between specialization and diversification, innovation, adaptation and transition of food systems. We show that it is essential to understand the interactions between territorial agricultural and food models (confrontation, complementarity, coevolution, hybridization, etc.), going beyond just the characterization of the diversity of models and the evaluation of their relative performances. We conclude by highlighting the original aspects of the proposed analytical framework, its methodological challenges and the expected consequences for providing support to agricultural and food development in urban and rural territories.","Gasselin, Pierre; Lardon, Sylvie; Cerdan, Claire; Loudiyi, Salma; Sautier, Denis",Rev Agric Food Environ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7374664/,779

When the pandemic will end is a question of great concern. A logistic model that depicts the growth rules of infected and recovered cases in China’s mainland may shed some light on this question. This model well explained the data by 13 April from 31 countries that have been experiencing serious COVID-2019 outbreaks (R(2) ≥ 0.95). Based on this model, the semi-saturation period (SSP) of infected cases in those countries ranges from 3 March to 18 June. According to the linear relationship between the growth rules for infected and for recovered cases identified from the Chinese data, we predicted that the SSP of the recovered cases outside China ranges from 22 March to 8 July. More importantly, we found a strong positive correlation between the SSP of infected cases and the timing of a government’s response. Finally, this model was also applied to four regions that went through other coronavirus or Ebola virus epidemics (R(2) ≥ 0.95). There is a negative correlation between the death rate and the logistic growth rate. These findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of rapid epidemic control measures in various countries.","Han, Chuanliang; Liu, Yimeng; Tang, Jiting; Zhu, Yuyao; Jaeger, Carlo; Yang, Saini",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7433281/,779
38347,Multiple drugs: Livedoid reaction and off-label use: case report,2020-08-29,"Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) predation on subyearling fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) was examined in the Snake River (USA) to identify seasonal and habitat-related changes in bass diets, and associated subyearling consumption and loss in various riverine and impounded reaches. Smallmouth bass diets reflected opportunistic foraging that at times showed predation on subyearlings is influenced by the consumption of other prey such as crayfish, sand roller (Percopsis transmontana), and smaller invertebrates. Estimated loss of subyearlings was influenced by bass abundance and consumption rates. The highest bass abundances (> 1,000 bass/river kilometer) were observed in the upper reach of Hells Canyon early in April and May, and in Lower Granite Reservoir. Peak consumption rates of subyearlings (≥ 0.12 subyearlings/bass/day) occurred in the upper reach of Hells Canyon during May and in most reservoir reaches in June. Predation losses accumulated evenly along the river continuum from riverine to reservoir habitats. We estimated that 869,371 subyearlings could be lost to smallmouth bass predation between riverine production areas and Lower Granite Dam in a given year. To provide a context for this estimated loss, we provide an illustration of its potential effect on the adult population. Assuming no juvenile mortality occurred downstream of the dam and depending on smolt-to-adult return rates, this represented up to 3.9–16.0% of the potential adult run that could have returned to Lower Granite Dam had no subyearling predation by smallmouth bass occurred upstream of the dam. Although this study was limited by a number of assumptions and constraints, it does provide an illustration of how predation affects juvenile and adult salmon loss over a broad, changing river landscape.","Tiffan, Kenneth F.; Erhardt, John M.; Hemingway, Rulon J.; Bickford, Brad K.; Rhodes, Tobyn N.",Environ Biol Fishes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7443614/,779

38775,Multiple drugs: Lack of efficacy: case report,2020-09-05,"Lysosomes are involved in pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and play a large role in neurodegenerative disorders caused by virus infection. However, whether virus-infected cells or animals can be used as experimental models of neurodegeneration in humans based on virus-related lysosomal dysfunction remain unclear. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus displays neurotropism in mice, and neural cells are its targets for viral progression. PHEV infection was confirmed to be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases in the present. The findings demonstrated for the first time that PHEV infection can lead to lysosome disorders and showed that the specific mechanism of lysosome dysfunction is related to PGRN expression deficiency and indicated similar pathogenesis compared with human neurodegenerative diseases upon PHEV infection. Trehalose can also increase progranulin expression and rescue abnormalities in lysosomal structure in PHEV-infected cells. In conclusion, these results suggest that PHEV probably serve as a disease model for studying the pathogenic mechanisms and prevention of other degenerative diseases.

To analyze cellular protein expression in ORFV-infected goat skin fibroblast (GSF) cells, we used two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). The proteomics approach was used along with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect differentially expressed proteins in ORFV-infected GSF cells and mock-infected GSF cells. A total of 282 differentially expressed proteins were identified. It was found that 222 host proteins were upregulated and 60 were downregulated following viral infection. We confirmed that these proteins were differentially expressed and found that heat shock 70-kDa protein 1B (HSPA1B) was differentially expressed and localized in the cytoplasm. It was also noted that HSPA1B caused inhibition of viral proliferation, in the middle and late stages of viral infection. The differentially expressed proteins were associated with the biological processes of viral binding, cell structure, signal transduction, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation.","Hao, Jun-hong; Kong, Han-jin; Yan, Ming-hao; Shen, Chao-chao; Xu, Guo-wei; Zhang, Da-jun; Zhang, Ke-shan; Zheng, Hai-xue; Liu, Xiang-tao",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7465882/,779

Yet, group discussions, especially in a business context, are still challenging as non-verbal communication (NVC) is often depicted on digital whiteboards, including deictic gestures paired with visual artifacts. However, as NVC heavily relies on the visual perception, whichrepresents a large amount of detail, an adaptive approach is required that identifies the most relevant information for BVIP. Additionally, visual artifacts usually rely on spatial properties such as position, orientation, and dimensions to convey essential information such as hierarchy, cohesion, and importance that is often not accessible to the BVIP. In this paper, we investigate the requirements of BVIP during brainstorming sessions and, based on our findings, provide an accessible multimodal tool that uses non-verbal and spatial cues as an additional layer of information. Further, we contribute by presenting a set of input and output modalities that encode and decode information with respect to the individual demands of BVIP and the requirements of different use cases.","Koutny, Reinhard; Günther, Sebastian; Dhingra, Naina; Kunz, Andreas; Miesenberger, Klaus; Mühlhäuser, Max",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479786/,779

Thailand had imposed import restrictions and created an import permit system prior to China’s decision. However, the nation was not prepared for the extent of the subsequent smuggling and other illegal activities, as evidenced by the various problems related to the permit system and customs enforceability in 2018. In response, Thailand banned imports of plastic waste and e-waste, resulting in a loss of business opportunities for companies with legal import permits. Other nations in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines, witnessed a similar surge in imports of plastic waste and e-waste after China’s decision to restrict waste imports. These nations subsequently also imposed import bans and/or restrictions. However, the enforceability of such bans and restrictions may be limited in Asia.

It examines both short-term and medium-to-long-term impacts of the pandemic and outlines strategies to reduce the potential consequences of those impacts. To this end, we use a qualitative, multiple-case-study methodology, collecting data from eight sample companies with fourteen respondents in the food and beverage industry in Bangladesh. The findings show that the short-term impacts of this pandemic, such as product expiry, shortage of working capital, and limited operations of distributors, are severe, while the medium-to-long-term impacts promise to be complex and uncertain. In the longer term, various performance metrics, such as return on investment by the firms, the contribution of the firms to the gross domestic product (GDP), and employee size, are all expected to decrease. Moreover, firms may need to restructure their supply chain and build relationships with new distributors and trade partners.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out of 114 AKI patients, consecutively selected, on dialysis and mechanical ventilation, aged between 19 and 95 years. For construction of the predictive model, 80% of cases were randomly separated to training and 20% of unused cases to validation. Several machine learning models were tested in the training data: linear regression with stepwise, rpart, support vector machine with radial kernel, generalised boosting machine and random forest. The models were selected by ten-fold cross-validation and the performances evaluated by the root mean square error. RESULTS: There were 364 indirect calorimetry measurements in 114 patients, mean age of 60.65 ± 16.9 years and 68.4% were males. The average REE was 2081 ± 645 kcal. REE was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, minute volume (MV), expiratory positive airway pressure, serum urea, body mass index and inversely with age. The principal variables included in the selected model were age, body mass index, use of vasopressors, expiratory positive airway pressure, MV, C-reactive protein, temperature and serum urea. The final r-value in the validation set was 0.69. CONCLUSION: We propose a new predictive equation for estimating the REE of AKI patients on dialysis that uses a non-linear approach with better performance than actual models.","Ponce, Daniela; de Goes, Cassiana Regina; de Andrade, Luis Gustavo Modelli",Nutr Metab (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670992/,779

The high level of evidence generated by clinical trials makes them the main approach to evaluating new clinical interventions. The increasing amounts of data to be considered in the planning and conducting of clinical trials has led to higher costs and increased timelines of clinical trials, with low productivity. Advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and the internet of things offer an opportunity to improve the efficiency and productivity of clinical trials at various stages. Although researchers have done some tangible work regarding the application of advanced technologies in clinical trials, the studies are yet to be mapped to give a general picture of the current state of research. This systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze studies published on the role of advanced technologies in clinical trials. A search restricted to the period between 2010 and 2020 yielded a total of 443 articles. The analysis revealed a trend of increasing research interests in the area over the years. Recruitment and eligibility aspects were the main focus of the studies. The main research types were validation and evaluation studies. Most studies contributed methods and theories, hence there exists a gap for architecture, process, and metric contributions. In the future, more empirical studies are expected given the increasing interest to implement the AI, ML, DL, and IoT in clinical trials.","Ngayua, Esther Nanzayi; He, Jianjia; Agyei-Boahene, Kwabena",Scientometrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680218/,779
42570,Enoxaparin-sodium: Lack of efficacy: case report,2020-11-28,"BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant infections due to Mycobacterium abscessus often require complex and prolonged regimens for treatment. Here, we report the evaluation of a new ex vivo antimicrobial susceptibility testing model using organotypic cultures of murine precision-cut lung slices, an experimental model in which metabolic activity, and all the usual cell types of the organ are found while the tissue architecture and the interactions between the different cells are maintained. METHODS: Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from the lungs of wild type BALB/c mice using the Krumdieck(®) tissue slicer. Lung tissue slices were ex vivo infected with the virulent M. abscessus strain L948. Then, we tested the antimicrobial activity of two drugs: imipenem (4, 16 and 64 μg/mL) and tigecycline (0.25, 1 and 4 μg/mL), at 12, 24 and 48 h. Afterwards, CFUs were determined plating on blood agar to measure the surviving intracellular bacteria. The viability of PCLS was assessed by Alamar Blue assay and corroborated using histopathological analysis. RESULTS: PCLS were successfully infected with a virulent strain of M. abscessus as demonstrated by CFUs and detailed histopathological analysis. The time-course infection, including tissue damage, parallels in vivo findings reported in genetically modified murine models for M. abscessus infection. Tigecycline showed a bactericidal effect at 48 h that achieved a reduction of > 4log(10) CFU/mL against the intracellular mycobacteria, while imipenem showed a bacteriostatic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The use of this new organotypic ex vivo model provides the opportunity to test new drugs against M. abscessus, decreasing the use of costly and tedious animal models.","Molina-Torres, Carmen Amelia; Flores-Castillo, Oscar Noé; Carranza-Torres, Irma Edith; Guzmán-Delgado, Nancy Elena; Viveros-Valdez, Ezequiel; Vera-Cabrera, Lucio; Ocampo-Candiani, Jorge; Verde-Star, Julia; Castro-Garza, Jorge; Carranza-Rosales, Pilar",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680588/,779

Method We conducted a self-administered anonymous survey of DPs in centres across England and Wales following the SOP recommendations published by PHE and PHW. The survey was live from 8th June 2020 until 12th June 2020. 200 DPs completed the survey. Results were collated and analysed graphically for interpretation. Results Most respondents (57.5%) felt that due to their role of being a dental practitioner, they were at a high risk of COVID-19 transmission and (52.5%) that published guidelines from their respective public health body (either PHE or PHW) were not sufficient for identifying patients with or at risk of COVID-19. The overall correlation showed that DPs in Wales had a more confident outlook on guidance from their public health body compared with DPs in England. Conclusion Our survey illustrates a lack of confidence in and understanding of COVID-19 guidance from PHW and PHW amongst dental practitioners, together with significant anxiety regarding exposure risk in the dental setting.

The 2019-nCoV spread rapidly and reaching epidemic proportions in many countries of the world. ACE2 was identified as a key receptor for 2019-nCoV infections. Excessive form of soluble ACE2 rescues cellular ACE2 activity which has a protective role in acute lung failure and neutralizes the virus. The short half-life of ACE2 is a major limitation to its practical application. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems are one of the most widely investigated approaches for developing novel therapies for a variety of diseases. Nevertheless, nanoparticles suffer from the rapid removal from the bloodstream by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). A noncovalent attachment of nanoparticles to RBCs increases their half-life in blood and allows transient accumulation in the lungs, while decreases their uptake by the liver and spleen. Connecting the recombinant ACE2 into the surface of nanoparticles that were attached to RBCs can be a potential therapeutic approach for 2019-nCoV infection through increasing their lung targeting to naturalize the virus and also acting as a bioreactor in the blood circulation to decrease serum level of Angiotensin II and protects lungs from injury/ARDS.","Aghili, Zahra Sadat; Mirzaei, Seyed Abbas; Banitalebi-Dehkordi, Mehdi",J Biol Res (Thessalon),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720268/,779
43071,Lopinavir/ritonavir: Sick sinus syndrome following off-label use: case report,2020-12-12,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grossly impacted how we deliver healthcare and how healthcare institutions derive value from the care provided. at increased infectious risk on immunosuppressive therapies and often have mobility limitations. Adapting to new technologies and reimbursement patterns were challenges that had to be met by the institutions while patients struggled with decisions to prioritize concerns and to identify new pathways to care. With the implementation of social distancing practices, telemedicine plays an increasing role in patient care delivery, particularly in the field of Neurology. This is of particular concern in our cancer patient population given that these patients are often at increased infectious risk on immunosuppressive therapies and often have mobility limitations. We reviewed telemedicine practices in neurology pre-/post-COVID-19 and evaluated the neuro-oncology clinical practice approaches of two large care systems, Barrow Neurological Institute and Geisinger Health. Practice metrics were collected for impact on clinic volumes, institutional recovery techniques, and task force development to address COVID-19 specific issues. Neuro-Oncology divisions reached >67% of pre-pandemic capacity (patient visits and slot utilization) within 3-weeks and returned to >90% capacity within 6-weeks of initial closures due to COVID-19. The two health systems rapidly and effectively implemented telehealth practices to recover patient volumes. While telemedicine will not replace the in-person clinical visit, telemedicine will likely continue to be an integral part of neuro-oncologic care. Telemedicine has potential for expanding access in remote areas and provides a convenient alternative to patients with limited mobility, transportation, or other socioeconomic complexities that otherwise challenge patient visit adherence.","Fonkem, Ekokobe; Gatson, Na Tosha; Tadipatri, Ramya; Azadi, Amir",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650323/,779
44226,Rocuronium bromide: Hypoxia: 2 case reports,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: In 2020, Med Learning Group (MLG) launched an interactive, multi-faceted educational initiative focusing on COVID-19. The innovative education & tools developed for FRONTLINE are publicly available for the entire healthcare community to use. Learners range from a variety of specialties, including infectious disease specialists, pulmonary medicine specialists, emergency room practitioners, advanced practitioners, nurses, & other healthcare professionals to help support them in their effort to optimize care of patients with COVID-19. MLG partnered with Health Resources & Services Administration, Project ECHO, Public Health Foundation & community, VA & academic centers to create a collaborative network with shared goals for education. METHODS: This initiative seeks to reach over 25,000 learners with innovative educational programs & tools to enhance the learning experience, facilitate continuous learning & support the translation of education into practice, & encourage HCP-patient dialogue: • COVID Community of Care Website/Application • COVID Frontline Update Podcast Series • Virtual/Live ECHO Series with 3D animations of pathophysiology • Enduring ECHO Module with Case Discussions • Quality Improvement Personalized Posters RESULTS: By September 2020, we will have the results from pre/posttests, intra-activity Q&A, evaluations, & 60- to 90-day follow-on assessments. We will evaluate learners’ changes in knowledge & competence, & reported practice changes. In addition, MLG will have feedback collected via surveys & interviews on the various point-of-care tools. Based off previous MLG educational initiatives, it is expected that learners will find value in the various tools available in this programming. CONCLUSION: Advanced tools like virtual live learning platforms, mobile websites/apps, 3D animations & podcasts will prove to be an asset to the continuing education of HCPs treating patients with COVID-19. The outcomes are expected to demonstrate the extent to which HCPs have enhanced their ability to identify clinical predictors of disease severity of COVID-19 & apply current treatment guidelines, clinical trial data, & patient-specific factors to the management of patients with COVID-19.

44227,Ceftriaxone/levofloxacin/lopinavir/ritonavir: Thrombocytopenia following off-label use: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Journal clubs have been a mainstay of medical education since the days of Osler. Social media platforms allow virtual journal clubs to connect global participants. We describe the creation and impact of #IDJClub, an Infectious Diseases (ID) Twitter journal club. METHODS: We launched #IDJClub in October 2019. The format presents a recent ID publication for a 1-hour synchronous Twitter chat led by an ID physician from @IDJClub. Sessions started monthly, but increased in frequency due to interest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-scripted tweets guide participants through the article description and analysis. We used Symplur’s Healthcare Hashtag project to track the number of impressions, tweets, participants, and the engagement rate (average tweets/participant) of #IDJClub per 60 minute discussion plus the following 30 minutes to capture ongoing conversations. We also conducted an online anonymous survey using Likert scales and open-ended questions to assess educational impact. RESULTS: As of June 11 2020, @IDJClub garnered 5,338 followers from around the world (Figure 1). In its first 9 months, 12 virtual journal clubs were conducted with a mean of 791,624 impressions, 328 tweets, and 48 participants per session, which steadily increased over time (Figure 2). A total of 134 participants completed the survey, of whom 40% were ID physicians, 19% pharmacists, 13% ID fellows, and 10% medical residents. Most respondents followed 1–2 (38%) or 3–4 (38%) of the discussions, with variable levels of active participation. Majorities agreed that #IDJClub provided clinically useful knowledge, increased personal confidence in review of literature, and compared favorably with in-person journal clubs (Figure 3). The format addressed several barriers such as lack of access to in-person journal clubs or subject experts at one’s own institution and lack of time to read new research or attend traditional journal clubs (Figure 4). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: #IDJClub is an effective platform for virtual journal club, providing an engaging, open-access tool for critical appraisal of ID literature.

44246,Multiple drugs: Venous thromboembolism and lack of efficacy: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Elevated D-dimer level is frequently seen in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The potential benefit of systemic anticoagulation in COVID-19 has been suggested, but data lack on when to initiate anticoagulation. We aimed to identify a cut-off value of D-dimer at which anticoagulation may provide mortality benefit in COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted for a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a 262-bed community hospital in a Washington D.C. suburb. Patients hospitalized between April 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included if d-dimer levels were checked during hospitalization. Demographics, laboratory results, and hospital courses were reviewed. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between anticoagulation and in-hospital mortality, controlling for the d-dimer value. The association was examined in subgroups with different d-dimer cut-offs. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to assess if the association between anticoagulation and mortality remains after adjusting for other mortality risk factors. RESULTS: 101 patients were included in the study and 32 (31.7%) died during hospitalization. The average age was 61.2 ± 14.8 years old and 50.5% were males. Older age, male sex, hypertension, and peak d-dimer level were associated with mortality in univariable analysis (p< 0.05). For patients with peak d-dimer level >3mcg/mL, anticoagulation use was associated with lower mortality after controlling for the d-dimer level (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06–0.97 p=0.045). This association weakened after adjusting for age, sex, and hypertension. (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07–1.46, p=0.143). For patients with peak d-dimer level >5 mcg/mL, anticoagulation use was associated with lower mortality after controlling for the d-dimer level (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02–0.68, p=0.017) and this association remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and hypertension (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.86, p=0.035). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a d-dimer level higher than 5 mcg/mL, anticoagulation use was independently associated with lower mortality.

44249,Durvalumab/everolimus: Lung toxicity and pulmonary sarcoidosis: 2 case reports,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of patients with severe COVID-19 infection can be protracted and deteriorate to ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction with prolonged fever. As such, there is clinical overlap with many infectious diseases especially those that cause pneumonia. Due to of the prevalence of COVID-19 illness amidst the pandemic, concerns about testing sensitivity and the attendant risk to health care personnel (HCP) delivering care, patients are frequently tested multiple times to ascertain that they are SARS-CoV-2 free. Often, alternative diagnoses are not considered because some diagnostic modalities—such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)—pose an unacceptable risk to the patient and/or HCP. METHODS: We interrogated plasma for microbial cell-free DNA from 58 patients who were known to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Clinical information is taken from information submitted with the test requisition or obtained at the time of result reporting from clinical consultations with the ordering provider. In each case, a plasma sample was analyzed with the Karius Test (KT) which is a CLIA certified/CAP-accredited next-generation sequencing (NGS) plasma test designed to detect and quantify circulating microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA), which can assist with the diagnosis of deep-seated infections. After mcfDNA is extracted and NGS performed, human reads are removed and remaining sequences are aligned to a curated database of >1400 organisms. Organisms present above a statistical threshold are reported. The time to result is on average 24 hours from sample receipt. RESULTS: In a subset of 20 samples, we found a broad range of pathogens. Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common. These detections were unexpected in the majority of these patients. (see Table) Broad range of Karius detected pathogens (including fastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi and viruses) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Open-ended, plasma-based NGS for mcfDNA with the KT provides a rapid, non-invasive method to diagnose deep-seated infection like pneumonia. This broad-based test detected a wide range of pathogens – many unsuspected – in patients with severe pneumonia and other invasive infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. These detections highlight the utility of the tool; which allowed better management including de-escalation of SARS-CoV-2 testing and selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy for the unexpected diagnoses.

44387,Multiple drugs: Rectal bleeding and off label use: case report,2021-01-09,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition causing pain, physical disability, and reduced quality of life. Exercise and patient education are non-pharmacological interventions for knee OA unanimously recommended as first-line treatments based on extensive research evidence. However, none of the numerous randomised controlled trials of exercise and education for knee OA has used adequate sham/placebo comparison groups because the ‘active’ ingredients are unknown. Designing and executing an adequate and ‘blindable placebo’ version of an exercise and education intervention is impossible. Therefore, using an open-label study design, this trial compares the efficacy of a widely used ‘state-of-art’ exercise and education intervention (Good Life with osteoarthritis in Denmark; GLAD) with presumably inert intra-articular saline injections on improvement in knee pain in patients with knee OA. METHODS: In this open-label randomised trial, we will include 200 patients with radiographically verified OA of the knee and randomly allocate them to one of two interventions: (i) 8 weeks of exercise and education (GLAD) or (ii) Intra-articular injections of 5 ml isotonic saline every second week for a total of 4 injections. Outcomes are taken at baseline, after 8 weeks of treatment (week 9; primary endpoint) and after an additional 4 weeks of follow-up (week 12). The primary outcome is change from baseline in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaire (KOOS) pain subscale score. Secondary outcomes include the Physical function in Activities of Daily Living, Symptoms, and Knee-related Quality of Life subscales of the KOOS, the patients’ global assessment of disease impact, physical performance tests, and presence of knee joint swelling. DISCUSSION: This current trial compares a presumably active treatment (GLAD) with a presumably inert treatment (IA saline injections). Both study interventions have well-established and anticipated similar effects on knee OA symptoms, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The interpretation of the results of this trial will likely be difficult and controversial but will contribute to a better understanding of the bias introduced in the effect estimation of classically unblindable exercise and education interventions for knee OA.

Common causes of anemia include poor nutrition, infections, malaria, HIV, and treatments for HIV. We conducted a secondary analysis to study the prevalence of and associated risk factors for anemia in women to elucidate the intersection of HIV and anemia using data from 3 cycles of Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) conducted in 2005, 2010, and 2015. METHODS: DHS design comprises of a two-stage cluster-sampling to monitor and evaluate indicators for population health. A field hemoglobin test was conducted in eligible women. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dL in pregnant women; < 12.0 in nonpregnant women. Chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression analysis accounting for complex survey design were used to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with anemia. RESULTS: Prevalence (95% confidence interval (CI)) of anemia was 37.8(35.9–39.7), 28.2(26.9–29.5), 27.8(26.5–29.1) in 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively. Approximately 9.4, 7.2, and 6.1%, of women had moderate anemia; (Hgb 7–9.9) while 1.0, 0.7, and 0.6% of women had severe anemia (Hgb < 7 g/dL)), in 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively. Risk factors associated with anemia included HIV (HIV+: 2005: OR (95% CI) = 2.40(2.03–2.74), 2010: 2.35(1.99–2.77), and 2015: 2.48(2.18–2.83)]; Residence in 2005 and 2010 [(2005: 1.33(1.08–1.65), 2010: 1.26(1.03–1.53)]; Pregnant or breastfeeding women [2005: 1.31(1.16–1.47), 2010: 1.23(1.09–1.34)]; not taking iron supplementation [2005: 1.17(1.03–1.33), 2010: 1.23(1.09–1.40), and2015: 1.24(1.08–1.42)]. Masvingo, Matebeleland South, and Bulawayo provinces had the highest burden of anemia across the three DHS Cycles. Manicaland and Mashonaland East had the lowest burden. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anemia in Zimbabwe declined between 2005 and 2015 but provinces of Matebeleland South and Bulawayo were hot spots with little or no change HIV positive women had higher prevalence than HIV negative women. The multidimensional causes and drivers of anemia in women require an integrated approach to help ameliorate anemia and its negative health effects on the women’s health. Prevention strategies such as promoting iron-rich food and food fortification, providing universal iron supplementation targeting lowveld provinces and women with HIV, pregnant or breastfeeding are required.","Gona, Philimon N.; Gona, Clara M.; Chikwasha, Vasco; Haruzivishe, Clara; Mapoma, Chabila C.; Rao, Sowmya R.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787417/,779

This holds promise for glioblastomas (GBMs), the most common primary tumors of the adult brain, which are resistant to standard-of-care therapy. Although most clinical trials enroll patients at recurrence, most preclinical studies have been done with specimens from primary disease. There are limited expression data from GBMs at recurrence and surprisingly little is known about the evolution of splicing patterns under therapy. RESULT: We profile 37 primary-recurrent paired human GBM specimens via RNA sequencing. We describe the landscape of alternative splicing in GBM at recurrence and contrast that to primary and non-malignant brain-tissue specimens. By screening single-cell atlases, we identify cell-type-specific splicing patterns and novel splicing events in cell-surface proteins that are suitable targets for engineered T cell therapies. We identify recurrent-specific isoforms of mitogen-activated kinase pathway genes that enhance invasiveness and are preferentially expressed by stem-like cells. CONCLUSION: These studies shed light on gene expression in recurrent GBM and identify novel targets for therapeutic development.

I discuss with my own lived experience of surviving COVID-19 as the basis for how the event of a crisis brings into focus hope’s undecidable, ontological nature, thus shattering everyday presumptions about hope as located elsewhere than the here and now in what I call either imagineered prostalgia or salvaged and recycled nostalgia. I also discuss the challenge of the suicidal moment to the idea that hope is ontological. I close with a suggested link to various kinds of pandemics, either virally infective or racially oppressive or genocidal, in the shared, ontological nature of breath as hope, dum spiro spero, where, as I breathe, I hope. I note how this ontology of breath as hope, whether as ruach, pneuma, prana, qi, alruwh, or roho, is incomparably and ontically unique in both the different kinds of asphyxiations faced of breath and in what each is trying to breathe. My hope is that by knowing hope is ontological and inherent to existence, even in despair, and neither coupled to imagineered prostalgia nor salvaged and recycled nostalgia, that one can embrace life as is, knowing we gasp even when we cannot breathe.","DuBose, Todd",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847226/,779

After cancelling exams, they sought teacher estimates on their grades, but supported an algorithm to standardise the results. When the results produced a public outcry over unfair consequences, they initially defended their decision but reverted quickly to teacher assessment. We explain these developments by comparing two ‘windows of opportunity’ overseen by four separate governments, in which the definition of the problem, feasibility of each solution, and motive of policymakers to select one over the other lurched dramatically within a week of the exams results. These experiences highlight the confluence of events and choices and the timing and order of choice. A policy solution that had been rejected during the first window, and would have been criticised heavily if chosen first, became a lifeline during the second. As such, while it is important to understand why the standardisation process went so wrong, we focus on why the policymaking process went so wrong.

48445,Multiple drugs: Off label use and lack of efficacy: case report,2021-03-20,"Current infrastructures in modern cities are highly dependent on complex software-intensive systems, which are composed of many elements, including software, sensors, actuators, and processes. Citizens and managers are also important stakeholders in these systems, as they provide data, provide and retrieve information and also manage the many systems that control the city infrastructures’. UML has been often considered for designing these types of systems, mostly with focus only on designing the software elements of the system. However, these infrastructures systems are composed of many more elements than software, including processes, constraints, sensors, networks, laws and further documents. SysML is a UML profile that has gained attention in past years, as SysML also models systems elements that are not software. In this paper, the main idea is to describe a SysML profile for modeling smart cities applications, which is useful as it specifies common elements of a city as native elements of system design. The profile, named SmartCitySysML, extended from SysML Requirements, Sequence and Block Definition diagrams in order to model system and software elements for smart cities. Design of a road traffic control system regarding a group of intersections is used as a case study. As a result, SmartCitySysML facilitates the use of common elements in smart city infrastructures and provides a visual representation to assess quality of diagrams from a practical point of view.","Souza, Layse Santos; Misra, Sanjay; Soares, Michel S.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974970/,779

The procedure is quite slow and cumbersome, and some patients may not be able to pursue the final test results and diagnosis. The method in this paper comprises many fact-finding and data-mining methods. Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic were fussed together in emerging the Coactive Neuro-Fuzzy Expert System diagnostic tool. The authors conducted oral interviews with the medical practitioners whose knowledge were captured into the knowledge based of the Fuzzy Expert System. Neuro-Fuzzy expert system diagnostic software was implemented with Microsoft Visual C# (C Sharp) programming language and Microsoft SQL Server 2012 to manage the database. Questionnaires were administered to the patients and filled by the medical practitioners on behalf of the patients to capture the prevailing symptoms. The study demonstrated the practical application of neuro-fuzzy method in diagnosis of malaria. The hybrid learning rule has greatly enhanced the proposed system performance when compared with existing systems where only the back-propagation learning rule were used for implementation. It was concluded that the diagnostic expert system developed is as accurate as that of the medical experts in decision making.

A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in atrial remodeling and its clinical correlations especially with atrial fibrillation (AF) and other cardiometabolic comorbidities may induce a significant impact on the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic approach of ACM-related comorbidities. Although initially described several decades ago, investigators have only recently highlighted that several renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases are determining factors for atrial remodeling and subsequent ACM. Based on data from multiple recent studies, our research emphasizes the correlations between ACM and other coexisting pathologies including cardiovascular, respiratory, or metabolic diseases, with fibrosis being the most incriminated pathophysiological mechanism. In addition to the usual tests, the paraclinical assessment of ACM is increasingly based on the use of various cardiac biomarkers, while the cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has become an increasingly tempting diagnostic too for describing morphofunctional aspects of the heart chambers, with the gadolinium contrast enhanced CMR (LGE-CMR) emerging as a commonly used technique aiming to identify and quantify the precise extent of atrial fibrosis.

Examples include adaptive airbag deployment systems, hypersonic vehicles, and active blast mitigation systems. Given their critical functions, accurate and fast modeling tools are necessary for ensuring the target performance. However, the unique characteristics of these systems, which consist of (1) large uncertainties in the external loads, (2) high levels of non-stationarities and heavy disturbances, and (3) unmodeled dynamics generated from changes in system configurations, in combination with the fast-changing environments, limit the applicability of physical modeling tools. In this paper, a deep learning algorithm is used to model high-rate systems and predict their response measurements. It consists of an ensemble of short-sequence long short-term memory (LSTM) cells which are concurrently trained. To empower multi-step ahead predictions, a multi-rate sampler is designed to individually select the input space of each LSTM cell based on local dynamics extracted using the embedding theorem. The proposed algorithm is validated on experimental data obtained from a high-rate system. Results showed that the use of the multi-rate sampler yields better feature extraction from non-stationary time series compared with a more heuristic method, resulting in significant improvement in step ahead prediction accuracy and horizon. The lean and efficient architecture of the algorithm results in an average computing time of 25 [Formula: see text] s, which is below the maximum prediction horizon, therefore demonstrating the algorithm’s promise in real-time high-rate applications.","Barzegar, Vahid; Laflamme, Simon; Hu, Chao; Dodson, Jacob",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8001144/,779

51253,Lopinavir/ritonavir: Lichen planus following off-label use: case report,2021-04-03,"▀ Ravaged by the pandemic, 2020 likely saw the UK economy suffer its steepest fall in GDP in more than three centuries. But we expect 2021 to see a strong recovery, pushing the UK close to the top of advanced economy (AE) growth rankings. Four themes will shape UK prospects this year: ▀ 1. Speedy vaccine rollout will allow a rapid lifting of Covid‐related restrictions. The government plans to vaccinate all vulnerable groups by the end of Q1. This should allow a meaningful relaxation of social distancing restrictions from Q2, triggering a strong, consumer‐led, recovery. ▀ 2. Services will outperform industry. 2020 was a rare year when industry has fared better than services. But the lifting of social distancing restrictions should spark a strong revival in sectors relying on social consumption. Industry will also be more heavily affected by the introduction of the new UK‐EU trading relationship, with increased costs and supply‐chain disruption likely. ▀ 3. Policymakers will stay on the accelerator. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already loosened the fiscal stance by 2% of GDP this year relative to pre‐pandemic plans, and we think chances of more support are greater than of premature tightening. Similarly, the BoE has already committed to £150bn worth of gilt purchases this year, and the MPC's bias is towards further loosening, even though base effects will likely push inflation back to target by end‐2021. ▀ 4. Brexit will remain in the news, particularly in early‐2021. Notwithstanding the UK‐EU trade deal, the realities of life outside the single market and customs union will quickly become apparent in the early part of this year. Goods trade between the UK and EU will take longer and involve a substantial increase in bureaucracy.

To fight against the spread of this virus, clinical image analysis of chest CT (computed tomography) images can play an important role for an accurate diagnostic. In the present work, a bi-modular hybrid model is proposed to detect COVID-19 from the chest CT images. In the first module, we have used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the chest CT images. In the second module, we have used a bi-stage feature selection (FS) approach to find out the most relevant features for the prediction of COVID and non-COVID cases from the chest CT images. At the first stage of FS, we have applied a guided FS methodology by employing two filter methods: Mutual Information (MI) and Relief-F, for the initial screening of the features obtained from the CNN model. In the second stage, Dragonfly algorithm (DA) has been used for the further selection of most relevant features. The final feature set has been used for the classification of the COVID-19 and non-COVID chest CT images using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed model has been tested on two open-access datasets: SARS-CoV-2 CT images and COVID-CT datasets and the model shows substantial prediction rates of 98.39% and 90.0% on the said datasets respectively.

The aim of the present study was to determine the usefulness of such hematological indicators for assessment of the relationship between inflammation and oxidative stress in order to provide new predictive tools for a non-invasive investigation of disease outcome for liver cirrhosis patients. A total of 35 subjects with compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, patients with toxic metabolic cirrhosis due to ethanol consumption; group 2, patients with liver cirrhosis following hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Using hematological data obtained after the complete counting of peripheral blood cells, the monocyte/lymphocyte (MLR), neutrophil/lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte (PLR) ratios as well as systemic immune inflammation biomarkers were determined. The erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and biochemical parameters related to liver function were also registered. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyl content (PCARB), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were also investigated in the peripheral blood samples of healthy subjects and liver cirrhosis patients. The results revealed that NLR, MLR and PLR were significantly increased in group 2. PLR was significantly increased in group 1 compared with that noted in the control group. TBARS and PCARB were increased in patients from group 1 compared to patients from group 2 and the control group. However, no difference in TAC was found between the liver cirrhosis groups and the control. We showed that the pro-inflammatory status of liver cirrhosis patients can be easily appreciated by NLR, MLR but not PLR. However, the increase in these ratios was not significantly associated with a decrease in the antioxidant capacity and an augmentation of oxidative stress markers for the patients diagnosed with cirrhosis included in the two groups of study.","Pomacu, Mihnea Marian; Trașcă, Maria Diana; Pădureanu, Vlad; Bugă, Ana Maria; Andrei, Ana Marina; Stănciulescu, Elena Camelia; Baniță, Ileana Monica; Rădulescu, Dumitru; Pisoschi, Cătălina Gabriela",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082585/,779

52560,Multiple drugs: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-05-08,"High prevalence of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in COVID-19 patients was reported by several studies. Since VD is a key regulating factor of both innate and adaptive immunity, it was hypothesized that VD deficiency may predispose to SARS-CoV-2 infection and lower levels of VD could be related to increased COVID-19 severity and worse outcome risks. However, to date, only few studies partially investigated the relationship between VD and inflammatory and immune response and clinical features of COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of vitamin D levels on COVID-19 inflammatory activity, clinical pattern and disease severity. Patients admitted to San Raffaele University Hospital for COVID-19 from February 2020 were enrolled in this study. We excluded patients with comorbidities and therapies influencing VD metabolism. 25OH-Vitamin D levels were evaluated at admission in hospital and VD insufficiency and deficiency were defined as VD level below 30 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL, respectively. A total of 88 patients were included in the study. Median (IQR) VD levels were 16.3 (11.2–23.9) ng/mL. VD insufficiency and deficiency were found in 88.6% and in 68.2% of patients, respectively. Linear regression analyses showed a positive correlation between VD levels and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p=0.019; r=0.254), and negative correlations between VD levels and Neutrophil/Lymphocyte (N/L) ratio (p=0.04; r=-0.19), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p=0.047; r=-0.18) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (p=0.04; r=-0.22). Lower VD levels were found in patients affected by severe disease (needs for high-flow oxygen therapy and/or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, admitted to ICU and/or dead) than non-severe patients (13.4 ng/mL [10.37–19.15] vs 18.45 ng/mL [15.15–24.95]; p=0.007). Moreover, patients with VD deficiency had higher levels of CRP, LDH, IL-6, IFN-gamma (p=0.04, p=0.01, p=0.002, p=0.04; respectively), lower PaO2/FiO2 and higher N/L ratios (p=0.008, p=0.004; respectively), and higher rate of severe disease (65% vs 39%, p=0.02), as compared to VD non-deficient ones. In conclusion, low VD levels are widely found in hospitalized COVID-19 and may lead to increased disease severity through an excessive immune-inflammatory response. Our data suggest that reaching adequate vitamin D levels in risky population may contribute to prevention of COVID-19 occurrence and severity.","Filippo, Luigi di; Allora, Agnese; Doga, Mauro; Querini, Patrizia Rovere; Locatelli, Massimo; Frara, Stefano; Giustina, Andrea",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090264/,779

This study investigates the effect of coronavirus and our department’s response on 30-day mortality for patients admitted with NOF fractures. METHOD: Data from 65 fractured NOF admissions (22(nd) March - 24(th) May 2020) was compared with 62 patients from the same period in 2019. Binary logistic regression was used to explore 30-day mortality; accounting for differences in ASA, anaesthetic type, anticoagulation status, surgery type, age, time to surgery and year of admission. RESULTS: The odds of 30-day mortality was statistically significantly higher in patients who were suspected/confirmed COVID-19 positive (n = 10),(OR 2.39, 95%CI (1.60-74.13)). In COVID-19 negative patients (n = 55), the odds of 30-day mortality was lower in 2020, and approached statistical significance (0.232, 95%CI (0.053-1.02)), compared to the same period in 2019. Median length of stay (LOS) in patients who survived was 11 days in 2020 and 15.5 days in 2019 (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a COVID-19 diagnosis significantly increases the 30-day mortality in patients with a fractured NOF.

Here, a computational engine was developed to predict the features of AFPs and reveal the most important 39 features for AFP identification, such as antifreeze-like/N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase C-terminal, insect AFP motif, C-type lectin-like, and EGF-like domain. With this newly presented computational method, a group of previously confirmed functional AFP motifs was screened out. This study has identified some potential new AFP motifs and contributes to understanding biological antifreeze mechanisms.","Zhang, Yu-Hang; Li, Zhandong; Lu, Lin; Zeng, Tao; Chen, Lei; Li, Hao; Huang, Tao; Cai, Yu-Dong",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226703/,779

We still view the pandemic as being disinflationary and expect the low inflation/low yield environment of the past decade to persist. ▀ The US looks set for an even bigger fiscal boost than we had expected a month ago, and its GDP growth is now seen at 7.0% this year. We expect the full $1.9trn of fiscal measures to be passed, rather than the $1.3trn package previously assumed. Strong US demand and a fall in global Covid cases bode well for the world economy. ▀ However, a growing concern is that the ongoing substantial global fiscal support, combined with the release of pent‐up demand as restrictions are eased, may cause a sustained pick‐up in inflation. Although we expect some factors, many of which are a direct consequence of the pandemic, and rising oil prices to lead to higher headline inflation in the short term, we do not see a sustained overshoot of inflation targets. ▀ First, fiscal policy is expected to be a bit tighter at a global level this year than in 2020 and, while households have built up large stocks of savings over the past year, the unwind is likely to be gradual and a large share of these unplanned savings may be permanently saved rather than spent. ▀ Second, we do not see a strong argument why higher costs and inflation in the short term will lead to an inflationary spiral. Workers are in no position to push up wages in response to the near‐term rise in inflation. And while some sectors that have seen surges in demand during the pandemic may be able to pass on higher costs and even expand their margins, this will be offset by weaker price pressures among the sectoral losers from the pandemic. ▀ Although a rise in bond yields from their record lows seems justified, we doubt central banks will come under pressure to raise policy rates any time soon to contain inflation.",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250897/,779

The increase in the information available has paved the way to carry out more innovative and varied human studies. Efforts have focused on the search for a safe and effective treatment to stimulate neuro-regeneration in the brain and to reduce the sequelae of stroke in patients. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the clinical trials using cell therapy to treat stroke published to date and assess their limitations. From 2000 to date, most of the published clinical trials have focused on phases I or II, and the vast majority of them demonstrate that stem cells are essentially safe to use when administered by different routes, with transient and mild adverse events that do not generally have severe consequences for health. In general, there is considerable variation in the trials in terms of statistical design, sample size, the cells used, the routes of administration, and the functional assessments (both at baseline and follow-up), making it difficult to compare the studies. From this general description, possibly the experimental protocol is the main element to improve in future studies. Establishing an adequate experimental and statistical design will be essential to obtain favorable and reliable results when conducting phase III clinical trials. Thus, it is necessary to standardize the criteria used in these clinical trials in order to aid comparison. Shortly, cell therapy will be a key approach in the treatment of stroke if adequate and comprehensive levels of recovery are to be achieved.","Rascón-Ramírez, Fernando José; Esteban-García, Noelia; Barcia, Juan Antonio; Trondin, Albert; Nombela, Cristina; Sánchez-Sánchez-Rojas, Leyre",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260969/,779

Therefore, developing an effective vaccine capable of inducing the strong humoral and cellular immune responses necessary to block the pre-erythrocytic stage has potential to overcome the spatiotemporal hindrances pertaining to parasite biology and hepatic microanatomy. We recently showed that when combined with a human adenovirus type 5 (AdHu5)-priming vaccine, adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) is a potent booster malaria vaccine vector capable of inducing strong and long-lasting protective immune responses in a rodent malaria model. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy of a hepatotropic virus, adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8), as a booster vector because it can deliver a transgene potently and rapidly to the liver, the organ malaria sporozoites initially infect and multiply in following sporozoite injection by the bite of an infected mosquito. We first generated an AAV8-vectored vaccine expressing P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of AAV8-PfCSP to mice initially primed with AdHu5-PfCSP resulted in a hepatocyte transduction rate ~2.5 times above that seen with intramuscular (i.m.) administration. This immunization regimen provided a better protection rate (100% sterile protection) than that of the i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.m. AAV8-boost regimen (60%, p < 0.05), i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.v. AAV1-boost (78%), or i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.m. AAV1-boost (80%) against challenge with transgenic PfCSP-expressing P. berghei sporozoites. Compared with the i.m. AdHu5-prime/i.v. AAV1-boost regimen, three other regimens induced higher levels of PfCSP-specific humoral immune responses. Importantly, a single i.v. dose of AAV8-PfCSP recruited CD8(+) T cells, especially resident memory CD8(+) T cells, in the liver. These data suggest that boost with i.v. AAV8-PfCSP can improve humoral and cellular immune responses in BALB/c mice. Therefore, this regimen holds great promise as a next-generation platform for the development of an effective malaria vaccine.","Shahnaij, Mohammad; Iyori, Mitsuhiro; Mizukami, Hiroaki; Kajino, Mayu; Yamagoshi, Iroha; Syafira, Intan; Yusuf, Yenni; Fujiwara, Ken; Yamamoto, Daisuke S.; Kato, Hirotomo; Ohno, Nobuhiko; Yoshida, Shigeto",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8261234/,779

The prominent applications include decision-making, pattern recognition, clustering analysis, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we introduce a new correlation coefficient for picture fuzzy sets with the justification of its advantages. This correlation coefficient is better than the existing correlation coefficients and other such measures in the picture fuzzy theory because it considers the picture fuzzy set as a whole and also expresses the nature (positive or negative) as well as the extent of association between two PFSs. By performing some comparative analysis based on the computation of correlation degree and linguistic hedges, we establish the effectiveness of the suggested correlation measure over some available correlation measures in a picture fuzzy environment. Further, in the context of pattern recognition, we examine the performance of the proposed correlation measure over some existing picture fuzzy correlation measures.

A few researchers have developed frameworks to better explain wasteful behaviors away from home, however a comprehensive interpretation of the phenomenon giving indications for maps/guidelines for the foodservice managers has not been carried out. In this paper, as a result of a thematic literature review, the Restaurant Food Waste Map (RFWM) was designed to describe the phases in which the food waste phenomenon occurs, and to identify mitigation activities of food waste generation processes. The proposed map is aimed to describe three phases in which the food waste phenomenon occurs: (1) kitchen food preparation, (2) food service, and (3) clients’ consumption. Moreover, the present map highlights the approaches that restaurants could take into consideration to better manage the food waste: (1) prevention, (2) reduction, and (3) reuse/redistribution of food waste. These approaches set out guidance on the preferred methods of dealing with food waste so as to minimize its impact on the environment and society. The present study provides literature knowledge about food waste management at the restaurant level, and highlights some practical implications.

To date, little is known about the role of self-help in promoting health literacy among its members during the Corona pandemic. METHODS: “The Health Literacy of Self-Help group members: Challenges of the Corona-pandemic (GeMSe(HeCo))” study is based on a qualitative study design. Field access was provided by self-help advocacy groups throughout Germany. For this purpose, telephone interviews were conducted from July–October 2020 with N = 19 representatives of self-help groups, transcribed and content-analyzed. RESULTS: Self-help group representatives reported strengths and weaknesses in members’ use of health information during the Corona pandemic. Weaknesses were reported primarily among older members, those with low levels of education, and those with immigrant backgrounds. Strengths were observed by the representatives among long-term members and among members who continuously educate themselves about their disease. DISCUSSION: Self-help groups are perceived as providing important support to members in dealing with health information during the Corona pandemic. One particular benefit to members is the self-help group’s review and compilation of health information according to individual needs. Challenges can arise due to difficulties in German language and understanding, e.g., as a result of a migration background. The expansion of digital offers has proven helpful during this time. In this context, support should increasingly consider older members and members with low financial means, as they have less access to digital offers especially during the Corona pandemic.","Kogel, Lisa Marie; Steeb, Natalie; Rathmann, Katharina",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8311402/,779

The emergence of infections especially caused by arboviruses can be linked to several mechanisms which include geographical expansion linked to human development and transportation, global warming, enhanced transmission in peridomestic area and close proximity of human habitations to domestic as well as wild animals. The co-circulation of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika is a matter of public health priority due to the fact that they are transmitted by the same vector as well as increase in the number of reported cases of severe dengue, post-chikungunya chronic joint disease and microcephaly related to Zika virus disease. The study was designed to estimate the prevalence of these arboviral infections in Odisha. About 5198 cases presenting with common clinical symptoms of fever, arthralgia, headache, myalgia and malaise were screened during 2016–2019. A total of 42.2% patients tested positive for dengue NS1 antigen (n = 4154), 30.2% for dengue IgM (n = 2161) and 14.3% for chikungunya IgM (n = 1816). A total of 1684 samples were subjected to Zika RT-PCR and none was tested positive. Peak in the numbers of dengue/ chikungunya cases was evident in the post-monsoon months of July – October. Circulation of all four serotypes of dengue i.e. DEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 was noticed in the state. Molecular investigation of suspected Chik cases in early phases showed circulation of Eastern Central Southern African genotype (E1:226A). There is dearth of knowledge about disease severity during arbovirus co-infections and importance of adequate management of patients at an early stage residing in risk areas. It is the first study in Odisha to study the pattern and status of these three arboviral diseases Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) regarding sexual health are lacking in this intervention, or have not been validated in transgender patients. METHODS: A community advisory board of transgender women informed an anonymous online survey utilizing PROs for those who were contemplative of (pre-) and post-vaginoplasty. They were recruited on online platforms not associated with an individual institution. Survey measures included the Female Genital Self-Image Scale (FGSIS) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sexual health measures. Welch approximation t-tests were performed for FGSIS and PROMIS questions using Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: 687 transgender patients pre-vaginoplasty (n = 522, 76%) and post-vaginoplasty (n = 165, 24%) responded. In PROMIS measures, the postoperative cohort reported higher ability to orgasm (p = 0.0003), satisfaction with sex life (p = 0.001), pleasure in sex life (p = 0.002), use of lubricant (p < 0.0001), and scar interfere with sexual satisfaction (p < 0.0001). FGSIS total score was higher among postoperative patients (27.8 ± 6.0) than preoperative patients (17.8 ± 5.3) (p < 0.0001). Using Spearman’s rho, no significant correlation between FGSIS total score and any PROMIS sub-sectional measures was observed for either cohort. 193 patients (133 preoperative, 60 postoperative) reported their responses about sex being influenced by the Covid-19 crisis. CONCLUSION: Patients who are contemplating vaginoplasty have worse sexual health and genital self-image than those who have had vaginoplasty. FGSIS scores did not correlate with PROMIS sexual health measures when controlling for prior vaginoplasty, demonstrating that sexual health is multimodal for each individual patient.","Isabella Kloer, Carmen; Blasdel, Gaines; Shakir, Nabeel; Zhao, Lee; Bluebond-Langner, Rachel",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8312807/,779

One of the main issues related to fNIRS applications is the motion artefact removal, since a corrupted physiological signal is not correctly indicative of the underlying biological process. A novel procedure for motion artifact correction for fNIRS signals based on wavelet transform and video tracking developed for infrared thermography (IRT) is presented. In detail, fNIRS and IRT were concurrently recorded and the optodes’ movement was estimated employing a video tracking procedure developed for IRT recordings. The wavelet transform of the fNIRS signal and of the optodes’ movement, together with their wavelet coherence, were computed. Then, the inverse wavelet transform was evaluated for the fNIRS signal excluding the frequency content corresponding to the optdes’ movement and to the coherence in the epochs where they were higher with respect to an established threshold. The method was tested using simulated functional hemodynamic responses added to real resting-state fNIRS recordings corrupted by movement artifacts. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedure in eliminating noise, producing results with higher signal to noise ratio with respect to another validated method.","Perpetuini, David; Cardone, Daniela; Filippini, Chiara; Chiarelli, Antonio Maria; Merla, Arcangelo",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346954/,779

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded labial salivary gland (LSG) slides from 20 female SS patients and their clinical and LSG pathology data were obtained from the Sjögren’s International Collaborative Clinical Alliance. Relative interstitial fibrosis area (RIFA) in Masson’s trichrome-stained LSG sections was quantified from digitally scanned slides and used for correlation analysis. Gene expression levels were assessed by microarray analysis. Core promoter accessibility for RIFA-correlated genes was determined using DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing analysis. RESULTS: RIFA was significantly correlated with unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in SS patients. Sixteen genes were significantly and positively correlated with RIFA. In a separate analysis, a group of differentially expressed genes was identified by comparing severe and moderate fibrosis groups. This combined set of genes was distinct from differentially expressed genes identified in lung epithelium from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients compared with controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of salivary glands suggested most of the RIFA-correlated genes are expressed by fibroblasts in the gland and are in a permissive chromatin state. CONCLUSION: RIFA quantification is a novel method for assessing interstitial fibrosis and the impact of fibrosis on SS symptoms. Loss of gland function may be associated with salivary gland fibrosis, which is likely to be driven by a unique set of genes that are mainly expressed by fibroblasts.","Yin, Hongen; Pranzatelli, Thomas J.

DESIGN: An observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nephrology department and Biochemistry and molecular biology department, faculty of medicine, Cairo University. PATIENTS: A total of 256 CRF patients on HD for at least six months (162 male and 103 female) and 160 healthy subjects (122 male and 38 female) were recruited in the current study after signing a consent form. ACE G2350A (rs4343) Insertion/Deletion (I/D) was tested, the association between ACE G2350A (RS4343) gene polymorphisms and patients response to rHuEpo was evaluated. RESULTS: ACE G2350A (rs4343) I/D was the most prevalent genotype, while I/I genotype was the lowest prevalent among patient or control subjects included in the study. D allele is the most prevalent allele, either among patients or the control group. Hemoglobin (Hb) level in patients with I/I and Deletion/Deletion (D/D) genotype was significantly higher compared to those with I/D genotype (P = 0.012 and P = 0.005, respectively). Serum iron in the I/D genotype was significantly higher than those with either I/I or D/D genotype (P = 0.045 and P = 0.018, respectively). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) content, total leukocytic count (TLC), and soluble erythropoietin receptor (sEpoR) were independent predictors of Hb level. The ACE gene, TLC, and serum iron were the independent factors that may affect the Haematocrit (Hct) level. ACE G2350A (rs4343) gene polymorphisms may affect the HD patient’s responses to rHuEPOs. CONCLUSION: In HD patients, screening for ACE G2350A (rs4343) gene polymorphisms before rHuEpo administration may help predict patient response.","Hamdan Almaeen, Abdulrahman; Mostafa-Hedeab, Gomaa",Pharmgenomics Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408344/,779

In contrast, the proposal introduces a single criterion for companies in the listed sectors, according to which they are to be primarily identified ipso iure—a company’s size. The author gives an overview of the main provisions and highlights the principal challenges associated with the proposed changes to the NIS regulatory regime.","Sievers, Thomas",Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450695/,779
58330,Non-serious case reports,2021-10-02,"Phishing emails have permeated our digital communication, taking advantage of vulnerabilities that the information technology system poses to users. Given the potential for further cybersecurity incidents, theft of personally identifiable information, and damage to organizations’ assets, cybersecurity professionals have implemented various mitigation practices to combat phishing emails. This paper categorizes current mitigation practices in relation to a sequential schema adopted from the situational crime prevention approach, so as to enable a more organized and strategic assessment of human and environmental vulnerabilities. Our model could be useful for cybersecurity professionals to further advance mitigation measures as an incident progresses and for criminologists and other academic researchers to reduce the severity of subsequent criminal incidents.","Suzuki, Yumi E.; Monroy, Sergio A.

89553,Enhancing digestive fistula healing by the off-label use of a thermoresponsive vessel occluder polymer associated with esophageal stent placement: A case report.,2020-09-08,"As food safety management further develops, microbiological testing will continue to play an important role in assessing whether Food Safety Objectives are achieved. However, traditional microbiological culture-based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. The present review discusses the reasons for the increasing interest in rapid methods, current developments in the field, the research needs, and the future trends. The advent of biotechnology has introduced new technologies that led to the emergence of rapid diagnostic methods and altered food testing practices. Rapid methods are comprised of many different detection technologies, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies and DNA, ranging from simple differential plating media to the use of sophisticated instruments. The use of non-invasive sampling techniques for live animals especially came into focus with the 1990s outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that was linked to the human outbreak of Creutzfeldt Jakob's Disease. Serology is still an important tool in preventing foodborne pathogens to enter the human food supply through meat and milk from animals. One of the primary uses of rapid methods is for fast screening of large number of samples, where most of them are expected to be test-negative, leading to faster product release for sale. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, where a primary culture broth is tested in PCR, is the most common approach in rapid testing. Recent reports show that it is possible both to enrich a sample and enumerate by pathogen-specific real-time PCR, if the enrichment time is short. This can be especially useful in situations where food producers ask for the level of pathogen in a contaminated product. Another key issue is automation, where the key drivers are miniaturization and multiple testing, which mean that not only one instrument is flexible enough to test for many pathogens but also many pathogens can be detected with one test. The review is mainly based on the author's scientific work that has contributed with the following new developments to this field: (i) serologic tests for large-scale screening, surveillance, or eradication programs, (ii) same-day detection of Salmonella that otherwise was considered as difficult to achieve, (iii) pathogen enumeration following a short log-phase enrichment, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biotracing of pathogens based on mathematical modeling, even in the absence of isolate. Rapid methods are discussed in a broad global health perspective, international food supply, and for improvement of quantitative microbial risk assessments. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture-independent, metagenomic-based detection, online monitoring, a global validation infrastructure has been emphasized. The cost and ease of use of rapid assays remain challenging obstacles to surmount.","Hoorfar, J",APMIS.

365661,Lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin: Various toxicities following off-label treatment: case report,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a male bias in mortality likely driven by both gender and sex-based differences between male and female individuals. This is consistent with sex and gender-based features of HIV infection and overlap between the two diseases will highlight potential mechanistic pathways of disease and guide research questions and policy interventions. In this review, the emerging findings from SARS-CoV-2 infection will be placed in the context of sex and gender research in the more mature HIV epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: This review will focus on the new field of literature on prevention, immunopathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 referencing relevant articles in HIV for context from a broader time period, consistent with the evolving understanding of sex and gender in HIV infection. Sex-specific features of epidemiology and immunopathogenesis reported in COVID-19 disease will be discussed and potential sex and gender-specific factors of relevance to prevention and treatment will be emphasized. SUMMARY: Multilayered impacts of sex and gender on HIV infection have illuminated pathways of disease and identified important goals for public health interventions. SARS-CoV-2 has strong evidence for a male bias in disease severity and exploring that difference will yield important insights.","Scully, Eileen P",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,,779
617446,Multiple drugs: Lack of efficacy and COVID-19 associated encephalopathy: case report,2021-05-08,"Hantaviruses are zoonotic RNA viruses that cause severe acute disease in humans. Infected individuals have strong inflammatory responses that likely cause immunopathology. Here, we studied the response of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in peripheral blood of individuals with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Puumala orthohantavirus, a hantavirus endemic in Europe. We show that MAIT cell levels decrease in the blood during HFRS and that residual MAIT cells are highly activated. This activation correlates with HFRS severity markers. In vitro activation of MAIT cells by hantavirus-exposed antigen-presenting cells is dependent on type I interferons (IFNs) and independent of interleukin-18 (IL-18). These findings highlight the role of type I IFNs in virus-driven MAIT cell activation and suggest a potential role of MAIT cells in the disease pathogenesis of viral infections.","Maleki, Kimia T.; Tauriainen, Johanna; García, Marina; Kerkman, Priscilla F.; Christ, Wanda; Dias, Joana; Wigren Byström, Julia; Leeansyah, Edwin; Forsell, Mattias N.; Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf; Ahlm, Clas; Björkström, Niklas K.; Sandberg, Johan K.; Klingström, Jonas",Cell Rep Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763658/,779
