6401,"European Nuclear Medicine Congress: August 14–17, 1984, Helsinki, Finland",1984,"The collectin surfactant protein-D (SP-D) plays a significant role in innate immunity. Epidemiological studies described associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human gene coding surfactant protein-D (SFTPD) and infectious pulmonary diseases. Studies on twins indicated very strong genetic dependence for serum levels of SP-D. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic influence of sequence variations within the SFTPD gene on the constitutional serum SP-D levels. We sequenced the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), the coding region and the 3′ region of the SFTPD gene of 32 randomly selected blood donors. Six validated SNPs were genotyped with sequence-specific probes (TaqMan 7000) in 290 German blood donors. Serum SP-D levels were analysed by ELISA, and the association of SFTPD haplotype estimates with the quantitative phenotype serum SP-D level was determined. One single SFTPD haplotype (allele frequency 13.53%) revealed a negative association with serum SP-D levels (P<0.0001). This was confirmed in a second prospectively collected group of blood donors (n=160, P=0.0034). The discovery of a frequent negative variant of the SFTPD gene provides a basis for genetic analysis of the function of SP-D in the resistance against pulmonary infections and inflammatory disorders in humans.","Heidinger, Kathrin; König, Inke R.; Bohnert, Anette; Kleinsteiber, Anja; Hilgendorff, Anne; Gortner, Ludwig; Ziegler, Andreas; Chakraborty, Trinad; Bein, Gregor",Immunogenetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100655/,509
6447,Detection of acute inhalation injury in fire victims by means of technetium-99m DTPA radioaerosol inhalation lung scintigraphy,1997,"The innate immune response is important in paraquat-induced acute lung injury, but the exact pathways involved are not elucidated. The objectives of this study were to determine the specific role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the process. Acute lung injury was induced by administering paraquat (PQ) intraperitoneally. NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 mRNA and protein expression in lung tissue and IL-1β and IL-18 levels in BALF were detected at 4, 8, 24, and 72 h after PQ administration in rats. Moreover, rats were pretreated with 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg NLRP3 inflammasome blocker glybenclamide, respectively, 1 h before PQ exposure. At 72 h after PQ administration, lung histopathology changes, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 protein expression, as well as secretion of cytokines including IL-1β and IL-18 in BALF were investigated. The NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 expression, and cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 levels in PQ poisoning rats were significantly higher than that in the control group. NLRP3 inflammasome blocker glybenclamide pretreatment attenuated lung edema, inhibited the NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 activation, and reduced IL-1β and IL-18 levels in BALF. In the in vitro experiments, IL-1β and IL-18 secreted from RAW264.7 mouse macrophages treated with paraquat were attenuated by glybenclamide. In conclusion, paraquat can induce IL-1β/IL-18 secretion via NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 pathway, and the NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for paraquat-induced acute lung injury.","Liu, Zhenning; Zhao, Hongyu; Liu, Wei; Li, Tiegang; Wang, Yu; Zhao, Min",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101550/,509

Retrospective chart review of patients with HIV diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 2013 at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital (UM/JMH) 47 females and 1 male were included in the analysis. The median age of diagnosis was 46 years (IQR 41–52) and 64 % of the women were premenopausal. Median CD4(+) count was 330 cells/µL (IQR 131–589 cells/µL). 41 % had AIDS at time of diagnosis. 94 % of patients presented with locoregional disease and 6 % with late stage breast cancer. 52 % had ER(+) tumors. 6 % had HER-2/neu tumor expression and 21 % had triple negative disease. The 5 year PFS was 50 % (95 % CI 34–64 %), the 5 year OS was 44 % (95 % CI 29–58 %), and the Breast cancer-specific survival was 57 % (95 % CI 40–70 %). Death was attributed to breast cancer in 22 patients, AIDS progression in 6 patients, other medical condition in 1, and for 4, the cause was unknown. Serious adverse events were documented in 46 % of patients treated with chemotherapy. Targeted therapy was well tolerated. Patients with HIV/AIDS and breast cancer pose a major challenge for oncologists. Surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy are well tolerated. Standard dose chemotherapy can have life-threatening side effects which can be managed with growth factor support and antimicrobial prophylaxis. All cancer therapy can be given while continuing with antiviral therapy at full dose.","Gomez, Alexandra; Montero, Alberto J.; Hurley, Judith",Breast Cancer Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102268/,509

333163,Covid-19 growth rate analysis: application of a low-complexity tool for understanding and comparing epidemic curves,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent causing COVID-19 which has infected more than 2 million people with more than 200000 deaths since its emergence in December 2019. In the majority of cases patients are either asymptomatic or show mild to moderate symptoms and signs of a common cold. A subset of patients, however, develop a severe atypical pneumonia, with the characteristic ground-glass appearance on chest x-ray and computerized tomography, which evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome, that requires mechanical ventilation and eventually results in multiple organ failure and death. The Molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present work we performed a stringent metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from bronchoalveolar cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to elucidate molecular alterations and cellular deconvolution to identify immune cell profiles. RESULTS: Alterations in genes involved in hyaluronan, glycosaminoglycan and mucopolysaccharides metabolism were over-represented in bronchoalveolar cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, as well as potential lung infiltration with neutrophils, T CD4+ cell and macrophages. The blood mononuclear cells presented a proliferative state. Dramatic reduction of NK and T lymphocytes, whereas an exacerbated increase in monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary our results revealed molecular pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection to bronchoalveolar cells inducing the hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan metabolism that could shape partially the components of the ground-glass opacities observed in CT. And the potential immune response profile in COVID-19.","Andonegui-Elguera, Sergio; Taniguchi-Ponciano, Keiko; Gonzalez-Bonilla, Cesar Raul; Torres, Javier; Mayani, Hector; Herrera, Luis Alonso; Peña-Martínez, Eduardo; Silva-Román, Gloria; Vela-Patiño, Sandra; Ferreira-Hermosillo, Aldo; Ramirez-Renteria, Claudia; Carvente-Garcia, Roberto; Mata-Lozano, Carlos; Marrero-Rodríguez, Daniel; Mercado, Moises",Arch Med Res,,509
408933,P-SILI as justification for intubation in COVID-19: readers as arbiters,2020,"The most frequent form of dementia is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a severe progressive neurological pathology in which the main cognitive functions of an individual are compromised. Recent studies have found that loneliness and living in isolation are likely to cause an acceleration in the cognitive decline associated with AD. Therefore, understanding social behaviours of AD patients is crucial to promote sociability, thus delaying cognitive decline, preserving independence, and providing a good quality of life. In this work, we analyze the localization data of AD patients living in assisted care homes to gather insights about the social dynamics among them. We use localization data collected by a system based on iBeacon technology comprising two components: a network of antennas scattered throughout the facility and a Bluetooth bracelet worn by the patients. We redefine the Relational Index to capture wandering and casual encounters, these being common phenomena among AD patients, and use the notions of Relational and Popularity Indexes to model, visualize and understand the social behaviour of AD patients. We leverage the data analyses to build predictive tools and applications to enhance social activities scheduling and sociability monitoring and promotion, with the ultimate aim of providing patients with a better quality of life. Predictions and visualizations act as a support for caregivers in activity planning to maximize treatment effects and, hence, slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We present the Community Behaviour Prediction Table (CBPT), a tool to visualize the estimated values of sociability among patients and popularity of places within a facility. Finally, we show the potential of the system by analyzing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown time-frame between February and June 2020 in a specific facility. Through the use of the indexes, we evaluate the effects of the pandemic on the behaviour of the residents, observing no particular impact on sociability even though social distancing was put in place.","Bellini, Gloria; Cipriano, Marco; Comai, Sara; De Angeli, Nicola; Gargano, Jacopo Pio; Gianella, Matteo; Goi, Gianluca; Ingrao, Giovanni; Masciadri, Andrea; Rossi, Gabriele; Salice, Fabio",Sensors (Basel),,509

While cognitive -behavioral therapies seem to better accommodate to these changes, traditional psychoanalytic therapies may become impractical This study goes into detail about the minimum technical and legal limits for a suitable teletherapy application Finally, another issue is whether the fact of using virtual communication tools would consequently involve a potential dehumanization of psychotherapy, and how this would affect the specific practice for some models of psychotherapy","Javier Feder, Diego; de los Santos, Romina; di Benedetto, Karina; Behobi, Walter; Fernandez Cao, Jesus",Acta Psiquiatrica Y Psicologica De America Latina,,509

Further, the large influx of COVID-19 patients has overwhelmed healthcare facilities, limited access to intensive care unit beds and ventilators, and canceled elective surgeries causing disruptions to the cancer care continuum and re-organization of oncological care. While it is known that the potential threat of infection is greatest in elderly patients (>60 years of age) and patients with underlying comorbidities, there is still insufficient data to determine the risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Given the immunosuppressive status in cancer patients arising from chemotherapy and other comorbidities, management of COVID-19 in this patient population carries a unique set of challenges. We report three cases of COVID-19 in immunocompromised cancer patients and discuss the challenges in preventing, diagnosing, and treating this vulnerable group.","Patel, Raj H.; Vanaparthy, Rachana; Greene, John N.",Cancer Control,https://doi.org/10.1177/10732748211044361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579537/,509
