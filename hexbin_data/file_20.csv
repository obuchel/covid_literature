20,Managing emerging infectious diseases: Is a federal system an impediment to effective laws?,2004-11-19,"In the 1980's and 1990's HIV/AIDS was the emerging infectious disease. In 2003–2004 we saw the emergence of SARS, Avian influenza and Anthrax in a man made form used for bioterrorism. Emergency powers legislation in Australia is a patchwork of Commonwealth quarantine laws and State and Territory based emergency powers in public health legislation. It is time for a review of such legislation and time for consideration of the efficacy of such legislation from a country wide perspective in an age when we have to consider the possibility of mass outbreaks of communicable diseases which ignore jurisdictional boundaries.","Howse, Genevieve",Aust New Zealand Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544965/,20
137,"Distinguishing Molecular Features and Clinical Characteristics of a Putative New Rhinovirus Species, Human Rhinovirus C (HRV C)",2008-04-02,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequently detected pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and yet little is known about the prevalence, recurrence, structure and clinical impact of individual members. During 2007, the complete coding sequences of six previously unknown and highly divergent HRV strains were reported. To catalogue the molecular and clinical features distinguishing the divergent HRV strains, we undertook, for the first time, in silico analyses of all available polyprotein sequences and performed retrospective reviews of the medical records of cases in which variants of the prototype strain, HRV-QPM, had been detected. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Genomic analyses revealed that the six divergent strains, residing within a clade we previously called HRV A2, had the shortest polyprotein of all picornaviruses investigated. Structure-based amino acid alignments identified conserved motifs shared among members of the genus Rhinovirus as well as substantive deletions and insertions unique to the divergent strains. Deletions mostly affected regions encoding proteins traditionally involved in antigenicity and serving as HRV and HEV receptor footprints. Because the HRV A2 strains cannot yet be cultured, we created homology models of predicted HRV-QPM structural proteins. In silico comparisons confirmed that HRV-QPM was most closely related to the major group HRVs. HRV-QPM was most frequently detected in infants with expiratory wheezing or persistent cough who had been admitted to hospital and required supplemental oxygen. It was the only virus detected in 65% of positive individuals. These observations contributed to an objective clinical impact ranging from mild to severe. CONCLUSIONS: The divergent strains did not meet classification requirements for any existing species of the genus Rhinovirus or Enterovirus. HRV A2 strains should be partitioned into at least one new species, putatively called Human rhinovirus C, populated by members detected with high frequency, from individuals with respiratory symptoms requiring hospital admission.","McErlean, Peter; Shackelton, Laura A.; Andrews, Emily; Webster, Dale R.; Lambert, Stephen B.; Nissen, Michael D.; Sloots, Theo P.; Mackay, Ian M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2268738/,20
315,Pattern Recognition Receptor–Dependent Mechanisms of Acute Lung Injury,2009-11-02,"Acute lung injury (ALI) that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome is caused by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from clinical events including sepsis, major surgery and trauma. Innate immunity activation plays a central role in the development of ALI. Innate immunity is activated through families of related pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved microbial motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors were the first major family of PRRs discovered in mammals. Recently, NACHT–leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors and retinoic acid–inducible gene–like receptors have been added to the list. It is now understood that in addition to recognizing infectious stimuli, both Toll-like receptors and NACHT-LRR receptors can also respond to endogenous molecules released in response to stress, trauma and cell damage. These molecules have been termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It has been clinically observed for a long time that infectious and noninfectious insults initiate inflammation, so confirmation of overlapping receptor-signal pathways of activation between PAMPs and DAMPs is no surprise. This review provides an overview of the PRR-dependent mechanisms of ALI and clinical implication. Modification of PRR pathways is likely to be a logical therapeutic target for ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Xiang, Meng; Fan, Jie",Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785474/,20
416,On the possible role of robustness in the evolution of infectious diseases,2010-06-30,"Robustness describes the capacity for a biological system to remain canalized despite perturbation. Genetic robustness affords maintenance of phenotype despite mutational input, necessarily involving the role of epistasis. Environmental robustness is phenotypic constancy in the face of environmental variation, where epistasis may be uninvolved. Here we discuss genetic and environmental robustness, from the standpoint of infectious disease evolution, and suggest that robustness may be a unifying principle for understanding how different disease agents evolve. We focus especially on viruses with RNA genomes due to their importance in the evolution of emerging diseases and as model systems to test robustness theory. We present new data on adaptive constraints for a model RNA virus challenged to evolve in response to UV radiation. We also draw attention to other infectious disease systems where robustness theory may prove useful for bridging evolutionary biology and biomedicine, especially the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, immune evasion by influenza, and malaria parasite infections.","Ogbunugafor, C.

431,Proteomics Comparison of Cerebrospinal Fluid of Relapsing Remitting and Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,2010-08-27,"BACKGROUND: Based on clinical representation of disease symptoms multiple sclerosis (MScl) patients can be divided into two major subtypes; relapsing remitting (RR) MScl (85–90%) and primary progressive (PP) MScl (10–15%). Proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has detected a number of proteins that were elevated in MScl patients. Here we specifically aimed to differentiate between the PP and RR subtypes of MScl by comparing CSF proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CSF samples (n = 31) were handled according to the same protocol for quantitative mass spectrometry measurements we reported previously. In the comparison of PP MScl versus RR MScl we observed a number of differentially abundant proteins, such as protein jagged-1 and vitamin D-binding protein. Protein jagged-1 was over three times less abundant in PP MScl compared to RR MScl. Vitamin D-binding protein was only detected in the RR MScl samples. These two proteins were validated by independent techniques (western blot and ELISA) as differentially abundant in the comparison between both MScl types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The main finding of this comparative study is the observation that the proteome profiles of CSF in PP and RR MScl patients overlap to a large extent. Still, a number of differences could be observed. Protein jagged-1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors and involved in the mediation of Notch signaling. It is suggested in literature that the Notch pathway is involved in the remyelination of MScl lesions. Aberration of normal homeostasis of Vitamin D, of which approximately 90% is bound to vitamin D-binding protein, has been widely implicated in MScl for some years now. Vitamin D directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes, and so it may be involved in neuroprotective elements in MScl.","Stoop, Marcel P.; Singh, Vaibhav; Dekker, Lennard J.; Titulaer, Mark K.; Stingl, Christoph; Burgers, Peter C.; Sillevis Smitt, Peter A.

757,Transmission of Infectious Diseases En Route to Habitat Hotspots,2012-02-20,"BACKGROUND: The spread of infectious diseases in wildlife populations is influenced by patterns of between-host contacts. Habitat “hotspots” - places attracting a large numbers of individuals or social groups - can significantly alter contact patterns and, hence, disease propagation. Research on the importance of habitat hotspots in wildlife epidemiology has primarily focused on how inter-individual contacts occurring at the hotspot itself increase disease transmission. However, in territorial animals, epidemiologically important contacts may primarily occur as animals cross through territories of conspecifics en route to habitat hotspots. So far, the phenomenon has received little attention. Here, we investigate the importance of these contacts in the case where infectious individuals keep visiting the hotspots and in the case where these individuals are not able to travel to the hotspot any more. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a simulation epidemiological model to investigate both cases in a scenario when transmission at the hotspot does not occur. We find that (i) hotspots still exacerbate epidemics, (ii) when infectious individuals do not travel to the hotspot, the most vulnerable individuals are those residing at intermediate distances from the hotspot rather than nearby, and (iii) the epidemiological vulnerability of a population is the highest when the number of hotspots is intermediate. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: By altering animal movements in their vicinity, habitat hotspots can thus strongly increase the spread of infectious diseases, even when disease transmission does not occur at the hotspot itself. Interestingly, when animals only visit the nearest hotspot, creating additional artificial hotspots, rather than reducing their number, may be an efficient disease control measure.","Benavides, Julio; Walsh, Peter D.; Meyers, Lauren Ancel; Raymond, Michel; Caillaud, Damien",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3282722/,20
821,Distribution and Risk Factors of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in Mainland China,2012-05-01,"Data from all reported cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of cases were characterized through spatial analysis. The impact of travel-related risk factors on invasion of the disease was analyzed using survival analysis, and climatic factors related to local transmission were identified using multilevel Poisson regression, both at the county level. The results showed that the epidemic spanned a large geographic area, with the most affected areas being in western China. Significant differences in incidence were found among age groups, with incidences peaking in school-age children. Overall, the epidemic spread from southeast to northwest. Proximity to airports and being intersected by national highways or freeways but not railways were variables associated with the presence of the disease in a county. Lower temperature and lower relative humidity were the climatic factors facilitating local transmission after correction for the effects of school summer vacation and public holidays, as well as population density and the density of medical facilities. These findings indicate that interventions focused on domestic travel, population density, and climatic factors could play a role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.","Fang, Li-Qun; Wang, Li-Ping; de Vlas, Sake J.; Liang, Song; Tong, Shi-Lu; Li, Yan-Li; Li, Ya-Pin; Qian, Quan; Yang, Hong; Zhou, Mai-Geng; Wang, Xiao-Feng; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Ma, Jia-Qi; Cao, Wu-Chun",Am J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3339311/,20
1009,Imaging Findings in Patients With H1N1 Influenza A Infection,2011-12-25,"BACKGROUND: Swine influenza (H1N1) is a very contagious respiratory infection and World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alert level to phase 6 (pandemic). The study of clinical and laboratory manifestations as well as radiologic imaging findings helps in its early diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the imaging findings of patients with documented H1N1 infection referred to our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (16 men) with documented H1N1 infection were included in our study. The initial radiography obtained from the patients was reviewed regarding pattern (consolidation, ground glass, nodules and reticulation), distribution (focal, multifocal, and diffuse) and the lung zones involved. Computed tomography (CT) scans were also reviewed for the same abnormalities. The patient files were studied for their possible underlying diseases. RESULTS: The mean age was 37.97 ± 13.9 years. Seventeen (54.8%) patients had co-existing condition (eight respiratory, five cardiovascular, two immunodeficiency, two cancer, four others). Twelve (38.7%) patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Five (16.1%) patients died. (25.8%) had normal initial radiographs. The most common abnormality was consolidation (12/31; 38.7%) in the peripheral region (11/31; 35.5%) followed by peribronchovascular areas (10/31; 32.3%) which was most commonly observed in the lower zone. The patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have two or more lung zones involved (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with the novel swine flu infection, the most common radiographic abnormality observed was consolidation in the lower lung zones. Patients admitted to ICU were more likely to have two or more lung zones involved.","Bakhshayeshkaram, Mehrdad; Saidi, Bahareh; Tabarsi, Payam; Zahirifard, Soheila; Ghofrani, Mishka",Iran J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3522360/,20
1264,Different Mechanisms of Inflammation Induced in Virus and Autoimmune-Mediated Models of Multiple Sclerosis in C57BL6 Mice,2013-08-28,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system (CNS). Neurotropic demyelinating strain of MHV (MHV-A59 or its isogenic recombinant strain RSA59) induces MS-like disease in mice mediated by microglia, along with a small population of T cells. The mechanism of demyelination is at least in part due to microglia-mediated myelin stripping, with some direct axonal injury. Immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mainly CD4(+) T-cell-mediated disease, although CD8(+) T cells may play a significant role in demyelination. It is possible that both autoimmune and nonimmune mechanisms such as direct viral toxicity may induce MS. Our study directly compares CNS pathology in autoimmune and viral-induced MS models. Mice with viral-induced and EAE demyelinating diseases demonstrated similar patterns and distributions of demyelination that accumulated over the course of the disease. However, significant differences in acute inflammation were noted. Inflammation was restricted mainly to white matter at all times in EAE, whereas inflammation initially largely involved gray matter in acute MHV-induced disease and then is subsequently localized only in white matter in the chronic disease phase. The presence of dual mechanisms of demyelination may be responsible for the failure of immunosuppression to promote long-term remission in many MS patients.","Kishore, Abhinoy; Kanaujia, Anurag; Nag, Soma; Rostami, A.

1385,Emerging infectious diseases,2014-01-11,"The spectrum of human pathogens and the infectious diseases they cause is continuously changing through evolution and changes in the way human populations interact with their environment and each other. New human pathogens most often emerge from an animal reservoir, emphasizing the central role that non-human reservoirs play in human infectious diseases. Pathogens may also re-emerge with new characteristics, such as multidrug-resistance, or in different places, such as West Nile virus in the USA in 1999, to cause new epidemics. Most human pathogens have a history of evolution in which they first emerge and cause epidemics, become unstably adapted, re-emerge periodically, and eventually become endemic with the potential for future outbreaks.","van Doorn, H.

1594,Comparison of Antibodies Hydrolyzing Myelin Basic Protein from the Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis,2014-09-29,"It was found that antibodies (Abs) against myelin basic protein (MBP) are the major components of the antibody response in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We have recently shown that IgGs from sera of MS patients are active in the hydrolysis of MBP. However, in literature there are no available data concerning possible MBP-hydrolyzing Abs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients. We have shown that the average content of IgGs in their sera is about 195-fold higher than that in their CSF. Here we have compared, for the first time, the average content of lambda- and kappa-IgGs as well as IgGs of four different subclasses (IgG1-IgG4) in CSF and sera of MS patients. The average relative content of lambda-IgGs and kappa –IgGs in the case of CSFs (8.0 and 92.0%) and sera (12.3 and 87.7%) are comparable, while IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4: CSF - 40.4, 49.0, 8.2, and 2.5% of total IgGs, respectively and the sera - 53.6, 36.0, 5.6, and 4.8%, decreased in different order. Electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were obtained by sequential affinity chromatography of the CSF proteins on protein G-Sepharose and FPLC gel filtration. We present first evidence showing that IgGs from CSF efficiently hydrolyze MBP and that their average specific catalytic activity is unpredictably ∼54-fold higher than that of Abs from sera of the same MS patients. Some possible reasons of these findings are discussed. We suggest that anti-MBP abzymes of CSF may promote important neuropathologic mechanisms in this chronic inflammatory disorder and in MS pathogenesis development.","Doronin, Visilii B.; Parkhomenko, Taisiya A.; Castellazzi, Massimiliano; Padroni, Marina; Pastore, Michela; Buneva, Valentina N.; Granieri, Enrico; Nevinsky, Georgy A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4180057/,20
1604,The interconnected and cross-border nature of risks posed by infectious diseases,2014-10-10,"Infectious diseases can constitute public health emergencies of international concern when a pathogen arises, acquires new characteristics, or is deliberately released, leading to the potential for loss of human lives as well as societal disruption. A wide range of risk drivers are now known to lead to and/or exacerbate the emergence and spread of infectious disease, including global trade and travel, the overuse of antibiotics, intensive agriculture, climate change, high population densities, and inadequate infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities. Where multiple risk drivers interact, the potential impact of a disease outbreak is amplified. The varying temporal and geographic frequency with which infectious disease events occur adds yet another layer of complexity to the issue. Mitigating the emergence and spread of infectious disease necessitates mapping and prioritising the interdependencies between public health and other sectors. Conversely, during an international public health emergency, significant disruption occurs not only to healthcare systems but also to a potentially wide range of sectors, including trade, tourism, energy, civil protection, transport, agriculture, and so on. At the same time, dealing with a disease outbreak may require a range of critical sectors for support. There is a need to move beyond narrow models of risk to better account for the interdependencies between health and other sectors so as to be able to better mitigate and respond to the risks posed by emerging infectious disease.","Suk, Jonathan E.; Van Cangh, Thomas; Beauté, Julien; Bartels, Cornelius; Tsolova, Svetla; Pharris, Anastasia; Ciotti, Massimo; Semenza, Jan C.",Glob Health Action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195207/,20
1799,The Importance of Bacterial and Viral Infections Associated with Adult Asthma Exacerbations in Clinical Practice,2015-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Viral infection is one of the risk factors for asthma exacerbation. However, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice. METHODS: The study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. The pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. RESULTS: Asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. The numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. The dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients. H. influenzae was observed in stable asthmatic patients. Other bacteria, especially S. pneumoniae, were important in asthma exacerbation inpatients. CONCLUSION: Viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation.","Iikura, Motoyasu; Hojo, Masayuki; Koketsu, Rikiya; Watanabe, Sho; Sato, Ayano; Chino, Haruka; Ro, Shoki; Masaki, Haruna; Hirashima, Junko; Ishii, Satoru; Naka, Go; Takasaki, Jin; Izumi, Shinyu; Kobayashi, Nobuyuki; Yamaguchi, Sachiko; Nakae, Susumu; Sugiyama, Haruhito",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4406689/,20

Knowledge regarding their occurrence and worldwide transmission is important to control outbreaks and prevent epidemics. Here, we performed shotgun sequencing of toilet waste from 18 international airplanes arriving in Copenhagen, Denmark, from nine cities in three world regions. An average of 18.6 Gb (14.8 to 25.7 Gb) of raw Illumina paired end sequence data was generated, cleaned, trimmed and mapped against reference sequence databases for bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes. An average of 106,839 (0.06%) reads were assigned to resistance genes with genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, macrolide and beta-lactam resistance genes as the most abundant in all samples. We found significantly higher abundance and diversity of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, including critical important resistance (e.g. bla(CTX-M)) carried on airplanes from South Asia compared to North America. Presence of Salmonella enterica and norovirus were also detected in higher amounts from South Asia, whereas Clostridium difficile was most abundant in samples from North America. Our study provides a first step towards a potential novel strategy for global surveillance enabling simultaneous detection of multiple human health threatening genetic elements, infectious agents and resistance genes.","Nordahl Petersen, Thomas; Rasmussen, Simon; Hasman, Henrik; Carøe, Christian; Bælum, Jacob; Charlotte Schultz, Anna; Bergmark, Lasse; Svendsen, Christina A.; Lund, Ole; Sicheritz-Pontén, Thomas; Aarestrup, Frank M.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498435/,20
2027,"Phylogenetic Exploration of Nosocomial Transmission Chains of 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 among Children Admitted at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa in 2011",2015-11-13,"Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation. Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission, which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.","Valley-Omar, Ziyaad; Nindo, Fredrick; Mudau, Maanda; Hsiao, Marvin; Martin, Darren Patrick",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643913/,20

Wistar rats were equally randomized to three groups: normal control group, ALI 6 h group (smoke inhalation for 6 h) and ALI 24 h group (smoke inhalation for 24 h). We observed changes in cell counting in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alveolar-capillary membrane permeability and lung tissue pathology. Moreover, rats in ALI 6 h and ALI 24 h group showed increased expression of Th17 cell and related cytokines (IL-17 A, IL-6, TGF-β and IL-23). Meanwhile, Treg prevalence and related cytokines (IL-10, IL-2 and IL-35) were decreased. Consequently, the ratio of Th17/Treg was higher after smoke inhalation. Additionally, Th1 cell decreased while Th2 cell increased at 6 h and 24 h after smoke inhalation. In conclusion, Th17/Treg imbalance exists in rats with smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of this disease.","Zhang, Fan; Li, Mian-yang; Lan, Ya-ting; Wang, Cheng-bin",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756332/,20

Recent reports suggest that human neutrophil elastase (HNE) plays a key role in the inflammatory response that is characteristic of ALI, which indicates that the development of HNE inhibitors could be an efficient treatment strategy. In the current study, an enzyme-based screening assay was used to identify effective HNE inhibitors from a number of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). Among them, a water extract of Ilex kaushue (IKWE) effectively inhibited HNE activity (IC(50), 11.37 ± 1.59 μg/mL). Using bioactivity-guided fractionation, one new compound and 23 known compounds were identified. Compound 6 (identified as 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid; 3,5-DCQA) exerted the most potent and selective inhibitory effect on HNE activity (IC(50), 1.86 ± 0.06 μM). In a cell-based assay, 3,5-DCQA not only directly reduced superoxide generation and elastase activity but also attenuated the Src family kinase (SRKs)/Vav signaling pathway in N-formyl-L-Met-L-Leu-L-Phe (fMLF)-stimulated human neutrophils. In an animal disease model, both 3,5-DCQA and standardized IKWE protected against lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI in mice, which provides support for their potential as candidates in the development of new therapeutic agents for neutrophilic inflammatory diseases.","Chen, Yu-Li; Hwang, Tsong-Long; Yu, Huang-Ping; Fang, Jia-You; Chong, Kowit Yu; Chang, Yao-Wen; Chen, Chun-Yu; Yang, Hsuan-Wu; Chang, Wen-Yi; Hsieh, Pei-Wen",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041076/,20
2412,XB130 deficiency enhances lipopolysaccharide-induced septic response and acute lung injury,2016-03-23,"XB130 is a novel oncoprotein that promotes cancer cell survival, proliferation and migration. Its physiological function in vivo is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the role of XB130 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic responses and acute lung injury. LPS was intraperitoneally administrated to Xb130 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. There was a significant weight loss in KO mice at Day 2 and significantly higher disease scores during the 7 days of observation. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in the serum were significantly higher in KO mice at Day 2. In KO mice there were a significantly higher lung injury score, higher wet/dry lung weight ratio, more apoptotic cells and less proliferative cells in the lung. Macrophage infiltration was significantly elevated in the lung of KO mice. There was significantly increased number of p-GSK-3β positive cells in KO mice, which were mainly neutrophils and macrophages. XB130 is expressed in alveolar type I and type II cells in the lung. The expression in these cells was significantly reduced after LPS challenge. XB130 deficiency delayed the recovery from systemic septic responses, and the presence of XB130 in the alveolar epithelial cells may provide protective mechanisms by reducing cell death and promoting cell proliferation, and reducing pulmonary permeability.","Toba, Hiroaki; Tomankova, Tereza; Wang, Yingchun; Bai, Xiaohui; Cho, Hae-Ra; Guan, Zhehong; Adeyi, Oyedele A.; Tian, Feng; Keshavjee, Shaf; Liu, Mingyao",Oncotarget,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041914/,20

We found that individuals carrying variant allele at A/B (namely BB or AB genotypes) was associated with increased susceptibility to TB (odds ratios [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.91, P = 1.3 × 10(−6)). Additionally, LYPB haplotype showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.27–1.87, P = 4.2 × 10(−6); global haplotype association P = 3.5 × 10(−5)). Furthermore, individuals bearing low- or medium- MBL expression haplotype pairs had an increased risk of TB (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.29–1.90, P = 1.4 × 10(−6)). Thus, the reduced expression of functional MBL secondary to having MBL2 variants may partially mediate the increased susceptibility to TB risk.","Liu, Cheng; He, Tao; Rong, Yanxiao; Du, Fengjiao; Ma, Dongxing; Wei, Yujie; Mei, Zhiqin; Wang, Yuling; Wang, Haibin; Zhu, Yuehua; Zhang, Zongde; Zheng, Li; Wu, Xueqiong; Liu, Huiliang; Ding, Wenjun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095599/,20
2473,Dimethyloxaloylglycine increases bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head,2016-09-13,"Mesenchymal stem cells have been widely studied to promote local bone regeneration of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1α protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1α expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8±7.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5±3.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2±2.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6±2.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups. Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the revasculation of the necrotic area were also increased significantly in the DMOG-treated ASC group compared with the control groups. Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1α expression in the treatment of ONFH.","Zhu, Zhen-Hong; Song, Wen-Qi; Zhang, Chang-Qing; Yin, Ji-Min",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5103711/,20

3094,Prenatal dexamethasone and postnatal high-fat diet have a synergistic effect of elevating blood pressure through a distinct programming mechanism of systemic and adipose renin–angiotensin systems,2018-03-14,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension may result from high-fat (HF) diet induced-obesity and overexposure to glucocorticoids in utero. Recent studies demonstrated the potent contribution of adipose tissue’s renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to systemic RAS, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure (BP). In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) exposure and postnatal HF diet on RAS of adipose tissue. METHODS: RAS and BP of 6-month old rats exposed to prenatal DEX and/or postnatal HF diet were examined. RESULTS: Prenatal DEX plus postnatal HF exerted a synergistic effect on systolic BP. Prenatal DEX exposure suppressed plasma angiotensin (ANG) I and ANG II, whereas postnatal HF suppressed plasma ANG-(1–7) level. Prenatal DEX increased prorenin receptor and renin levels, but suppressed angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme 1 (ACE1) mRNA expressions in adipose tissue. Postnatal HF increased AGT mRNA expression, but suppressed prorenin receptor, renin, ACE2, ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2R), and Mas receptor (MasR) mRNA expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal GC exposure altered the ACE1/ANG II/ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis, whereas postnatal HF negatively impacted the ACE2/ANG-(1–7)/MasR axis. Prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF synergistically elevated BP through a distinct programming mechanism of systemic and adipose RAS.

3655,Modeling the impact of quarantine during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease,2019-02-05,"The quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to an infectious agent is one of the most basic public health measure that has historically been used to combat the spread of communicable diseases in human communities. This study presents a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of the quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to disease on the spread of the 2014–2015 outbreaks of Ebola viral disease. It is assumed that quarantine is imperfect (i.e., individuals can acquire infection during quarantine). In the absence of quarantine, the model is shown to exhibit global dynamics with respect to the disease-free and its unique endemic equilibrium when a certain epidemiological threshold (denoted by [Formula: see text]) is either less than or greater than unity. Thus, unlike the full model with imperfect quarantine (which is known to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation), the version of the model with no quarantine does not undergo a backward bifurcation. Using data relevant to the 2014–2015 Ebola transmission dynamics in the three West African countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), uncertainty analysis of the model show that, although the current level and effectiveness of quarantine can lead to significant reduction in disease burden, they fail to bring the associated quarantine reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) to a value less than unity (which is needed to make effective disease control or elimination feasible). This reduction of [Formula: see text] is, however, very possible with a modest increase in quarantine rate and effectiveness. It is further shown, via sensitivity analysis, that the parameters related to the effectiveness of quarantine (namely the parameter associated with the reduction in infectiousness of infected quarantined individuals and the contact rate during quarantine) are the main drivers of the disease transmission dynamics. Overall, this study shows that the singular implementation of a quarantine intervention strategy can lead to the effective control or elimination of Ebola viral disease in a community if its coverage and effectiveness levels are high enough.","Dénes, Attila; Gumel, Abba B.",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382747/,20
3888,Complement Receptor 1 availability on red blood cell surface modulates Plasmodium vivax invasion of human reticulocytes,2019-06-20,"Plasmodium vivax parasites preferentially invade reticulocyte cells in a multistep process that is still poorly understood. In this study, we used ex vivo invasion assays and population genetic analyses to investigate the involvement of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in P. vivax invasion. First, we observed that P. vivax invasion of reticulocytes was consistently reduced when CR1 surface expression was reduced through enzymatic cleavage, in the presence of naturally low-CR1-expressing cells compared with high-CR1-expressing cells, and with the addition of soluble CR1, a known inhibitor of P. falciparum invasion. Immuno-precipitation experiments with P. vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins showed no evidence of complex formation. In addition, analysis of CR1 genetic data for worldwide human populations with different exposure to malaria parasites show significantly higher frequency of CR1 alleles associated with low receptor expression on the surface of RBCs and higher linkage disequilibrium in human populations exposed to P. vivax malaria compared with unexposed populations. These results are consistent with a positive selection of low-CR1-expressing alleles in vivax-endemic areas. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CR1 availability on the surface of RBCs modulates P. vivax invasion. The identification of new molecular interactions is crucial to guiding the rational development of new therapeutic interventions against vivax malaria.","Prajapati, Surendra Kumar; Borlon, Céline; Rovira-Vallbona, Eduard; Gruszczyk, Jakub; Menant, Sebastien; Tham, Wai-Hong; Kattenberg, Johanna Helena; Villasis, Elizabeth; De Meulenaere, Katlijn; Gamboa, Dionicia; Vinetz, Joseph; Fujita, Ricardo; Xuan, Xa Nguyen; Urbano Ferreira, Marcelo; Niño, Carlos H.; Patarroyo, Manuel A.; Spanakos, Gregory; Kestens, Luc; Abbeele, Jan Van Den; Rosanas-Urgell, Anna",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586822/,20

4612,"Bilateral ureteral obstruction is rapidly accompanied by ER stress and activation of autophagic degradation of IMCD proteins, including AQP2",2020-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Intractable, mechanical hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is a rare catastrophic complication following mitral valve surgery. We analyzed patient characteristics and IMHA management by reoperations after mitral valve surgery. METHODS: We collected medical records from mitral valve patients requiring reoperation due to IMHA. Inclusion criteria: hemoglobin < 100 g/L; positive hemolysis tests and echocardiography results; and exclusion of other hemolysis causes. RESULTS: Data from 25 IMHA cases included 10 (40%) early onset (1.3 (0.3,3.0) months) and 15 (60%) late onset (120 (24,204) months) cases. Early IMHA etiologies included surgical defects (6, 60%), uncontrolled infection (3, 30%) and Bechet’s disease (1, 10%). Late IMHA etiologies included degeneration (13, 87%), new infection (1, 7%) and trauma (1, 7%). There were more mechanical valves (15, 88%) than bio-valves (2, 12%); the main valvular dysfunction was paravalvular leak (16, 64%). IMHA manifestations included jaundice (18, 72%), dark urine (21, 84%), heart failure (16, 64%), acute kidney injury (11, 44%), hepatomegaly (15, 60%), splenomegaly (15, 60%) and pancreatitis (1, 4%). Laboratory results showed decreased hemoglobin (70 ± 14 g/L) and increased bilirubin (72 ± 57 μmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (2607 ± 2142 IU/L) and creatinine (136 ± 101 μmol/L) levels. Creatinine level negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (B = -3.33, S.E. B = 1.31, Exp(B) = 368.15, P = 0.018). Preoperative medications included iron supplements (20, 80%), erythropoietin (16, 64%) and beta-blocker (22, 88%). Two patients died of cardiac causes before reoperation. The other 23 underwent reoperation with long surgical times (aortic cross clamp 124 ± 50 min, cardiopulmonary bypass 182 ± 69 min) and blood transfusions (red blood cells 6 (6, 8) units, plasma 600 (400,800) ml, platelet 1(0,2) units). Postoperative complications included cardiac dysfunction (5, 22%), arrhythmia (10, 43%), sepsis (6, 26%), pulmonary infection (5, 22%), gastrointestinal bleeding (3, 13%), cerebral hemorrhage (2, 9%), chronic renal dysfunction (1, 4%) and surgical hemorrhage (1, 4%). Five (33%) patients died after reoperation from cardiac dysfunction (3, 60%), septic shock (1, 20%) and self-discharge (1, 20%). CONCLUSIONS: IMHA induces severe multi-organ dysfunction, contributing to high mortality.

Its main features included a biotin-streptavidin amplification step and a solid phase consisting of a microporous membrane. Cell samples in the form of suspensions were applied to nitrocellulose or ion exchange membranes immobilized in commerciallyavailable microtiter, multiwell manifolds. The blocking buffer contained 1% purified α-casein. The primary antibodies were monoclonal and the polyclonal secondary antibody was biotinylated. The enzyme utilized was streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The substrate-dye complex consisted of either 4-chloro-1-naphthol and hydrogen peroxide or ortho phenylene diamine (OPD) and hydrogen peroxide. The presence of homologous antiserum in the reaction sequence gave clearly visible, colored reactions on the membrane when 50 ul with approximately 10(5) or more cfu/ml were present. This new biotin-avidin microporous membrane (BAMM-ELISA) test can be used both to detect mycoplasmas and to speciate them. The BAMM-ELISA is simple, rapid, sensitive, specific and economical. As such, it has potential for aiding in the control of mycoplasma contamination in cell culture, and could prove useful in clinical diagnostic applications as well.","Gabridge, Michael G.; Lundin, Daniel J.; Gladd, Martha F.",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089076/,20

5628,Physicians Poster Sessions: Poster session / Day 2,2015-03-20,"Background Bioaerosols are defined as airborne particles of liquid or volatile compounds that contain living organisms or have been released from living organisms. The creation of bioaerosols is a recognized consequence of certain types of dental treatment and represents a potential mechanism for the spread of infection. Objectives The aims of the present study were to assess the bioaerosols generated by certain dental procedures and to evaluate the efficiency of a commercially available Air Cleaning System (ACS) designed to reduce bioaerosol levels. Methods Bioaerosol sampling was undertaken in the absence of clinical activity (baseline) and also during treatment procedures (cavity preparation using an air rotor, history and oral examination, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction under local anaesthesia). For each treatment, bioaerosols were measured for two patient episodes (with and without ACS operation) and between five and nine bioaerosol samples were collected. For baseline measurements, 15 bioaerosol samples were obtained. For bioaerosol sampling, environmental air was drawn on to blood agar plates using a bioaerosol sampling pump placed in a standard position 20 cm from the dental chair. Plates were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 48 hours and resulting growth quantified as colony forming units (cfu/m(3)). Distinct colony types were identified using standard methods. Results were analysed statistically using SPSS 12 and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results The ACS resulted in a significant reduction (p = 0.001) in the mean bioaerosols (cfu/m(3)) of all three clinics compared with baseline measurements. The mean level of bioaerosols recorded during the procedures, with or without the ACS activated respectively, was 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 105.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.02) for cavity preparation, 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 62.2 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.04) for history and oral examination; 41.9 cfu/m(3) and 70.9 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for ultrasonic scaling and 9.1 cfu/m(3) and 66.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for extraction. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus species and Micrococcus species.

The objective of this prospective interventional study was to evaluate the etiology, diagnostic procedures, risk factors and outcome of pulmonary complications in a cohort of hematopoietic SCT recipients followed up for 1 year. For patients suffering from a pulmonary complication, a diagnostic algorithm that included non-invasive and bronchoscopic procedures was performed. We identified 73 pulmonary complications in 169 patients: 50 (68%) were pneumonias; 21 (29%) were non-infectious complications and 2 (3%) were undiagnosed. Viruses (particularly Rhinovirus) and bacteria (particularly P. aeruginosa) (28 and 26%, respectively) were the most common causes of pneumonia. A specific diagnosis was obtained in 83% of the cases. A non-invasive test gave a specific diagnosis in 59% of the episodes. The diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy was 67 and 78% in pulmonary infections. Early bronchoscopy (⩽5 days) had higher diagnostic yield than late bronchoscopy (78 vs 23%; P=0.02) for pulmonary infections. Overall mortality was 22 and 32% of all fatalities were due to pulmonary complications.

We examine the contribution of drug resistance mutations for low viral suppression in HIV-positive participants in a population-based sero-prevalence survey in rural South Africa. METHODS: We conducted HIV drug resistance genotyping and ART analyte testing on dried blood spots (DBS) from HIV-positive adults participating in a 2014 survey in North West Province. Among those with virologic failure (> 5000 copies/mL), we describe frequency of DRM to protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), report association of resistance with antiretroviral therapy (ART) status, and assess resistance to first and second line therapy. Analyses are weighted to account for sampling design. RESULTS: Overall 170 DBS samples were assayed for viral load and ART analytes; 78.4% of men and 50.0% of women had evidence of virologic failure and were assessed for drug resistance, with successful sequencing of 76/107 samples. We found ≥1 DRM in 22% of participants; 47% were from samples with detectable analyte (efavirenz, nevirapine or lopinavir). Of those with DRM and detectable analyte, 60% showed high–level resistance and reduced predicted virologic response to ≥1 NRTI/NNRTI typically used in first and second-line regimens. CONCLUSIONS: DRM and predicted reduced susceptibility to first and second-line regimens were common among adults with ART exposure in a rural South African population-based sample. Results underscore the importance of ongoing virologic monitoring, regimen optimization and adherence counseling to optimize durable virologic suppression.","Lippman, Sheri A.; Mooney, Alyssa C.; Puren, Adrian; Hunt, Gillian; Grignon, Jessica S.; Prach, Lisa M.; Gilmore, Hailey J.; Truong, Hong-Ha M.; Barnhart, Scott; Liegler, Teri",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099808/,20
6450,NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation Is Essential for Paraquat-Induced Acute Lung Injury,2014-10-23,"PURPOSE: To identify risk factors associated with mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by S. pneumoniae who require intensive care unit (ICU) management, and to assess the prognostic values of these risk factors at the time of admission. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who were admitted to the 32-bed medico-surgical ICU of a community and referral university hospital between 2002 and 2011. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on variables available at admission. RESULTS: Among the 77 adult patients with severe CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who required ICU management, 12 patients died (observed mortality rate 15.6 %). Univariate analysis indicated that septic shock and low C-reactive protein (CRP) values at admission were associated with an increased risk of death. In a multivariate model, after adjustment for age and gender, septic shock [odds ratio (OR), confidence interval 95 %; 4.96, 1.11–22.25; p = 0.036], and CRP (OR 0.99, 0.98–0.99 p = 0.034) remained significantly associated with death. Finally, we assessed the discriminative ability of CRP to predict mortality by computing its receiver operating characteristic curve. The CRP value cut-off for the best sensitivity and specificity was 169.5 mg/L to predict hospital mortality with an area under the curve of 0.72 (0.55–0.89). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of patients with S. pneumoniae CAP requiring ICU management was much lower than predicted by severity scores. The presence of septic shock and a CRP value at admission <169.5 mg/L predicted a fatal outcome.","Que, Yok-Ai; Virgini, Virginie; Lozeron, Elise Dupuis; Paratte, Géraldine; Prod’hom, Guy; Revelly, Jean-Pierre; Pagani, Jean-Luc; Charbonney, Emmanuel; Eggimann, Philippe",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101553/,20

Transmitted by infected rodents and their excreta, Hantavirus are identified as etiologic agents of two main types of diseases—Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the latter having a fatality rate of above 40 %. Although considerable research for over two decades has been going on in this area, bibliometric studies to gauge the state of research of this field have been rare. An analysis of 2631 articles, extracted from WoS databases on Hantavirus between 1980 and 2014, indicated a progressive increase (R (2) = 0.93) in the number of papers over the years, with the majority of papers being published in the USA and Europe. About 95 % papers were co-authored and the most common arrangement was 4–6 authors per paper. Co-authorship has seen a steady increase (R (2) = 0.57) over the years. We apply research collaboration network analysis to investigate the best-connected authors in the field. The author-based networks have 49 components (connected clump of nodes) with 7373 vertices (authors) and 49,747 edges (co-author associations) between them. The giant component (the largest component) is healthy, occupying 84.19 % or 6208 vertices with 47,117 edges between them. By using edge-weight threshold, we drill down into the network to reveal bonded communities. We find three communities’ hotspots—one, led by researchers at University of Helsinki, Finland; a second, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, USA; and a third, led by Hokkaido University, Japan. Significant correlation was found between author’s structural position in the network and research performance, thus further supporting a well-studied phenomenon that centrality effects research productivity. However, it was the PageRank centrality that out-performed degree and betweenness centrality in its strength of correlation with research performance.","Kumar, Sameer; Markscheffel, Bernd",Scientometrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101558/,20
6541,Anti-inflammatory effects of Reduning Injection (热毒宁注射液) on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury of rats,2014-06-10,"Acute liver failure represents a serious life-threatening event comparable to acute heart failure with cardiogenic shock or acute renal failure. Underlying acute liver diseases leading to hepatic failure differ between different geographic regions and in their incidence rates. In Europe etiological agents like viruses, drugs and toxins predominate over other much rarer causes. The different noxious agents lead to hepatocellular necrosis and/or apoptosis with loss of liver cell specific functions subsequent to a fall of functioning hepatocytes below a critical number. The syndrome is clinically characterized by the rapid onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 7 days after a first manifestation of liver disease (fulminant liver disease). Liver failure in patients with preexisting chronic liver disease is largely defined by the time which elapses between the occurrence of jaundice and encephalopathy (hyperacute, acute, subacute liver failure). The acute loss of liver specific functions is accompanied by a number of severe life-threatening complications like cerebral edema, circulatory failure, infections, renal failure and defective coagulation. Management of patients with fulminant liver disease requires a profound knowledge of hepatology and intensive care medicine. A close cooperation with a liver transplant unit is an absolute prerequisite for successful therapy. Permanent or temporary auxiliary liver replacement by a healthy human liver allows for a survival of 60 to 70% of patients selected for such a transplant procedure. Progress has been made in the temporary substitution of specific liver cell functions bridging the time period between liver failure and resumption of hepatocellular functions or availability of a donor liver. Different artificial livers have been designed and introduced into clinical trials. However, further evaluation is urgently needed.","Holstege, Axel",Intensivmed Notfallmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101717/,20
6675,Tumor necrosis factor as a pharmacological target,2005,"Apelin is a peptide hormone that binds to a class A GPCR (the apelin receptor/APJ) to regulate various bodily systems. Upon signal peptide removal, the resulting 55-residue isoform, proapelin/apelin-55, can be further processed to 36-, 17-, or 13-residue isoforms with length-dependent pharmacological properties. Processing was initially proposed to occur intracellularly. However, detection of apelin-55 in extracellular fluids indicates that extracellular processing may also occur. To test for this, apelin-55 was applied exogenously to HEK293A cells overexpressing proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 3 (PCSK3), the only apelin processing enzyme identified thus far, and to differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which endogenously express apelin, PCSK3 and other proprotein convertases. Analysis of culture media constituents from each cell type by high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and western blot demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in apelin-55 levels. This decrease was partially, but not fully, attenuated by PCSK inhibitor treatment in both cell lines. Comparison of the resulting apelin-55-derived peptide profile between the two cell lines demonstrated distinct processing patterns, with apelin-36 production apparent in 3T3-L1 adipocytes vs. detection of the prodomain of a shorter isoform (likely the apelin-13 prodomain, observed after additional proteolytic processing) in PCSK3-transfected HEK293A cells. Extracellular processing of apelin, with distinct cell type dependence, provides an alternative mechanism to regulate isoform-mediated physiological effects of apelin.

Three therapeutic strategies of TIPS placement were used: (1) TIPS placement followed by portal vein recanalization via the shunt, (2) portal vein recanalization via percutaneous approaches followed by TIPS placement, and (3) TIPS insertion between a hepatic vein and a large collateral vessel without portal vein recanalization. Four approaches were used to access the portal vein: transjugular, transhepatic, transsplenic, and transmesenteric. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to hepatic capsule perforation was lethal in only three patients. No episode of pulmonary embolism was reported. Other procedure-related complications were reversible. The overall incidence of shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy was 8–33% and 0–50%, respectively. In conclusion, the reviewed studies uniformly support the feasibility and safety of TIPS for PVT even in the presence of portal cavernoma. Further, several major issues that remain unresolved are discussed.","Qi, Xingshun; Han, Guohong",Hepatol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101972/,20

Severe infections could lead to life-threatening complications, especially in young children and the elderly. Understanding the distribution of the incubation period, which is currently inconsistent and ambiguous, can help in controlling the burden of disease. We conducted a systematic review of outbreak investigation reports, extracted individual incubation data and summary estimates, tested for heterogeneity, classified studies into subgroups with limited heterogeneity, and undertook a meta-analysis to identify factors that may contribute to the distribution of the pathogen’s incubation period. Twenty-eight studies were identified for inclusion in the review (1 of which included information on 2 outbreaks), and the resulting I(2) value was 77%, indicating high heterogeneity. Studies were classified into 5 subgroups, with the mean incubation period ranging from 3.5 to 8.1 days. The length of the incubation period increased with patient age and decreased by 7.2 hours with every 10% increase in attack rate.","Awofisayo-Okuyelu, Adedoyin; Brainard, Julii; Hall, Ian; McCarthy, Noel",Epidemiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108491/,20

There is evidence that cell-mediated responses may be involved and to extend these observations, rotavirus antigen and the three major T cell subsets, BoCD4(+), BoCD8(+), and BoWC1(+)γ/δ lymphocytes were immunostained in tissue sections from calves killed at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days post inoculation and quantified by image analysis. It was established that in control calves, BoCD4(+) lymphocytes were predominantly in the lamina propria, while the majority of BoCD8(+) and BoWC1(+)γ/δ lymphocytes were in the epithelium. Rotavirus infection was seen throughout the small intestine with the greatest amount of viral antigen detected at 4 days post inoculation in the mid and distal small intestine. Increased numbers of all subsets were detected; small increases in intraepithelial BoCD4(+) and BoWC1(+)γ/δ T lymphocytes were observed especially in the distal small intestine, while larger increases in BoCD8(+) cells were detected in the epithelium and lamina propria of the proximal, mid and distal small intestine. The timing and location of these increases in T lymphocyte subsets is indicative of a specific immune response involving BoCD8(+) and BoWC1(+)γ/δ T lymphocytes.","Parsons, K.R.; Hall, G.A.; Bridger, J.C.; Cook, R.S.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119536/,20

Furthermore, a significant decrease of infectious virus coincides with the appearance of prominent inflammatory infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord. In the present study, mononuclear cells infiltrating the brain during JHMV infection were isolated and characterized. While all subsets of immune cells were present, there appeared to be a temporal relationship between the peak incidence of CD8(+) T cells (40% of total isolated cells) and reduction of virus at day 7 post-infection. Cells with the natural killer (NK) phenotype (at least 30%) were also present throughout infection. These data suggest that CD8(+) T cells and NK cells are prominent among cells which infiltrate the brain during JHM virus infection and may have important roles in reduction of virus within the CNS.","Williamson, Jo S.P.; Sykes, Karin C.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119758/,20

The pioneer work conducted with the adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mouse provided irrefutable evidence that excess adenosine (ADO) accumulating in the lungs of asthmatic patients, constitutes a powerful mediator of disease severity. These original studies launched the development of murine strains for the two major ectonucleotidases responsible for the generation of airway ADO from ATP release: CD39 and CD73. The dramatic acute lung injury and chronic lung complications, manifested by these knockout mice in response to allergens and endotoxin, demonstrated the critical importance of regulating the availability of ATP and ADO for their receptors. Therapeutic targets are currently evaluated using knockout mice and agonists/antagonists for each ADO receptor (A(1)R, A(2A)R, A(2B)R, and A(3)R) and the predominant ATP receptors (P2Y(2)R and P2X(7)R).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Sprague-Dawley rats, partial cystectomy (>50%) was performed, followed by BAMG augmentation cystoplasty. After 4 months, organ bath studies of tissue strips in 10 were used to compare the contractility of the BAMG regenerates and the corresponding host detrusor smooth muscle. RESULTS: The BAMG regenerates exhibited contractile activity to electrical field stimulation and a qualitatively identical pattern of response to muscarinic, purinergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic drug administration and nitric oxide. At 4 months after surgery, the maximum forces of contraction of the BAMG regenerates to carbachol stimulation amounted to close to 80% of the host bladder response. With electrical field stimulation, they equaled 44% and 62% of the host bladder response after 2.5 and 4 months, respectively. Histological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of receptors for neurotransmitters that these functional in vitro studies implied. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides further evidence that augmentation cystoplasty with the BAMG leads to functional regeneration of the rat bladder detrusor smooth muscle.","PIECHOTA, HANS J.; DAHMS, STEFAN E.; NUNES, LORA S.; DAHIYA, RAJVIR; LUE, TOM F.; TANAGHO, EMIL A.",J Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126917/,20

The ground rice culture was mixed with a commercial purified diet at concentrations of 5, 7·5 and 10% and the fungal mat at concentrations of 1, 2 and 3%. In groups fed the rice-culture diets, weight gains were reduced and all the rats in the group fed the 10% diet died. Rats fed fungal-mat diets showed a marked reduction in weight gain, and the death rate was high (about 83%) in groups fed the 2 or 3% diet. Gross lesions found in groups fed either type of diet included focal necrosis in the liver, greenish discoloration of the kidneys, gastric ulceration, ulceration of the scrotal epidermis and corneal opacity. Histological changes in the liver included necrosis of the epithelium of biliary ducts, periductal oedema, pericholangitis, periductal fibrosis and disseminated focal hepatocellular necrosis. Necrosis of epithelium occurred also in the extraheptic ducts and was accompanied by an interstitial pancreatitis in certain rats. Foci of leucocytes and macrophages were found in the dermis of the scrotum and in the epididymal adipose connective tissue. Ulceration of the epidermis occurred late in the sequence of scrotal changes. Ocular lesions comprised corneal oedema, interstitital keratitis, iridocyclitis and hypopyon. Renal lesions consisted of tubular necrosis and hyaline and biliary casts within convoluted tubules.","Zimmermann, J.L.; Carlton, W.W.; Tuite, J.",Food Cosmet Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130234/,20
8662,Diagnostic Virology,2018-07-30,"A major antigen of the brush border membrane of Torpedo marmorata kidney was identified and purified by immunoprecipitation. The sequence of its 18 N terminal amino acids was determined and found to be very similar to that of mammalian aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2). Indeed aminopeptidase N activity was efficiently immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 180K1. The purified antigen gives a broad band at 180 kDa after SDS-gel electrophoresis, which, after treatment by endoglycosidase F, is converted to a thinner band at 140 kDa. This antigen is therefore heavily glycosylated. Depending on solubilization conditions, both the antigen and peptidase activity were recovered either as a broad peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 18S (2% CHAPS) or as a single peak of 7.8S (1% CHAPS plus 0.2 % C(12)E(9)), showing that Torpedo aminopeptidase N behaves as an oligomer stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, easily converted into a 160 kDa monomer. The antigen is highly concentrated in the apical membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells (600 gold particles/μm(2) of brush border membrane) whereas no labeling could be detected in other cell types or in other membranes of the same cells (basolatéral membranes, vacuoles or vesicles). Monoclonal antibodies prepared here will be useful tools for further functional and structural studies of Torpedo kidney aminopeptidase N.","O'Callaghan, Barbara; Synguelakis, Monique; Le Gal La Salle, Gildas; Morel, Nicolas",Biol Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131328/,20

The CDV Cornell A75-17 strain produces a delayed, subacute to chronic, demyelinating CNS disease. In contrast, the Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) strain-associated neurological disease is more acute in onset, is usually non-demyelinating and primarily produces lesions in the gray matter. In these studies we describe the effects of these two virulent and one avirulent CDV strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), on astrocytes in dissociated canine brain cell cultures. In multiple replicate experiments, astrocytes were infected most rapidly by CDV-RO [100% of astrocytes were infected by 14 days post-inoculation (pi.)]. This strain caused severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytolysis. CDV-SH similarly produced a rapid infection of the astrocytes. In contrast, CDV A75-17 infected less than 25% of the astrocyte population during the first 28 days p.i. (± 7 days); after 28 days p.i., a rapid rise in astrocyte infection occurred. Both virulent viruses caused astrocytic syncytial formation but did not cause cytolysis of the astrocyte population as was observed with the attenuated virus. Titers of infectious virus, released into the supernatant fluid, reflected the degree of astrocyte infection. Virus released by the cultures late in CDV A75-17 infection showed enhanced ability to infect newly derived astrocytes; in contrast, brain cell passaged CDV-SH did not show increased growth in these cells. These results show that (1) there is a difference in growth rate, CPE and capacity for adaptation of three different CDV strains in astrocytes in vitro, and (2) some aspects of the disease (such as persistence in white matter) produced by the virulent strains in vivo may be related to the course of astrocyte infection observed in vitro.","Pearce-Kelling, Susan; Mitchell, William J.; Summers, Brian A.; Appel, Max J.G.",Microb Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135698/,20

Pediatric inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are clinically heterogeneous with respect to their mode of presentation, clinical severity, rate of progression, and prognosis. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the CNS, typically transitory and self-limiting. The highest incidence of ADEM is observed during childhood. It is characterized by an acute encephalopathy with polyfocal neurological deficits. In the absence of specific biological markers the diagnosis of ADEM is still based on clinical features and MRI evidence of widespread demyelination, after ruling out other possible explanations for an acute encephalopathy. Over the past decade, many retrospective patient studies have focused on clinical and neuroimaging features, in an attempt to define specific diagnostic criteria. The occurrence of relapses in children with ADEM poses diagnostic difficulties in its differentiation from multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). With the widespread use of high-dose steroids, the long-term prognosis of ADEM with regard to functional and cognitive recovery is favorable.

The present study was performed in order to clarify a) the cause of the wasting syndrome and b) the protective role of antigen‐specific milk antibodies. METHOD: Ig‐deficient mouse embryos in a conventional environment were embryo‐transferred to specified pathogen free (SPF) dams. Neonatal growth, mortality, and health status of mice from both environments was recorded. Suspected presence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was tested by RT‐PCR. Protective effects on neonatal mortality of milk containing different titers of anti‐MHV antibodies were investigated in cross‐fostering experiments. RESULTS: The SPF colony of Ig‐deficient mice exhibited no breeding problems, whereas Ig‐deficient neonates in the conventional environment suffered from lethal wasting syndrome. Serological screening of the mice kept in the two environments revealed that mice in the conventional room had high titers of antibodies against mouse hepatitis virus. Presence of MHV in runting neonates was confirmed by pathological examinations and RT‐nested‐PCR using MHV genome specific primers. Milk containing high titers of anti‐MHV antibodies, when provided for 8 days or more, completely prevented Ig‐deficient neonates from developing wasting syndrome in the conventional environment. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the neonatal wasting syndrome is associated with the presence of MHV and that neonates are efficiently protected by MHV‐specific antibodies in the milk.","Gustafsson, Erika; Blomqvist, Gunilla; Bellman, Anna; Holmdahl, Rikard; Mattsson, Anita; Mattsson, Ragnar",Am J Reprod Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159460/,20

RT-PCR using primers to conserved sequences in the ORF1b gene amplified a 794 bp region of either GAV or YHV. Nested PCR using a conserved sense primer and either a GAV- or YHV-specific antisense primer to a divergent sequence differentially amplified a 277 bp region of the primary PCR amplicon. Multiplexing the YHV antisense primer with a GAV antisense primer to another divergent sequence allowed the viruses to be distinguished in a single nested PCR. Nested PCR enhanced detection sensitivity between 100- and 1000-fold and GAV or YHV RNA was detectable in ∼10 fg lymphoid organ total RNA. The multiplex RT-nested PCR was also able to co-detect GAV and YHV RNA mixed over a wide range of concentrations to simulate potential dual-infection states. The robustness of the test was examined using RNA samples from Penaeus monodon prawns infected either chronically or acutely with GAV or YHV and collected at different locations in Eastern Australia and Thailand between 1994 and 1998. GAV- (406 bp) or YHV-specific (277 bp) amplicons were differentially generated in all cases, including five YHV RNA samples in which no primary RT-PCR amplicon was detected.

However, travelers can present quite ill, and delays in recognition and treatment can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. This paper aims to summarize typical presentations of common international diseases and provide the emergency physician with a practical approach based on current guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: In the treatment of traveler’s diarrhea, azithromycin has become the treatment of choice due to the growing antibiotic resistance. Intravenous artesunate was approved in 2019 under investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of severe malaria, and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have become the first-line treatment for most cases of uncomplicated malaria. Since the 2015 outbreak, Zika has become a concern to many travelers, but the current treatment is supportive. SUMMARY: Clinicians should be aware of a few noteworthy updates in the treatment of internationally acquired illnesses, but more importantly, they must recognize warning signs of severe illness and treat promptly. Future research on workup and disposition could help emergency physicians identify which patients need admission in well-appearing febrile travelers.","Throckmorton, Laura; Hancher, Jonathan",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200320/,20

While the vaccine is now available, social acceptance remains relatively uncertain in many societies. The purpose of this study was to examine the beliefs, attitudes and practices associated with the intention to get vaccinated against the A/H1N1 virus among the general population in France. Methods: A representative sample of 1001 individuals (stratified random recruitment procedure, ages 16–90 years) was interviewed by telephone. The questionnaire included a variety of items associated with socio-demographic characteristics, risk perceptions, illness perceptions, political attitudes and worldviews as well as intention to get vaccinated. Results: More than 6 out of 10 of the respondents indicated that they planned to get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available. The same proportion of parents also reported the intention to vaccinate their children against the disease. In multiple regression analyses, socio-cognitive factors consistently predicting influenza A/H1N1 vaccination were: level of worry, risk perception and previous experience of vaccine against seasonal flu. Conclusions: The factors found to predict vaccination intention and their distribution are assumed to be a consequence of the fact that people perceive the risk of swine flu to be similar to that of seasonal flu. As a result, in the absence of an increase of the risk perception of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, a very low level of actual vaccination is forecasted. Behavioural change would require that the risks and consequences of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 be perceived as highly different from seasonal flu.","Setbon, Michel; Raude, Jocelyn",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314046/,20

Single-session interventions (SSIs) have helped reduce youth psychopathology across multiple trials, promising to broaden access to effective, low-intensity supports. Online, self-guided SSIs may be uniquely scalable, particularly if they are freely available for as-needed use. However, the acceptability of online SSI and their efficacy have remained unexamined outside of controlled trials, and their practical utility is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the perceived acceptability and proximal effects of Project YES (Youth Empowerment & Support), an open-access platform offering three online SSIs for youth internalizing distress. METHODS: After selecting one of three SSIs to complete, participants (ages 11-17 years) reported pre- and post-SSI levels of clinically relevant outcomes that SSIs may target (eg, hopelessness, self-hate) and perceived SSI acceptability. User-pattern variables, demographics, and depressive symptoms were collected to characterize youths engaging with YES. RESULTS: From September 2019 through March 2020, 694 youths accessed YES, 539 began, and 187 completed a 30-minute, self-guided SSI. SSI completers reported clinically elevated depressive symptoms, on average, and were diverse on several dimensions (53.75% non-white; 78.10% female; 43.23% sexual minorities). Regardless of SSI selection, completers reported pre- to post-program reductions in hopelessness (d(av)=0.53; d(z)=0.71), self-hate (d(av)=0.32; d(z)=0.61), perceived control (d(av)=0.60; d(z)=0.72) and agency (d(av)=0.39; d(z)=0.50).

The present study aimed to identify and validate promoter methylation-driven genes (PMDGs) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods: Based on GSE49149 and the PDAC cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), differential analyses of promoter methylation, correlation analysis, and Cox regression analysis were performed to identify PMDGs. The promoter methylation level was assessed by bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP) in paired tumor and normal tissues of 72 PDAC patients. Kaplan−Meier survival analyses were performed to evaluate the clinical value of PMDGs. Results: In GSE49149, the β-value of the dipeptidyl peptidase like 6 (DPP6) promoter was significantly higher in tumor compared with normal samples (0.50 vs. 0.24, P<0.001). In the PDAC cohort of TCGA, the methylation level of the DPP6 promoter was negatively correlated with mRNA expression (r = −0.54, P<0.001). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, hypermethylation of the DPP6 promoter was an independent risk factor for PDAC (hazard ratio (HR) = 543.91, P=0.002). The results of BSP revealed that the number of methylated CG sites in the DPP6 promoter was greater in tumor samples than in normal samples (7.43 vs. 2.78, P<0.001). The methylation level of the DPP6 promoter was moderately effective at distinguishing tumor from normal samples (area under ROC curve (AUC) = 0.74, P<0.001). Hypermethylation of the DPP6 promoter was associated with poor overall (HR = 3.61, P<0.001) and disease-free (HR = 2.01, P=0.016) survivals for PDAC patients. Conclusion: These results indicate that DPP6 promoter methylation is a potential prognostic biomarker for PDAC.","Zhao, Xin; Cao, Di; Ren, Zhangyong; Liu, Zhe; Lv, Shaocheng; Zhu, Jiqiao; Li, Lixin; Lang, Ren; He, Qiang",Biosci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7396423/,20

As a response to those events, forensic scientists from the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin in cooperation with historians from the Institute of National Remembrance started the project of the Polish Genetic Database of Victims of Totalitarianism, which aim is to identify victims killed in the years 1939–1956. Several exhumations were done under the project, with the biggest one done in Białystok. According to the information gathered by local historians, a detention centre in Białystok was the place of the secret burials in late 1940s and 1950s. Surprisingly, except few graves from the post-war period, most of the burials found in Białystok indicated that majority the victims were probably local civilians who died during the Nazi occupation. Unfortunately, data concerning what happened in the detention ward during that period of time is not very detailed. What was known is that people who got incarcerated were “political prisoners” what, according to Nazi politics, was based on their nationality, religion and activity against the Third Reich. The aim of this research was to test genetically the remains found in Białystok to determine their possible ethnic background, in order to shed new light on the victims and what happened in the Białystok detention centre during the Nazi occupation. The analysis of male specific region of the human Y chromosome shows that including phylogenetic analysis into the complex process led by the Polish Genetic Database of Victims of Totalitarianism may help with the final identification of hundreds of anonymous victims.","Diepenbroek, Marta; Cytacka, Sandra; Szargut, Maria; Arciszewska, Joanna; Zielińska, Grażyna; Ossowski, Andrzej",Int J Legal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6373375/,20

Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level is changed during the menopause transition, while the effect of FSH on menopausal depression has remained undefined. In this study we investigated whether or how FSH affected menopausal depression in postmenopausal (ovariectomized) FSHR knockout mice (Fshr(−/−)). We found that Fshr(−/−) mice displayed aggravated depression-like behaviors, accompanied by severe oxidative stress in the whole brain, resulted from significantly reduced glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLm) in glutathione synthesis and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in NADP/NADPH transition. Importantly, administration of ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 150 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1), i.p. for 12 weeks) attenuated the depression-like behaviors of Fshr(−/−) mice. Consistent with these in vivo experiment results, we found that pretreatment with FSH (50, 100 ng/mL) dose-dependently increased protein levels of GCLm and G6PD, and decreased the ROS production in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells. These findings demonstrate that FSH signaling is involved in pathogenesis of menopausal depression, and likely to maintain the redox-optimized ROS balance in neurons.","Bi, Wen-kai; Shao, Shan-shan; Li, Zhi-wei; Ruan, Yong-wei; Luan, Si-si; Dong, Zhen-hua; Wang, Jing; Wu, Shan-shan; Guo, Tian; Ma, Shi-zhan; Gao, Ling; Zhao, Jia-jun; He, Zhao",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468367/,20
12823,Development and characterization of an inducible Dicer conditional knockout mouse model of Parkinson’s disease: validation of the antiparkinsonian effects of a sigma-1 receptor agonist and dihydromyricetin,2020-02-28,"Oroxindin is a flavonoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Huang-Qin, which has shown various pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, etc. Thus far, the effect of oroxindin on colonic inflammation and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the tissue distribution of oroxindin and its therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as the underlying mechanisms. UC model was established in mice by administrating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 d. We first showed that oroxindin was largely absorbed by the colon as an active ingredient after normal mice received Huang-Qin-Tang, a traditional Chinese medicine decoction. UC mice were then treated with oroxindin (12.5, 25, 50 mg ·kg(−1) ·d(−1), i.g.) for 10 d. We found that oroxindin treatment greatly suppressed massive macrophages infiltration and attenuated pathological changes in colonic tissue. Furthermore, oroxindin treatment significantly inhibited the generation of IL-1β and IL-18 in the colon via inhibiting the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome formation and activation. In cultured macrophages, LPS induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation, which were suppressed by oroxindin (12.5–50 μM). In LPS-treated macrophages, oroxindin dose-dependently restored the expression of TXNIP protein, leading to suppressing TXNIP-dependent NF-κB activation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that oroxindin could be absorbed by the colon and attenuate inflammatory responses via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation, which is related to the inhibitory effect on TXNIP-dependent NF-κB-signaling pathway. Hence, oroxindin has the potential of becoming an effective drug for treating UC.","Liu, Qi; Zuo, Rui; Wang, Kai; Nong, Fei-fei; Fu, Ya-jun; Huang, Shao-wei; Pan, Zeng-feng; Zhang, Yi; Luo, Xia; Deng, Xiang-liang; Zhang, Xiao-xue; Zhou, Lian; Chen, Yang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468572/,20

A number of clinical cancer treatment modalities, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, photothermal and photodynamic therapy, have been shown to elicit immunogenicity by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, ICD-based immunotherapy is restricted by the ITM limiting its efficacy in eliciting a long-term antitumor immune response, and by severe systemic toxicity. To address these challenges, nanomedicine-based drug delivery strategies have been exploited for improving cancer immunotherapy by boosting ICD of the tumor cells. Nanosized drug delivery systems are promising for increasing drug accumulation at the tumor site and codelivering ICD inducers and immune inhibitors to simultaneously elicit the immune response and relieve the ITM. This review highlights the recent advances in nanomedicine-based immunotherapy utilizing ICD-based approaches. A perspective on the clinical translation of nanomedicine-based cancer immunotherapy is also provided.","Gao, Jing; Wang, Wei-qi; Pei, Qing; Lord, Megan S.; Yu, Hai-jun",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470797/,20
12864,Melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon attenuates mouse acute and chronic ischemic brain injury,2020-02-27,"Paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain (PINP) is refractory to currently used analgesics. Previous studies show a pivotal role of oxidative stress in PINP. Because the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been considered as the critical regulator of endogenous antioxidant defense, we here explored whether activation of Nrf2 could attenuate PINP. A rat model of PINP was established by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (2 mg/kg) every other day with a final cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg. Hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) in response to von Frey filament stimuli were used to assess mechanical allodynia. We showed that a single dose of Nrf2 activator, oltipraz (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg), dose-dependently attenuated established mechanical allodynia, whereas repeated injection of oltipraz (100 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), i.p. from d 14 to d 18) almost abolished the mechanical allodynia in PINP rats. The antinociceptive effect of oltipraz was blocked by pre-injection of Nrf2 inhibitor trigonelline (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Early treatment with oltipraz (100 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), i.p. from d 0 to d 6) failed to prevent the development of the PINP, but delayed its onset. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly upregulated in the spinal cord of PINP rats. Repeated injection of oltipraz caused further elevation of the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the spinal cord of PINP rats, which was reversed by pre-injection of trigonelline. These results demonstrate that oltipraz ameliorates PINP via activating Nrf2/HO-1-signaling pathway in the spinal cord.","Zhou, Ya-qun; Liu, Dai-qiang; Chen, Shu-ping; Chen, Nan; Sun, Jia; Wang, Xiao-mei; Cao, Fei; Tian, Yu-ke; Ye, Da-wei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470811/,20

Relaxin-2 (RL2) has been linked to the presence and size of arterial aneurysms, and to the extent of atherosclerosis in human subjects. Here, we assessed the expression levels of RL2 in aneurysmal (AA, n = 16) and atherosclerotic (ATH, n = 22) arteries, and established the correlation between RL2 levels and the presence/size of AA and the clinical severity of atherosclerosis. The expression levels of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) were also detected for correlations with different phenotypes of atherosclerosis and AA. Temporal artery biopsy specimens (n = 6) and abdominal aortic tissues harvested from accident victims during autopsy (n = 10) were used as controls. Quantitative tissue biomarker analysis revealed that tissue-specific RL2 was increased in patients with larger or symptomatic AA compared to subjects with atherosclerotic disease and healthy controls. In situ RL2 levels were proportional to the size and the severity of aneurysmatic disease, and were substantially elevated in patients with symptomatic aneurysm of any diameter or asymptomatic aneurysm of a diameter >350% of that of the normal artery. In contrast, tissue RL2 was inversely associated with the clinical severity of atherosclerotic lesions. Correlation between RL2 and MMP2 was different between ATH1 and ATH2, depending on atherosclerosis grade. Overall, tissue RL2 is differentially associated with discrete phenotypes of arterial disease and might exert multipotent biological effects on vascular wall integrity and remodeling in human subjects.","Papoutsis, Konstantinos; Kapelouzou, Alkistis; Georgiopoulos, Georgios; Kontogiannis, Christos; Kourek, Christos; Mylonas, Konstantinos S; Patelis, Nikolaos; Cokkinos, Dennis V; Karavokyros, Ioannis; Georgopoulos, Sotirios",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471450/,20

However, DD is largely unexplored in the critically ill pediatric population. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with DD, and to investigate the effects of DD on clinical outcomes among critically ill children. METHODS: Diaphragmatic function was assessed by diaphragm ultrasound. According to the result of diaphragmatic ultrasound, all enrolled subjects were categorized into the DD group (n = 24) and the non-DD group (n = 46). Collection of sample characteristics in both groups include age, sex, height, weight, primary diagnosis, complications, laboratory findings, medications, ventilatory time and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The incidence of DD in this PICU was 34.3%. The level of CRP at discharge (P = 0.003) in the DD group was higher than the non-DD group, and duration of elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.001), sedative days (P = 0.008) and ventilatory treatment time (P < 0.001) in the DD group was significantly longer than the non-DD group. Ventilatory treatment time and duration of elevated CRP were independently risk factors associated with DD. Patients in the DD group had longer PICU length of stay, higher rate of weaning or extubation failure and higher mortality. CONCLUSION: DD is associated with poorer clinical outcomes in critically ill childern, which include a longer PICU length of stay, higher rate of weaning or extubation failure and a higher mortality. The ventilatory treatment time and duration of elevated CRP are main risk factors of DD in critically ill children.

METHODS: Prospective, randomized, double-masked, non-inferiority, 12-week clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to SML group or TCL group. Patients in the SML group were treated with 577 nm micropulse laser. The spot size was 160 µm, the duty cycle was 5% and exposure time was 0.2 s. The power was 50% threshold tested. Patients in the TCL group were treated with 577 nm continuous laser. The power was 100% threshold tested. The primary outcome was the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 12, with a non-inferiority limit of five letters on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity charts. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were enroled. Seventy-seven patients were male. Forty-four patients were in SML group and 44 in TCL group. At week 12, SML was equivalent to TCL with a gain of 6.23 ± 8.59 and 6.61 ± 6.35 letters, respectively, (SML–TCL difference: −0.38 letters; 95% confidence interval (CI):−3.58–2.81; P(non-inferiority) = 0.0026). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (t = 0.240, P = 0.811). At week 12, the proportion of patients whose SRF had been totally absorbed was 63.63 and 81.82% respectively for SML and TCL groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (χ(2) = 3.67, P = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Both SML and TCL can improve visual acuity in CSC.

Recently, its use has increased for a variety of clinical indications. To guide clinical practice, we developed evidence-based recommendations regarding use of HFNC in various clinical settings. METHODS: We formed a guideline panel composed of clinicians, methodologists and experts in respiratory medicine. Using GRADE, the panel developed recommendations for four actionable questions. RESULTS: The guideline panel made a strong recommendation for HFNC in hypoxemic respiratory failure compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) (moderate certainty), a conditional recommendation for HFNC following extubation (moderate certainty), no recommendation regarding HFNC in the peri-intubation period (moderate certainty), and a conditional recommendation for postoperative HFNC in high risk and/or obese patients following cardiac or thoracic surgery (moderate certainty).

Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics and CyTOF-based single-cell protein quantification to characterize peripheral immune cells during EBOV infection in rhesus monkeys. We obtained 100,000 transcriptomes and 15,000,000 protein profiles, finding that immature, proliferative monocyte-lineage cells with reduced antigen-presentation capacity replace conventional monocyte subsets, while lymphocytes upregulate apoptosis genes and decline in abundance. By quantifying intracellular viral RNA, we identify molecular determinants of tropism among circulating immune cells and examine temporal dynamics in viral and host gene expression. Within infected cells, EBOV downregulates STAT1 mRNA and interferon signaling, and it upregulates putative pro-viral genes (e.g., DYNLL1 and HSPA5), nominating pathways the virus manipulates for its replication. This study sheds light on EBOV tropism, replication dynamics, and elicited immune response and provides a framework for characterizing host-virus interactions under maximum containment.","Kotliar, Dylan; Lin, Aaron E.; Logue, James; Hughes, Travis K.; Khoury, Nadine M.; Raju, Siddharth S.; Wadsworth, Marc H.; Chen, Han; Kurtz, Jonathan R.; Dighero-Kemp, Bonnie; Bjornson, Zach B.; Mukherjee, Nilanjan; Sellers, Brian A.; Tran, Nancy; Bauer, Matthew R.; Adams, Gordon C.; Adams, Ricky; Rinn, John L.; Melé, Marta; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Nolan, Garry P.; Barnes, Kayla G.; Hensley, Lisa E.; McIlwain, David R.; Shalek, Alex K.; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Bennett, Richard S.",Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7707107/,20

We first apply the SWItch Miner (SWIM) methodology, which predicts important (switch) genes within the co-expression network that regulate disease state transitions, then map them to the human protein–protein interaction network (PPI, or interactome) to predict novel disease–disease relationships (i.e., a SWIM-informed diseasome). Although the relevance of switch genes to an observed phenotype has been recently assessed, their performance at the system or network level constitutes a new, potentially fascinating territory yet to be explored. Quantifying the interplay between switch genes and human diseases in the interactome network, we found that switch genes associated with specific disorders are closer to each other than to other nodes in the network, and tend to form localized connected subnetworks. These subnetworks overlap between similar diseases and are situated in different neighborhoods for pathologically distinct phenotypes, consistent with the well-known topological proximity property of disease genes. These findings allow us to demonstrate how SWIM-based correlation network analysis can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new disease gene associations. When integrated with an interactome-based network analysis, it not only identifies novel candidate disease genes, but also may offer testable hypotheses by which to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of human disease and reveal commonalities between seemingly unrelated diseases.","Paci, Paola; Fiscon, Giulia; Conte, Federica; Wang, Rui-Sheng; Farina, Lorenzo; Loscalzo, Joseph",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819998/,20
15659,The Development of a Standardized Quality Assessment Material to Support Xpert(®) HIV-1 Viral Load Testing for ART Monitoring in South Africa,2021-01-22,"Regulated cell death (RCD) has always been considered a tolerogenic event. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurs as a consequence of tumour cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), triggering an immune response. ICD plays a major role in stimulating the function of the immune system in cancer during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. ICD can therefore represent one of the routes to boost anticancer immune responses. According to the recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (2018), apoptosis (type I cell death) and necrosis (type II cell death) represent are not the only types of RCD, which also includes necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and others. Specific downstream signalling molecules and death-inducing stimuli can regulate distinct forms of ICD, which develop and promote the immune cell response. Dying cells deliver different potential immunogenic signals, such as DAMPs, which are able to stimulate the immune system. The acute exposure of DAMPs can prime antitumour immunity by inducing activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), leading to the downstream response by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells (NK). As ICD represents an important target to direct and develop new pharmacological interventions, the identification of bioactive natural products, which are endowed with low side effects, higher tolerability and preferentially inducing immunogenic programmed cell death, represents a priority in biomedical research. The ability of ICD to drive the immune response depends on two major factors, neither of which is intrinsic to cell death: ‘Antigenicity and adjuvanticity’. Indeed, the use of natural ICD-triggering molecules, alone or in combination with different (immuno)therapies, can result in higher efficacy and tolerability. Here, we focused on natural (marine) compounds, particularly on marine microalgae derived molecules such as exopolysaccharides, sulphated polysaccharides, glycopeptides, glycolipids, phospholipids, that are endowed with ICD-inducing properties and sulfavants. Here, we discuss novel and repurposed small-molecule ICD triggers, as well as their ability to target important molecular pathways including the IL-6, TNF-α and interferons (IFNs), leading to immune stimulation, which could be used alone or in combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer prevention and therapies.","Sansone, Clementina; Bruno, Antonino; Piscitelli, Concetta; Baci, Denisa; Fontana, Angelo; Brunet, Christophe; Noonan, Douglas M.; Albini, Adriana",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912082/,20

A limited number of studies have evaluated the association of liver enzymes with both general and abdominal obesity in the general population; data for the Bangladeshi population are not available yet. This study aimed to assess the relationship of serum liver enzymes activity with both general and abdominal obesity in Bangladeshi adults. In total, 540 blood samples were obtained from the participants (388 males and 152 females) and analyzed for serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP using standard methods. General obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27.5 kg/m(2) and abdominal obesity was defined as waist circumference (WC) ≥ 90 cm in males and ≥ 80 cm in females. The relationship between liver enzymes and obesity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression models. Overall, 58% of participants in the general obesity group and 55% of the participants in the abdominal obesity group had at least one or more elevated levels of liver enzymes. The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was significantly higher in the obesity group compared to the normal BMI and WC groups (p < 0.05 for all cases). The mean level of serum ALT, AST and GGT were significantly higher in the obesity group than the normal BMI group (p < 0.05). In the WC groups, mean AST and GGT were significantly higher in the obesity group compared to the normal group (p < 0.05). In regression analysis, serum levels of ALT showed an independent and significant association with general obesity, whereas, serum GGT showed a significant association with both general and abdominal obesity. In conclusion, a high prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was observed among participants included in the present study. Of the four enzymes, serum GGT was independently associated with both general and abdominal obesity. Further studies are required to understand the complex relationship between liver enzymes and obesity in the general population.","Ali, Nurshad; Sumon, Abu Hasan; Fariha, Khandaker Atkia; Asaduzzaman, Md; Kathak, Rahanuma Raihanu; Molla, Noyan Hossain; Mou, Ananya Dutta; Barman, Zitu; Hasan, Mahmudul; Miah, Rakib; Islam, Farjana",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988042/,20

In order to apply the results of a study, we should be able to assess its population external validity. We performed an investigator-initiated randomized controlled trial (RCT) (AIDA study), which compared colistin-meropenem combination therapy to colistin monotherapy in the treatment of patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In order to examine the study’s population external validity and to substantiate the use of AIDA study results in clinical practice, we performed a concomitant observational trial. METHODS: The study was conducted between October 1st, 2013 and January 31st, 2017 (during the RCTs recruitment period) in Greece, Israel and Italy. Patients included in the observational arm of the study have fulfilled clinical and microbiological inclusion criteria but were excluded from the RCT due to receipt of colistin for > 96 h, refusal to participate, or prior inclusion in the RCT. Non-randomized cases were compared to randomized patients. The primary outcome was clinical failure at 14 days of infection onset. RESULTS: Analysis included 701 patients. Patients were infected mainly with Acinetobacter baumannii [78.2% (548/701)]. The most common reason for exclusion was refusal to participate [62% (183/295)]. Non-randomized and randomized patients were similar in most of the demographic and background parameters, though randomized patients showed minor differences towards a more severe infection. Combination therapy was less common in non-randomized patients [31.9% (53/166) vs. 51.2% (208/406), p = 0.000]. Randomized patients received longer treatment of colistin [13 days (IQR 10–16) vs. 8.5 days (IQR 0–15), p = 0.000]. Univariate analysis showed that non-randomized patients were more inclined to clinical failure on day 14 from infection onset [82% (242/295) vs. 75.5% (307/406), p = 0.042]. After adjusting for other variables, non-inclusion was not an independent risk factor for clinical failure at day 14. CONCLUSION: The similarity between the observational arm and RCT patients has strengthened our confidence in the population external validity of the AIDA trial. Adding an observational arm to intervention studies can help increase the population external validity and improve implementation of study results in clinical practice.

These discoveries, combined with technological advances in DNA profiling, are shifting the paradigm for cancer diagnosis toward earlier detection with the goal of improving outcomes. Liquid biopsy testing has already revolutionized the way cancer is managed in human medicine – and it is poised to make a similar impact in veterinary medicine. Multiple clinical use cases for liquid biopsy are emerging, including screening, aid in diagnosis, targeted treatment selection, treatment response monitoring, minimal residual disease detection, and recurrence monitoring. This review article highlights key scientific advances in genomics and their relevance for veterinary oncology, with the goal of providing a foundational introduction to this important topic for veterinarians. As these technologies migrate from human medicine into veterinary medicine, improved awareness and understanding will facilitate their rapid adoption, for the benefit of veterinary patients.","Chibuk, Jason; Flory, Andi; Kruglyak, Kristina M.; Leibman, Nicole; Nahama, Alexis; Dharajiya, Nilesh; van den Boom, Dirk; Jensen, Taylor J.; Friedman, Jeffrey S.; Shen, M.

16805,Effect of low-level laser therapy on the inflammatory response in an experimental model of ventilator-induced lung injury,2020-10-27,"The activation status can dictate the fate of an HIV-infected CD4+ T cell. Infected cells with a low level of activation remain latent and do not produce virus, while cells with a higher level of activation are more productive and thus likely to transfer more virions to uninfected cells during cell-to-cell transmission. How the activation status of infected cells affects HIV dynamics under antiretroviral therapy remains unclear. We develop a new mathematical model that structures the population of infected cells continuously according to their activation status. The effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs in blocking cell-to-cell viral transmission decreases as the level of activation of infected cells increases because the more virions are transferred from infected to uninfected cells during cell-to-cell transmission, the less effectively the treatment is able to inhibit the transmission. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the model is shown to determine the existence and stability of the equilibria. Using the principal spectral theory and comparison principle, we show that the infection-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] is less than one. By constructing Lyapunov functional, we prove that the infected equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] is greater than one. Numerical investigation shows that even when treatment can completely block cell-free virus infection, virus can still persist due to cell-to-cell transmission. The random switch between infected cells with different activation levels can also contribute to the replenishment of the latent reservoir, which is considered as a major barrier to viral eradication. This study provides a new modeling framework to study the observations, such as the low viral load persistence, extremely slow decay of latently infected cells and transient viral load measurements above the detection limit, in HIV-infected patients during suppressive antiretroviral therapy.","Guo, Ting; Qiu, Zhipeng; Shen, Mingwang; Rong, Libin",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8049625/,20
17001,Transcriptome and lipidome profile of human mesenchymal stem cells with reduced senescence and increased trilineage differentiation ability upon drug treatment,2021-03-26,"Regenerating functional new neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system has been proven to be very challenging due to the inability of neurons to divide and repopulate themselves after neuronal loss. Glial cells, on the other hand, can divide and repopulate themselves under injury or diseased conditions. We have previously reported that ectopic expression of NeuroD1 in dividing glial cells can directly convert them into neurons. Here, using astrocytic lineage-tracing reporter mice (Aldh1l1-CreER(T2) mice crossing with Ai14 mice), we demonstrate that lineage-traced astrocytes can be successfully converted into NeuN-positive neurons after expressing NeuroD1 through adeno-associated viruses. Retroviral expression of NeuroD1 further confirms that dividing glial cells can be converted into neurons. Importantly, we demonstrate that for in vivo cell conversion study, using a safe level of adeno-associated virus dosage (10(10)–10(12) gc/mL, 1 µL) in the rodent brain is critical to avoid artifacts caused by toxic dosage, such as that used in a recent bioRxiv study (2 × 10(13) gc/mL, 1 µL, mouse cortex). For therapeutic purpose under injury or diseased conditions, or for non-human primate studies, adeno-associated virus dosage needs to be optimized through a series of dose-finding experiments. Moreover, for future in vivo glia-to-neuron conversion studies, we recommend that the adeno-associated virus results are further verified with retroviruses that mainly express transgenes in dividing glial cells in order to draw solid conclusions. The study was approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Jinan University, China (approval No. IACUC-20180330-06) on March 30, 2018.","Xiang, Zongqin; Xu, Liang; Liu, Minhui; Wang, Qingsong; Li, Wen; Lei, Wenliang; Chen, Gong",Neural Regen Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8067918/,20

We propose the use of a deep learning and transfer learning approach based on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for non-invasive classification of SCLC vs. NSCLC brain metastases. Sixty-nine patients with brain metastasis of lung cancer origin were included. Of them, 44 patients had NSCLC and 25 patients had SCLC. Classification was performed with EfficientNet architecture on crop images of lesion areas and based on post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging input data. Evaluation of the model was carried out in a 5-fold cross-validation manner, and based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The best classification results were obtained with multiparametric MRI input data (T1WI+c+FLAIR+T2WI), with a mean overall accuracy of 0.90 ± 0.04, and F1 score of 0.92 ± 0.05 for NSCLC and 0.87 ± 0.08 for SCLC for the validation data and an accuracy of 0.87 ± 0.05, with an F1 score of 0.88 ± 0.05 for NSCLC and 0.85 ± 0.05 for SCLC for the test dataset. The proposed method provides an automatic noninvasive method for the classification of brain metastasis with high sensitivity and specificity for differentiation between NSCLC vs. SCLC brain metastases. It may be used as a diagnostic tool for improving decision-making in the treatment of patients with these metastases. Further studies on larger patient samples are required to validate the current results.","Grossman, Rachel; Haim, Oz; Abramov, Shani; Shofty, Ben; Artzi, Moran",Technol Cancer Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155765/,20
17990,LncRNA Landscape of Coronary Atherosclerosis Reveals Differentially Expressed LncRNAs in Proliferation and Migration of Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells,2021-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Usefulness of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in weaning patients with non-hypercapnic hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (hARF) is unclear. The study aims to assess in patients with non-hypercapnic hARF, the efficacy of NIV after early extubation, compared to standard weaning. METHODS: In this individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE, Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify potentially eligible randomized controlled trials published from database inception to October 2020. To be eligible, studies had to include patients treated with NIV after early extubation and compared to conventional weaning in adult non-hypercapnic hARF patients. Anonymized individual patient data from eligible studies were provided by study investigators. Using one-step and two-step meta-analysis models we tested the difference in total days spent on invasive ventilation. RESULTS: We screened 1605 records. Six studies were included in quantitative synthesis. Overall, 459 participants (mean [SD] age, 62 [15] years; 269 [59%] males) recovering from hARF were included in the analysis (233 in the intervention group and 226 controls). Participants receiving NIV had a shorter duration of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to control group (mean difference, − 3.43; 95% CI − 5.17 to − 1.69 days, p < 0.001), a shorter duration of total days spent on mechanical ventilation (mean difference, − 2.04; 95% CI − 3.82 to − 0.27 days, p = 0.024), a reduced risk of ventilatory associated pneumonia (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.71, p = 0.014), a reduction of time spent in ICU (time ratio, 0.81; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.96, p = 0.015) and in-hospital (time ratio, 0.81; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95, p = 0.010), with no difference in ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although primary studies are limited, using an individual patient data metanalysis approach, NIV after early extubation appears useful in reducing total days spent on invasive mechanical ventilation.

18340,Analysis of putative quadruplex-forming sequences in fungal genomes: novel antifungal targets?,2021-05-06,"We here conducted an image-based chemical screen to evaluate how medically approved drugs, as well as drugs that are currently under development, influence overall translation levels. None of the compounds up-regulated translation, which could be due to the screen being performed in cancer cells grown in full media where translation is already present at very high levels. Regarding translation down-regulators, and consistent with current knowledge, inhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were the most represented class. In addition, we identified that inhibitors of sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) also reduce mRNA translation levels independently of mTOR. Mechanistically, this is explained by an effect of the compounds on the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates the integrated stress response (ISR) and contributes to the toxicity of SPHK inhibitors. Surprisingly, the toxicity and activation of the ISR triggered by 2 independent SPHK inhibitors, SKI-II and ABC294640, the latter in clinical trials, are also observed in cells lacking SPHK1 and SPHK2. In summary, our study provides a useful resource on the effects of medically used drugs on translation, identified compounds capable of reducing translation independently of mTOR and has revealed that the cytotoxic properties of SPHK inhibitors being developed as anticancer agents are independent of SPHKs.","Corman, Alba; Kanellis, Dimitris C.; Michalska, Patrycja; Häggblad, Maria; Lafarga, Vanesa; Bartek, Jiri; Carreras-Puigvert, Jordi; Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183993/,20
18412,Diagnostic and prognostic potential of the proteomic profiling of serum-derived extracellular vesicles in prostate cancer,2021-06-21,"Problematic gaming has been linked to poor sleep outcomes; however, these associations have not yet been synthesized quantitatively. This review employed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between problematic gaming and sleep-related outcomes. A search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar identified a total of 763 studies, including 34 studies (n = 51,901 participants) eligible for inclusion. Papers were included if available in any European language, addressed problematic gaming, contained original data, and provided sufficient data for calculation of effect sizes. Two researchers independently extracted data using pre-defined fields including quality assessment. Sleep-related outcomes were meta-analyzed for sleep parameters that were reported by 5 or more papers. Significant overall effects were found for sleep duration (g = −0.238, 95% CI = −0.364, −0.112), poor sleep quality (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.47, 2.78), daytime sleepiness (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.00, 2.46) and sleep problems (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.94, 3.47). Between-study heterogeneity was detected for all meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed a higher inverse effect size for adolescent samples compared to adult or non-specific age samples in terms of sleep duration. For daytime sleepiness, a larger effect size was found for studies based on single-item sleep measures compared to multi-item sleep measures. For sleep problems, the subgroup analysis showed the opposite with a higher effect size for studies based on single-item sleep measures than multi-item sleep measures. Across all sleep parameters, problematic gamers consistently reported a more adverse sleep status than non-problematic gamers.

18800,Next-generation sequencing diagnostics of bacteremia in pediatric sepsis,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ISLES challenge (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation) enables globally diverse teams to compete to develop advanced tools for stroke lesion analysis with machine learning. Detection of irreversibly damaged tissue on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) is often necessary to determine eligibility for late-time-window thrombectomy. Therefore, the aim of ISLES-2018 was to segment infarcted tissue on CTP based on diffusion-weighted imaging as a reference standard. METHODS: The data, from 4 centers, consisted of 103 cases of acute anterior circulation large artery occlusion stroke who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging rapidly after CTP. Diffusion-weighted imaging lesion segmentation was performed manually and acted as a reference standard. The data were separated into 63 cases for training and 40 for testing, upon which quality metrics (dice score coefficient, Hausdorff distance, absolute lesion volume difference, etc) were computed to rank methods based on their overall performance. RESULTS: Twenty-four different teams participated in the challenge. Median time to CTP was 185 minutes (interquartile range, 180–238), the time between CTP and magnetic resonance imaging was 36 minutes (interquartile range, 25–79), and the median infarct lesion size was 15.2 mL (interquartile range, 5.7–45). The best performance for Dice score coefficient and absolute volume difference were 0.51 and 10.1 mL, respectively, from different teams. Based on the ranking criteria, the top team’s algorithm demonstrated for average Dice score coefficient and average absolute volume difference 0.51 and 10.2 mL, respectively, outperforming the conventional threshold-based method (dice score coefficient, 0.3; volume difference, 15.3). Diverse algorithms were used, almost all based on deep learning, with top-ranked approaches making use of the raw perfusion data as well as methods to synthetically generate complementary information to boost prediction performance. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning methods may predict infarcted tissue from CTP with improved accuracy compared with threshold-based methods used in clinical routine. This dataset will remain public and can be used to test improvement in algorithms over time.","Hakim, Arsany; Christensen, Søren; Winzeck, Stefan; Lansberg, Maarten G.; Parsons, Mark W.; Lucas, Christian; Robben, David; Wiest, Roland; Reyes, Mauricio; Zaharchuk, Greg",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240494/,20

Little data, however, support its widespread use. We hypothesize that the patients with RSCL will have poorer outcomes than those treated with primary fascial closure (PFC). METHODS: Patients operated for acute diverticulitis from 2014 to 2016 using The American College of Surgeons sponsored National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data were reviewed. Two groups were identified: PFC, patients with their closed fascia but skin left open (PFC) and RSCL, patients with their left open fascia after the initial operation. The primary outcome of the study was 30-day mortality, with secondary analyses evaluating complications, discharge location and length of stay. Univariate analysis was initially performed followed by propensity score matching. RESULTS: A total of 460 patients were surgically treated for Hinchey IV diverticulitis of whom 101 (21.9%) had RSCL. The length of stay of the RSCL patients was significantly longer (15 versus 12 days, p, 0.02) than patients in the PFC group. Similarly, the discharge destination for the PFC group was twice as likely to be discharged home as the RSCL group. CONCLUSION: RSCL for acute diverticulitis is a widely used but is associated with prolonged hospitalizations resulting in high rates of discharge to skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities. Its routine use for diverticulitis should be limited.","Berg, Arthur; Rosenzweig, Matthew; Kuo, Yen-Hong; Onayemi, Ayolola; Mohidul, Shawla; Moen, Micaela; Sciarretta, Jason; Davis, John Mihran; Ahmed, Nasim",Langenbecks Arch Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402969/,20

This study aimed to explore the experiences of nurses’ moral distress in the long-term care of older adults via a phenomenological study. METHODS: A qualitative, phenomenological study was conducted with 9 participants using in-depth semi-structured interviews. The purpose was to gain insight into the lived experiences and perceptions of moral distress among ICU nurses in hospitals affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences during their long-term care of older adults. RESULTS: Five major themes are identified from the interviews: advocating, defense mechanisms, burden of care, relationships, and organizational issues. In addition, several subthemes emerged including respectful end of life care, symptom management, coping, spirituality, futile care, emotional work, powerlessness, relationships between patients and families, relationships with healthcare teams, relationships with institutions, inadequate staffing, inadequate training, preparedness, education/mentoring, workload, and support. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study contributes to the limited knowledge and understanding of the challenges nurses face in the ICU.

The pathogenesis of this disease is complicated. Studies have shown that the immune system is involved in the neurodegenerative process of glaucoma. There are continuous evidences that autoantibodies play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. However, focuses on B cells, the antibody-producing cells in glaucoma are surprisingly limited. METHODS: Fresh peripheral blood samples were collected from 44 glaucoma patients (38 with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and 6 with (primary open-angle glaucoma POAG)) and 36 age-matched healthy donors (HD). Density gradient centrifugation was performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Flow cytometry was performed to determine B cell phenotypes. The severity of glaucoma was determined based on the mean deviation (MD) of visual field. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that total B cells was significantly increased in glaucoma patients compared to HD. Next, we checked changes of different B cell subsets in glaucoma. Glaucoma patients were found to have a significant increase in the frequencies of antibody-secreting cells (ASC)/plasmablasts, naïve, and CD19(+) CD27(−) IgD(−) double negative (DN) subpopulations, but a decrease in the CD27(+) IgD(+) unswitched memory compartment. Notably, we found that the increment of CD27(−) IgD(−) DN B cells was significantly magnified according to the clinical severity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate, for the first time, that peripheral B cell subsets are altered and unveil the correlation of a newly identified pro-inflammatory CD27(−) IgD(−) DN subset with clinical features of glaucoma, suggesting that these B cell subsets could serve as potential biomarkers to monitor the disease progression of glaucoma patients.","Yu, Ling; Chen, Yang; Xu, Xiang; Dong, Qiwei; Xiu, Wenbo; Chen, Qinyuan; Wang, Jinxia; He, Chong; Ye, Jian; Lu, Fang",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8464325/,20

22770,Physicians Poster Abstracts,2007-03-21,"In the last decade, developments in molecular (nucleic acid-based) diagnostic methods have made significant improvements in the detection of plant pathogens. By using methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the range of targets that can now be reliably diagnosed has grown to the extent that there are now extremely few, known pathogens that cannot be identified accurately by using laboratory-based diagnostics. However, while the detection of pathogens in individual, infected samples is becoming simpler, there are still many scenarios that present a major challenge to diagnosticians and plant pathologists. Amongst these are the detection of pathogens in soil or viruses in their vectors, high throughput testing and the development of generic methods, that allow samples to be simultaneously screened for large numbers of pathogens. Another major challenge is to develop robust technologies that avoid the reliance on well-equipped central laboratories and making reliable diagnostics available to pathologists in the field or in less-developed countries. In recent years, much of the research carried out on phytodiagnostics has focussed in these areas and as a result many novel, routine diagnostic tests are becoming available. This has been possible due to the introduction of new molecular technologies such real-time PCR and microarrays. These advances have been complemented by the development of new nucleic acid extraction methods, increased automation, reliable internal controls, assay multiplexing and generic amplification methods. With developments in new hardware, field-portable real-time PCR is now also a reality and offers the prospect of ultra-rapid, on-site molecular diagnostics for the first time. In this paper, the development and implementation of new diagnostic methods based upon novel molecular techniques is presented, with specific examples given to demonstrate how these new methods can be used to overcome some long-standing problems.","Mumford, Rick; Boonham, Neil; Tomlinson, Jenny; Barker, Ian",Eur J Plant Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087944/,20

Neutropenia traditionally is risk stratified based on duration and depth of neutropenia. Recipients of chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and stem cell transplants (SCTs) often are deemed as having high risk neutropenia due to significant depth and duration of neutropenia. The mortality associated with febrile neutropenia is up to 11%, and can be as high as 50% in the setting of severe sepsis or septic shock.

24136,Psittacosis,2015-04-21,"The last decade was characterized by the successive introduction of several biological agents for the treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD). Randomized controlled trials (RCT) proved them to have globally acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. However, life-threatening complications are rare events and RCT are underpowered to detect them. As these drugs became more widely prescribed in clinical practice, and particularly, having the information from multiple national biologics registries available, serious adverse events became perceptible. Infection remains the major concern, but other serious and life-threatening complications have emerged, such as malignancies, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disorders, and drug-induced autoimmune syndromes. Several of these are correlated with either the underlying disease or concomitant immunosuppressive medication.

Within this classification there has to be some overlap—for example the HIV virus causing AIDS would appear to be a direct health effect, but a shift in lifestyles that has seen an increase in the number of individuals’ sexual partners—a shift that perhaps reflects a breakdown of family and religious value systems—may be the more fundamental, but indirect, cause.

In most systemic infections, renal involvement is a minor component of the illness, but in some, renal failure may be the presenting feature and the major problem in management. Although individual infectious processes may have a predilection to involve the renal vasculature, glomeruli, interstitium, or collecting systems, a purely anatomic approach to the classification of infectious diseases affecting the kidney is rarely helpful because most infections may involve several different aspects of renal function. In this chapter, a microbiological classification of the organisms affecting the kidney is adopted.

24933,"Protection of Upper Respiratory Tract, Mouth and Eyes",2018-09-25,"The lungs are particularly sensitive to RT, and are often the primary dose-limiting structure during thoracic therapy. The alveolar/capillary units and pneumocytes within the alveoli appear to be particularly sensitive to RT. Hypoxia may be important in the underlying physiology of RT-associated lung injury. The cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), plays an important role in the development of RT-induced fibrosis. The histopathological changes observed in the lung after RT are broadly characterized as diffuse alveolar damage. The interaction between pre-treatment PFTs and the risk of symptomatic lung injury is complex. Similarly, the link between changes in PFTs and the development of symptoms is uncertain. The incidence of symptomatic lung injury increases with increase in most dosimetric parameters. The mean lung dose (MLD) and V20 have been the most-often considered parameters. MLD might be a preferable metric since it considers the entire 3D dose distribution. Radiation to the lower lobes appears to be more often associated with clinical symptoms than is radiation to the upper lobes. This might be related to incidental cardiac irradiation. In pre-clinical models, there appears to be a complex interaction between lung and heart irradiation. TGF-β has been suggested in several studies to predict for RT-induced lung injury, but the data are still somewhat inconsistent. Oral prednisone (Salinas and Winterbauer 1995), typically 40–60 mg daily for 1–2 weeks with a slow taper, is usually effective in treating pneumonitis. There are no widely accepted treatments for fibrosis. A number of chemotherapeutic agents have been suggested to be associated with a range of pulmonary toxicities.","Kelsey, Christopher R.; Vujaskovic, Zeljko; Jackson, Isabel Lauren; Riedel, Richard F.; Marks, Lawrence B.",ALERT &#x02022; Adverse Late Effects of Cancer Treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121399/,20

La progettazione di un processo o di una tecnologia clinica implica, dunque, una fondamentale revisione di un prodotto o di un sistema. Più che cercare di apportare qualche miglioramento marginale, un progettista tende a raffigurarsi il prodotto partendo da zero, ricorrendo alla comprensione del modo naturale in cui gli esseri umani lavorano e interagiscono con la tecnologia. Per contro, l’espressione “miglioramento del processo” suggerisce che il processo in questione presenta alcune carenze, ma che è abbastanza robusto e funzionale. È chiaro, tuttavia, che alcuni processi e sistemi sanitari si sono sviluppati in maniera tale che il miglioramento non è più una soluzione sufficiente.

Here we describe the average family dog in the Western hemisphere owned by an average family without sufficient knowledge about potential hazards their pet might transmit to family members. This chapter is based on semi quantitative risk analysis in order to rank potential health risk transmitted from family dogs to human. Surprisingly every day risk is different from the generally expected potential risk according to traditional ranking of hazards (zoonoses) in dogs in general. Attention is given to human behavior regarding the family dog and responsible dog ownership. Modern trends include pet travel or pet import from endemic to non-endemic areas, without sufficient knowledge amongst pet owners or public health institutes. Of great value is information provided by ESCCAP (www.esccap.org) with information for European countries (veterinarians and pet-owners) on prevalences and prevention of parasitic infections in dogs and cats in the major languages of Europe. Eventually attention is paid to new trends in dog feed such as feeding bones and raw meat. This may have serious consequences for the spread of ordinary zoonoses like Salmonella and parasitic infections not only between dogs, but also to family members. A last point of attention is the prevention of attracting wild life zoonoses via dogs to family members (eg. Echinococcus multilocularis and Baylisascaris spp.). Authorities responsible for public health should be encouraged to pay more attention, not only in providing more regulations, but primary in enforcement of existing rules and stimulating responsible pet-ownership. Companion animal veterinarians and (local) public health authorities, including physicians, should contribute equally in zoonoses prevention programs (‘One health’ approach).","van Knapen, Frans; Overgaauw, Paul",Zoonoses - Infections Affecting Humans and Animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122405/,20

26783,Global control of infectious diseases by vaccination programs,2007,"Dengue is one of the most important mosquito-borne viral infections caused by single-stranded RNA virus that are transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito species. Dengue is endemic in over 140 countries in Asia, the USA, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there are more than 2.5 billion people—mainly occurs in children living in tropical and subtropical countries—at risk of dengue infection with one or more dengue viruses. There are estimated nearly 100 million symptomatic dengue infections occurring worldwide annually, nearly 75% in Asia and the Western Pacific region [1]. During the past decades, the outbreaks of dengue infection have been reported throughout the world with increased severity. Ecologic and demographic changes are considered to be the contributing factors to the emergence of dengue infection in the past decades. Dengue has expanded into new countries and into urban settings associated with increased distribution of A. aegypti, population growth, urbanization, development of slums, migration of population, movement of dengue virus by infected travelers, trade development, and improved diagnostic capabilities in medical practice [2, 3]. Increased transmission of dengue virus in tropical urban areas has been created by substandard housing and crowding as well as deterioration in water, sewer, and waste management systems, all of which are intimately associated with unplanned urbanization [4–7]. So it is likely that dengue will expand its geographic reach and become an increasing burden on health resources in affected areas during the next decade. An effective vector-control management is the only means to reduce dengue infection in endemic areas. Because vector control has achieved only limited success so far in reducing the transmission of dengue, the usage of effective dengue vaccine in target population along with the preventive measures already used such as raising public awareness may be the means to effectively control of this disease in endemic area [8].","Tantawichien, Terapong; Thisayakorn, Usa",Neglected Tropical Diseases - South Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123783/,20

26992,P174 High aerosol production of potentially infectious cough aerosols in people with cystic fibrosis during coughing,2019-05-27,"Pulmonary toxicity is common after cancer therapy and can result from all therapeutic modalities. The consequential decrease in lung function ranges in severity from subclinical to life-threatening or even fatal and can manifest in the acute setting or many years after completion of therapy. Radiation effects are due to direct insult to the pulmonary parenchyma and, for younger children, impaired thoracic musculoskeletal development. Radiation pneumonitis can occur in the acute/subacute setting, as well as fibrosis with comprised gas exchange as a late effect of direct lung irradiation; thoracic wall malformation can cause restriction of function as a chronic sequela. The pulmonary effects of cytotoxic drugs usually present as acute effects, but there is the potential for significant late morbidity and mortality. Of course, surgical interventions can also cause both acute and/or late pulmonary effects as well, depending on the specific procedure. Although treatment approaches for the management of pediatric cancers are continually adapted to provide optimal therapy while minimizing toxicities, to a varying degree all therapies have the potential for both acute and late pulmonary toxicity. Of note, the cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications rises with increasing time since diagnosis, which suggests that adult survivors of childhood cancer require lifelong monitoring and management of potential new-onset pulmonary morbidity as they age. Knowledge of cytotoxic therapies and an understanding of lung physiology and how it may be altered by therapy facilitate appropriate clinical care and monitoring of long-term survivors.","Dhakal, Sughosh; Weiner, Daniel; Schwartz, Cindy; Constine, Louis S.",Survivors of Childhood and Adolescent Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124061/,20

This is for example the case for multilingual collections where documents are not available in all languages. Some studies tackled this problem by assuming the existence of view generation functions to approximately complete the missing views; for example Machine Translation to translate documents into the missing languages. These functions generally require an external resource to be set and their quality has a direct impact on the performance of the learned multiview classifier over the completed training set. Our proposed approach addresses this problem by jointly learning the missing views and the multiview classifier using a tripartite game with two generators and a discriminator. Each of the generators is associated to one of the views and tries to fool the discriminator by generating the other missing view conditionally on the corresponding observed view. The discriminator then tries to identify if for an observation, one of its views is completed by one of the generators or if both views are completed along with its class. Our results on a subset of Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collections show that the discriminator achieves significant classification performance; and that the generators learn the missing views with high quality without the need of any consequent external resource.","Doinychko, Anastasiia; Amini, Massih-Reza",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148219/,20

The epidemiologic evidence points to three environ­mental risk factors—infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), low levels of vitamin D, and cigarette smoking—whose association with multiple sclerosis (MS) seems to satisfy in varying degrees most of the criteria that support causality, including temporality, strength, consis­tency, biologic gradient, and plausibility. None of these associations, however, has been tested experimentally in humans and only one––vitamin D deficiency is presently amenable to experimental interventions. The evidence, albeit more sparse and inconsistent, linking other environmental factors to MS risk are summarized. Epidemiologic clues to the hypothetical role of infection in MS are com­plex and often seem to point in opposite directions. The ecological studies, database/linkage analyses, and longitudinal studies of sunlight exposure and vitamin D are reviewed. Biologic mechanisms for smoking and increased risk of MS could be neuro­toxic, immunomodulatory, vascular, or they could involve increased frequency and duration of respiratory infections. Some other possible risk factors include––diet and hepatitis B vaccine.","Ascherio, Alberto; Munger, Kassandra L.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173578/,20

The SurvRev model offers many advantages. First, SurvRev can use partial observations which were considered as missing data and removed from previous regression frameworks. Using deep survival analysis, we could estimate the next customer arrival from unknown distribution. Second, SurvRev is an event-rate prediction model. It generates the predicted event rate of the next k days rather than directly predicting revisit interval and revisit intention. We demonstrated the superiority of the SurvRev model by comparing it with diverse baselines, such as the feature engineering model and state-of-the-art deep survival models.","Kim, Sundong; Song, Hwanjun; Kim, Sejin; Kim, Beomyoung; Lee, Jae-Gil",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206260/,20

The construction of these networks is difficult and is mostly done with a static approach, neglecting time delayed interdependences. Tensors are objects that naturally represent multilayer networks and in this paper, we propose a new methodology based on Tucker tensor autoregression in order to build a multilayer network directly from data. This methodology captures within and between connections across layers and makes use of a filtering procedure to extract relevant information and improve visualization. We show the application of this methodology to different stationary fractionally differenced financial data. We argue that our result is useful to understand the dependencies across three different aspects of financial risk, namely market risk, liquidity risk, and volatility risk. Indeed, we show how the resulting visualization is a useful tool for risk managers depicting dependency asymmetries between different risk factors and accounting for delayed cross dependencies. The constructed multilayer network shows a strong interconnection between the volumes and prices layers across all the stocks considered while a lower number of interconnections between the uncertainty measures is identified.","Brandi, Giuseppe; Di Matteo, Tiziana",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304789/,20

Such languages are characterized by an alphabet and a set of commutation rules, also called concurrent alphabet, which can be encoded by an independency graph or by its complement, called dependency graph. One key technical result, which has its own interest, concerns general properties of graphs and states that “if an undirected graph admits a transitive orientation, then the multiplicity of the root of minimum modulus of its clique polynomial is smaller or equal to the number of connected components of its complement graph”. As a consequence, under the same hypothesis of transitive orientation of the independency graph, one obtains the relation [Formula: see text], where the random variables [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] represent the number of prefixes in traces of length n under two different fundamental probabilistic models: the uniform distribution among traces of length n (for [Formula: see text]), the uniform distribution among words of length n (for [Formula: see text]).

Early, clinically relevant biomarkers are required to allow timely application of therapeutic interventions. We previously reported early alterations in several microRNAs (miRNA) in umbilical cord blood at birth in infants with HIE. However, the exact timing of these alterations is unknown. Here, we report serial changes in six circulating, cross-species/bridging biomarkers in a clinically relevant porcine model of neonatal HIE with functional analysis. Six miRNAs—miR-374a, miR-181b, miR-181a, miR-151a, miR-148a and miR-128—were significantly and rapidly upregulated 1-h post-HI. Changes in miR-374a, miR-181b and miR-181a appeared specific to moderate-severe HI. Histopathological injury and five miRNAs displayed positive correlations and were predictive of MRS Lac/Cr ratios. Bioinformatic analysis identified that components of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) family may be targets of miR-181a. Inhibition of miR-181a increased neurite length in both SH-SY5Y cells at 1 DIV (days in vitro) and in primary cultures of rat neuronal midbrain at 3 DIV. In agreement, inhibition of miR-181a increased expression of BMPR2 in differentiating SH-SY5Y cells. These miRNAs may therefore act as early biomarkers of HIE, thereby allowing for rapid diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention and may regulate expression of signalling pathways vital to neuronal survival.

Effective pain control is essential. We assessed whether epidural analgesia (EA) in patients with fractured ribs who were not intubated at ICU admission decreased the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We also looked for risk factors for IMV. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective, observational, multicenter study conducted in 40 ICUs in France included consecutive patients with three or more fractured ribs who were not intubated at admission between July 2013 and July 2015. RESULTS: Of the 974 study patients, 788 were included in the analysis of intubation predictors. EA was used in 130 (16.5%) patients, and 65 (8.2%) patients required IMV. Factors independently associated with IMV were chronic respiratory disease (P = 0.008), worse SAPS II (P < 0.0001), flail chest (P = 0.02), worse Injury Severity Score (P = 0.0003), higher respiratory rate at admission (P = 0.02), alcohol withdrawal syndrome (P < 0.001), and noninvasive ventilation (P = 0.04). EA was not associated with decreases in IMV requirements, median numerical rating scale pain score, or intravenous morphine requirements from day 1 to day 7. CONCLUSIONS: EA was not associated with a lower risk of IMV in chest trauma patients with at least 3 fractured ribs, moderate pain, and no intubation on admission. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimal pain control strategy in chest trauma patients admitted to the ICU, notably those with severe pain or high opioid requirements.","Bachoumas, Konstantinos; Levrat, Albrice; Le Thuaut, Aurélie; Rouleau, Stéphane; Groyer, Samuel; Dupont, Hervé; Rooze, Paul; Eisenmann, Nathanael; Trampont, Timothée; Bohé, Julien; Rieu, Benjamin; Chakarian, Jean-Charles; Godard, Aurélie; Frederici, Laura; Gélinotte, Stephanie; Joret, Aurélie; Roques, Pascale; Painvin, Benoit; Leroy, Christophe; Benedit, Marcel; Dopeux, Loic; Soum, Edouard; Botoc, Vlad; Fartoukh, Muriel; Hausermann, Marie-Hélène; Kamel, Toufik; Morin, Jean; De Varax, Roland; Plantefève, Gaetan; Herbland, Alexandre; Jabaudon, Matthieu; Duburcq, Thibault; Simon, Christelle; Chabanne, Russell; Schneider, Francis; Ganster, Frederique; Bruel, Cedric; Laggoune, Ahmed-Saïd; Bregeaud, Delphine; Souweine, Bertrand; Reignier, Jean; Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7450151/,20

Veterans in MFHs are provided 24/7 care by VA trained and supervised community caregivers and primary care by VA Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) teams. One year after the three-year (2017-2019) expansion funds stopped, COIN continued monitoring remaining programs. Objectives were to understand factors critical for program expansion and sustainability and the impact of COVID-19. Phone interviews were conducted with sixteen coordinators from seventeen programs. A thematic analysis approach was used to address the evaluation objectives using transcript data. Findings showed factors important to program sustainability were: 1) Program fit (finding caregivers in the community); and 2) Local VA facility support (staffing, adaptation, and local leadership support). COVID prompted losing some caregivers and prevented others from joining. Program staffing was not impacted as many program activities ceased. Recreational therapists (RTs) were significant to maintaining Veterans well-being and reducing social isolation through virtual activities. COVID required coordinators transition their supervision of MFHs to new virtual environments and HBPC to increase telehealth to new levels. Local leadership became important to monitoring local conditions and providing support to programs. The evaluation: 1) Found factors important to program sustainability were also critical to keeping programs operational during the pandemic; and 2) Stimulated future research on the suitability of MFH programs to meet challenges to resurgences of COVID or other national emergencies.","Solorzano, Nelly; Manheim, Chelsea; Haverhals, Leah; Levy, Cari",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740217/,20

The majority (83%, n=60) of Maine’s age-friendly communities have fewer than 10,000 residents and only two have populations over 20,000. Before the pandemic, rural Mainers struggled to find safe and convenient transportation options, afford healthy food, access primary and secondary medical care, and participate in activities to stay physically fit and socially connected. Age-friendly community efforts attempted to address those issues by building on community strengths and assets to develop local solutions. The challenges of rural aging were amplified by the pandemic and reliance on older community leaders and volunteers, who were seen as an at-risk population and thus strongly encouraged to avoid social contact. This study offers a narrative exploration of how rural age-friendly communities responded to COVID-19. The leaders of 71 age-friendly communities were contacted by phone, email, or Zoom between May 15 and August 30. Thirty-nine of the communities (54.9%) actively partnered with residents and organizations to address needs during the pandemic. Identified themes described the challenges faced in developing an effective response and new opportunities to expand the age-friendly work in the community. Suggestions for developing new partnerships between age-friendly initiatives and local organizations were highlighted.

Gait adaptability training is possible on the C-Mill, a treadmill equipped with augmented reality, enabling visual projections to serve as stepping targets or obstacles. It is unknown whether gait adaptability can be trained in people with HSP. AIM: The aim of Move-HSP is to study the effects of ten 1-h sessions of C-Mill training, compared with usual care, on gait adaptability in people with pure HSP. In addition, this study aims to identify key determinants of C-Mill training efficacy in people with pure HSP. METHOD: Move-HSP is a 5-week, two-armed, open-label randomized controlled trial with a cross-over design for the control group. Thirty-six participants with pure HSP will be included. After signing informed consent, participants are randomized (1:1) to intervention or control group. All participants register (near) falls for 15 weeks, followed by the first assessment (week 16), and, thereafter, wear an Activ8 activity monitor for 7 days (week 16). The intervention group receives 10 sessions of C-Mill training (twice per week, 1-h sessions; weeks 17–21), whereas control group continues with usual care (weeks 17–21). Afterwards, both groups are re-assessed (week 22). Subsequently, the intervention group enter follow-up, whereas control group receives 10 sessions of C-Mill training (weeks 23–27), is re-assessed (week 28), and enters follow-up. During follow-up, both groups wear Activ8 activity monitors for 7 days (intervention group: week 23, control group: week 29) and register (near) falls for 15 weeks (intervention group: weeks 23–37, control group: weeks 29–43), before the final assessment (intervention group: week 38, control group: week 44). The primary outcome is the obstacle subtask of the Emory Functional Ambulation Profile. Secondary outcomes consist of clinical tests assessing balance and walking capacity, physical activity, and fall monitoring. DISCUSSION: Move-HSP will be the first RCT to assess the effects of C-Mill gait adaptability training in people with pure HSP. It will provide proof of concept for the efficacy of gait adaptability training in people with pure HSP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04180098. Registered on November 27, 2019.

Can ML deliver better algorithmic rules than traditional simple legal rules? This paper argues that the answer to these question is “no” by building an argument based on three increasingly more serious barriers that ML faces to develop legal (or quasi-legal) algorithmic rules: data availability, the Lucas’ critique, and incentive compatibility in eliciting information.

An example is the broad class of mathematical models, based on differential equations, used in ecology, biochemical kinetics, epidemiology, gene regulatory networks, etc. Independent of their simplicity or complexity, all these models have in common (generally unknown a priori) parameters that need to be identified from observations (data) of the real system, usually available on the literature, obtained by specific assays or surveyed by public health offices. Before using this data to calibrate the models, a good practice is to judge the most influential parameters. That can be done with aid of the Sobol’ indices, a variance-based statistical technique for global sensitivity analysis, which measures the individual importance of each parameter, as well as their joint-effect, on the model output (a.k.a. quantity of interest). These variance-based indexes may be computed using Monte Carlo simulation but, depending on the model, this task can be very costly. An alternative approach for this scenario is the use of surrogate models to speed-up the calculations. Using simple biological models, from different areas, we develop a tutorial that illustrates how practitioners can use Sobol’ indices to quantify, in a probabilistic manner, the relevance of the parameters of their models. This tutorial describes a very robust framework to compute Sobol’ indices employing a polynomial chaos surrogate model constructed with the UQLab package.","Tosin, Michel; Côrtes, Adriano M.

With this, a new virtual hand trauma clinic was set up. We assess accuracy of assessment within this virtual set-up with comparison to pre COVID-19 face-to-face assessment. METHOD: Two weeks of clinic sessions during and pre lockdown were analysed. Initial assessment was compared with the patient's operation note. RESULTS: In the pre COVID-19 two-week period 129 face-to-face appointments were analysed. Of 99 patients that required surgery 77 (78%) had an accurate assessment. 6 were overestimated, 12 were underestimated. 189 patients were seen over two weeks during lockdown via telephone or video call. Accuracy of assessment increased with seniority of the clinician. Of 126 patients that required an operation 109 (87%) had an accurate assessment; all structures injured were correctly predicted. 12 were overestimated, 5 had their injury underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: The new virtual clinic allowed patients to be remotely assessed during lockdown, reducing footfall and unnecessary journeys. We found that virtual clinic assessments are accurate, and no patient underwent an unnecessary procedure. Using a telephone call plus photo gave similar accuracy as a video call.

INTRODUCTION: Exercise prescription is one of the main components of phase III Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) programs due to its documented prognostic benefits. It has been well established that, when added to aerobic training, resistance training (RT) leads to greater improvements in peripheral muscle strength and muscle mass in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). With COVID-19, most centre-based CR programs had to be suspended and CR patients had to readjust their RT program to a home-based model where weight training was more difficult to perform. How COVID-19 Era impacted lean mass and muscle strength in trained CVD patients who were attending long-term CR programs has yet to be discussed. PURPOSE: To assess upper and lower limb muscle strength and lean mass in CVD patients who had their centre-based CR program suspended due to COVID-19 and compare it with previous assessments. METHODS: 87 CVD patients (mean age 62.9 ± 9.1, 82.8% male), before COVID-19, were attending a phase III centre-based CR program 3x/week and were evaluated annually. After 7 months of suspension, 57.5% (n = 50) patients returned to the face-to-face CR program. Despite all constraints caused by COVID-19, body composition and muscle strength of 35 participants (mean age 64.7 ± 7.9, 88.6% male) were assessed. We compared this assessment with previous years and established three assessment time points: M1) one year before COVID-19 (2018); M2) last assessment before COVID-19 (2019); M3) the assessment 7 months after CR program suspension (last trimester of 2020). Upper limbs strength was measured using a JAMAR dynamometer, 30 second chair stand test (number of repetitions – reps) was used to measure lower limbs strength and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to measure upper and lower limbs lean mass. Repeated measures ANOVA were used. RESULTS: Intention to treat analysis showed that upper and lower limbs lean mass did not change from M1 to M2 but decreased significantly from M2 to M3 (arms lean mass in M2: 5.68 ± 1.00kg vs M3: 5.52 ± 1.06kg, p = 0.004; legs lean mass in M2: 17.40 ± 2.46kg vs M3: 16.77 ± 2.61kg, p = 0.040). Lower limb strength also decreased significantly from M2 to M3 (M2: 23.31 ± 5.76 reps vs M3: 21.11 ± 5.31 reps, p = 0.014) after remaining stable in the year prior to COVID-19. Upper limb strength improved significantly from M1 to M2 (M1: 39.00 ± 8.64kg vs M2: 40.53 ± 8.77kg, p = 0.034) but did not change significantly from M2 to M3 (M2 vs M3: 41.29 ± 9.13kg, p = 0.517). CONCLUSION: After CR centre-based suspension due to COVID-19, we observed a decrease in upper and lower limbs lean mass and lower limb strength in previously trained CVD patients. These results should emphasize the need to promote all efforts to maintain physical activity and RT through alternative effective home-based CR programs when face-to-face models are not available or possible to be implemented.","Borges, M; Lemos Pires, M; Pinto, R; De Sa, G; Ricardo, I; Cunha, N; Alves Da Silva, P; Linan Pinto, M; Sousa Guerreiro, C; Pinto, FJ; Abreu, A; Santa-Clara, H",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136044/,20

55780,Is multiple viral infection a predictor of severity in children with acute bronchiolitis?,2019-09-11,"This research proposed two pretreatments of viscose fabrics: oxidation with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radical (TEMPO) and coating with TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCN), to introduce functional groups (COOH and CHO) suitable for irreversible binding of chitosan nanoparticles without and with embedded zinc (NCS and NCS + Zn, respectively) and consequently achieving washing durable antibacterial properties of the chitosan nanoparticles functionalized fabrics. The characterizations of pretreated and chitosan nanoparticles functionalized fabrics were performed by FTIR and XPS spectroscopy, elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, zeta potential measurements, scanning electron microscopy, determination of COOH and CHO groups content, and antimicrobial activity under dynamic contact conditions. Influence of pretreatments on NCS and NCS + Zn adsorption, chemical, electrokinetic, and antibacterial properties as well as morphology, and washing durability of NCS and NCS + Zn functionalized fabrics were studied and compared. Washing durability was evaluated through changes in the chitosan and zinc content, zeta potential, and antibacterial activity after 1, 3, and 5 washing cycles. Pretreatments improved washing durability of antibacterial properties of chitosan nanoparticles functionalized fabrics. The NCS and NCS + Zn functionalized pretreated fabrics preserved antibacterial activity against S. aureus after five washing cycles, while antibacterial activity against E. coli was preserved only after one washing cycle in the case NCS + Zn functionalized pretreated viscose fabrics.","Korica, Matea; Peršin, Zdenka; Fras Zemljič, Lidija; Mihajlovski, Katarina; Dojčinović, Biljana; Trifunović, Snežana; Vesel, Alenka; Nikolić, Tanja; Kostić, Mirjana M.",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269808/,20
56231,A View on Polymerase Chain Reaction as an Outstanding Molecular Diagnostic Technique in Periodontology,2021-07-19,"Honey is a rich source of carbohydrates, while minor compounds such as amino acids and polyphenols contribute to its health-promoting effects. Honey is one of the oldest traditional remedies applied for microbial infections, due to its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of Hungarian black locust, linden, and sunflower honeys against the most common biofilm-forming respiratory tract pathogens Haemophilus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The unifloral character of all three honey types was confirmed by melissopalynological analysis. The antibacterial activity of each honey sample against each bacterium strain was proven with agar well diffusion assay and thin layer chromatography—direct bioautography. Kinetics and mechanisms of antibacterial action were clarified with time-kill assay and membrane degradation study. The anti-biofilm activity was evidenced using crystal violet assay. In each assay, linden honey was the most effective, followed by sunflower and black locust honey. In addition, each honey sample had greater potential to suppress respiratory tract bacteria, compared to major sugar components. In conclusion, honey in general and linden honey in particular, can have a role in the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria.","Balázs, Viktória Lilla; Nagy-Radványi, Lilla; Filep, Rita; Kerekes, Erika; Kocsis, Béla; Kocsis, Marianna; Farkas, Ágnes",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8304482/,20

The sample consisted of 613 respondents from England (47.6% were women and 52.4% men). All of them were of legal age (mean = 34.5; standard deviation = 8.15). An exploratory factor analysis was applied, and three confirmatory factor models were adjusted. Omega coefficients and test-retest designs were used for reliability analysis. The MMSI-2 has a valid internal structure consisting of five macrofactors: Clinical Personality Tendencies (CPT), Anomalous Perceived Phenomena (APP), Incoherent Manipulations (IMA), Altered States of Consciousness (ASC), and Openness (OP). Omega coefficients for CPT and OP factors were low but acceptable. Furthermore, test-retest trials were excellent for all scales and factors. The psychological factors CPT, IMA, and ASC predicted 18.3% of the variance of anomalous experiences (APP). The authors concluded the English MMSI-2 was a valid and reliable test for the evaluation of anomalous phenomena but recommend that subsequent research reviews the predictive quality of the underlying model.","Escolà-Gascón, Álex; Dagnall, Neil; Gallifa, Josep",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322782/,20
57369,Molecular Mechanism of Jinchan Oral Liquid in the Treatment of Children with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Pneumonia Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Technology,2021-08-26,"CONTEXT: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are generally considered high risk for poor outcomes following COVID-19 infection. The CIBMTR observational report published by Sharma et al. found that recipients of allogeneic HSCT who contracted COVID-19 had poor overall survival with a 30-day mortality of 32%. However, there are relatively few other studies that evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on HSCT recipients, especially in the setting of in vivo T-cell depletion protocol. OBJECTIVE: This is a single-institution, retrospective analysis evaluating outcomes of HSCT recipients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 2020 and April 2021. PATIENTS: There were 21 patients at our institution who had undergone HSCT and subsequently contracted COVID-19. Their median age was 53 years at the time of diagnosis. Thirteen of the patients were Hispanic (61.9%). Six of the patients received match-related stem cells (28.6%), 7 received cells from match unrelated donors (33.3%), and 7 received cells from haploidentical donors (33.3%). Fifteen of the patients (71.4%) received myeloablative conditioning regimens, whereas 5 (23.8%) received reduced intensity or non-myeloablative regimens. One patient had received an autologous stem cell transplant. Our most common GVHD prophylaxis regimens were PTCy/Tacro/MMF (12 pts, 57.1%) and Tacro/MTX (6 pts, 28.5%). RESULTS: Our primary endpoint in this retrospective analysis was non-relapse mortality within 60 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the 21 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 1 passed away 20 days after diagnosis, giving us a 4.8% case fatality rate. The median time of COVID-19 diagnosis post-transplant was 469 days. Sixteen of the 21 patients were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis (76.2%). Eight patients received steroids for treatment of COVID-19 (38.1%). Seven of the 21 patients (33.3%) were hospitalized for a median of 7 days (range, 5–17 days), with 2 requiring ICU level of care (9.5%). One patient was intubated and ultimately passed away. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that our HSCT recipients who contracted COVID-19 have had generally good short-term outcomes. Longer follow-up is required to determine if a COVID-19 diagnosis has any effect on long-term transplant related complications and outcomes in this population.","Dwabe, Sami; Savitala-Damerla, Lakshmi; Ladha, Abdullah; Tam, Eric; Chaudhary, Preet; Yaghmour, George",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8404081/,20
57385,Immune Checkpoints Expression in Chronic Lung Allograft Rejection,2021-08-13,"The present study discusses the effect of the ozone depletion that occurred over the Arctic in 2020 on the ozone column in central and southern Europe by analysing a data set obtained from ground-based measurements at six stations placed from 79 to 42°N. Over the northernmost site (Ny-Ålesund), the ozone column decreased by about 45% compared to the climatological average at the beginning of April, and its values returned to the normal levels at the end of the month. Southwards, the anomaly gradually reduced to nearly 15% at 42°N (Rome) and the ozone minimum was detected with a delay from about 6 days at 65°N to 20 days at 42°N. At the same time, the evolution of the ozone column at the considered stations placed below the polar circle corresponded to that observed at Ny-Ålesund, but at 42°–46°N, the ozone column turned back to the typical values at the end of May. This similarity in the ozone evolutional patterns at different latitudes and the gradually increasing delay of the minimum occurrences towards the south allows the assumption that the ozone columns at lower latitudes were affected by the phenomenon in the Arctic. The ozone decrease observed at Aosta (46°N) combined with predominantly cloud-free conditions resulted in about an 18% increase in the erythemally weighted solar ultraviolet irradiance reaching the Earth’s surface in May.","Petkov, Boyan; Vitale, Vito; Di Carlo, Piero; Mazzola, Mauro; Lupi, Angelo; Diémoz, Henri; Fountoulakis, Ilias; Drofa, Oxana; Mastrangelo, Daniele; Casale, Giuseppe Rocco; Siani, Anna Maria",Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406651/,20

Since electricity basically drives industry, industrial civilization could collapse without it. This could cause anthropological civilization (cities) to collapse, from which humanity might not recover, having long-term consequences. Previous work analyzed technical solutions to save nearly everyone despite industrial loss globally, including transition to animals powering farming and transportation. The present work estimates cost-effectiveness for the long-term future with a Monte Carlo (probabilistic) model. Model 1, partly based on a poll of Effective Altruism conference participants, finds a confidence that industrial loss preparation is more cost-effective than artificial general intelligence safety of ~ 88% and ~ 99+% for the 30 millionth dollar spent on industrial loss interventions and the margin now, respectively. Model 2 populated by one of the authors produces ~ 50% and ~ 99% confidence, respectively. These confidences are likely to be reduced by model and theory uncertainty, but the conclusion of industrial loss interventions being more cost-effective was robust to changing the most important 4–7 variables simultaneously to their pessimistic ends. Both cause areas save expected lives cheaply in the present generation and funding to preparation for industrial loss is particularly urgent.","Denkenberger, David; Sandberg, Anders; Tieman, Ross John; Pearce, Joshua M.",Eur J Futures Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8451736/,20

An effective preventive vaccine against this virus is urgently needed. As the most critical step during infection, SARS-CoV-2 uses its Spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) to engage with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1,2. Here we showed that a recombinant vaccine comprising residues 319-545 of the S-RBD could induce a potent functional antibody response in the immunized mice, rabbits and non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) as early as 7 or 14 days after a single dose injection. The sera from the immunized animals blocked RBD binding to ACE2 expressed on the cell surface and neutralized the infection by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Importantly, the vaccination also provided protection in non-human primates from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. The elevated RBD-specific antibodies were also found in the sera from patients with COVID-19. Several immune pathways and CD4 T lymphocytes were implicated in the induction of the vaccine antibody response. Our finding highlights the importance of the RBD domain in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design and provides the rationale for the development of a protective vaccine through the induction of antibody against the RBD domain.","Yang, Jingyun; Wang, Wei; Chen, Zimin; Lu, Shuaiyao; Yang, Fanli; Bi, Zhenfei; Bao, Linlin; Mo, Fei; Li, Xue; Huang, Yong; Hong, Weiqi; Yang, Yun; Zhao, Yuan; Ye, Fei; Lin, Sheng; Deng, Wei; Chen, Hua; Lei, Hong; Zhang, Ziqi; Luo, Min; Gao, Hong; Zheng, Yue; Gong, Yanqiu; Jiang, Xiaohua; Xu, Yanfeng; Lv, Qi; Li, Dan; Wang, Manni; Li, Fengdi; Wang, Shunyi; Wang, Guanpeng; Yu, Pin; Qu, Yajin; Yang, Li; Deng, Hongxin; Tong, Aiping; Li, Jiong; Wang, Zhenling; Yang, Jinliang; Shen, Guobo; Zhao, Zhiwei; Li, Yuhua; Luo, Jingwen; Liu, Hongqi; Yu, Wenhai; Yang, Mengli; Xu, Jingwen; Wang, Junbin; Li, Haiyan; Wang, Haixuan; Kuang, Dexuan; Lin, Panpan; Hu, Zhengtao; Guo, Wei; Cheng, Wei; He, Yanlin; Song, Xiangrong; Chen, Chong; Xue, Zhihong; Yao, Shaohua; Chen, Lu; Ma, Xuelei; Chen, Siyuan; Gou, Maling; Huang, Weijin; Wang, Youchun; Fan, Changfa; Tian, Zhixin; Shi, Ming; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Dai, Lunzhi; Wu, Min; Li, Gen; Wang, Guangyu; Peng, Yong; Qian, Zhiyong; Huang, Canhua; Lau, Johnson Yiu-Nam; Yang, Zhenglin; Wei, Yuquan; Cen, Xiaobo; Peng, Xiaozhong; Qin, Chuan; Zhang, Kang; Lu, Guangwen; Wei, Xiawei",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2599-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726802/,20

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between April 12 and June 5, 2020, patients presenting with acute ureteral obstruction requiring decompression were prospectively selected for ultrasound-guided bedside ureteral stent placement. During stent placement, upper tract access confirmed using ultrasound with or without retrograde injection of ultrasound contrast prior to double-J stent insertion. A post-procedural abdominal x-ray was obtained for stent position confirmation. RESULTS Eight patients (4 men, 4 women) were offered bedside ultrasound-guided ureteral stent placement, and all 8 consented to proceed. Stents were successfully placed in 7 of 8 patients. One patient had an impacted ureterovesical junction stone and stricture requiring ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy in the operating room. All patients tolerated procedures without immediate complications. CONCLUSION Live renal ultrasonography can facilitate a high success rate for bedside ureteral stent placement outside the operating room. This approach is an attractive alternative to fluoroscopy-guided stent placement in the operating room and is of particular value in the COVID-19 era when judicious use of these resources is salient.","Yang, Heiko; Chappidi, Meera; Overland, Maya; Ahn, Justin; Bayne, David; Chi, Thomas",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.0954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33261510/,20
60049,Infectious disease surveillance and modelling across geographic frontiers and scientific specialties.,2012,"Climate change and human globalization have spurred the rapid spread of mosquito-borne diseases to naïve populations. One such emerging virus of public health concern is chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a member of the Togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus CHIKV pathogenesis is predominately characterized by acute febrile symptoms and severe arthralgia, which can persist in the host long after viral clearance. CHIKV has also been implicated in cases of acute encephalomyelitis, and its vertical transmission has been reported. Currently, no FDA-approved treatments exist for this virus. Recoding elements help expand the coding capacity in many viruses and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets in antiviral treatments. Here, we report the molecular and structural characterization of two CHIKV translational recoding signals: a termination codon read-through (TCR) element located between the nonstructural protein 3 and 4 genes and a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) signal located toward the 3' end of the CHIKV 6K gene. Using Dual-Luciferase and immunoblot assays in HEK293T and U87MG mammalian cell lines, we validated and genetically characterized efficient TCR and -1 PRF. Analyses of RNA chemical modification data with selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE) assays revealed that CHIKV -1 PRF is stimulated by a tightly structured, triple-stem hairpin element, consistent with previous observations in alphaviruses, and that the TCR signal is composed of a single large multibulged hairpin element. These findings illuminate the roles of RNA structure in translational recoding and provide critical information relevant for design of live-attenuated vaccines against CHIKV and related viruses.","Kendra, Joseph A; Advani, Vivek M; Chen, Bin; Briggs, Joseph W; Zhu, Jinyi; Bress, Hannah J; Pathy, Sushrut M; Dinman, Jonathan D",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra118.005606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30242123/,20
60148,The changing microbial epidemiology in cystic fibrosis.,2010,"Serology is a core component of the surveillance and management of viral zoonoses. Virus neutralization tests are a gold standard serological diagnostic, but requirements for large volumes of serum and high biosafety containment can limit widespread use. Here, focusing on Rabies lyssavirus, a globally important zoonosis, we developed a pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (pmRFFIT) that overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we adapted an existing micro-neutralization test to use a green fluorescent protein-tagged murine leukemia virus pseudotype in lieu of pathogenic rabies virus, reducing the need for specialized reagents for antigen detection and enabling use in low-containment laboratories. We further used statistical models to generate rapid, quantitative predictions of the probability and titer of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies from microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes. Using 47 serum samples from domestic dogs with neutralizing antibody titers estimated using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN), pmRFFIT showed moderate sensitivity (78.79%) and high specificity (84.62%). Despite small conflicts, titer predictions were correlated across tests repeated on different dates both for dog samples (r = 0.93) and in a second dataset of sera from wild common vampire bats (r = 0.72, N = 41), indicating repeatability. Our test uses a starting volume of 3.5 µL of serum, estimates titers from a single dilution of serum rather than requiring multiple dilutions and end point titration, and may be adapted to target neutralizing antibodies against alternative lyssavirus species. The pmRFFIT enables high-throughput detection of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in low-biocontainment settings and is suited to studies in wild or captive animals where large serum volumes cannot be obtained.","Meza, Diana K; Broos, Alice; Becker, Daniel J; Behdenna, Abdelkader; Willett, Brian J; Viana, Mafalda; Streicker, Daniel G",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931658/,20

Despite significant total and free T4 elevation, clinical evidence of thyrotoxicosis was absent. Thyroid I-123 uptake was also reduced. Additional testing revealed slight T3 elevation and significant rT3 elevation. Graves' and Hashimoto's thyroiditis testing was negative. We hypothesize that the biochemical hyperthyroidism was due to transient thyroiditis. Although an etiology for the boy's hepatitis was never determined, and an undiagnosed infectious etiology causing subacute thyroiditis was considered, subsequent testing showing positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies, suggesting autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis as the likely cause of the hyperthyroidism.

The extremely low incidence of pituitary germinoma has resulted in a significant gap in knowledge regarding its demographics, management, and treatment outcomes. We present the largest multicenter analysis of pituitary germinomas to date, focused on analyzing demographic and management patterns. METHODS This study utilizes the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program (2004-2016) to study patients with a primary intracranial germinoma of the pituitary gland. We analyzed demographic information and management strategies among adult and pediatric populations and conducted a 20-year overall survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curve for a descriptive evaluation of survival outcomes between age groups and treatment groups. RESULTS 92 patients were included in the study, consisting of 58% pediatric patients and 42% adults, with overall 60% males. 82% patients received radiation as part of the treatment, with no significant difference between pediatric and adult groups. Chemotherapy was used significantly more in pediatrics (p = 0.0002) while surgery was significantly more common in adults (p = 0.0117). The most common treatment in pediatrics was radiation + chemotherapy (47%), while the most common treatment in adults was radiation + gross total resection + chemotherapy (23%) followed by radiation + gross total resection (19%). Younger age, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were associated with increased 20-year survival on Kaplan-Meier curves. CONCLUSIONS There exist significant differences in the management of pediatric and adult populations with pituitary germinomas. The low incidence of these tumors makes them challenging to study, but also highlights the importance of national cancer registries in amassing sufficient patient data from which to draw evidence-based conclusions.","Bhimani, Abhiraj D; Barrington, Nikki M; Aguilar, Tania M; Arnone, Gregory D; Mehta, Ankit I",Pituitary,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-020-01042-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388804/,20

The theatre team at one hospital in the East of England produced local alternating signage to communicate the COVID-19 pathway risk during cases in theatres. This signage - named the 'COVID-19 Flag' - is placed outside of the individual theatre to ensure that staff are informed of the infection risk with the cases underway. Furthermore, it is a quick visual guide to be used in conjunction with national guidance and local protocols for appropriate decisions regarding the treatment and care of patients in the operating theatres.","Hayman, Gareth; Britton, Carolina R",Journal of perioperative practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1750458920982168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544660/,20
63145,Radiofrequency ablation for stage I non-small cell lung cancer: management of locoregional recurrence.,2012,"BACKGROUND The transanal endoscopic operation (TEO) has proved to be an effective alternative to conventional surgery for the treatment of rectal lesions. The TEO procedure offers reduced morbidity, faster recovery and equivalent oncologic outcome. Currently, two instrument sets are available: one with three-dimensional (Wolf) and one with two-dimensional (Storz) optic capacities. The three-dimensional (3D) instrument set is considered the golden standard. Although the advantages of TEO are imposing, the procedure with the 3D armamentarium has certain technical and financial drawbacks. This study therefore aimed to compare results for the TEO 2D alternative with recently published results for 3D TEO. METHODS All consecutive patients with benign or malignant pT1 or pT2 rectal lesions undergoing TEO were prospectively followed. All procedures were performed with the 2D armamentarium using standard endoscopic instruments, a rectoscope (diameter, 4 cm; working length, 7.5-15 cm), and 5-mm Ligasure and Ultracision. Operating times, complications, hospital stay, and oncologic outcome were gathered and compared with published data. RESULTS Between 2004 and 2006, 31 patients with a median age of 75 years (range, 33-87 years) underwent 31 TEOs for a total of 36 rectal lesions (29 tubulovillous adenomas and 7 adenocarcinomas). The median distance of the lesion from the anal verge was 7.5 cm (range, 5-15 cm). The median lesion diameter was 2.3 cm (range, 0.5-5.0 cm). The locations of the lesions were as follows: 18 on the dorsal, 5 on the ventral, and 5 on the lateral rectal wall. The median operating time was 55 min (range, 25-165 min), compared with 105 min reported in the literature. All the lesions except one could be radically excised. No intraoperative complications occurred. Postoperative complications occurred for three patients, all due to hemorrhage. The median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 1-21 days). During a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1-35 months), two recurrences took place. CONCLUSION The study findings showed that for rectal tumors located up to 15 cm from the anal verge with a maximal diameter of 5 cm, TEO using standard laparoscopic instruments with a 2D view is feasible and provides results comparable with those associated with a 3D view and dedicated instruments. Furthermore, the 2D procedure can be performed with improved ergonomics due to movable monitors and is considerably less expensive.","Nieuwenhuis, D H; Draaisma, W A; Verberne, G H M; van Overbeeke, A J; Consten, E C J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-9918-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18443874/,20

This meta-analysis compared the clinical outcomes of patients treated using either approach. METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify all randomized trials that compared MIS and endoscopy-based interventions for treatment of infected necrotizing pancreatitis. Main outcome measure was to compare rates of complications or death during 6-month follow-up. RESULTS Three studies involving 184 patients met inclusion criteria. While there was no significant difference in mortality (14.5 vs. 16.1%, risk ratio (RR) 1.02, p=0.963), new onset multiple organ failure (5.2 vs. 19.7%, RR=0.34, p=0.045), enterocutaneous fistula/perforation (3.6 vs. 17.9%, RR=0.34, p=0.034) and pancreatic fistula (4.2 vs. 38.2%, RR=0.13, p<0.001) were significantly lower for endoscopic interventions compared to MIS. There was no significant difference in intraabdominal bleeding, endocrine or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency between cohorts. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for endoscopy (standardized mean difference, -0.41, p=0.010). CONCLUSIONS An endoscopy-based treatment approach, as compared to minimally invasive surgery, significantly reduces complications in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis.

The production of inflammatory cytokines is key to mediating WNV-induced immunopathology in the central nervous system. Elucidating the host factors utilized by WNV for productive infection would provide valuable insights into the evasion strategies used by this virus. Although attempts have been made to determine these host factors, proteomic data depicting WNV-host protein interactions are limited. We applied liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for label-free, quantitative phosphoproteomics to systematically investigate the global phosphorylation events induced by WNV infection. Quantifiable changes to 1,657 phosphoproteins were found; of these, 626 were significantly upregulated and 227 were downregulated at 12 h postinfection. The phosphoproteomic data were subjected to gene ontology enrichment analysis, which returned the inflammation-related spliceosome, ErbB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor kappa B, and mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathways. We used short interfering RNAs to decrease the levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinase, and retinoblastoma 1 and found that the activity of nuclear factor kappa B (p65) is significantly decreased in WNV-infected U251 cells, which in turn led to markedly reduced inflammatory cytokine production. Our results provide a better understanding of the host response to WNV infection and highlight multiple targets for the development of antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies.","Zhang, Hao; Sun, Jun; Ye, Jing; Ashraf, Usama; Chen, Zheng; Zhu, Bibo; He, Wen; Xu, Qiuping; Wei, Yanming; Chen, Huanchun; Fu, Zhen F; Liu, Rong; Cao, Shengbo",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26485063/,20
63672,ASO Author Reflections: Proposed Nodal Categories for Future Editions of the TNM Classification of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,2021-01-09,"OBJECTIVES Five to 10% of patients with stable coronary artery disease have refractory angina pectoris (RAP). These patients are restricted in performing daily activities due to angina pectoris. Spinal cord stimulation is a last resort treatment option. A number of this patient population also has an indication for a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator). Manufacturers of spinal cord stimulators have stated a warning that interference can occur between the spinal cord stimulator and the CIED. Consequently, only a limited number of patients with RAP and a CIED have received a spinal cord stimulator. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to determine whether spinal cord stimulation can be safely used in patients with RAP and a CIED. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients with RAP referred to our center were screened and included if 1) the patient received a spinal cord stimulator as treatment for RAP and if 2) the patient received a CIED either prior to or after spinal cord stimulator implantation. A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treadmill test was used as screening tool to determine whether the patient was eligible for implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was checked 1) after TENS treadmill test, 2) during implantation of spinal cord stimulator or CIED, 3) during mode switches of the SCS, and 4) during regular out-patient follow-up. RESULTS In total, 22 patients had both a spinal cord stimulator and a CIED with an average follow-up duration of 44.5 months. No interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was found. CONCLUSION Spinal cord stimulation can be safely applied in patients with a CIED provided that the CIED is checked for interference during implantation, if mode switches of the SCS occurred and once yearly after implantation according to routine follow-up.","Vervaat, Fabienne E; van Suijlekom, Hans; Wijnbergen, Inge",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.13411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955131/,20

Herein, hsa_circ_0007494 was suppressed in the PCa cell lines and tissues. This resulted in metastasis of tumors to the lymph node and predicted tumor stage. Functionally, overexpression of hsa_circ_0007494 inhibited the proliferation and invasive capacity of the cells in vitro and blocked the growth of tumors in vivo. Hsa_circ_0007494 functioned as a ""molecular sponge"" for miR-616 and hence upregulated the target of miR-616, PTEN. In addition, rescue assays revealed that PTEN silencing (or miR-616 mimics) blocked the tumor-suppressing effects of hsa_circ_0007494 overexpression on PCa progression. Together, our findings indicate that hsa_circ_0007494 suppresses PCa by forming a negative regulatory network including hsa_circ_0007494/miR-616/PTEN. Thus, hsa_circ_0007494 may be a treatment target for PCa.","Zhang, Shilong; Zhang, Xiangsheng; Chen, Guoxiao; Zheng, Xiaokang; Zhu, Xiaobo; Shan, Lei",Experimental cell research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810511/,20
64133,Flow-Diversion Effect of LEO Stents: Aneurysm Occlusion and Flow Remodeling of Covered Side Branches and Perforators.,2018,"Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes under different environmental conditions, is critical for the origins and maintenance of biodiversity; however, the genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity as well as how variation in those mechanisms can drive evolutionary change remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the cichlid feeding apparatus, an icon of both prodigious evolutionary divergence and adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We first provide a tissue-level mechanism for plasticity in craniofacial shape by measuring rates of bone deposition within functionally salient elements of the feeding apparatus in fishes forced to employ alternate foraging modes. We show that levels and patterns of phenotypic plasticity are distinct among closely related cichlid species, underscoring the evolutionary potential of this trait. Next, we demonstrate that hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which has been implicated in the evolutionary divergence of cichlid feeding architecture, is associated with environmentally induced rates of bone deposition. Finally, to demonstrate that Hh levels are the cause of the plastic response and not simply the consequence of producing more bone, we use transgenic zebrafish in which Hh levels could be experimentally manipulated under different foraging conditions. Notably, we find that the ability to modulate bone deposition rates in different environments is dampened when Hh levels are reduced, whereas the sensitivity of bone deposition to different mechanical demands increases with elevated Hh levels. These data advance a mechanistic understanding of phenotypic plasticity in the teleost feeding apparatus and in doing so contribute key insights into the origins of adaptive morphological radiations.","Navon, Dina; Male, Ira; Tetrault, Emily R; Aaronson, Benjamin; Karlstrom, Rolf O; Albertson, R Craig",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921856117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719137/,20
64805,[Informations and recommendations of the German Respiratory Society and the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for chemotherapy concerning the outbreak of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in humans].,2013,"INTRODUCTION Prolonged air leak (PAL) is the most common complication after partial lung resection and the most important determinant of length of hospital stay for patients post-operatively. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors involved in developing air leaks and the consequences of PAL. METHODS All patients undergoing lung resection between January 2002 and December 2007 in our hospital were studied retrospectively. Univariate analysis to predict risk factors for developing post-operative air leaks included patient demographics, smoking status, pulmonary function tests, disease aetiology (benign, malignant), neoadjuvant therapy (pre-operative radiotherapy/chemotherapy), extent and type of resection, and different consultant surgeons' practice. A logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 1,911 lung resections were performed over the 6-year study period. An air leak lasting more than 6 days post-operatively was present in 129 patients (6.7%). This included 100 out of the 1,250 patients (8%) from the lobectomy group and 29 out of the 661 patients (4.4%) from the wedge/segmentectomy group. Using the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for developing an air leak included a low predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (pFEV(1)) (p<0.001), performing an upper lobectomy (p=0.002) and different consultant practice (p=0.02). PAL was associated with increased length of stay (p<0.0001), in-hospital mortality (p=0.003) and intensive care unit readmission (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Air leaks after pulmonary resections were at an acceptable rate in our series. Particular patients are at a higher risk but meticulous surgical technique is vital in reducing their incidence. Our study shows that pFEV1 is the strongest predictor of post-operative air leaks.","Elsayed, H; McShane, J; Shackcloth, M",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/003588412x13171221592258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22943333/,20

During the Covid lockdown phase, dental operators were limited to providing emergency treatment that could not be postponed. Therefore, it is necessary for the dental team to restart safely to treat neglected oral diseases that may also affect systemic health. The role of the dental hygienist has apparently changed for procedures performed close to the patient's oral cavity, particularly in terms of the droplets and aerosols produced during oral hygiene practices. Through an analysis of the most recent literature on the use of dedicated PPE and changed post-Covid 19 work processes, and a review of the differences between manual causal therapy and mechanical therapy in terms of outcome after oral hygiene treatment, we define how the role of the dent﻿al hygienist can change positively. Materials and Methods: Narrative reviews of the literature in terms of PPE adopted and oral hygiene procedures performed were carried out in Pubmed. Results: 188 articles from February 2020 to May 2020 using the search terms 'dentistry' and 'covid-19' were examined. 10 reviews of the literature were performed using the search terms 'mechanical procedures' and 'manual hygiene'.

66144,Severe respiratory viral infection induces procalcitonin in the absence of bacterial pneumonia.,2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, thereare children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to thatseen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). OBJECTIVE The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. RESULTS The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. CONCLUSION COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. Ithas become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder diseasebecause of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they canpresent with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.","Frenkel, Lawrence; Gomez, Fernando; Bellanti, Joseph A",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2020.42.200104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143815/,20
66695,Ryk modulates the niche activity of mesenchymal stromal cells by fine-tuning canonical Wnt signaling.,2020-07-28,"Angiotensin (1-7) production increases during AT1R (angiotensin type-1 receptor) blockade. The contribution of Ang (1-7) (angiotensin [1-7]) and its receptor (MasR) to the favorable effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on remodeling and function of resistance arteries remains unclear. We sought to determine whether MasR contributes to the improvement of vascular structure and function during chronic AT1R blockade. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with Ang (1-7) or olmesartan ± MasR antagonist A-779, or vehicle, for 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by tail cuff methodology. Mesenteric arteries were dissected and mounted on a pressurized micromyograph to evaluate media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) and endothelial function. Expression of MasR and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) was evaluated by immunoblotting, plasma nitrate by colorimetric assay, and reactive oxygen species production by dihydroethidium staining. Independently of blood pressure, olmesartan significantly reduced M/L and improved NO bioavailability, A-779 prevented these effects. Likewise, Ang (1-7) significantly reduced M/L and NO bioavailability. MasR expression was significantly increased by Ang (1-7) as well as by olmesartan, and it was blunted in the presence of A-779. Both Ang (1-7) and olmesartan increased eNOS expression and plasma nitrite which were reduced by A-779. Superoxide generation was attenuated by olmesartan and Ang (1-7) and was blunted in the presence of A-779. These MasR-mediated actions were independent of AT2R activation since olmesartan and Ang (1-7) increased MasR expression and reduced M/L in Ang II (angiotensin II)-infused AT2R knockout mice, independently of blood pressure control. A-779 prevented these effects. Hence, MasR activation may contribute to the favorable effects of AT1R antagonism on NO bioavailability and microvascular remodeling, independently of AT2R activation and blood pressure control.","Savoia, Carmine; Arrabito, Emanuele; Parente, Rosa; Nicoletti, Carmine; Madaro, Luca; Battistoni, Allegra; Filippini, Antonio; Steckelings, Ulrike M; Touyz, Rhian M; Volpe, Massimo",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.15527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070664/,20

OBJECTIVES To examine whether people requiring palliative care were included in non-pharmacological delirium intervention studies in inpatient settings, how they were characterised and what their outcomes were. DESIGN Systematic review (PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017062178). DATA SOURCES Systematic search in March 2017 for non-pharmacological delirium intervention studies in adult inpatients. Database search terms were 'delirium', 'hospitalisation', 'inpatient', 'palliative care', 'hospice', 'critical care' and 'geriatrics'. Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodological checklists guided risk of bias assessment. RESULTS The 29 included studies were conducted between 1994 and 2015 in diverse settings in 15 countries (9136 participants, mean age = 76.5 years (SD = 8.1), 56% women). Most studies tested multicomponent interventions (n = 26) to prevent delirium (n = 19). Three-quarters of the 29 included studies (n = 22) excluded various groups of people requiring palliative care; however, inclusion criteria, participant diagnoses, illness severity and mortality indicated their presence in almost all studies (n = 26). Of these, 21 studies did not characterise participants requiring palliative care or report their specific outcomes (72%), four reported outcomes for older people with frailty, dementia, cancer and comorbidities, and one was explicitly focused on people receiving palliative care. Study heterogeneity and limitations precluded definitive determination of intervention effectiveness and only allowed interpretations of feasibility for people requiring palliative care. Acceptability outcomes (intervention adverse events and patients' subjective experience) were rarely reported overall. CONCLUSION Non-pharmacological delirium interventions have frequently excluded and under-characterised people requiring palliative care and infrequently reported their outcomes.","Hosie, Annmarie; Siddiqi, Najma; Featherstone, Imogen; Johnson, Miriam; Lawlor, Peter G; Bush, Shirley H; Amgarth-Duff, Ingrid; Edwards, Layla; Cheah, Seong Leang; Phillips, Jane; Agar, Meera",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216319853487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250725/,20

Here, we compared intraspecies sensitivity to toxicants for Mesocyclops leuckarti of which toxicity data was obtained from published literatures, and zebrafish Danio rerio of which toxicity data was done in this study). Due to the internal concentration of chemicals not measured, simplified toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models were used, and we investigated whether TK-TD parameters estimated by Bayesian method might represent the differences in sensitivity between life-stages of 2 species. The results demonstrated that the difference in TK-TD parameters (background mortality m0, no effect concentration NEC, the killing rate ks, and the dominant rate kd) could represent the toxicity difference between life-stages of individual species. The TK-TD model could predict toxicity in individual species (Cyprinus carpio L., Enchytraeus crypticus, Folsomia candida, Hyalella Azteca) exposed to different chemical concentrations and successfully extrapolate toxicity between different life stages of Mesocyclops leuckarti and Danio rerio by scaling several TK-TD parameters. The modified TK-TD model on the extrapolation toxicity of chemicals between life stages for species could be useful for the ERA and for deriving and revising WQC for chemicals.","Gao, Yongfei; Xie, Zhicheng; Feng, Mingfeng; Feng, Jianfeng; Zhu, Lin",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888597/,20

This cardiac disturbance carries a 10% risk of sudden cardiac death due to the malignant arrhythmia, Torsades de Pointes. The Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (AzCERT) has classified QTc prolonging therapeutic classes such as antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, anti-infectives, and others. AzCERT criteria categorizes medications into three risk categories: ""known,"" ""possible,"" and ""conditional risk"" of QTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. The list of QTc prolonging medications continues to expand as new drug classes are approved and studied. Risk factors for QTc prolongation can be delineated into modifiable or non-modifiable. A validated risk scoring tool may be utilized to predict the likelihood of prolongation in patients receiving AzCERT classified medication. The resultant risk score may be applied to a clinical decision support system which offers mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies including discontinuation of possible offending agents with selection of an alternative agent, assessment of potential drug interactions or dose adjustments through pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic monitoring, and initiation of both ECG and electrolyte monitoring are essential to prevent a drug-induced arrhythmia. The challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of innovative continuous monitoring technology, increasing protection for both patients and healthcare workers.

We have previously identified the putative causal mutation of MHV-Wüts18 as a C to U transition at codon 2446 in ORF1b, which results in a substitution of proline 12 with serine in non-structural protein 16. Here, we have used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system to produce a recombinant virus, inf-MHV-Wüts18((AGC)) that encodes nsp16 serine 12 with AGC rather than UCU; a difference that facilitates the isolation of second-site revertants. Sequence analysis of nine inf-MHV-Wüts18((AGC)) revertant viruses suggests that their phenotype is most probably due to the intra-molecular substitution of amino acids in nsp16. However, the revertant viruses displayed different plaque sizes and whole genome sequencing of two revertants showed that they were isogenic apart from a mutation in nsp13. These results are discussed in the context of a model of coronavirus MHV nsp16 structure.","Chang, Guo-hui; Oliver, Elizabeth; Stanton, Ian; Wilson, Matthew; Luo, Bao-jun; Lin, Lei; Davidson, Andrew; Siddell, Stuart",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.026781-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20943891/,20
70959,What is a pandemic?,2009,"INTRODUCTION Body temperature measurement in children is of clinical relevance. Although rectal measurement is the gold standard, less invasive tools have become available. We aimed to describe the accuracy of tympanic, infrared skin, or temporal artery scan thermometers compared with rectal measurement to reflect core temperature. METHODS Rectal (Filac 3000; Covidien, Mechelen, Belgium), tympanic (AccuSystem Genius2 Typmanic Infrared Ear Thermometer, Covidien, Mechelen, Belgium), temporal artery scan (Exergen, Exergen Corp, Watertown, Massachusetts), and infrared (ThermoFlash Contactless Medical Electronic Thermometer, Visiomedlab, Paris, France) body temperature measurements were randomly performed and readings were collected once. Temperature readings were described as median and range, and observations were compared with rectal temperature readings (using Wilcoxon, Bland-Altman, sensitivity, and specificity tests). The child's comfort was assessed by the child, parent, and nurse (using Likert scales) and ease of use was assessed by nurses (using visual analog scale). RESULTS Based on observations in 294 (median age = 3.2 years, range = 0.02-17 years) children, the mean difference was 0.49°C (tympanic scan; P < 0.0001), 0.34°C (infrared skin scan; P < 0.0001), and 0°C (temporal artery scan; P = 0.9288), respectively, when compared with rectal temperature readings. Based on visual inspection of Bland-Altman plots, all tools overestimated the temperature at lower body temperature and underestimated the temperature at higher body temperature, resulting in a sensitivity of 22% to 41% and a specificity of 98% to 100% for rectal temperatures above 38°C. The Likert scale scores and the visual analog scale scores for rectal measurement were only slightly higher when compared with the other methods. CONCLUSIONS All noninvasive techniques underperformed compared with rectal measurement. The temporal artery scan deviations were smallest, but all noninvasive techniques overestimate lower temperatures and underestimate higher temperatures compared with rectal measurement. In our hands, temporal artery scan measurement seems to be second best, but not yet ideal.","Allegaert, Karel; Casteels, Kristina; van Gorp, Ilse; Bogaert, Guy","Current therapeutic research, clinical and experimental",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.curtheres.2013.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25067984/,20
71016,Endothelialization of over- and undersized flow-diverter stents at covered vessel side branches: An in vivo and in silico study.,2016,"BACKGROUND Canine progressive retinal atrophies are a group of hereditary retinal degenerations in dogs characterised by depletion of photoreceptor cells in the retina, which ultimately leads to blindness. PRA in the Lhasa Apso (LA) dog has not previously been clinically characterised or described in the literature, but owners in the UK are advised to have their dog examined through the British Veterinary Association/ Kennel Club/ International Sheep Dog Society (BVA/KC/ISDS) eye scheme annually, and similar schemes that are in operation in other countries. After the exclusion of 25 previously reported canine retinal mutations in LA PRA-affected dogs, we sought to identify the genetic cause of PRA in this breed. RESULTS Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data of three PRA-affected LA and three LA without signs of PRA did not identify any exonic or splice site variants, suggesting the causal variant was non-exonic. We subsequently undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS), which identified a 1.3 Mb disease-associated region on canine chromosome 33, followed by whole-genome sequencing analysis that revealed a long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) insertion upstream of the IMPG2 gene. IMPG2 has previously been implicated in human retinal disease; however, until now no canine PRAs have been associated with this gene. The identification of this PRA-associated variant has enabled the development of a DNA test for this form of PRA in the breed, here termed PRA4 to distinguish it from other forms of PRA described in other breeds. This test has been used to determine the genotypes of over 900 LA dogs. A large cohort of genotyped dogs was used to estimate the allele frequency as between 0.07-0.1 in the UK LA population. CONCLUSIONS Through the use of GWAS and subsequent sequencing of a PRA case, we have identified a LINE-1 insertion in the retinal candidate gene IMPG2 that is associated with a form of PRA in the LA dog. Validation of this variant in 447 dogs of 123 breeds determined it was private to LA dogs. We envisage that, over time, the developed DNA test will offer breeders the opportunity to avoid producing dogs affected with this form of PRA.","Hitti-Malin, Rebekkah J; Burmeister, Louise M; Ricketts, Sally L; Lewis, Thomas W; Pettitt, Louise; Boursnell, Mike; Schofield, Ellen C; Sargan, David; Mellersh, Cathryn S",BMC genetics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12863-020-00911-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894063/,20
72232,Global Sequence Analysis and Expression of Azurin Gene in Different Clinical Specimens of Burn Patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection.,2020,"OBJECTIVE To study the use of video visits for male infertility care prior to the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: We reviewed video visits for male infertility patients completed at a tertiary academic center in southeast Michigan. These patients had follow-up after an initial in-person evaluation. We designed this retrospective case series to describe the diagnostic categories seen through telehealth, management steps completed during video visits, and to understand whether additional in-person care was required within 90 days of video visits. In addition, we estimated time and cost savings for patients attributed to video visits. RESULTS Most men seen during video visits had an endocrinologic (29%) or anatomic (21%) cause for their infertility. 73% of video visits involved reviewing results; 30% included counseling regarding assistive reproductive technologies; and 25% of video visits resulted in prescribing hormonally active medications. The two patients (3%) who were seen in clinic after their video visit underwent a varicocelectomy in the interim. No patients required an unplanned in-person visit. From a patient perspective, video visits were estimated to save a median of 97 minutes (IQR 64-250) of travel per visit. Median cost savings per patient- by avoiding travel and taking time off work for a clinic visit-were estimated to range from $149 (half day off) to $252 (full day off). CONCLUSIONS Video visits for established male infertility patients were used to manage different causes of infertility while saving patients time and money. Telehealth for established patients did not trigger additional in-person evaluations.","Andino, Juan; Zhu, Alex; Chopra, Zoey; Daignault-Newton, Stephanie; Ellimoottil, Chad; Dupree, James M",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2021.03.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022261/,20
72345,Research brief.,2019,"UNLABELLED Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are influenced by type 1 interferon-mediated antiviral defenses and by viral countermeasures to these defenses. When IAV NS1 protein is disabled, RNase L restricts virus replication; however, the RNAs targeted for cleavage by RNase L under these conditions have not been defined. In this study, we used deep-sequencing methods to identify RNase L cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs from IAV PR8ΔNS1-infected A549 cells. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of RNase L allowed us to distinguish between RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites. RNase L-dependent cleavage sites were evident at discrete locations in IAV RNA segments (both positive and negative strands). Cleavage in PB2, PB1, and PA genomic RNAs suggests that viral RNPs are susceptible to cleavage by RNase L. Prominent amounts of cleavage mapped to specific regions within IAV RNAs, including some areas of increased synonymous-site conservation. Among cellular RNAs, RNase L-dependent cleavage was most frequent at precise locations in rRNAs. Our data show that RNase L targets specific sites in both host and viral RNAs to restrict influenza virus replication when NS1 protein is disabled. IMPORTANCE RNase L is a critical component of interferon-regulated and double-stranded-RNA-activated antiviral host responses. We sought to determine how RNase L exerts its antiviral activity during influenza virus infection. We enhanced the antiviral activity of RNase L by disabling a viral protein, NS1, that inhibits the activation of RNase L. Then, using deep-sequencing methods, we identified the host and viral RNAs targeted by RNase L. We found that RNase L cleaved viral RNAs and rRNAs at very precise locations. The direct cleavage of IAV RNAs by RNase L highlights an intimate battle between viral RNAs and an antiviral endonuclease.","Cooper, Daphne A; Banerjee, Shuvojit; Chakrabarti, Arindam; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Hesselberth, Jay R; Silverman, Robert H; Barton, David J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02953-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25540362/,20
72810,Advanced glycosylation end products inhibit the proliferation of bone-marrow stromal cells through activating MAPK pathway.,2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND Serum estradiol levels in severe acute injury are correlated with in hospital mortality. In acute pancreatitis, serum estradiol levels are strong predictors of disease severity. Studies of whether changes in estradiol levels play a causative role in acute pancreatitis severity are limited. The ovariectomized mouse model has been used to study the effects of estradiol in health and disease. AIMS We assessed whether the ovariectomized mouse model could be used to assess the effects of estradiol on pancreatitis severity. METHODS C57BL/6 mice with their ovaries removed were used to simulate low circulating estradiol conditions. Ovariectomized mice were treated with six hourly injections of cerulein to induce mild acute pancreatitis and compared to ovariectomized mice pre-treated with subcutaneous estradiol injections. RESULTS Findings suggest ovariectomized model is a problematic preparation to study pancreatitis. At baseline, ovariectomy leads to prominent acinar cell ultrastructure changes as well as changes in other select morphologic and biomarkers of pancreatitis. In addition, ovariectomy changed select acute pancreatitis responses that were only partially rescued by estradiol pre-treatment. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the ovariectomized mouse as a model of estradiol depletion should be used with caution in pancreatic studies. Future studies should explore whether derangements in other female hormones produced by the ovaries can lead to changes in pancreatic studies.","Wang, Melinda; Gorelick, Fred",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-021-07116-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169436/,20

To detect gelation two methods were used: the stabilization of the director pattern, which measures the interaction of the physical gel network with the LC-director, and the suppression of the onset of electrohydrodynamic instabilities, which measures the increase of viscosity. Special emphasis was put on the influence of the photochemical - isomerization of the gelling agents on gelation.From the stabilization of the director pattern an elastic component can be seen by the memory effect (two different switching times). Photochemical - isomerization destroys this memory effect. The increase of the threshold field for the onset of electrohydrodynamic instabilities in free-standing films measures the increase of viscosity and the supression of flow. Both methods detect the same melting temperature of the gel and the same reduction of the gelling ability upon - isomerization. This proves that the gelling abilities of the new azo-containing gelling agents can be reversibly switched on and off by photoisomerization.","Deindörfer, Pia; Eremin, Alexey; Stannarius, Ralf; Davis, Riju; Zentel, Rudolf",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b603562k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680227/,20

It aims to uncover how British parliamentarians use moral foundations to discuss the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Twitter, using Moral Foundations Theory as a classification basis for their tweets. It is found that the majority of Brexit related tweets contain elements of moral reasoning, especially relating to the foundations of Authority and Loyalty. There are common underlying foundations between parties, but parties express opposing viewpoints within a single foundation. The study provides useful insights into Twitter's use as an arena for moral argumentation, as well as uncovers the politician's uses of moral arguments during Brexit agreement negotiations on Twitter.

73084,Molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases.,2009,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a serious public health problem worldwide. Treatments are limited, and no preventive vaccine is available. Toward developing an HCV vaccine, we engineered two recombinant measles viruses (MVs) expressing structural proteins from the prototypic HCV subtype 1a strain H77. One virus directs the synthesis of the HCV capsid (C) protein and envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2), which fold properly and form a heterodimer. The other virus expresses the E1 and E2 glycoproteins separately, with each one fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the MV fusion protein. Although these hybrid glycoproteins were transported to the plasma membrane, they were not incorporated into MV particles. Immunization of MV-susceptible, genetically modified mice with either vector induced neutralizing antibodies to MV and HCV. A boost with soluble E2 protein enhanced titers of neutralizing antibody against the homologous HCV envelope. In animals primed with MV expressing properly folded HCV C-E1-E2, boosting also induced cross-neutralizating antibodies against two heterologous HCV strains. These results show that recombinant MVs retain the ability to induce MV-specific humoral immunity while also eliciting HCV neutralizing antibodies, and that anti-HCV immunity can be boosted with a single dose of purified E2 protein. The use of MV vectors could have advantages for pediatric HCV vaccination.","Reyes-del Valle, Jorge; de la Fuente, Cynthia; Turner, Mallory A; Springfeld, Christoph; Apte-Sengupta, Swapna; Frenzke, Marie E; Forest, Amelie; Whidby, Jillian; Marcotrigiano, Joseph; Rice, Charles M; Cattaneo, Roberto",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01776-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22896607/,20

74906,Advances in addressing technical challenges of point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited settings.,2016,"PURPOSE This article is part of an ongoing body of investigation examining the experiences of lawyers with diverse and multiple minority identities, with particular focus on lawyers with disabilities; lawyers who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (""LGBTQ+"" as an overarching term); and lawyers with minority identities associated with race and ethnicity, gender, and age. The focus of this article is on discrimination and bias in their workplaces as reported by the lawyers experiencing it. METHODS We employ survey data from the first phase of this investigation, gathered from the survey responses of 3590 lawyers located across all states in the United States and working in most types and sizes of legal venues. The data were collected between 2018 and 2019, before the 2020 pandemic. We estimate differences across three categories of discrimination reported-subtle-only discrimination, overt-only discrimination, and both subtle and overt discrimination. We estimate the nature and magnitude of associations among individual and organizational variables, and we use multinomial logistic regression to illustrate relative risks of reports of discrimination for intersecting identities. RESULTS As compared to non-disabled lawyers, lawyers with disabilities show a higher likelihood of reporting both subtle and overt discrimination versus no discrimination. Similarly, lawyers who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (""LGBQ"") show a higher likelihood of reporting both subtle and overtdiscrimination, and subtle-only discrimination, as compared to lawyers who identify as straight/heterosexual. Women lawyers and lawyers of color are more likely to report all three types of discrimination. In general, younger lawyers are more likely to report subtle-only discrimination when compared to older lawyers. Lawyers working at a private firm are less likely to report all types of discrimination, while working for a larger organization is associated with a higher relative risk of reporting subtle-only discrimination versus no discrimination. CONCLUSIONS The current study represents a next, incremental step for better understanding non-monochromatic and intersectional aspects of individual identity in the legal profession. The findings illustrate that primary individual and multiple minority identities, as identified by disability, sexual orientation, gender, race/ethnicity, and age, are associated with reports of discrimination and bias in the legal workplace.","Blanck, Peter; Hyseni, Fitore; Wise, Fatma Altunkol",American journal of law & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/amj.2021.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34247678/,20

Little was known about the impact of these changes on childbearing women. AIM To describe childbearing women's experiences of becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS A qualitative exploratory design using semi-structured interviews was used. Women were recruited through social media and self-nominated to participate in an interview. Maximum variation sampling was used. A total of 27 interviews were conducted with women across Australia. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS The thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes and ten sub-themes. The themes were 'going it alone - having a baby was an isolating experience' ('receiving maternity care alone', 'dealing with government restrictions', and 'desiring social support'), 'advocating for self or others' ('seeking reliable information', 'valuing peersupport', and 'having to be resourceful'), 'finding a way through' ('a changed experience for all', 'managing stress and anxiety', 'requiring constant adjustments', and 'managing fear mongering'), and 'keeping safe'. CONCLUSION Becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia was a profound experience for the women. Following the public health initiatives which resulted in physical distancing restrictions, isolation, and the need to provide and receive social and peer support were common experiences. Whilst public health initiatives are implemented to keep people safe, the social and emotional toll on childbearing women should be considered by healthcare professionals. Childbearing women need to be safe but also require support and reassurance.","Sweet, Linda; Bradfield, Zoe; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Wynter, Karen; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Homer, Caroline S E; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wilson, Alyce N",Midwifery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.102996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813305/,20

This study aims to explore international differences in the pediatric mortality rate. Methods We analyzed several countries with populations over 5 million that report disaggregated data of COVID-19 deaths by quinquennial or decennial age groups. Data were extracted from COVID-19 cases and deaths by age database, National Ministeries of Health, and the World Health Organization. Results We included 23 countries in the analysis. Pediatric mortality varied from 0 to 12.1 deaths per million children of the corresponding age group, with the highest rate in Peru. In most countries, deaths were more frequent in the 0-4-year-old age group, except for Brazil. The pediatric/general COVID-19 mortality showed a great variation and ranged from 0% (Republic of Korea) to 10.4% (India). Pediatric and pediatric/general COVID mortality correlates strongly with 2018 neonatal mortality (r = 0.77, p < 0.001; and r = 0.88, p < 0.001, respectively), while shows a moderate or no correlation (r = 0.47, p = 0.02; and r = 0.19, p = 0.38, respectively) with COVID-19 mortality in the general population. Conclusions International heterogeneity in pediatric COVID-19 mortality importantly parallels historical neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is a well-known index of the quality of a country's health system, which points to the importance of social determinants of health in pediatric COVID-19 mortality disparities.

These advances have been driven in part by the pediatric neurology physician-scientist workforce and its efforts. However, pediatric neurology research faces significant challenges from internal and external forces including work-life balance demands, COVID-19 pandemic effects, and research funding. Understanding the impact of these challenges on the perceptions, planning, and careers of pediatric neurology physician-scientists is needed to guide the research mission. METHODS Our objective was to survey the research challenges, goals, and priorities of pediatric neurologists. In 2020 we conducted a cross-sectional, 28-question survey emailed to 1,775 members of the Child Neurology Society. RESULTS One hundred fifty-one individuals responded to the survey. Most respondents were grant investigators (52%) and conducted clinical research (69%). Research areas included epilepsy (23%), neurodevelopmental and autism (16%), neurocritical care and stroke (11%), neurogenetics and neurometabolics (9%), neonatal neurology (8%), and others. The most common funding source was the National Institutes of Health (37%). Shared major research concerns were funding, utilization of remote technology, overcoming disparities, natural history and multicenter studies, global neurology, and diversification of the research portfolio. Commitment to continuing and increasing research efforts was evident.

78906,"Human Parvovirus 4: an emerging etiological agent in cases presenting with Influenza like illness"".",2020-10-05,"Objective To analyse the clinical features of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and employ data mining technology to explore the rules of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) therapy. Methods The clinical data of 216 patients with DPN and qi-yin deficiency syndrome were obtained, and the clinical features of the patients were assessed by cluster analysis. Relevant information was entered into the clinical diagnosis and treatment collection system, and data mining techniques were used to analyse the drug frequency, core CHM, CHM pair, and so on. Results In this study, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and homocysteine (HCY) were closely related to the pathogenesis of DPN. Overall, 162 patients had typical DPN syndrome characteristics, and we analysed 216 prescriptions, including 182 CHM. The frequencies of prescription of Astragalus membranaceus, Ligusticum wallichii, Poria cocos, and Radix Rehmanniae were greater than 45%. A Bayesian network analysis diagram showed that the 9 most common core CHM included Astragalus membranaceus, Ligusticum wallichii, Poria cocos, atractylodes rhizome, and Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. According to the association rules of CHM, Radix Ophiopogon is used for Codonopsis pilosula; Astragalus membranaceus and atractylodes rhizome for Rehmannia are also frequently used. Astragalus membranaceus and Cinnamomi Ramulus or Ligusticum wallichii and Moutan bark were highly related to a decreased Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score. Conclusion HbA1c and HCY are related risk factors for DPN. Numbness is a typical syndrome characteristic. Astragalus membranaceus is a monarch CHM and is used most frequently.","Zhao, Jindong; Li, Yan; Xin, Ling; Sun, Min; Yu, Chanjuan; Shi, Guobin; Bao, Taotao; Liu, Jian; Ni, Yingqun; Lu, RuiMin; Wu, Yuanyuan; Fang, Zhaohui",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5795264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724325/,20

79282,3T MRI reveals extra- and intracranial involvement in giant cell arteritis.,2015,"As part of efforts to improve study design, the use of outcome measures in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is receiving increasing attention. This review aimed to assess how clinical outcome assessments (COAs) have been used and reported in RCTs in adult TBI. Systematic literature searches were conducted to identify medium to large (n ≥ 100) acute and post-acute TBI trials published since 2000. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a set of structured templates. Items from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 Statement and CONSORT patient-reported outcomes (PROs) extension were used to evaluate reporting quality of COAs. Glasgow Outcome Scale/Extended (GOS/GOSE) data were extracted using a checklist developed specifically for the review. A total of 126 separate COAs were identified in 58 studies. The findings demonstrate heterogeneity in the use of TBI outcomes, limiting comparisons and meta-analyses of RCT findings. The GOS/GOSE was included in 39 studies, but implemented in a variety of ways, which may not be equivalent. Multi-dimensional outcomes were used in 30 studies, and these were relatively more common in rehabilitation settings. The use of PROs was limited, especially in acute study settings. Quality of reporting was variable, and key information concerning COAs was often omitted, making it difficult to know how precisely outcomes were assessed. Consistency across studies would be increased and future meta-analyses facilitated by (a) using common data elements (CDEs) recommendations for TBI outcomes and (b) following CONSORT guidelines when publishing RCTs.","Horton, Lindsay; Rhodes, Jonathan; Wilson, Lindsay",Journal of neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.5648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648972/,20

Mental health difficulties, including depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and other negative mental health sequelae are likely and likely to persist. These challenges will require response from the psychotherapeutic and medical community that addresses the mental health needs of the population. Using binary logistic regression (n = 322 at time 1, and n = 189 at time 2), researchers in the present study examined promotive factors related to having sought medical or behavioral health treatment during a 30-day period in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Approximately 10% of the sample indicated having sought either type of help. Results from the binary logistic regressions indicated those who sought counseling or medical help were those who reported increased depression symptoms at time 1. The likelihood of help seeking was heightened for those who reported greater caregiving burden, highlighting the need to consider the availability of services for those caring for children during this community-wide crisis.","Tambling, Rachel; Russell, Beth; Tomkunas, Alexandria; Horton, Abagail; Hutchison, Morica",Family & community health,https://doi.org/10.1097/fch.0000000000000298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565782/,20

The authors aimed to determine the influence of age on outcomes of most commonly performed bariatric procedures. METHODS The retrospective study included patients qualified for primary Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) or Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) in two academic hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups: ≥50 (21.2-26.9%) and <50 (57.6-73.1%) years old. Endpoints assessed the influence of patients' age on the perioperative and the one-year postoperative period. RESULTS Operative time was longer in the ≥50-year-old group, but only for LRYGB. There were no differences in the intraoperative adverse events, postoperative morbidity, reoperation and readmission rates between the groups. The risk of port site hernia was increased (OR: 4.23, CI: 1.49-12.06) in the ≥50-year-old group. The mean % of total weight loss 12 months after the bariatric procedure was comparable, but % of excess weight loss and % of excess body mass index loss were lower in the ≥50-year-old group (p = .033 and .032). CONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery is safe and feasible in patients over 50 years old. The weight loss effect can be worse among patients over 50 years old; nevertheless, the treatment should be considered as effective.","Major, Piotr; Wysocki, Michał; Janik, Michał; Stefura, Tomasz; Walędziak, Maciej; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Kowalewski, Piotr; Paśnik, Krzysztof; Budzyński, Andrzej",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015458.2018.1433797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29397782/,20

Ultimately, our knowledge about the biological activity of these factors allowed us to better understand how the immune system functions in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases leading to the development of targeted biologic therapies. The study of cytokine signal transduction led to the discovery of Janus kinases (JAK), and the consideration of therapeutically targeting JAKs to treat immune and inflammatory diseases. This year also marks the tenth anniversary of the approval of the first JAK inhibitor (jakinib) and now there are a total of nine approved jakinibs for treatment of rheumatologic, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and neoplastic indications and most recently COVID-19. Here, we summarized the discoveries that led to development of first-generation jakinibs, discussed some of the newer, possibly more selective jakinibs, as well as jakinibs that also target other kinases. We also illustrated the rationale behind the application of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 cytokine storm. In this review we will discuss the clinical success of jakinibs, the gaps in our understanding of their biological activities as well as challenges in regard to their clinical application.

80350,Reply to Huang et al.,2014,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is a fundamental and significant task since it can guide subsequent clinic diagnosis and treatment. However, images are often corrupted by defects such as low-contrast, noise, intensity inhomogeneity, and so on. Therefore, a weighted level set model (WLSM) is proposed in this study to segment inhomogeneous intensity MRI destroyed by noise and weak boundaries. First, in order to segment the intertwined regions of brain tissue accurately, a weighted neighborhood information measure scheme based on local multi information and kernel function is designed. Then, the membership function of fuzzy c-means clustering is used as the spatial constraint of level set model to overcome the sensitivity of level set to initialization, and the evolution of level set function can be adaptively changed according to different tissue information. Finally, the distance regularization term in level set function is replaced by a double potential function to ensure the stability of the energy function in the evolution process. Both real and synthetic MRI images can show the effectiveness and performance of WLSM. In addition, compared with several state-of-the-art models, segmentation accuracy and Jaccard similarity coefficient obtained by WLSM are increased by 0.0586, 0.0362 and 0.1087, 0.0703, respectively.","Song, Jianhua; Zhang, Zhe",Entropy,https://doi.org/10.3390/e23091196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573821/,20
80379,Implications of the Revisions and Revaluation of Office/Outpatient Evaluation and Management Codes for Neuroradiology Reimbursement.,2020-06-18,"PURPOSE The success of immunotherapy with dendritic cells (DC) to treat cancer is dependent on effective migration to the lymph nodes and subsequent activation of antigen-specific T cells. In this study, we investigated the fate of DC after intradermal (i.d.) or intranodal (i.n.) administration and the consequences for the immune activating potential of DC vaccines in melanoma patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN DC were i.d. or i.n. administered to 25 patients with metastatic melanoma scheduled for regional lymph node resection. To track DC in vivo with scintigraphic imaging and in lymph nodes by immunohistochemistry, cells were labeled with both [(111)In]-indium and superparamagnetic iron oxide. RESULTS After i.d. injection, maximally 4% of the DC reached the draining lymph nodes. When correctly delivered, all DC were delivered to one or more lymph nodes after i.n. injection. Independent of the route of administration, large numbers of DC remained at the injection site, lost viability, and were cleared by infiltrating CD163+ macrophages within 48 hours. Interestingly, 87 +/- 10% of the surviving DC preferentially migrated into the T-cell areas, where they induced antigen-specific T-cell responses. Even though more DC reached the T-cell areas, i.n. injection of DC induced similar antigen-specific immune responses as i.d. injection. Immune responses were already induced with <5 x 10(5) DC migrating into the T-cell areas. CONCLUSIONS Monocyte-derived DC have high immune activating potential irrespective of the route of vaccination. Limited numbers of DC in the draining lymph nodes are sufficient to induce antigen-specific immunologic responses.","Verdijk, Pauline; Aarntzen, Erik H J G; Lesterhuis, W Joost; Boullart, A C Inge; Kok, Ellemieke; van Rossum, Michelle M; Strijk, Simon; Eijckeler, Femke; Bonenkamp, Johannes J; Jacobs, Joannes F M; Blokx, Willeke; Vankrieken, J Han J M; Joosten, Irma; Boerman, Otto C; Oyen, Wim J G; Adema, Gosse; Punt, Cornelis J A; Figdor, Carl G; de Vries, I Jolanda M",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-08-2729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19318472/,20

METHODS Between March 8, 2020, and May 26, 2020, the data of 503 neonates born to 497 mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy or at the time of delivery were collected by 79 hospitals throughout Spain. RESULTS Maternal symptoms were similar to that of the general population, with 5% of severe forms. In 45.8% of asymptomatic women at the time of delivery, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was detected because of recommendations established in Spain to perform COVID-19 screening in all women admitted to the hospital for labor. The rate of preterm deliveries was 15.7% and of cesarean deliveries, 33%. The most common diagnostic test was detection of viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs at a median age of 3 hours after delivery (1-12 hours). Almost one-half of neonates were left skin-to-skin after delivery, and delayed clamping of umbilical cords was performed in 43% of neonates. Also, 62.3% of asymptomatic neonates were managed with rooming-in. Maternal milk was received by 76.5% of neonates, 204 of them as exclusive breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS The current study indicates that there is no need for separation of mothers from neonates, allowing delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin contact along with maintenance of breastfeeding in a high percentage of newborns from mothers with COVID-19.","Sánchez-Luna, Manuel; Fernández Colomer, Belén; de Alba Romero, Concepción; Alarcón Allen, Ana; Baña Souto, Ana; Camba Longueira, Fátima; Cernada Badía, María; Galve Pradell, Zenaida; González López, María; López Herrera, M Cruz; Ribes Bautista, Carmen; Sánchez García, Laura; Zamora Flores, Elena",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-015065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479162/,20

METHODS AND RESULTS The Bavarian Reperfusion Alternatives Evaluation (BRAVE) 4 study is an investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, multicentre trial, designed to test the hypothesis that in STEMI patients with planned primary PCI a strategy based on prasugrel plus bivalirudin is superior to a strategy based on clopidogrel plus heparin in terms of net clinical outcome. Owing to slow recruitment, the trial was stopped prematurely after enrolment of 548 of 1240 planned patients. At 30 days, the primary composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization of the infarct related artery, stent thrombosis, stroke, or bleeding was observed in 42 patients (15.6%) randomized to prasugrel plus bivalirudin and 40 patients (14.5%) randomized to clopidogrel plus heparin [relative risk, 1.09; one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0-1.79, P = 0.680]. The composite ischaemic endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization of the infarct-related artery, stent thrombosis, or stroke occurred in 13 patients (4.8%) in the prasugrel plus bivalirudin group and 15 patients (5.5%) in the clopidogrel plus heparin group (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI 0.40-1.96, P = 0.894). Bleeding according to the HORIZONS-AMI definition was observed in 38 patients (14.1%) in the prasugrel plus bivalirudin group and 33 patients (12.0%) in the clopidogrel plus heparin group (relative risk, 1.18; 95% CI 0.74-1.88, P = 0.543). Results were consistent across various subgroups of patients. CONCLUSION In this randomized trial of STEMI patients, we were unable to demonstrate significant differences in net clinical outcome between prasugrel plus bivalirudin and clopidogrel plus heparin. Neither the composite of ischaemic complications nor bleeding were favourably affected by prasugrel plus bivalirudin compared with a regimen of clopidogrel plus unfractionated heparin.

CACS plays a key role in risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD) and patient management. Recent emergence of AI algorithms, particularly deep learning (DL)-based applications, have provided considerable progress in CACS. Many investigations have focused on the clinical role of DL models in CACS and showed excellent agreement between those algorithms and manual scoring, not only in dedicated coronary calcium CT but also in coronary CT angiography (CCTA), low-dose chest CT, and standard chest CT.

Methods In this cross-sectional study, we collected demographic and epidemiological data of 376 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 among children younger than 18 years of age. Using descriptive statistics and odds ratios, we described the odds of exposure outside the family after the implementation of control measures compared to before. Results Children diagnosed on or after February 4, 2020, had a lower odds of exposure to COVID-19 outside of the family compared to those diagnosed before February 3, 2020 (OR =0.594, 95% CI: 0.391 to 0.904). In the stratified analysis, children aged 0 to 5 years had the lowest odds of exposure outside of the family (OR =0.420, 95% CI: 0.196 to 0.904) compared to the other age groups assessed. Conclusions Our study on the children infected with COVID-19 as well as their exposure within family provided evidence that the implementation of containment measures was effective in reducing the odds of exposure outside of the family, especially for preschool children. Continuation of these efforts, coupled with tailored prevention and health education messaging for younger aged children, may help to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among children until other therapeutic interventions or vaccines are available.","Yang, Shu; Feng, Xixi; Du, Peipei; He, Daihai; Estill, Janne; Yang, Lin; Wen, Chuanbiao; Luo, Jiawei; Wang, Xiaohui; Lu, Liqun; Li, Tingting; Tang, Xiujuan; Li, Weiguo; Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Enmei; Cao, Peihua; Chen, Yaolong",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633941/,20

We aimed at evaluating the hemostatic profile of SGA neonates, using thromboelastometry (TEM). This is an observational study performed in a Greek tertiary General Hospital during an 18-month period. Ninety-three neonates were included in the study: 48 appropriate for gestational age weight (AGA) neonates and 45 SGA neonates Extrinsically activated TEM (ex-TEM) parameters, such as clotting time, clot formation time, amplitude recorded at 5 and 10 min, a angle, maximum clot firmness, lysis index at 60 min, and also platelet count, were used for the evaluation of the hemostatic profile in all neonates. No statistically significant differences were noticed regarding all ex-TEM parameters between AGA and SGA neonates, while no event of hemorrhage or thrombosis was noticed in the study population.Conclusions: The coagulation system of SGA neonates seems to be fully functional, with no evident tendency toward coagulopathy or thrombosis, when compared with AGA neonates. TEM seems to provide a promising and valid assessment of coagulation and fibrinolysis systems and may be used as a valuable biomarker, in the future. Further studies, with large samples, are necessary to confirm our results. What is Known: • SGA neonates may present coagulation disorders mainly due to hepatic dysfunction, polycythemia, and thrombocytopenia owing to long-term intrauterine hypoxia. • In the literature, despite the statistically significant differences in laboratory results between SGA and AGA neonates, no clinical manifestations of significantly altered hemostasis were recorded. Data of TEM interpretation of hemostasis in SGA neonates are not available. What is New: • TEM seems to interpret coagulation mechanism of preterm and full-term SGA neonates and confirm previous relevant literature findings regarding hemostasis in these neonates.","Sokou, Rozeta; Konstantinidi, Aikaterini; Stefanaki, Charikleia; Tsantes, Andreas G; Parastatidou, Stavroula; Lampropoulou, Katerina; Katsaras, George; Tavoulari, Evagelia; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Kyriakou, Elias; Gounaris, Antonios; Bonovas, Stefanos; Tsantes, Argirios E",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-019-03331-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707363/,20

This ecological time-series study was conducted in Imperatriz, Maranhão, Brazil. Leprosy cases diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 were included. Detection rates stratified by sex and age groups were estimated. The study of temporal trends was accomplished using the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition method and temporal modeling of detection rates using linear seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model according to Box and Jenkins method. Trend forecasts were performed for the 2017-2020 period. A total of 3,212 cases of leprosy were identified, the average incidence among men aged between 30 and 59 years old was 201.55/100,000 inhabitants and among women in the same age group was 135.28/100,000 inhabitants. Detection rates in total and by sex presented a downward trend, though rates stratified according to sex and age presented a growing trend among men aged less than 15 years old and among women aged 60 years old or over. The final models selected in the time-series analysis show the forecasts of total detection rates and rates for men and women presented a downward trend for the 2017-2020 period.

One of the most studied and used as a paradigmatic case is the population collapse of the Rapa Nui society. Here, we test different hypotheses about it by developing explicit population dynamic models that integrate feedbacks between climatic, demographic and ecological factors that underpinned the socio-cultural trajectory of these people. We evaluate our model outputs against a reconstruction of past population size based on archaeological radiocarbon dates from the island. The resulting estimated demographic declines of the Rapa Nui people are linked to the long-term effects of climate change on the island's carrying capacity and, in turn, on the 'per-capita food supply'.","Lima, M; Gayo, E M; Latorre, C; Santoro, C M; Estay, S A; Cañellas-Boltà, N; Margalef, O; Giralt, S; Sáez, A; Pla-Rabes, S; Chr Stenseth, N",Proceedings.

DATA SOURCES Peer-reviewed articles were identified through searches of PubMed using the terms ""Middle East respiratory syndrome,"" ""coronavirus respiratory illness in Saudi Arabia,"" and ""novel (beta) coronavirus and human coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center"". In addition, articles were searched on the websites of the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using the terms ""Middle East respiratory syndrome"" and ""novel coronavirus in Middle East."" The reference lists of these articles and relevant review articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Final references were selected for inclusion in the review on the basis of their relevance. DATA SYNTHESIS The emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus causes severe pulmonary disease with multiorgan involvement and a high fatality rate. Within months after its emergence, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was reported in several countries worldwide in people who had traveled from the Middle East. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is considered a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barrier to humans, but the pathogenesis and the routes of transmission are not completely understood. There is currently no recommended treatment for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, although supportive treatment has played an important role. CONCLUSIONS This syndrome has raised global public health concerns about the dissemination of an emerging infectious disease and highlights the need for a coordinated global response to contain such a disease threat.","Alsolamy, Sami",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25785521/,20

86579,Laboratory-developed test regulation and the immunocompromised patient: uncertainty ahead.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND In treatment-refractory liver dominant metastatic colorectal cancer, the role of liver directed therapies still is unclear. We sought to determine a prognostic score for Y90 radioembolization in these patients. METHODS We analyzed 106 patients with refractory liver dominant mCRC who had undergone a total of 178 Y90 radioembolizations with resin microspheres was collected. Potential factors influencing survival were analyzed using a Cox regression. The Log rank test served to establish prognostic factors and to form a clinical score for outcome prediction after Y90 radioembolization. RESULTS Median survival of all patients was 6.7 months. Neither age nor prior surgical or systemic therapy nor metastatic spread had an effect on survival. In contrast, hepatic tumor load, Karnofsky index as well as CEA and CA19-9 serums level had a significant influence (p < 0.001, p = 0.037, p = 0.023 and p < 0.001, respectively). These three factors formed a score with 1 point each for tumor load >20 %, CEA >130 ng/ml or CA19-9 > 200U/ml and Karnofsky index <80 %. Patients with a score of 0 and 1 displayed a median OS of 10.4 months. Patients with a score of 2 and 3 demonstrated a median OS of 5.1 months only (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Overaggressive patient selection for Y90 radioembolization of liver dominant chemorefractory mCRC is of questionable benefit. A scoring system comprising hepatic tumor load, CEA and CA19-9 serum levels and Karnofsky index (TuCK-score) may support an improved patient selection. In our cohort of liver only versus liver dominant disease, extrahepatic lung or lymphatic metastases did not significantly alter the prognosis.","Damm, Robert; Seidensticker, Ricarda; Ulrich, Gerhard; Breier, Leonie; Steffen, Ingo G; Seidensticker, Max; Garlipp, Benjamin; Mohnike, Konrad; Pech, Maciej; Amthauer, Holger; Ricke, Jens",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-016-2549-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439702/,20
87514,Potential for bacteriophage therapy for Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia with influenza A coinfection.,2021-02-04,"Understanding consumer perceptions of meat alternatives is key to facilitating a shift toward more sustainable food consumption. Importantly, these perceptions may vary according to the characteristics of the consumer (e.g., preferences, motivations), the product (e.g., sensory attributes) and the encounter (e.g., how the meat alternative is presented/framed). Qualitative and quantitative methods were applied to examine consumer perceptions of five proposed alternatives to meat: legumes, tofu, seitan, lab-grown meat, and insects. In Study 1, 138 participants provided free associations with regards to conventional animal proteins (e.g., red/white meat, fish) and the five alternatives. Three profiles of consumers were identified: (1) hedonically motivated meat eaters uninterested in meat substitutes; (2) health-oriented meat eaters open to some meat substitutes; and (3) ethically conscious meat avoiders positively oriented to most meat alternatives. In Study 2, the presentation of the product was experimentally manipulated: 285 participants evaluated the same five meat alternatives along several dimensions (e.g., edibility, healthiness), either when framed as an individual product or as part of a larger meal. Overall, most meat alternatives benefited from a meal framing, with the notable exception of legumes, which benefited from an individual framing, and insects which were evaluated quite negatively regardless of framing. The present findings suggest that there is not a single way to frame all meat alternatives that will improve their appeal to all consumers.","Possidónio, Catarina; Prada, Marília; Graça, João; Piazza, Jared",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916208/,20
87520,Can mesenchymal stem cell therapy be the interim management of COVID-19?,2020-06-16,"Background Screening for Barrett's Oesophagus (BE) relies on endoscopy which is invasive and has a low yield. This study aimed to develop and externally validate a simple symptom and risk-factor questionnaire to screen for patients with BE. Methods Questionnaires from 1299 patients in the BEST2 case-controlled study were analysed: 880 had BE including 40 with invasive oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) and 419 were controls. This was randomly split into a training cohort of 776 patients and an internal validation cohort of 523 patients. External validation included 398 patients from the BOOST case-controlled study: 198 with BE (23 with OAC) and 200 controls. Identification of independently important diagnostic features was undertaken using machine learning techniques information gain (IG) and correlation based feature selection (CFS). Multiple classification tools were assessed to create a multi-variable risk prediction model. Internal validation was followed by external validation in the independent dataset. Findings The BEST2 study included 40 features. Of these, 24 added IG but following CFS, only 8 demonstrated independent diagnostic value including age, gender, smoking, waist circumference, frequency of stomach pain, duration of heartburn and acid taste and taking of acid suppression medicines. Logistic regression offered the highest prediction quality with AUC (area under the receiver operator curve) of 0.87. In the internal validation set, AUC was 0.86. In the BOOST external validation set, AUC was 0.81. Interpretation The diagnostic model offers valid predictions of diagnosis of BE in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, assisting in identifying who should go forward to invasive testing. Overweight men who have been taking stomach medicines for a long time may merit particular consideration for further testing. The risk prediction tool is quick and simple to administer but will need further calibration and validation in a prospective study in primary care.

88159,MR Imaging of Individual Perfusion Reorganization Using Superselective Pseudocontinuous Arterial Spin-Labeling in Patients with Complex Extracranial Steno-Occlusive Disease.,2017,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is generally diagnosed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or serological assays. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreases a few days after symptom onset. Thus, the RT-PCR sensitivity peaks at three days after symptom onset (approximately 80%). We evaluated the performance of the ARCHITECT® SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (henceforth termed IgG assay; Abbott Laboratories, Lake County, IL, USA), and the combination of RT-PCR and the IgG assay for COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods In this retrospective study, 206 samples from 70 COVID-19 cases at two hospitals in Tokyo that were positive using RT-PCR were used to analyze the diagnostic sensitivity. RT-PCR-negative (N=166), COVID-19-unrelated (N=418), and Japanese Red Cross Society (N=100) samples were used to evaluate specificity. Results Sensitivity increased daily after symptom onset and exceeded 84.4% after 10 days. Specificity ranged from 98.2% to 100% for samples from the three case groups. Seroconversion was confirmed from 9 to 20 days after symptom onset in 18 out of 32 COVID-19 cases with multiple samples and from another case with a positive result in the IgG assay for the first available sample. Conclusions The combination of RT-PCR and IgG assay improves the robustness of laboratory diagnostics by compensating for the limitations of each method.","Aoki, Kotaro; Takai, Kunitomo; Nagasawa, Tatsuya; Kashiwagi, Katsuhito; Mori, Nobuaki; Matsubayashi, Keiji; Satake, Masahiro; Tanaka, Ippei; Kodama, Nanae; Shimodaira, Takahiro; Ishii, Yoshikazu; Miyazaki, Taito; Ishii, Toshiaki; Morita, Toshisuke; Yoshimura, Toru; Tateda, Kazuhiro",Annals of laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2021.41.6.568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108284/,20

Methods Totally 63 discharged patients in Wuhan,China,who underwent both chest CT and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR)from February 1 to February 29,2020,were included.With RT-PCR as a gold standard,the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed.Patients were divided into mild/moderate and severe/critical groups according to the disease conditions,and clinical features such as sex,age,symptoms,hospital stay,comorbidities,and oxygen therapy were collected.CT images in the recovery phase were reviewed in terms of time from onset,CT features,location of lesions,lobe score,and total CT score. Results There were 37 patients in the mild/moderate group and 26 in the severe/critical group. Compared with the mild/moderate patients,the severe/critical patients had older age [(43±16) years vs. (52±16) years; t=2.10, P=0.040], longer hospital stay [(15±6)d vs. (19±7)d; t=2.70, P=0.009], higher dyspnea ratio (5.41% vs. 53.85%; χ2=18.90, P<0.001), lower nasal oxygen therapy ratio (81.08% vs. 19.23%;χ2=23.66, P<0.001), and higher bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation ratio (0 vs. 57.69%; χ2=25.62, P<0.001). Time from onset was (23±6) days in severe/critical group, significantly longer than that in mild/moderate group [(18±7) days] (t=3.40, P<0.001). Severe/critical patients had significantly higher crazy-paving pattern ratio (46.15% vs.10.81%;χ2=4.24, P=0.039) and lower ground-glass opacities ratio (15.38% vs. 67.57%; χ2=16.74, P<0.001) than the mild/moderate patients. The proportion of lesions in peripheral lung was significantly higher in mild/moderate group than in severe/critical group (78.38% vs.34.61%; χ2=13.43, P<0.001), and the proportion of diffusely distributed lesions was significantly higher in severe/critical group than in mild/moderate group (65.38% vs.10.81%; χ2=20.47, P<0.001). Total CT score in severe/critical group was also significantly higher in severe/critical group than in mild/moderate group [11 (8,17) points vs. 7 (4,9) points; Z=3.81, P<0.001]. Conclusions The CT features in the recovery stage differ between mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 patients.The lung infiltration is remarkably more severe in the latter.","Zou, Wenbin; Liu, Changyu; Cai, Yixin; Zeng, Zhilin; Zhang, Ni; Fu, Xiangning",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We compared perioperative outcomes of 82 consecutive patients undergoing RA-GB between 2013 and 2016 to 169 consecutive patients having undergone L-GB between 2009 and 2016. Secondary endpoints included duration of hospitalization, readmission rate, weight loss at 1 year, and the learning curve of RA-GB, assessed by operation times and complication rates. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between groups concerning age (43.5 ± 11.2 vs. 42.2 ± 12.4 years), body mass index (42.4 ± 5.0 vs. 43.6 ± 7.2 kg/m2), or comorbidities. The rate of revision surgery was higher in L-GB group without reaching statistical significance. No statistically significant difference was observed for duration of operation (134 ± 35 vs. 135 ± 37 min), readmission rate at 90 days (4.9% vs. 8.9%), or percentage of excess weight loss at 1 year (RA-GB vs. L-GB) (76.8% ± 20.5 vs. 73.1% ± 23.5). There were fewer statistically significant complications overall in RA-GB (9.8% vs. 21.9%, p = 0.019). Median duration of hospital stay was shorter for RA-GB (3 vs. 4 days, p < 0.0001). The mean duration of operation for RA-GB decreased from 153 min in 2014 to 122 min in 2016; p = 0.004. CONCLUSION In our experience, the robotic approach for gastric bypass was associated with fewer postoperative complications compared to traditional laparoscopic gastric bypass.

The significance of these fenestrations in relation to aneurysms remains unclear. We present four patients with fenestration-associated aneurysms and a comprehensive review of associations with aneurysms and other vascular lesions. A PubMed search of the literature was conducted from 1970-2012 reporting cases of intracranial aneurysms associated with arterial fenestration or duplications. Data were collected on patient presentation, sex, age, aneurysm and fenestration location, aneurysm treatment, and presence of other vascular lesions. We performed a retrospective review of four patients with intracranial fenestrations associated with aneurysms at our institution from 2012-2013. There were 59 cases of fenestrations and associated aneurysms in the literature. Aneurysms were reported as either arising from (n=50) or adjacent to but distinct from (n=13) fenestrations. The most common single fenestration location was at the basilar artery (n=23, 36.5%); however the majority of fenestrations were in the carotid circulation (n=34, 54.0%). The majority of patients with aneurysms and fenestrations at all locations except those at the anterior communicating artery (70.5%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients with aneurysms arising from a fenestration or adjacent to a fenestration presented with an additional intracranial vascular lesion in 38% and 31% of cases, respectively. The majority of all aneurysms were treated with microsurgical clipping. Aneurysms associated with cerebral arterial fenestrations are most commonly discovered after subarachnoid hemorrhage and are most often located in the carotid circulation. A high index of suspicion must be maintained for an associated vascular lesion if an intracranial fenestration is discovered.","Patel, Mira A; Caplan, Justin M; Yang, Wuyang; Colby, Geoffrey P; Coon, Alexander L; Tamargo, Rafael J; Huang, Judy",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2014.07.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150765/,20

93344,Systemic responses during local viral infections: type I IFNs sound the alarm.,2011,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Minimally invasive sacral colpopexy has increased over the past decade, with many senior physicians adopting this new skill set. However, skill acquisition at an academic institution in the presence of postgraduate learners is not well described. This manuscript outlines the introduction of laparoscopic sacral colpopexy to an academic urogynecology service that was not performing minimally invasive sacral colpopexies, and it also defines a surgical learning curve. METHODS The first 180 laparoscopic sacral colpopexies done by four attending urogynecologists from January 2009 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was operative time. Secondary outcomes included conversion to laparotomy, estimated blood loss, and intra- and postoperative complications. Linear regression was used to analyze trends in operative times. Fisher's exact test compared surgical complications and counts of categorical variables. RESULTS Mean total operative time was 250 ± 52 min (range 146-452) with hysterectomy and 222 ± 45 (range 146-353) for sacral colpopexy alone. When compared with the first ten cases performed by each surgeon, operative times in subsequent groups decreased significantly, with a 6-16.3% reduction in overall times. There was no significant difference in the rate of overall complications regardless of the number of prior procedures performed (p = 0.262). CONCLUSIONS Introduction of laparoscopic sacral colpopexy in a training program is safe and efficient. Reduction in operative time is similar to published learning curves in teaching and nonteaching settings. Introducing this technique does not add additional surgical risk as these skills are acquired.","Kantartzis, Kelly; Sutkin, Gary; Winger, Dan; Wang, Li; Shepherd, Jonathan",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-013-2085-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549650/,20

94154,Consensus statement on human immunodeficiency virus pre-exposure prophylaxis in China.,2020-10-21,"In December 2019, an outbreak of viral pneumonia began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, which caused the spread of infectious pneumonia to a certain extent in China and neighboring countries and regions, and triggered the epidemic crisis. The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease listed as a B infectious disease, which is managed according to standards for A infectious disease. Traditional Chinese medicine and integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine have played an active role in the prevention and control of this epidemic. China's ethnomedicine has recognized infectious diseases since ancient times, and formed a medical system including theory, therapies, formula and herbal medicines for such diseases. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou have issued the prevention and control programs for COVID-19 using Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, Yi and Miao medicines. These programs reflect the wisdom of ethnomedicine in preventing and treating diseases, which have successfully extracted prescriptions and preventive measures for the outbreak of the epidemic from their own medical theories and traditional experiences. In this paper, we summarized and explained the prescriptions and medicinal materials of ethnomedicine in these programs, and the origin of Tibetan medicine prescriptions and Mongolian medicine prescriptions in ancient books were studied.

However, whether winter supplementation of vitamin D reduces the risk among children is unknown. Objective To determine whether high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of wintertime upper respiratory tract infections in young children. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized clinical trial was conducted during the winter months between September 13, 2011, and June 30, 2015, among children aged 1 through 5 years enrolled in TARGet Kids!, a multisite primary care practice-based research network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Interventions Three hundred forty-nine participants were randomized to receive 2000 IU/d of vitamin D oral supplementation (high-dose group) vs 354 participants who were randomized to receive 400 IU/d (standard-dose group) for a minimum of 4 months between September and May. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was the number of laboratory-confirmed viral upper respiratory tract infections based on parent-collected nasal swabs over the winter months. Secondary outcomes included the number of influenza infections, noninfluenza infections, parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses, time to first upper respiratory tract infection, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at study termination. Results Among 703 participants who were randomized (mean age, 2.7 years, 57.7% boys), 699 (99.4%) completed the trial. The mean number of laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory tract infections per child was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.91-1.19) for the high-dose group and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.16) for the standard-dose group, for a between-group difference of 0.02 (95% CI, -0.17 to 0.21) per child. There was no statistically significant difference in number of laboratory-confirmed infections between groups (incidence rate ratio [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.16). There was also no significant difference in the median time to the first laboratory-confirmed infection: 3.95 months (95% CI, 3.02-5.95 months) for the high-dose group vs 3.29 months (95% CI, 2.66-4.14 months) for the standard-dose group, or number of parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses between groups (625 for high-dose vs 600 for standard-dose groups, incidence RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88-1.16). At study termination, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 48.7 ng/mL (95% CI, 46.9-50.5 ng/mL) in the high-dose group and 36.8 ng/mL (95% CI, 35.4-38.2 ng/mL) in the standard-dose group. Conclusions and Relevance Among healthy children aged 1 to 5 years, daily administration of 2000 IU compared with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation did not reduce overall wintertime upper respiratory tract infections. These findings do not support the routine use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in children for the prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections.

Despite this, NIV is underutilized. The evidence strongly supports its use in patients presenting with an exacerbation of COPD and in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. As reviewed in this paper, there is now evidence supporting or not supporting the use of NIV in various other presentations of acute respiratory failure. It is important not only to know when to initiate NIV, but also when this therapy is failing. Whether NIV in the setting of acute respiratory failure can be managed appropriately outside the ICU setting is controversial. Although a variety of interfaces are available, the oronasal mask is the best initial interface in terms of leak prevention and patient comfort. Some critical care ventilators have NIV modes that compensate well for leaks, but as a group the ventilators that are designed specifically for NIV have better leak compensation. NIV should be part of the armamentarium of all clinicians caring from patients with acute respiratory failure.","Hess, Dean R",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23709194/,20

95607,Reply: To PMID 24797994.,2015,"BACKGROUND The cellular transmembrane protein CD317/BST-2/HM1.24/Tetherin restricts HIV-1 infection by physically tethering mature virions to the surface of infected cells. HIV-1 counteracts this restriction by expressing the accessory protein Vpu, yet the mechanism of this antagonism is incompletely understood. β-TrCP is the substrate recognition domain of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that interacts with the di-serine motif S52/S56 in the cytoplasmic tail of Vpu to target the CD4 receptor for proteasomal degradation. Recently, it has been suggested that β-TrCP is also critically involved in Vpu's ability to overcome the CD317-mediated virion release block. RESULTS To test this model, we analyzed the consequences of several experimental strategies to interfere with the Vpu-β-TrCP protein-protein interaction. Under these conditions, we studied effects of Vpu on expression and localization of CD317 and CD4, as well as on its ability to promote HIV-1 release. Our results demonstrate a strict requirement for Vpu's di-serine motif for degradation of CD4 and also CD317, reduction of cell surface exposure of CD317, and HIV-1 release enhancement. We further show a critical role of β-TrCP2, but not of the structurally related β-TrCP1 isoform, for Vpu-mediated degradation of both receptors. Most importantly, Vpu remained active in downregulating CD317 from the cell surface and in overcoming the HIV-1 release restriction in β-TrCP-depleted cells. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that β-TrCP is not strictly required for Vpu's ability to counteract the CD317-imposed virion release block and support the relevance of cell surface down-modulation of the restriction factor as a central mechanism of Vpu antagonism. Moreover, we propose the existence of a critical, yet to be identified cellular factor that interacts with Vpu via its di-serine motif to alter the trafficking of the restriction factor.","Tervo, Hanna-Mari; Homann, Stefanie; Ambiel, Ina; Fritz, Joëlle V; Fackler, Oliver T; Keppler, Oliver T",Retrovirology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-8-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310048/,20

Using a composite health measure, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the outbreaks were quantified and compared. DALYs were calculated using standardized methodology incorporating age- and sex-stratified data in a disease progression model; years lost due to disability and years of life lost were computed by outcome. Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 caused more DALYs (24 484) than Q fever (5797). However, Q fever was 8·28 times more severe [497 DALYs/1000 symptomatic cases (DP1SC)] than A(H1N1)pdm09 (60 DP1SC). The A(H1N1)pdm09 burden is largely due to mortality while the Q fever burden is due primarily to long-term sequelae. Intervention prioritization for influenza should support patients in a critical condition while for Q fever it should target immediate containment and support for patients with long-term sequelae. Burden estimates provide guidance for focusing intervention options during outbreaks of infectious diseases.","Brooke, R J; Van Lier, A; Donker, G A; Van Der Hoek, W; Kretzschmar, M E E",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268813003531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476696/,20

Although mobile devices have become the primary means of accessing information on the web, many existing visualizations are not optimized for small screens and can lead to a frustrating user experience. Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.","Wu, Aoyu; Tong, Wai; Dwyer, Tim; Lee, Bongshin; Isenberg, Petra; Qu, Huamin",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074819/,20

The ability to model the effects of RF energy on the collagen, elastin, and liquid content of the target tissue would allow for the refinement of the control of the energy in order to improve outcomes and reduce negative side-effects. In this paper, we study the time-varying impedance spectra of the circuit. It is expected that the collagen/elastin ratio does not change over time such that the time-varying impedance is a function of the liquid content. We apply a non-parametric model in which we characterize the measured impedance spectra by its frequency response function. The measurements indicate that the changing impedance as a function of time exhibit a polynomial shift which we characterize by a polynomial regression. Finally, we quantify the uncertainty to obtain prediction intervals for the estimated polynomial describing the time variation of the impedance spectra.","Barbé, Kurt; Ford, Carolyn; Bonn, Kenlyn; Gilbert, James",Conference proceedings : ...

We identify and replicate novel genome-wide significant associations, on chr12q24.13 (rs10735079, p=1.65 [Formula: see text] 10-8) in a gene cluster encoding antiviral restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3), on chr19p13.2 (rs2109069, p=2.3 [Formula: see text] 10-12) near the gene encoding tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), on chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, p=3.98 [Formula: see text] 10-12) within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), and on chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, p=4.99 [Formula: see text] 10-8) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. We identify potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications: using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease; transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19.

This study aimed to determine whether long-term changes in stiffness can be trained, and if so, what is the most effective method. Twenty-four healthy male subjects (23 ± 3 years; 1.8 ± 0.06 m; 77.5 ± 10.8 kg) were recruited for passive and active stiffness measurements before and after a 6-week core training intervention. Twelve subjects (22 ± 2 years; 1.8 ± 0.08 m; 78.3 ± 12.3 kg) were considered naive to physical and core exercise. The other 12 subjects (24 ± 3 years; 1.8 ± 0.05 m; 76.8 ± 9.7 kg) were Muay Thai athletes (savvy). A repeated-measures design compared core training methods (isometric vs. dynamic, with a control group) and subject training experience (naive vs. savvy) before and after a 6-week training period. Passive stiffness was assessed on a ""frictionless"" bending apparatus and active stiffness assessed through a quick release mechanism. Passive stiffness increased after the isometric training protocol. Dynamic training produced a smaller effect, and as expected, there was no change in the control group. Active stiffness did not change in any group. Comparisons between subject and training groups did not reveal any interactions. Thus, an isometric training approach was superior in terms of enhancing core stiffness. This is important since increased core stiffness enhances load bearing ability, arrests painful vertebral micromovements, and enhances ballistic distal limb movement. This may explain the efficacy reported for back and knee injury reduction.","Lee, Benjamin C Y; McGill, Stuart M",Journal of strength and conditioning research,https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000000740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26010794/,20

Bone marrow- (BM) and adipose tissue- (AT) derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are of great interest for tissue reconstruction due to their unique immunological properties and regenerative potential. The purpose of this study was to characterize BM and AT-MSCs and evaluate their effect when administered in a porcine wound model. MSCs were derived from male Göttingen Minipigs and characterized according to established criteria. Allogeneic BM- or AT-MSCs were administered intradermally (1 x 10(6) cells) into partial-thickness wounds created on female animals, and covered with Vaseline® gauze or fibrin in a randomized pattern. Animals were euthanized at 7, 10, 14 and 21 days. Tissues were analyzed visually for healing and by microscopic examination for epidermal development and remodelling. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of male DNA in the specimens. All wounds were healed by 14 days. MSC-injected wounds were associated with improved appearance and faster re-epithelialization compared to saline controls. Evaluation of rete ridge depth and architecture showed that MSC treatment promoted a faster rate of epidermal maturation. Male DNA was detected in all samples at days 7 and 10, suggesting the presence of MSCs. We showed the safety, feasibility and potential efficacy of local injection of allogeneic BM- and AT-MSCs for treatment of wounds in a preclinical model. Our data in this large animal model support the potential use of BM- and AT-MSC for treatment of cutaneous wounds through modulation of healing and epithelialization.","Hanson, Summer E; Kleinbeck, Kyle R; Cantu, David; Kim, Jaeyhup; Bentz, Michael L; Faucher, Lee D; Kao, W John; Hematti, Peiman",Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/term.1700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23418160/,20

METHODS We did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19. Patients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery. RESULTS We included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set. The recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%, p = 0.022). The median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, p < 0.001). Time to recovery of fever (2 vs. 3 days), fatigue (3 vs. 6 days) and coughing (7 vs. 10 days) was also significantly shorter in treatment group (all p < 0.001). The rate of improvement in chest computed tomographic manifestations (83.8% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.001) and clinical cure (78.9% vs. 66.2%, p = 0.017) was also higher in treatment group. However, both groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings (both p > 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported.

Therefore, the development of novel therapies is necessary for targeting at preventing tendon adhesion formation and improving tendon strength. Methods: We used rat fibroblasts for in vitro experiments to determine the optimal concentration of TSA in rats, and then set up negative control group, TSA intervention group, mir-29b interference adenovirus intervention group and TSA and mir-29b interference adenovirus co-intervention group. By comparing cell proliferation and protein expression in different group, we verified the effect and mechanism of drugs on fibroblast function. At the same time, the Sprague-Dawley rat Achilles tendon model in vivo was established in this study, which was divided into sham operation group and operation group. Afterwards in the operation group, mir-29b inhibitor and placebo were injected every 3 days respectively. Then the injection inhibitor group was divided into 5 groups which mean TSA was injected into the marked area at 0, 6, 24 and 72 hours after operation for 1 week, finally all of the rats were died at 3 weeks after operation. Through the observation of general properties, histological observation of Achilles tendon injury, biomechanical test and cell and protein expression in rats' tendon cell, the effect of drugs on tendon adhesion formation was analyzed. Results: We demonstrated that the combination of miR-29b inhibitor and tanshinone IIA(TSA) could prevent tendon adhesion and also enhance tendon strength. Mechanically, the miR-29b inhibitor could activate the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway to trigger endogenous pathways and induce a high proliferation of fibroblast. Subsequently, we also found adding TSA after 6 hours of miR-29b treatment gave less cell cytotoxicity in our rat model with better outcome of less tendon adhesion and enhanced strength. Conclusion: We conclude that the use of miR-29b inhibitor at the end of the tendon break could initiate endogenous repair mechanism and subsequently use of TSA should be able to inhibit the exogenous repair mechanism. Therefore, the combination of both treatments could prevent tendon adhesion and ensure tendon strength. Our findings suggested that this approach would be a feasible approach for tendon repair.","Zhou, Haiying; Jiang, Shuai; Li, Pengfei; Shen, Hui; Yang, Hu; Xu, Shengquan; Ye, Chenyi; Chen, Mingjian; Lu, Hui",International journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.44138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410838/,20

In particular, the BPS-P model improves on Engel's by articulating and evidencing the multiple pathways between biological, psychological, and social influences on health and identifying mechanisms that might be implicated in these pathways. Yet its analytic treatment of these influences as ""separate systems"" means that, as with Engel's model, the BPS-P model is more a list of ingredients than an integrated whole. In this commentary, following Haslam et al.'s (2019) specification of a sociopsychobio model, we underscore the value of a synthetic appreciation of biology, psychology, and society as dynamically interdependent aspects of an integrated whole which is more than just the sum of its parts and the pathways between them. In particular, our alternative framework centres on an appreciation of people as social beings whose group memberships and associated social identities open up 'changeways' (not just pathways) that, as we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, can fundamentally restructure biology, psychology and society.","Haslam, S Alexander; Haslam, Catherine; Jetten, Jolanda; Cruwys, Tegan; Bentley, Sarah V",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33303292/,20

In order to elucidate its potential advantages, we compared the two laparoscopic approaches. Methods. 87 patients were included in a multicentric study for suspected appendicitis in order to perform (SPAA) appendectomy or laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). All outcomes, including blood loss, operative time, complications, and length of stay and pain were recorded prospectively. Results. There were 46 patients in the SPAA group and 41 in the LAG with a mean operative time of 40,4 minutes in the SPAA group and 35,0 minutes in the LA group. Only one patient was converted to an open approach. We described only 2 complications. Pain was graded 2,8 in the SPAA group and 2,9 in the LA group, according to the AVS after 24 hours. Patients in the SPAA Group were more satisfied (7,5 versus 6,9) (P < 0.05). Same results were found for the cosmetic result (8,6 versus 7,4) (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Using the single port approach feasible and safe. The true benefit of the technique should be assessed by new randomised controlled trials.","Vilallonga, Ramon; Barbaros, Umut; Nada, Ahmed; Sümer, Aziz; Demirel, Tuğrul; Fort, José Manuel; González, Oscar; Armengol, Manuel",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/492409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22655190/,20
100434,Combination of four clinical indicators predicts the severe/critical symptom of patients infected COVID-19.,2020-05-13,"CONTEXT In the United States, state laws require health care providers to report specific diseases and events to public health authorities, a fundamental facet of disease surveillance. However, reporting by providers is often inconsistent, infrequent, and delayed. OBJECTIVE To examine knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding provider disease reporting and to understand current barriers to provider disease reporting. DESIGN A cross-sectional study was conducted via an anonymous, standardized electronic survey. SETTING The survey was conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a large, tertiary academic medical center in Nashville, Tennessee. PARTICIPANTS Health care providers in 4 specialties (internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, and emergency medicine). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Knowledge of and attitudes regarding provider reporting of diseases to public health authorities in Tennessee. RESULTS The majority of providers acknowledged they cared for patients with reportable diseases (362/435, 83.2%) and believed that it was their responsibility to report to public health authorities (429/436, 98.4%); however, less than half had ever reported a case (206/436, 47.2%). The median percent correct on the knowledge assessment of Tennessee reportable diseases and conditions was 81.3% (interquartile range = 68.8-87.5). Providers cited a lack of knowledge of which diseases are reportable (186/429, 43.3%) and the logistics of reporting (153/429, 35.7%) as the primary barriers for compliance. CONCLUSION Most providers acknowledged they cared for patients with reportable diseases and believed they had an obligation to report to public health authorities. However, a lack of knowledge about reporting was frequently described as a limitation to report effectively. Many knowledge deficits were significantly greater among residents than other providers.The policy and practice implications of these findings include a demonstrated need for education of providers about disease reporting as well as development of more convenient reporting mechanisms. Fundamental knowledge of reportable disease requirements and procedures is critical for participation in the broader public health system.","Fill, Mary-Margaret A; Murphree, Rendi; Pettit, April C",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000000492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27997480/,20

Drawing on anthropological framings of the ""gift,"" this paper contextualizes participation in precision medicine as inextricable from social relationships and their ongoing ethical obligations. Going beyond altruism, reframing biospecimen and data collection in terms of socially regulated gift-giving recovers questions of responsibility and care. As opposed to conceiving participation in terms of donations that elide clinical labor critical to precision medicine, the gift metaphor underscores ethical commitments to reciprocity and responsibility. This demands confronting inequities in precision medicine, such as systemic bias and lack of affordability and access. A focus on justice in precision medicine that recognizes the sociality of the gift is a critical frontier for bioethics.","Lee, Sandra Soo-Jin",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1851813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325811/,20
101013,Quantification of cerebral artery motion during the cardiac cycle.,2011,"OBJECT Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has become one of the preferred procedures for circumferential fusion in the lumbar spine. Over the last decade, advances in surgical techniques have enabled surgeons to perform the TLIF procedure through a minimally invasive approach (MI-TLIF). There are a few studies reported in the medical literature in which perioperative complication rates of MI-TLIF were evaluated; here, the authors present the largest cohort series to date. They analyzed intraoperative and perioperative complications in 513 consecutive MI-TLIF-treated patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 513 consecutive patients treated over a 10-year period for lumbar degenerative disc disease using MI-TLIF. All patients undergoing either a first-time or revision 1- or 2-level MI-TLIF procedure were included in the study. Demographic, intraoperative, and perioperative data were collected and analyzed using bivariate analyses (Student t-test, analysis of variance, odds ratio, chi-square test) and multivariate analyses (logistic regression). RESULTS A total of 513 patients underwent an MI-TLIF procedure, and the perioperative complication rate was 15.6%. The incidence of durotomy was 5.1%, and the medical and surgical infection rates were 1.4% and 0.2%, respectively. A statistically significant increase in the infection rate was seen in revision MI-TLIF cases, and the same was found for the perioperative complication rate in multilevel MI-TLIF cases. Instrumentation failure occurred in 2.3% of the cases. After analysis, no statistically significant difference was seen in the rates of durotomy during revision and multilevel surgeries. There was no significant difference between the complication rates when stratified according to presenting diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest study of perioperative complications in MI-TLIF in the literature. A total of 513 patients underwent MI-TLIF (perioperative complication rate 15.6%). The most common complication was a durotomy (5.1%), and there was only 1 surgical wound infection (0.2%). There were significantly more perioperative infections in revision MI-TLIF cases and more perioperative complications in multilevel MI-TLIF cases. The results of this study suggest that MI-TLIF has a similar or better perioperative complication profile than those documented in the literature for open-TLIF treatment of degenerative lumbar spine disease.","Wong, Albert P; Smith, Zachary A; Nixon, Alexander T; Lawton, Cort D; Dahdaleh, Nader S; Wong, Ricky H; Auffinger, Brenda; Lam, Sandi; Song, John K; Liu, John C; Koski, Tyler R; Fessler, Richard G",Journal of neurosurgery.

101308,Association of influenza outbreaks with advanced pediatric medical support.,2018,"We observed that the nonfusogenic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain MHV-2 reached a titer of approximately 2 log10 higher than that of the fusogenic strain A59 in astrocytoma DBT cells. To determine whether the spike protein is responsible for the difference, a recombinant virus, Penn-98-1, that contains the A59 genome with a spike from MHV-2 was used to infect DBT cells. Results showed that Penn-98-1 behaved like MHV-2, thus establishing a role for the spike protein in viral growth. The inverse correlation between viral fusogenicity and growth was further established in four different cell types and with a fusogenic mutant, the S757R mutant, derived from isogenic Penn-98-1. While both A59 and Penn-98-1 entered cells at similar levels, viral RNA and protein syntheses were significantly delayed for A59. Interestingly, when the genomic RNAs were delivered directly into the cells via transfection, the levels of gene expression for these viruses were similar. Furthermore, cell fractionation experiments revealed that significantly more genomic RNAs for the nonfusogenic MHVs were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within the first 2 h after infection than for the fusogenic MHVs. Pretreatment of Penn-98-1 with trypsin reversed its properties in syncytium formation, virus production, and genome transport to the ER. These findings identified a novel role for the spike protein in regulating the uncoating and delivery of the viral genome to the ER after internalization.","Zhu, Hongqing; Yu, Dongdong; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00956-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19570858/,20
101808,Role of ssDNA as a Noninvasive Indicator for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Exploratory Study.,2021,"Purpose This study determines if δ-opioid receptor agonist (i.e. SNC-121)-induced epigenetic changes via regulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neuroprotection in glaucoma model. Methods Intraocular pressure was raised in rat eyes by injecting 2M hypertonic saline into the limbal veins. SNC-121 (1 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered to the animals for 7 days. Retinas were collected at days 7 and 42, post-injury followed by measurement of HDAC activities, mRNA, and protein expression by enzyme assay, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results The visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) were declined in ocular hypertensive animals, which were significantly improved by SNC-121 treatment. Class I and IIb HDACs activities were significantly increased at days 7 and 42 in ocular hypertensive animals. The mRNA and protein expression of HDAC 1 was increased by 1.33 ± 0.07-fold and 20.2 ± 2.7%, HDAC 2 by 1.4 ± 0.05-fold and 17.0 ± 2.4%, HDAC 3 by 1.4 ± 0.06-fold and 17.4 ± 3.4%, and HDAC 6 by 1.5 ± 0.09-fold and 15.1 ± 3.3% at day 7, post-injury. Both the mRNA and protein expression of HDACs were potentiated further at day 42 in ocular hypertensive animals. HDAC activities, mRNA, and protein expression were blocked by SNC-121 treatment at days 7 and 42 in ocular hypertensive animals. Conclusions Data suggests that class I and IIb HDACs are activated and upregulated during early stages of glaucoma. Early intervention with δ-opioid receptor activation resulted in the prolonged suppression of class I and IIb HDACs activities and expression, which may, in part, play a crucial role in RGC neuroprotection.","Zaidi, Syed A H; Guzman, Wendy; Singh, Sudha; Mehrotra, Shikhar; Husain, Shahid",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.61.14.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263714/,20

The gradual progression from premalignant Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) provides an ideal model to study the ordering of somatic mutations. We identified recurrently mutated genes and assessed clonal structure using whole-genome sequencing and amplicon resequencing of 112 EACs. We next screened a cohort of 109 biopsies from 2 key transition points in the development of malignancy: benign metaplastic never-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE; n=66) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD; n=43). Unexpectedly, the majority of recurrently mutated genes in EAC were also mutated in NDBE. Only TP53 and SMAD4 mutations occurred in a stage-specific manner, confined to HGD and EAC, respectively. Finally, we applied this knowledge to identify high-risk Barrett's esophagus in a new non-endoscopic test. In conclusion, mutations in EAC driver genes generally occur exceptionally early in disease development with profound implications for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","Weaver, Jamie M J; Ross-Innes, Caryn S; Shannon, Nicholas; Lynch, Andy G; Forshew, Tim; Barbera, Mariagnese; Murtaza, Muhammed; Ong, Chin-Ann J; Lao-Sirieix, Pierre; Dunning, Mark J; Smith, Laura; Smith, Mike L; Anderson, Charlotte L; Carvalho, Benilton; O'Donovan, Maria; Underwood, Timothy J; May, Andrew P; Grehan, Nicola; Hardwick, Richard; Davies, Jim; Oloumi, Arusha; Aparicio, Sam; Caldas, Carlos; Eldridge, Matthew D; Edwards, Paul A W; Rosenfeld, Nitzan; Tavaré, Simon; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Nature genetics,https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24952744/,20
102902,Viral pneumonia.,2009,"Introduction Several studies regarding tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) in colorectal, esophageal, breast, endometrial, and cervical carcinomas have been done in the past with significant results. Objectives The objectives of this study were to (1) study and grade TSR in buccal mucosa and tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), (2) grade inflammatory cell infiltrate surrounding the tumor, and (3) correlate the above two parameters with tumor grade, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI). Materials and Methods Totally, 25 patients of buccal SCC and 16 cases of tongue SCC were included in the study. TSR was assessed visually on the hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections by two independent observers. Cases were categorized into two groups: One with high TSR >50% (stroma poor) and the other with low TSR <50% as the stroma-rich group. TSR was correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, inflammatory cell infiltrate, LVI, and PNI. Data were analyzed by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. The Chi-square and Fischer's exact tests were applied in the analysis of categorical variable. Results and Conclusion SCC of buccal mucosa showed a significant correlation between TSR and size of the tumor (P = 0.001). We found that smaller the tumor size ≤2 cm (Stage T1), lesser the TSR, and size >2 cm was found to be associated with higher TSR. Hence, higher TSR (stroma poor) was associated with an adverse pathological characteristic, i.e., advanced T significantly. There was no significant correlation between TSR and inflammatory infiltrate with grade of the tumor, lymph node metastasis, LVI, and PNI. In 16 cases of SCC of the tongue; no correlation was observed between TSR and inflammatory infiltrate with tumor size, grade of the tumor, lymph node metastasis, LVI, and PNI. TSR has been studied in various malignancies (mostly adenocarcinomas) including laryngeal SCCs; however, it has never been studied on oral SCCs.","Rani, Poonam; Gupta, Amita Jain; Mehrol, Chetna; Singh, Meeta; Khurana, Nita; Passey, J C",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/0973-1482.193113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719249/,20
103463,IFN-γ release assay versus tuberculin skin test for monitoring TB infection in healthcare workers.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data on the global outbreak of ""2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV"" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.","Meo, S A; Alhowikan, A M; Al-Khlaiwi, T; Meo, I M; Halepoto, D M; Iqbal, M; Usmani, A M; Hajjar, W; Ahmed, N",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202002_20379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32141570/,20

Anaesthesiologists' presence in interventional radiology is increasing in turn, due to increasingly ill patients and intricate procedures requiring more than local anaesthesia for well tolerated completion. The literature available describing this is largely written by radiologists, with little attention paid to anaesthetic considerations.

103619,Histopathologic evaluation of arterial wall response to 5 neurovascular mechanical thrombectomy devices in a swine model.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE New aspects for automatic electrocardiography artifact removal from surface electromyography signals by application of fractional order calculus in combination with linear and nonlinear moving window filters are explored. Surface electromyography recordings of skeletal trunk muscles are commonly contaminated with spike shaped artifacts. This artifact originates from electrical heart activity, recorded by electrocardiography, commonly present in the surface electromyography signals recorded in heart proximity. For appropriate assessment of neuromuscular changes by means of surface electromyography, application of a proper filtering technique of electrocardiography artifact is crucial. METHODS A novel method for automatic artifact cancellation in surface electromyography signals by applying fractional order calculus and nonlinear median filter is introduced. The proposed method is compared with the linear moving average filter, with and without prior application of fractional order calculus. 3D graphs for assessment of window lengths of the filters, crest factors, root mean square differences, and fractional calculus orders (called WFC and WRC graphs) have been introduced. For an appropriate quantitative filtering evaluation, the synthetic electrocardiography signal and analogous semi-synthetic dataset have been generated. The examples of noise removal in 10 able-bodied subjects and in one patient with muscle dystrophy are presented for qualitative analysis. RESULTS The crest factors, correlation coefficients, and root mean square differences of the recorded and semi-synthetic electromyography datasets showed that the most successful method was the median filter in combination with fractional order calculus of the order 0.9. Statistically more significant (p < 0.001) ECG peak reduction was obtained by the median filter application compared to the moving average filter in the cases of low level amplitude of muscle contraction compared to ECG spikes. CONCLUSIONS The presented results suggest that the novel method combining a median filter and fractional order calculus can be used for automatic filtering of electrocardiography artifacts in the surface electromyography signal envelopes recorded in trunk muscles.","Miljković, Nadica; Popović, Nenad; Djordjević, Olivera; Konstantinović, Ljubica; Šekara, Tomislav B",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.12.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254082/,20

We present an investigation of individual differences in facial expression of emotion using observational techniques. Given descriptions of highly psychopathic persons as successful liars and manipulators, we investigate the ability to intentionally pose emotional expressions when no emotion is elicited. A mixed sample of adult men (N = 316 community volunteers, prison inmates, and forensic-psychiatric patients) ranging along the psychopathy continuum were asked to facially express a nonfelt emotion, specifically anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise, through either written instructions or through imitation of a target's facial expression. Through structural equation modeling, we evaluate relations between this emotion expression ability and general mental ability, interpersonal abilities, and psychopathy. We find that psychopathy is moderately associated with poorer emotion expression ability, meaning highly psychopathic individuals are poorer at imitating the expressions of others and poorer at expressing all emotions. However, this deficit is largely attributable to deficits in general mental ability. These results challenge the view that highly psychopathic individuals have the cognitive skills to support a superior ability to deceive or manipulate others.

While much is known regarding the acute early phase of sepsis, there is a knowledge gap pertaining to restoration of muscle mass and function after elimination of the septic nidus. We used a sepsis-recovery model - where cecal-ligation-puncture (CLP) was performed in adult male mice followed 24 h later by removal of the cecum and antibiotic treatment - to assess changes in the abundance of muscle contractile proteins and function during the acute phase of sepsis (24 h post-CLP) and during the recovery phase (day 10 post-CLP). Although body weight and food consumption decreased acutely with sepsis, both had normalized by day 10; however, EDL mass remained decreased 10%. During acute sepsis, there were few contractile defects or significant changes in contractile proteins. In contrast, during sepsis-recovery, specific maximum isometric twitch and specific maximum tetanic force were decreased ≈50%, compared to time-matched pair-fed controls, and defects were independent of the concomitant reduction in muscle mass. Force generation in sepsis-recovery mice was decreased 30% with increasing stimulus frequency. Contractile defects during sepsis-recovery were associated with 50-90% reductions in thin filament (troponin T, troponin I, tropomyosin, α-sarcomeric actin), thick filament (myosin heavy and myosin light chains), Z-disc (α-actinin 3) and M-band (myomesin-2) proteins, but no change in the intermediate filaments desmin and vimentin. During sepsis-recovery, myofibrillar protein synthesis did not differ from control, but synthesis of sarcoplasmic proteins was increased 60%. These data suggest intrinsic defects in muscle contractile function exist during the recovery phase of sepsis and may negatively impact convalescence.","Crowell, Kristen T; Lang, Charles H",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433214/,20

104782,Virtual-versus-Real Implantation of Flow Diverters: Clinical Potential and Influence of Vascular Geometry.,2016,"The role of signaling pathway through macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mCSF) and its receptor CSF1R during experimental herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) was studied by two different approaches. Firstly, we evaluated the effect of a stimulation of mCSF/CSF1R axis before infection. Exogenous mCSF (40 μg/kg, i.p.) was administered once daily to BALB/c mice on days 4 and 2 before intranasal infection with 2,500 plaque forming units (PFUs) of HSV-1. mCSF treatment significantly increased mouse survival compared to saline (50% versus 10%; P=0.0169). On day 6 post-infection (p.i.), brain viral titers were significantly decreased whereas IFN-β was significantly increased in mice treated with mCSF compared to saline. The number of CD68+ (a phagocytosis marker) microglial cells was significantly increased in mCSF-treated mice compared to the saline group. Secondly, we conditionally depleted CSF1R on microglial cells of CSF1R-loxP-CX3CR1-cre/ERT2 mice (in a C57BL/6 background) through induction with tamoxifen. Mice were then infected intranasally with 600,000 PFUs of HSV-1. The survival rates of mice depleted in CSF1R (KO) was significantly lower than that of wild type (WT) (0% versus 67%). Brain viral titers and cytokines/chemokines were significantly higher in KO than in WT animals on day 6 p.i. Furthermore, an increased infiltration of monocytes into the brains of WT was seen on day 6 p.i. but not in KO mice. Our results suggest that microglial cells are essential to control HSE at early stages of the disease and that the mCSF/CSF1R axis could be a therapeutic target to regulate their response to infection.ImportanceMicroglia appear to be one of the principal regulators of neuro-inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). An increasing number of studies demonstrated that the activation of microglia could either result in beneficial or detrimental effects in different CNS disorders. Hence, the role of microglia during herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) has not been fully characterized. Using experimental mouse models, we showed that an early activation of the mCSF/CSF1R axis improved the outcome of the disease possibly by inducing a proliferation of microglia. In contrast, depletion of microglia before HSV-1 infection worsened the prognosis of HSE. Thus, an early microglial response followed by a sustained infiltration of monocytes and T cells into the brain seem to be key components for a better clinical outcome. These data suggest that microglia could be a potential target for immunomodulatory strategies combined with antiviral therapy to better control the outcome of this devastating disease.","Uyar, Olus; Laflamme, Nataly; Piret, Jocelyne; Venable, Marie-Christine; Carbonneau, Julie; Zarrouk, Karima; Rivest, Serge; Boivin, Guy",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01428-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938766/,20
105019,1 September News.,2016,"BACKGROUND Cerebrovascular autoregulation after resuscitation has not been well studied in an experimental model of pediatric cardiac arrest. Furthermore, developing noninvasive methods of monitoring autoregulation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) would be clinically useful in guiding neuroprotective hemodynamic management after pediatric cardiac arrest. We tested the hypotheses that the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) would shift to a higher arterial blood pressure between 1 and 2 days of recovery after cardiac arrest and that the LLA would be detected by NIRS-derived indices of autoregulation in a swine model of pediatric cardiac arrest. We also tested the hypothesis that autoregulation with hypertension would be impaired after cardiac arrest. METHODS Data on LLA were obtained from neonatal piglets that had undergone hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest and recovery for 1 day (n = 8) or 2 days (n = 8), or that had undergone sham surgery with 2 days of recovery (n = 8). Autoregulation with hypertension was examined in a separate cohort of piglets that underwent hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest (n = 5) or sham surgery (n = 5) with 2 days of recovery. After the recovery period, piglets were reanesthetized, and autoregulation was monitored by standard laser-Doppler flowmetry and autoregulation indices derived from NIRS (the cerebral oximetry [COx] and hemoglobin volume [HVx] indices). The LLA was determined by decreasing blood pressure through inflation of a balloon catheter in the inferior vena cava. Autoregulation during hypertension was evaluated by inflation of an aortic balloon catheter. RESULTS The LLAs were similar between sham-operated piglets and piglets that recovered for 1 or 2 days after arrest. The NIRS-derived indices accurately detected the LLA determined by laser-Doppler flowmetry. The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve for cerebral oximetry index was 0.91 at 1 day and 0.92 at 2 days after arrest. The area under the curve for hemoglobin volume index was 0.92 and 0.89 at the respective time points. During induced hypertension, the static rate of autoregulation, defined as the percentage change in cerebrovascular resistance divided by the percentage change in cerebral perfusion pressure, was not different between postarrest and sham-operated piglets. At 2 days recovery from arrest, piglets exhibited neurobehavioral deficits and histologic neuronal injury. CONCLUSIONS In a swine model of pediatric hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest with confirmed brain damage, the LLA did not differ 1 and 2 days after resuscitation. The NIRS-derived indices accurately detected the LLA in comparison with laser-Doppler flow measurements at those time points. Autoregulation remained functional during hypertension.","Lee, Jennifer K; Yang, Zeng-Jin; Wang, Bing; Larson, Abby C; Jamrogowicz, Jessica L; Kulikowicz, Ewa; Kibler, Kathleen K; Mytar, Jennifer O; Carter, Erin L; Burman, Hillary T; Brady, Ken M; Smielewski, Peter; Czosnyka, Marek; Koehler, Raymond C; Shaffner, Donald H",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31824762d5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22314692/,20

106021,Incidence of viral respiratory pathogens causing exacerbations in adult cystic fibrosis patients.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Few published data are available concerning the risk of re-bleeding of spinal cord AVM after an hematomyelia and concerning the long-term clinical outcome. Our aim was to assess the risk of recurrence and long-term clinical outcome after hematomyelia in children with spinal cord AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-center retrospective study reviewed the clinical and radiologic data of 28 children younger than 18 years of age with arteriovenous malformation who had experienced at least 1 episode of hematomyelia between 1988 and 2012. Long-term clinical outcome was assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, and radiologic review included MR imaging and angioarchitecture on angiography (blinded to clinical information) before treatment and at recurrence. RESULTS Sixteen children (57%) experienced 1 episode of hematomyelia, while 12 children (43%) experienced recurrence. Girls and boys were equally affected (sex ratio, 1:1), and mean clinical follow-up was 5.7 ± 4.4 years. The risk of recurrence was higher for AVMs of the cervical and upper thoracic spine, 12 (100%) versus 11 (69%) (P = .01). A high American Spinal Injury Association scale score at last follow-up was reported for 11 children (39%), and the risk of recurrence tended to be associated with poorer functional prognosis (7 [64%] versus 5 [29%], P = .07). At the time of recurrence, perimedullary venous drainage was the main factor associated with recurrence (P = .002). Occlusion rate ≥50% was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (P = .047). CONCLUSIONS In the present series, cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord AVMs and microarchitecture were predictive of the risk of hematomyelia recurrence. Perimedullary venous drainage was one of the main parameters associated with recurrence. Functional prognosis was better in patients with a single episode of hematomyelia.","Saliou, G; Tej, A; Theaudin, M; Tardieu, M; Ozanne, A; Sachet, M; Ducreux, D; Deiva, K",AJNR.

This has enhanced bipartisan interest in moving forward with value-based payment reforms. Nurses have a rich history of innovative care models that speak to their potential centrality in delivery system reforms. However, deficits in terms of educational preparation, and in some cases resistance, to considering cost alongside quality, has hindered the profession's contribution to the conversation about value-based payments and their implications for system change. Addressing this deficit will allow nurses to more fully engage in redesigning health care to better serve the physical, emotional, and economic well-being of this nation. It also has the potential to unleash nurses from the tethers of a fee-for-service system where they have been relegated to a labor cost and firmly locate nurses in a value-generating role. Nurse administrators and educators bear the responsibility for preparing nurses for this next chapter of nursing.","Pittman, Patricia; Rambur, Betty; Birch, Susan; Chan, Garrett K; Cooke, Cindy; Cummins, Mollie; Leners, Colleen; Low, Lisa Kane; Meadows-Oliver, Mikki; Shattell, Mona; Taylor, Cheryl; Trautman, Deborah",Nursing administration quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1097/naq.0000000000000482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060500/,20

Moreover, in addition to the direct benefits to vaccinated individuals, the indirect effects of protection at the community level have also been demonstrated and termed 'herd immunity'. The predicted demographic shift in the population landscape towards an ever-increasing aging population and the evidence suggesting that older individuals produce less-than-optimal vaccine responses have raised the question of rethinking vaccine schedules. This article provides evidence that even if herd immunity might be an option to indirectly protect the aging and aged adult population, the highest priorities for the near future must be to understand how vaccine responses in older individuals can be improved, to break down the public, cultural, societal and political barriers to vaccination and to counter the antivaccination movement that inhibits the worldwide spread of lifelong immunization programs.","Lang, Pierre Olivier; Aspinall, Richard",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1586/erv.11.187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22309666/,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of all patients undergoing LESS PN at a single pediatric institution were retrospectively reviewed for patient demographics, perioperative details, and outcomes. A cystoscopy was initially performed to place an externalized catheter into the ureter of the ipsilateral normal renal moiety. An Olympus TriPort, an Olympus Endoeye flexible tip laparoscope, standard 3- or 5-mm instrumentation, and a LigaSure Blunt were utilized. RESULTS Four children (two boys, two girls) underwent LESS PN. Three patients underwent upper pole PN and one underwent lower pole PN. All procedures were performed for poorly functioning obstructed renal moieties (one ureterocele, one ureteropelvic junction obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux, and two ectopic ureters). Median age was 6.2 months (range 2.5-16.4 months). Median weight was 7.7 kg (range 6.1-12.6 kg). Median operative time was 126 min (range 97-180 min). No patient received inpatient postoperative narcotics. Median follow-up was 9.9 months (range 6.2-19.1 months). No postoperative complications were noted.

109697,"The Pope, condoms, and the evolution of HIV.",2009,"AIM Liver transplantation is the only curative strategy for final stage liver diseases. Despite the great advances achieved during the last 20 years, the recipient immune response after transplantation is not entirely controlled. This results in high rates of acute cell rejection and, approximately, 10% of early mortality. Therapeutic treatment could be improved by efficiently transfecting genes that encode natural immunosuppressant proteins, employing safe procedures that could be transferred to clinical setting. In this sense, interleukin 10 plays a central role in immune tolerance response by acting at different levels. METHODS hIL10 gene was hydrofected by retrograde hydrodynamic injection in pig liver with complete vascular exclusion mediated by an 'in vivo' surgical procedure. Levels of IL10 DNA, RNA and protein were determined within liver tissue 1 and 10 days after the injection and, more frequently, also the interleukin-10 protein in peripheral blood. RESULTS The procedure was safe for the animals and neither hemodynamic parameters nor liver function determinations showed relevant alterations. The hIL10 hydrofection in watertight liver mediated efficient gene transfer and this was transcribed and translated to protein, achieving up to 110 pg/ml of IL10 in peripheral blood. This value is close to that considered able to reduce the activity of TNFα by half (IL10 IC50 for TNFα = 124 pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS Results of this work suggest that IL10 liver hydrofection with vascular exclusion in vivo is a safe and transferable procedure that mediates plasma protein levels with potential clinical interest in immune modulation after transplantation.","Sendra, Luis; Herrero, María José; Montalvá, Eva María; Noguera, Inmaculada; Orbis, Francisco; Díaz, Ana; Fernández-Delgado, Rafael; López-Andújar, Rafael; Aliño, Salvador F",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689315/,20

In posterior circulation stroke (PCS), this relation is plausibly understudied due to a lack of methods that automatically quantify FLV. The applicability of deep learning approaches to PCS is limited due to its lower incidence compared to ACS. We evaluated strategies to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for PCS lesion segmentation by using image data from both ACS and PCS patients. We included follow-up non-contrast computed tomography scans of 1018 patients with ACS and 107 patients with PCS. To assess whether an ACS lesion segmentation generalizes to PCS, a CNN was trained on ACS data (ACS-CNN). Second, to evaluate the performance of only including PCS patients, a CNN was trained on PCS data. Third, to evaluate the performance when combining the datasets, a CNN was trained on both datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of transfer learning, the ACS-CNN was fine-tuned using PCS patients. The transfer learning strategy outperformed the other strategies in volume agreement with an intra-class correlation of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83-0.92) vs. 0.55 to 0.83 and a lesion detection rate of 87% vs. 41-77 for the other strategies.

A codification of the accepted collective values of nursing can play a constitutional and directional role for the profession. It can further stimulate discussions about nursing that reflect the dynamic essence of the profession. Consequently, there is merit to continually reflecting on a code's function and role especially when a new or revised code is introduced to the nursing profession and the wider public such as the European Nursing Council's Code of Ethics and Conduct for European Nursing. This paper examines codes of ethics in general and the European Nursing Council Code in particular using the framework of Gaumnitz and Lere. Although the European Nursing Council Code has all the ingredients of a contemporary professional ethics code, our position is that future iterations or addenda to this Code should be aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and take a more radical step in becoming an exemplar of a nursing code that can be a catalyst for the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals.","Kearns, Alan J; Kearns, Thomas",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020952104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089746/,20

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on admission rates to the delivery room and the feto-maternal unit, and to assess the effect on the nature of presenting obstetrical complaints to the emergency department. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective cohort study in one medical center. The population was women > 20 weeks pregnant who presented to the obstetrical emergency department with self-complaints during 29 days at the peak of the pandemic outbreak, and a matched group during the exact period in the previous year. We compared between the groups: clinical, obstetrical, and demographic data, including age, area of residence, gravidity, parity, previous cesarean deliveries, high-risk pregnancy follow-up, the last 30 days admissions to the obstetrical emergency department, gestational age, chief complaints, cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, admissions to the delivery room or feto-maternal unit, time from admissions to the delivery room to birth, if applicable, and acute obstetrical complications diagnosed at the emergency department. RESULTS During the pandemic outbreak, 398 women met study inclusion criteria, compared to 544 women in the matched period of the previous year. During the COVID-19 period, women visited the obstetrical emergency department at a more advanced mean gestational age (37.6 ± 3.7 vs. 36.7 ± 4.6, p = .001). Higher proportions of women in the COVID-19 cohort presented in active labor, defined by cervical dilation of at least 5 cm on admission to the labor ward [37 (9.3%) vs 28 (5.1%), p = .013)] and with premature rupture of membranes [82 (20.6%) vs 60 (11.0%), p < .001)], and consequently with more admissions to the delivery room [198 (49.7%) vs 189 (34.7%), p < .001)]. We also recorded a significant increase in urgent obstetrical events in the emergency department during the recorded COVID-19 pandemic [23 (5.8%) vs 12 (2.2%)), p = .004]. However, the rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity did not change. During the outbreak the proportion of visits during the night was higher than during the matched period of the previous year: [138 (34.7%) vs 145 (26.6%)), p = .008]. In a multivariate logistic regression, the higher rates of admission to the delivery room during active labor and of urgent events during the pandemic outbreak compared to the matched period in the previous year remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 caused a behavioral change among women who presented to the obstetrical emergency department. This was characterized by delayed arrival to the obstetrical emergency department and the delivery room, which led to a significant increase in urgent and acute interventions. The change in behavior did not affect the rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity.","Kugelman, Nir; Lavie, Ofer; Assaf, Wisam; Cohen, Nadav; Sagi-Dain, Lena; Bardicef, Mordehai; Kedar, Reuven; Damti, Amit; Segev, Yakir","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1847072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198540/,20

Continuous erector spinae plane (ESP) block, a relatively new truncal nerve block, has the potential to provide analgesia for thoracic surgeries while reducing opioid use. However, there have been only a few reports utilising this technique in infants, and none in preterm neonates. We present the perioperative pain management of a preterm neonate requiring thoracotomy. Epidural analgesia was deemed contraindicated due to coexisting coagulopathy; therefore, an ESP catheter was placed. The patient was extubated at the end of the surgery and had excellent pain control with rectal acetaminophen, chloroprocaine infusion via the ESP catheter and with minimal opioid requirement. Continuous ESP block may be safe and effective for postoperative pain management in coagulopathic premature neonates. Chloroprocaine is an effective local anaesthetic in the erector spinae compartment, which has not been previously reported.","Swenson Schalkwyk, Anna; Flaherty, James; Hess, Donavon; Horvath, Balazs",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-234480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900720/,20

Bariatric surgery is a treatment for clinically severe obesity and is known to increase urolithiasis risk. However, trends in risk over time are not well characterized. Moreover little attention has been devoted to laparoscopic gastric band placement. A comparison of urinary risk of urolithiasis after the Roux-en-Y and gastric banding procedures was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 24-hour urine collections from 39 subjects (11 male and 28 female, mean age 51 years) after bariatric surgery. Of these subjects 27 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 12 had gastric banding procedures. Mean time since surgery was 3.4 and 2.1 years for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and gastric banding groups, respectively. RESULTS Urine volume was low in both groups (less than 1.5 l daily). Urinary calcium excretion was lower (p = 0.001) in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (100 mg daily) vs the gastric banding group (191 mg daily). After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 48% had a urinary oxalate of 45 mg daily or more compared to 25% after gastric banding. Urinary citrate was less than 370 mg daily for 14 subjects in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 1 in the gastric banding group. All patients were taking calcium supplements. Dietary intake of high oxalate foods did not correlate with urinary oxalate excretion or with hyperoxaluria. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms the risk of urinary stones following the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure as a result of hyperoxaluria, low urine volume and hypocitraturia. Those with gastric banding placement had low urine volumes. Future studies should elucidate the effect of nutrition and/or pharmacological therapy on stone risk of both surgeries as their incidence increases.","Penniston, Kristina L; Kaplon, Daniel M; Gould, Jon C; Nakada, Stephen Y",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2009.07.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762051/,20

Nevertheless, antibody responses and cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses in COVID-19-convalescent individuals are largely unknown. Here, we show that the majority of COVID-19-convalescent individuals maintained SARS-CoV-2 spike S1- and S2-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and that some of the antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or both pseudotyped viruses. Convalescent individuals who experienced severe COVID-19 showed higher neutralizing antibody titres, a faster increase in lymphocyte counts and a higher frequency of CXCR3+ T follicular help (TFH) cells compared with COVID-19-convalescent individuals who experienced non-severe disease. Circulating TFH cells were spike specific and functional, and the frequencies of CXCR3+ TFH cells were positively associated with neutralizing antibody titres in COVID-19-convalescent individuals. No individuals had detectable autoantibodies. These findings provide insights into neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19-convalescent individuals and facilitate the treatment and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Jian; Wu, Qian; Liu, Ziyan; Wang, Qijie; Wu, Jiajing; Hu, Yabin; Bai, Tingting; Xie, Ting; Huang, Mincheng; Wu, Tiantian; Peng, Danhong; Huang, Weijin; Jin, Kun; Niu, Ling; Guo, Wangyuan; Luo, Dixian; Lei, Dongzhu; Wu, Zhijian; Li, Guicheng; Huang, Renbin; Lin, Yingbiao; Xie, Xiangping; He, Shuangyan; Deng, Yunfan; Liu, Jianghua; Li, Weilang; Lu, Zhongyi; Chen, Haifu; Zeng, Ting; Luo, Qingting; Li, Yi-Ping; Wang, Youchun; Liu, Wenpei; Qu, Xiaowang",Nature microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-00824-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199863/,20
113450,Kidney-induced systemic tolerance of heart allografts in mice.,2020-09-17,"Niemann Pick type C2 (NPC2) is a small sterol binding protein in the lumen of late endosomes and lysosomes. We showed recently that the yeast homologue of NPC2 together with its binding partner NCR1 mediates integration of ergosterol, the main sterol in yeast, into the vacuolar membrane. Here, we study the binding specificity and the molecular details of lipid binding to yeast NPC2. We find that NPC2 binds fluorescence- and spin-labeled analogues of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and sphingomyelin. Spectroscopic experiments show that NPC2 binds lipid monomers in solution but can also interact with lipid analogues in membranes. We further identify ergosterol, PC, and PI as endogenous NPC2 ligands. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that NPC2's binding pocket can adapt to the ligand shape and closes around bound ergosterol. Hydrophobic interactions stabilize the binding of ergosterol, but binding of phospholipids is additionally stabilized by electrostatic interactions at the mouth of the binding site. Our work identifies key residues that are important in stabilizing the binding of a phospholipid to yeast NPC2, thereby rationalizing future mutagenesis studies. Our results suggest that yeast NPC2 functions as a general ""lipid solubilizer"" and binds a variety of amphiphilic lipid ligands, possibly to prevent lipid micelle formation inside the vacuole.","Moesgaard, Laust; Petersen, Daniel; Szomek, Maria; Reinholdt, Peter; Winkler, Mikael B L; Frain, Kelly May; Müller, Peter; Pedersen, Bjørn Panyella; Kongsted, Jacob; Wüstner, Daniel",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141558/,20
113534,Prevalence of equine coronavirus in nasal secretions from horses with fever and upper respiratory tract infection.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Elevated liver enzyme levels are observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these features have not been characterized. METHODS Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17 to February 12, 2020, were enrolled. Liver enzyme level elevation was defined as alanine aminotransferase level >35 U/L for men and 25 U/L for women at admission. Patients with normal alanine aminotransferase levels were included in the control group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and patients symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared. RESULTS Of 788 patients with COVID-19, 222 (28.2%) patients had elevated liver enzyme levels (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 47.0 [35.0-55.0] years; 40.5% women). Being male, overweight, and smoking increased the risk of liver enzyme level elevation. The liver enzyme level elevation group had lesser pharyngalgia and more diarrhea than the control group. The median time from illness onset to admission was 3 days for liver enzyme level elevation groups (IQR, 2-6), whereas the median hospitalization time for 86 (38.7%) discharged patients was 13 days (IQR, 11-16). No differences in disease severity and clinical outcomes were noted between the groups. DISCUSSION We found that 28.2% of patients with COVID-19 presented with elevated liver enzyme levels on admission, which could partially be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male patients had a higher risk of liver enzyme level elevation. With early medical intervention, liver enzyme level elevation did not worsen the outcomes of patients with COVID-19.","Hao, Shao-Rui; Zhang, Shan-Yan; Lian, Jiang-Shan; Jin, Xi; Ye, Cheng-Yin; Cai, Huan; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Hu, Jian-Hua; Zheng, Lin; Zhang, Yi-Min; Jia, Hong-Yu; Yu, Guo-Dong; Wang, Xiao-Yan; Gu, Jue-Qing; Lu, Ying-Feng; Yu, Xiao-Peng; Yu, Liang; Xiang, Dai-Rong; Ye, Chan-Yuan; Jin, Ci-Liang; Qiu, Yun-Qing; Li, Lan-Juan; Sheng, Ji-Fang; Liang, Ting-Bo; Yang, Yi-Da",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000000717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32618658/,20

In contrast to the gelding or stallion, clinical disease is less common in the mare and manual removal techniques are possible because of their shorter, wider urethral anatomy. However, these manual removal techniques can be traumatic and are limited by the size of the urolith. This report describes the use of a commercial laparoscopic specimen pouch to remove a cystic urolith in a mare. CONCLUSION This approach may allow the extraction of larger uroliths per urethra in the mare, while affording some protection to the mucosa of the bladder neck and urethra.","Williamson, A J; McKinnon, A O",Australian veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/avj.12580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28444749/,20
114282,CXCR2-positive neutrophils are essential for cuprizone-induced demyelination: relevance to multiple sclerosis.,2010,"We report 5 cases of prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia after exposure to the ChAdOx1 vaccine (AZD1222, Vaxzevria) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients presented 5 to 11 days after first vaccination. The spectrum of clinical manifestations included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, arterial cerebral thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathy. All patients had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated D-dimer. Autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) were detected in all patients, although they had never been exposed to heparin. Immunoglobulin from patient sera bound to healthy donor platelets in an AZD1222-dependent manner, suppressed by heparin. Aggregation of healthy donor platelets by patient sera was demonstrated in the presence of buffer or AZD1222 and was also suppressed by heparin. Anticoagulation alone or in combination with eculizumab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resolved the pathology in 3 patients. Two patients had thromboembolic events despite anticoagulation at a time when platelets were increasing after IVIG. In summary, an unexpected autoimmune prothrombotic disorder is described after vaccination with AZD1222. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4 antibodies binding to platelets in AZD1222-dependent manner. Initial clinical experience suggests a risk of unusual and severe thromboembolic events.","Tiede, Andreas; Sachs, Ulrich J; Czwalinna, Andreas; Werwitzke, Sonja; Bikker, Rolf; Krauss, Joachim K; Donnerstag, Frank; Weißenborn, Karin; Höglinger, Günter; Maasoumy, Benjamin; Wedemeyer, Heiner; Ganser, Arnold",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2021011958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323939/,20

PROGRAM The Association of Bay Area Health Officials (ABAHO) represents 13 Bay Area health jurisdictions. IMPLEMENTATION On March 15, 2020, the local health officers of 7 ABAHO members (counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara and the city of Berkeley) decided to issue legal orders on March 16 for 6.7 million residents to shelter in place to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19. The Bay Area was the first region in the United States to shelter in place, and within days, other regions in the United States followed. EVALUATION Subsequent comparative analyses have confirmed that acting early in issuing shelter-in-place orders prevented a large number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the Bay Area throughout the United States. The quality of a decision-in this case, for crisis decision making-cannot be judged by the outcome. A good decision can have a bad outcome, and a bad decision can have a good outcome. The quality of a decision depends only on the quality of the decision-making process at the time the decision was made. DISCUSSION In this Field Report, we review how we made this collective decision. With the benefit of hindsight and reflection, we recount our story through the lens of public health legal authority, meta-leadership, and decision intelligence. Our purpose is to improve the crisis decision-making skills of public health officials by improving how we make high-stakes decisions each day in our continuing fight to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to save lives, and to eliminate COVID-19 racial/ethnic inequities.","Aragón, Tomás J; Cody, Sara H; Farnitano, Christopher; Hernandez, Lisa B; Morrow, Scott A; Pan, Erica S; Tzvieli, Ori; Willis, Matthew",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239560/,20

Relative to open surgery, it offers the benefits of less invasiveness and earlier recovery. However, when a mini-laparotomy wound is needed to retrieve the specimen, the benefits of minimally invasive surgery may be compromised as a result of pain- and wound-related complications. The introduction of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) makes ""scarless"" surgery a possibility; pain- and wound-related complications are totally abolished. However, a number of technical issues need to be overcome before this technique can be used widely. The development of natural orifice specimen extraction surgery abandons the need for a specimen-retrieval incision and helps overcome the technical hurdles of NOTES. As a bridge between true ""scarless"" surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery, hybrid procedures combining laparoscopic resection and natural orifice specimen extraction surgery currently play an important role in minimally invasive colorectal surgery.","Leung, Alex Lik Hang; Cheung, Hester Yui Shan; Li, Michael Ka Wah",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24165166/,20
119819,Perspectives in developments of mass spectrometry for improving diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders.,2021-02-19,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is an effective, single-stage treatment for choledocholithiasis. However, LCBDE requires specific cognitive and technical skills, is infrequently performed by residents, and currently lacks suitable training and assessment modalities outside of the operating room. To address this gap in training, a simulator model for transcystic and transcholedochal LCBDE was developed and evaluated. METHODS A procedure algorithm incorporating essential cognitive and technical steps of LCBDE was developed, along with a physical model to allow performance of a simulated procedure. Modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) rating scales were developed to assess performance on the model. Construct validity was assessed by comparing the performance of novices (residents and surgeons without LCBDE experience) versus experienced subjects (surgeons with previous LCBDE experience). Concurrent validity was assessed by comparing scores from the LCBDE scales to those from the standard OSATS scale. Internal consistency and interrater reliability were assessed by comparing performance scores assigned by three independent raters. RESULTS Sixteen novices and five experienced subjects performed simulated procedures, with novices scoring lower than experienced subjects on both transcystic (20 ± 3 vs. 33 ± 2 [possible score range, 0-45], p < 0.001) and transcholedochal (25 ± 8 vs. 42 ± 3 [possible score range, 0-53], p < 0.001) rating scales. Scores on the rating scales correlated significantly with scores from the standard OSATS scale. Internal consistency and interrater reliability of the LCBDE rating scales were favorable. CONCLUSIONS The LCBDE simulator is a low-cost yet realistic physical model that allows performance and evaluation of technical skills required for LCBDE. The LCBDE rating scales show evidence of construct validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency, and interrater reliability. Use of the LCBDE model and associated rating scales allows procedure-specific feedback for trainees and could be used to improve current training.","Santos, Byron F; Reif, Taylor J; Soper, Nathaniel J; Nagle, Alexander P; Rooney, Deborah M; Hungness, Eric S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2213-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22437949/,20
119857,Pure red blood cell aplasia and isoniazid use.,2007,"The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant influenza viruses emphasizes the need for new antiviral countermeasures. The M2 protein of influenza A is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel, which is essential for influenza replication and an established antiviral target. However, all currently circulating influenza A virus strains are now resistant to licensed M2-targeting adamantane drugs, primarily due to the widespread prevalence of an M2 variant encoding a serine to asparagine 31 mutation (S31N). To identify new chemical leads that may target M2(S31N), we performed a virtual screen of molecules from two natural product libraries and identified chebulagic acid as a candidate M2(S31N) inhibitor and influenza antiviral. Chebulagic acid selectively restores growth of M2(S31N)-expressing yeast. Molecular modeling also suggests that chebulagic acid hydrolysis fragments preferentially interact with the highly-conserved histidine residue within the pore of M2(S31N) but not adamantane-sensitive M2(S31). In contrast, chebulagic acid inhibits in vitro influenza A replication regardless of M2 sequence, suggesting that it also acts on other influenza targets. Taken together, results implicate chebulagic acid and/or its hydrolysis fragments as new chemical leads for M2(S31N) and influenza-directed antiviral development.","Duncan, Maggie C; Onguéné, Pascal Amoa; Kihara, Ibuki; Nebangwa, Derrick N; Naidu, Maya E; Williams, David E; Balgi, Aruna D; Andrae-Marobela, Kerstin; Roberge, Michel; Andersen, Raymond J; Niikura, Masahiro; Ntie-Kang, Fidele; Tietjen, Ian",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599753/,20

It has a reported rate of psychosocial precipitating factors ranging 30-65%. The aim of the study was to describe all cases of CP, admitted in our Psychiatry ward, during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD In this retrospective and observational study, we reported a sample of eight patients who were treated as inpatients in the psychiatric ward of our hospital during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic (mid-March to mid-May 2020) and compared it with previous years. All our patients fulfilled all four Perris & Brockington criteria for CP. We reported the sociodemographic, clinical and biological parameters. RESULTS In our sample, all of the patients had maladaptive personality traits; the major external stressing factor was COVID-19; all our patients had short prodromal symptomatology, short Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) and high score at the Positive Scale at Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-P) at hospital admission with the majority showing psychotic symptoms related to the actual COVID-19 pandemic. The predominant treatment during admission was olanzapine and a short time to full remission of psychotic symptoms was observed in all patients. CONCLUSION We found an increase in the admission of patients with CP during the first two months of the actual pandemic.

Methods: One hundred and twenty six LPS-induced ARDS model rats (weighted 200-220 g) were randomly divided into three groups: 1) Control group (N = 42); 2) low-dose hUC-MSC treatment group (MSC group 1, 1x107 cell/kg, N = 42); 3) high-dose hUC-MSC treatment group (MSC group 2, 2x107 cell/kg, N = 42), sham operation group as healthy group (N = 15). The rats were observed closely for 24 hours after hUC-MSC treatment, and the survival rate was calculated. At 24 hours, all rats were tested for hemodynamics, blood gas analysis, heart, lung, liver and kidney functions, inflammatory factors detection in blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The lung tissue of the rats was collected for HE staining analysis. Results: After LPS injection, ARDS was obvious in all LPS-infused rat groups, consistent with severe acute lung injury and high death rate. However, compared with the control group, a single intravenous injection hUC-MSC at dose of 1 × 107 cells/kg (low dose group) and 2 × 107 cells/kg (high dose group) reduced the mortality of rats with LPS-induced ARDS, as well as improving the lung function, increased the arterial oxygen pressure, improved the heart function, and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. In addition, the high dose MSC group showed better lung injury therapeutic effects than the low dose MSC group. Data from this study demonstrated that injection of hUC-MSC had a significant therapeutic effect in treating the rat model of LPS-induced ARDS and multiple organ function injury.","Liu, Guangyang; Di, Zhiquan; Hao, Chunhua; Wang, Weiting; Pei, Tianxian; Zheng, Libo; Long, Haomiao; Wang, Hao; Liao, Wenbin; Wang, Wen; Zhang, Chenliang; Li, Xin; Mi, Yi; Yan, Fengying; Liu, Yongjun",Experimental lung research,https://doi.org/10.1080/01902148.2021.1897191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749474/,20

This study aimed to establish the factors associated with increased risk of hypocalcaemia on day 1 following thyroidectomy. All patients who underwent thyroidectomy under a single consultant during a 5-year period were included. A multivariate analysis was undertaken to ascertain which variables had the most effect on the risk of hypocalcaemia. A prognosis table was constructed to allow risk to be predicted for individual patients based on these factors. Included in the analysis were 210 procedures and 194 patients. Eighty-two percent of patients had no calcium derangement postoperatively. Fourteen point nine percent were categorised as early hypocalcaemia, 1 % had protracted hypocalcaemia and 2.1 % had permanent hypocalcaemia. For hemi-thyroidectomies 2.8 % had postoperative hypocalcaemia and 0.9 % had permanent hypocalcaemia. The multivariate analysis revealed total thyroidectomy (risk ratio 26.5, p < 0.0001), diabetes (risk ratio 4.8, p = 0.07) and thyrotoxicosis (risk ratio 3.1, p = 0.04) as statistically significant variables for early postoperative hypocalcaemia. Gender as an isolated factor did not reach significance but was included in the model. The p value for the model was p < 1 × 10-12. Total thyroidectomy increases risk of early hypocalcaemia when compared to hemithyroidectomy. Gender, diabetes and thyrotoxicosis were also been found to influence the risk. All of these factors are available pre-operatively and can therefore be used to predict a more specific risk for individual patients. It is hoped that this can lead to better informed consent, prevention and better resource allocation.","Harris, Andrew S; Prades, Eduardo; Tkachuk, Olena; Zeitoun, Hisham",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-016-4084-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27207140/,20

We aimed to evaluate and compare the positive rate with molecular POC tests and DIAs in detecting influenza virus A, B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted in 2019-2020. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from adult outpatients with influenza-like illness who visited four hospitals and clinics in Japan. DIAs were performed at each facility. The clinical diagnosis was determined based on the findings of DIAs, history taking, and physical assessment. Molecular POC test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed later. RESULTS A total of 182 patients were evaluated. The positive rate for influenza virus with molecular POC test was significantly higher than that with DIAs (51.6% versus 40.7%, p = 0.046). In patients who tested positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test, the presence of influenza virus was confirmed by RT-PCR. In a comparison between the patients who were positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test and those with both molecular POC test and DIA, the percentage of patients who sought consultation within 18 h after the onset of symptoms was significantly higher in the molecular POC test only group than in the both methods group (70.0% versus 43.2%, p = 0.044).

121576,"Molecular epidemiology of Bordetella pertussis and analysis of vaccine antigen genes from clinical isolates from Shenzhen, China.",2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND The laparoscopic approach to repair of inguinal hernia has proven advantages over open repair. Repair of more technically challenging hernias, such as patients previously receiving prostatectomy, has been less studied and may not have these advantages. We aimed to compare safety, feasibility, and clinical outcomes for repairs in patients who previously underwent prostatectomy to control subjects. METHODS We undertook a case-control study using a prospectively collected database. From 2004, all patients were routinely offered totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair. All patients who had a history of previous prostatectomy were identified and compared to a matched control group. Both operative and follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS Of 987 patients undergoing surgery during this time period, 52 prostatectomy patients were identified (44% open, 44% robotic, 3% laparoscopic) and matched to 102 control subjects. Accounting for bilateral repairs, 203 hernia repairs had been performed. Patients were well matched for age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Operative time was longer for prostatectomy patients (mean, 70 vs. 52 min, p < 0.0001); however, this reduced over time when comparing the first and second half prostatectomy patients (77 vs. 63 min, p = 0.144). Overall, there were no intraoperative or major postoperative complications and only one conversion (prostatectomy group). No significant differences were found for rates of minor postoperative complications, length of stay, or recurrence (n = 1, control group). No difference was observed for chronic pain, and all patients in each group reported satisfaction with surgery at contemporary follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair for patients previously having undergone prostatectomy is safe and has equivalent outcomes to patients not having undergone prostatectomy, and is an option to open repair. Understandably, slightly longer operative times may be justified, given the benefits of early discharge and less postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery.","Le Page, Philip; Smialkowski, Ania; Morton, Jonathan; Fenton-Lee, Douglas",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3094-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877764/,20
121866,Usefulness of the extracted-overlay function in CT/MR-ultrasonography fusion imaging for radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma.,2013,"It is known that the extrastriate cortex is activated by visual symmetry. This activation generates an ERP component called the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN). SPN amplitude increases (i.e. becomes more negative) with repeated presentations. We exploited this SPN priming effect to test whether the extrastriate symmetry response is gated by element luminance polarity. On each trial, participants observed three stimuli (patterns of dots) in rapid succession (500 ms. with 200 ms. gaps). The patterns were either symmetrical or random. The dot elements were either black or white on a grey background. The triplet sequences either showed repeated luminance (black > black > black, or white > white > white) or changing luminance (black > white > black, or white > black > white). As predicted, SPN priming was comparable in repeated and changing luminance conditions. Therefore, symmetry with black elements is not processed independently from symmetry with white elements. Source waveform analysis confirmed that this priming happened within the extrastriate symmetry network. We conclude that the network pools information across luminance polarity channels.","Makin, Alexis D J; Piovesan, Andrea; Tyson-Carr, John; Rampone, Giulia; Derpsch, Yiovanna; Bertamini, Marco",The European journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32897595/,20

Here we established an in vivo imaging system that combines two-photon excitation microscopy and fluorescent influenza viruses of different pathogenicity. This approach allowed us to monitor and correlate several parameters and physiological changes including the spread of infection, pulmonary permeability, pulmonary perfusion speed, number of recruited neutrophils in infected lungs, and neutrophil motion in the lungs of live mice. Several physiological changes were larger and occurred earlier in mice infected with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus compared with those infected with a mouse-adapted human strain. These findings demonstrate the potential of our in vivo imaging system to provide novel information about the pathophysiological consequences of virus infections.","Ueki, Hiroshi; Wang, I-Hsuan; Fukuyama, Satoshi; Katsura, Hiroaki; da Silva Lopes, Tiago Jose; Neumann, Gabriele; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1806265115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29941581/,20

Identifying students at risk of failure before they experience difficulties may considerably improve their outcomes. METHODS Using a prospective design, we collected simple measures of engagement (formative assessment scores, compliance with routine administrative tasks, and attendance) over the first 6 weeks of Year 1. These measures were combined to form an engagement score which was used to predict a summative examination sat 14 weeks after the start of medical school. The project was repeated for five cohorts, giving a total sample size of 1042. RESULTS Simple linear regression showed engagement predicted performance (R2adj = 0.03, F(1,1040) = 90.09, p < 0.001) with a small effect size. More than half of failing students had an engagement score in the lowest two deciles. CONCLUSIONS At-risk medical students can be identified with some accuracy immediately after starting medical school using routinely collected, easily analysed data, allowing for tailored interventions to support students. The toolkit provided here can reproduce the predictive model in any equivalent educational context. Medical educationalists must evaluate how the advantages of early detection are balanced against the potential invasiveness of using student data.","Dewar, Avril; Hope, David; Jaap, Alan; Cameron, Helen",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2021.1908526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33844612/,20

MATERIAL AND METHODS Two hundred and three adults (106 men and 97 women), aged 18 to 59 years, participated in the study. Participants filled the questionnaires 1-2 weeks after the start of the lockdown and 3-4 weeks after the first measurement. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Complaints of sleep and daytime functioning difficulties during the period of self-isolation are common in 19-30% and depend not so much on the level and content of anxiety, but on its dysfunctional level that interferes with everyday activities (β=0.17-0.27, p<0.05, ΔR2=2.8-7.4%). Complaints of sleep are more often comorbid with complaints of pain (r=0.43) than with complaints of affective symptoms (r=0.33), and complaints of poor daytime functioning are more common among younger people and students (F=3.48, p<0.05, η2=0.05); 14.8-24.6% report improvement in sleep and daytime functioning during lockdown. Regardless of the presence of anxiety, more frequent monitoring of information about the coronavirus is associated with complaints of sleep (β=0.15, p<0.05, ΔR2=2.0%), while general negative emotions- with complaints of daytime functioning and affective symptoms (β=0.19-0.22, p<0.01, ΔR2=3.4-4.1%).

123823,Occlusion of Posterior Fossa Dural Sinuses in Vein of Galen Malformation.,2016,"Bronchoscopy during mechanical ventilation of patients' lungs significantly affects ventilation because of partial obstruction of the tracheal tube, and may thus be omitted in the most severely ill patients. It has not previously been possible to reduce the external diameter of the bronchoscope without reducing the diameter of the suction channel, thus reducing the suctioning capacity of the device. We believed that a better-designed bronchoscope could improve the safety of bronchoscopy in patients whose lungs were ventilated. We designed a flexible bronchoscope prototype with a drumstick-shaped head consisting of a long, thin proximal portion; a short and large distal portion for camera docking; and a large suction channel throughout the length of the device. The aims of our study were to test the impact of our prototype on mechanical ventilation when inserted into the tracheal tube, and to assess suctioning capacity. We first tested the efficiency of the suction channel, and demonstrated that the suction flow of the prototype was similar to that of conventional adult bronchoscopes. We next evaluated the consequences of bronchoscopy when using the prototype on minute ventilation and intrathoracic pressures during mechanical ventilation: firstly, in vitro using a breathing simulator; and secondly, in vivo using a porcine model of pulmonary ventilation. The insertion of adult bronchoscopes into the tracheal tube immediately impaired the protective ventilation strategy employed, whereas the prototype preserved it. For the first time, we have developed an innovative flexible bronchoscope designed for bronchoscopy during invasive mechanical ventilation, that both preserved the protective ventilation strategy, and enabled efficient suction flow.","Nay, M-A; Auvet, A; Mankikian, J; Herve, V; Dequin, P-F; Guillon, A",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.13839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294285/,20
124130,Early reperfusion rates with IV tPA are determined by CTA clot characteristics.,2014,"OBJECTIVE Chemotherapy-induced nausea is challenging to predict and treat. Research indicates that pretreatment psychological variables including patients' perceptions of their susceptibility to nausea, expectancies of treatment-related nausea and nausea history (i.e., motion sickness, morning sickness and baseline levels of nausea) may aid in predicting nausea severity during chemotherapy. However, this research is dated and limited in quantity. We investigated whether psychological variables could improve prediction of nausea severity to inform interventions targeting chemotherapy-induced nausea. METHODS In this secondary analysis, a subgroup of women receiving chemotherapy (for the first time) for breast cancer completed pretreatment measures: perceived nausea susceptibility, nausea expectancies, nausea history and baseline nausea. They rated subsequent nausea severity across 4-days, during treatment and posttreatment in a self-report diary. Structural Equation Modelling was used to explore associations. RESULTS Across the women (N = 481), perceived nausea susceptibility predicted subsequent nausea severity (β = 0.16), but nausea expectancies did not (β = 0.05). Nausea history variables demonstrated small-moderate associations with perceived susceptibility (β = 0.21-0.32) and negligible-small associations with nausea expectancies (β = 0.07-0.14). CONCLUSION Perceived nausea susceptibility appears to capture patients' nausea history, to a degree, and is related to nausea severity during treatment. This is an important variable to include in pretreatment prediction of patients at risk of severe nausea.","Devlin, Elise J; Whitford, Hayley S; Peoples, Anita R; Morrow, Gary R; Katragadda, Sreedhar; Giguere, Jeffrey K; Naqvi, Bilal; Roscoe, Joseph",European journal of cancer care,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323340/,20

The aim of this study was to develop a highly sensitive and specific method for the simultaneous detection of canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine coronavirus (CCV) in mixed infections by combining the high specificity of a dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) primer system with the high sensitivity of a nanoparticle-assisted PCR (nanoPCR) assay. Under the optimized assay conditions, the multiplex DPO-nanoPCR assay developed using DPO primers was 100-fold more sensitive than the multiplex PCR assay using conventional primers. The detection limits of the multiplex DPO-nanoPCR assay for the recombinant plasmids containing the cloned CDV, CPV and CCV target sequences were 5.4 × 102, 6.5 × 102 and 1.6 × 102 copies in a 25 μL assay, respectively. No cross-reaction with other canine viruses was observed. This is the first reported use of a multiplex nanoPCR assay with the DPO primer system for the simultaneous detection of CDV, CPV and CCV in mixed infections.

Postoperatively, patients are often left with unused opioids, which pose a risk for diversion if not appropriately disposed of. Patients are infrequently provided instructions on safe disposal methods of surplus opioids. Purpose: We sought to determine the current rates of disposal of unused opioids and the reported disposal mechanisms for unused opioids that were prescribed for acute postoperative pain control. Methods: A systematic review was performed of the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for relevant articles from their earliest entries through October 2, 2019. We used the search terms ""opioid"" or ""narcotic"" and ""disposal"" and ""surgery."" Studies were considered for inclusion if they reported the rate of disposal of unused opioids following surgery. A screening strategy was used to identify relevant articles using Covidence. For studies meeting inclusion criteria, relevant information was extracted. Results: Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria. We found that surplus opioid disposal rates varied widely, from 4.9% to 87.0%. Among studies with no intervention (opioid disposal education or drug disposal kit/bag), rates of opioid disposal ranged from 4.9% to 46.5%. While 7 studies used opioid disposal education as an intervention, only 3 showed a significant increase in surplus opioid disposal compared with standard care. All 3 studies that used an opioid disposal kit or bag as an intervention demonstrated significant increases in opioid disposal. Conclusions: Baseline rates of surplus opioid disposal are relatively low in the postoperative setting. Our findings suggest that opioid disposal kits significantly increase rates of surplus opioid disposal postoperatively. Further research, including a large-scale cost-benefit analysis, will be necessary prior to recommending widespread implementation of drug disposal kits or bags.","Lamplot, Joseph D; Premkumar, Ajay; James, Evan W; Lawton, Cort D; Pearle, Andrew D",HSS journal : the musculoskeletal journal of Hospital for Special Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/15563316211001366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421437/,20

METHODS Prospective cohort of patients treated with nasal surgery between 2015 and 2016. All patients were diagnosed with mild to severe OSAHS. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 70 years, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) higher than 15, and septal deviation. All patients had a DISE performed before surgery and 3 months after. The DISE findings were evaluated through the NOHL scale. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were included. Surgical success with subjective and objective improvement in nasal obstructions was achieved in all cases. The pattern of UA obstruction did change significantly following nasal surgery (P < 0.05). Before nasal surgery, 74% of the patients demonstrated multilevel obstruction. After nasal surgery, only 50% patients showed multilevel collapse (P < 0.05). Among patients with single-level collapse, the oropharynx was the most common location of obstruction. It became more frequent after nasal surgery was done (41% vs 21%, P < 0.05). Significant improvement was shown in hypopharyngeal collapse. Postoperative AHI decreased from a mean of 26.7 to 19 events/h, but this change was not significant. CONCLUSION Nasal surgery may improve hypopharyngeal collapses observed during DISE in patients with OSAHS. Thus, an improvement in nasal obstruction may also modify the surgical plan based on UA functional findings in OSAHS patients.","Bosco, Gabriela; Pérez-Martín, Nuria; Morato, Marta; Racionero, Miguel A; Plaza, Guillermo",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000005865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469731/,20
126505,Increased serum autotaxin levels in hepatocellular carcinoma patients were caused by background liver fibrosis but not by carcinoma.,2014,"Gonadal steroids modulate CNS plasticity, including phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF), a form of spinal respiratory neuroplasticity resulting in increased phrenic nerve motor output following exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia (aIH; three 5 min episodes, 10.5% O2). Despite the importance of respiratory system neuroplasticity, and its dependence on estrogen in males, little is known about pLTF expression or mechanisms of estrogen signaling in females. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) pLTF expression in young, gonadally intact female rats would be expressed during estrous cycle stages in which 17β-estradiol (E2) is naturally high (e.g., proestrus vs estrus), (2) pLTF would be absent in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and in physiological conditions in which serum progesterone, but not E2, is elevated (e.g., lactating rats, 3-10 d postpartum), and (3) acute E2 administration would be sufficient to restore pLTF in OVX rats. Recordings of phrenic nerve activity in female Sprague Dawley rats (3-4 months) revealed a direct correlation between serum E2 levels and pLTF expression in cycling female rats. pLTF was abolished with OVX, but was re-established by acute E2 replacement (3 h, intraperitoneal). To identify underlying E2 signaling mechanisms, we intrathecally applied BSA-conjugated E2 over the spinal phrenic motor nucleus and found that pLTF expression was restored within 15 min, suggesting nongenomic E2 effects at membrane estrogen receptors. These data are the first to investigate the role of ovarian E2 in young cycling females, and to identify a role for nongenomic estrogen signaling in any form of respiratory system neuroplasticity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia induces phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF), a form of spinal respiratory motor plasticity that improves breathing in models of spinal cord injury. Although pathways leading to pLTF are well studied in males and estradiol (E2) is known to be required, it has seldom been investigated in females, and underlying mechanisms of E2 signaling are unknown in either sex. We found that while ovariectomy abolished pLTF, it could be restored by acute systemic E2, or by intraspinal application of the membrane-impermeable E2 (BSA-conjugated E2; 15 min). The ability of nongenomic estrogen signaling within the cervical spinal cord to recover respiratory neuroplasticity in disorders of respiratory insufficiency suggests that membrane estrogen receptors may represent novel therapeutic targets to restore breathing in both sexes.","Dougherty, Brendan J; Kopp, Elizabeth S; Watters, Jyoti J",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0433-17.2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28592693/,20

These are their most widely known biologic activities. Nevertheless, recent observations demonstrate that platelets have a much more intricate repertoire beyond these traditional functions and that they are specialized for contributions to vascular barrier integrity, organ repair, antimicrobial host defense, inflammation, and activities across the immune continuum. Paradoxically, on the basis of clinical investigations and animal models of disease, some of these newly discovered activities of platelets appear to contribute to tissue injury. Studies in the last decade indicate unique interactions of platelets and their precursor, the megakaryocyte, in the lung and implicate platelets as essential effectors in experimental acute lung injury and clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additional discoveries derived from evolving work will be required to precisely define the contributions of platelets to complex subphenotypes of acute lung injury and to determine if these remarkable and versatile blood cells are therapeutic targets in acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Middleton, Elizabeth A; Rondina, Matthew T; Schwertz, Hansjorg; Zimmerman, Guy A",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2017-0420tr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29553813/,20

METHODS We evaluated serum ATX levels and its mRNA expression in consecutive 148 HCC patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and 30 patients with hepatic resection. RESULTS Although increased serum ATX levels were observed in almost all the patients treated with RFA, they were not reduced after RFA. Furthermore, serum ATX levels were associated not with tumor burden but with the parameters predicting for liver fibrosis, such as liver stiffness values. Then, in surgically-treated patients, there was no significant correlation between serum ATX levels and ATX mRNA expression levels in HCC tissues. Notably, ATX mRNA expression levels in HCC tissues were not higher than those in peri-tumorous tissues. Finally, serum ATX levels in surgically-treated HCC patients were rather correlated with ATX mRNA expression levels in peri-tumorous tissues as well as with liver fibrosis stage. CONCLUSION The increase in serum ATX levels in HCC patients may not be caused by abundant ATX production in HCC tissues but by fibrosis in the background livers.","Kondo, Mayuko; Ishizawa, Takeaki; Enooku, Kenichiro; Tokuhara, Yasunori; Ohkawa, Ryunosuke; Uranbileg, Baasanjav; Nakagawa, Hayato; Tateishi, Ryosuke; Yoshida, Haruhiko; Kokudo, Norihiro; Koike, Kazuhiko; Yatomi, Yutaka; Ikeda, Hitoshi",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2014.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642343/,20

127788,Effect of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic on viral respiratory infections in the first year of life.,2012,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID-19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVES We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid-19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid-Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 is unknown. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. Effectiveness of screening We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low-certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. Screening test accuracy All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point-in-time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, settings, and methods of measurement. We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. For single point-in-time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low-certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low- to low-certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low-certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low-certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low-certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT-PCR. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.","Viswanathan, Meera; Kahwati, Leila; Jahn, Beate; Giger, Kayla; Dobrescu, Andreea Iulia; Hill, Christine; Klerings, Irma; Meixner, Jana; Persad, Emma; Teufer, Birgit; Gartlehner, Gerald",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502003/,20

We report the experience of a national tertiary electrophysiology centre in the management of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) through the use of a fully remote follow-up model. METHODS We daily and prospectively collected remote monitoring (RM) relevant findings and following clinical actions performed from March 10th to April 3rd 2020, a period of suspension of routine ambulatory activity due to the national lockdown. RESULTS During the study period (25 days), we received 2,215 transmissions from 2,955 devices. Among them, 129 patients reported potential clinically actionable RM observations (event rate: 12.0/1000 patient-week). In 77 patients (60%), RM events triggered a clinical action, but only 5 patients needed an urgent in-hospital access (4 urgent procedures and 1 device reprogramming). CONCLUSIONS In the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, RM became an essential tool in healthcare delivery for CIED patients. We observed that RM was effective in ""keep people safe"" and ""focus only on individuals with health care needs"".","Iacopino, Saverio; Placentino, Filippo; Colella, Jacopo; Pesce, Francesca; Pardeo, Antonino; Filannino, Pasquale; Artale, Paolo; Desiro, Dalila; Sorrenti, Paolo; Campagna, Giuseppe; Fabiano, Gennaro; Peluso, Gianluca; Giacopelli, Daniele; Petretta, Andrea",Acta cardiologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015385.2020.1847459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203312/,20
128086,Immunomodulatory effects of antimicrobial agents. Part II: antiparasitic and antifungal agents.,2012,"OBJECTIVE Choosing between competing options (shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy) for the management of hydrocephalus requires patients and caregivers to make a subjective judgment about the relative importance of risks and benefits associated with each treatment. In the context of this particular decision, little is known about what treatment-related factors are important and how they are prioritized in order to arrive at a treatment preference. METHODS The Hydrocephalus Association electronically distributed a survey to surgically treated hydrocephalus patients or their families. Respondents rated the importance of various surgical attributes in their decision-making about treatment choice, and also indicated their preference in hypothetical scenarios involving a trade-off between potential risks and benefits of treatment. Rank-order correlations were used to determine whether certain predictor variables affected the rating of factors or hypothetical treatment choice. RESULTS Eighty percent of 414 respondents rated procedural risks, minimizing repeat surgery, and improving long-term brain function as being very or extremely important factors when deciding on a treatment; 69% rated the need to implant a permanent device similarly. Parent-respondents rated procedural risks higher than patient-respondents. A majority of respondents (n = 209, 54%) chose a procedure with higher surgical risk if it meant that implantation of a permanent device was not required, and respondents were more likely to choose this option if they discussed both treatment options with their surgeon prior to their initial intervention (Spearman rho 0.198, p = 0.001).Although only 144 of 384 total respondents (38%) chose a less established operation if it meant less repeat surgery, patient-respondents were more likely to choose this option compared to parent-respondents (Spearman rho 0.145, p = 0.005). Likewise, patient-respondents were more likely than parent-respondents to choose an operation that involved less repeat surgery and led to worse long-term brain function (Spearman rho 0.160, p = 0.002), an option that was chosen by only 23 (6%) of respondents overall. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first exploration of patient/parental factors that influence treatment preference in pediatric hydrocephalus. Procedural risks, minimizing repeat operations, and the desire to maximize long-term cognitive function appeared to be the most important attributes that influenced treatment decisions that the survey respondents had made in the past. Patients and/or their caregivers appear to see some inherent benefit in being shunt free. It appears that fear of multiple revision operations may drive treatment choice in some circumstances.","Tamber, Mandeep S; Naftel, Robert P",Journal of neurosurgery.

128719,Clinical Proteomics Profiling for Biomarker Identification Among Patients Suffering With Indian Post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis.,2020,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair has been confirmed as an effective procedure in several studies but is considered technically demanding. Separating the hernial sac and spermatic cord is difficult when a large sac inguinal hernia is encountered. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a combined open and laparoscopic TEP repair of large sac inguinal hernias. METHODS From June 2012 to May 2015, laparoscopic TEP (112 cases) and combined open and laparoscopic TEP (COL-TEP) (44 cases) were performed in patients with large sac hernia. There was no clear definition of large sac inguinal hernia; therefore, we defined a large sac as one with the sac base cranial to or over outer ring that could not be easily resected laparoscopically. Using this definition, the laparoscopic TEP group was divided into a small sac TEP (SS-TEP) group (68 cases) and a large sac TEP (LS-TEP) group (44 cases). Direct hernias were included in the SS-TEP group because the hernial sac was easily dissected laparoscopically. The patient demographics, perioperative parameters, complications, and recurrence were compared between the three groups. RESULTS No significant differences were found between the groups in mean age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, number of previous laparotomies, or recurrence rate. Compared with the LS-TEP group, both the SS-TEP and COL-TEP groups had a significantly lower surgical duration (51.4 ± 10.9 vs. 32.8 ± 13.1 and 36.2 ± 11.2 min, respectively), conversion rate (13.6 vs. 0 and 0 %, respectively), and total complication rate (27.3 vs. 13.2 and 11.3 %, respectively). CONCLUSION The combined technique was safe and effective for repair of large sac inguinal hernias. The combined technique was associated with decreased technical difficulty, surgical duration, and conversion and total complication rates.","Zhu, Jinhui; Yu, Kai; Ji, Yun; Chen, Yan; Wang, Yuedong",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4630-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26514131/,20

Gordon et al. previously conducted a review of medical education developments in response to COVID-19; however, the field has rapidly evolved in the ensuing months. This scoping review aims to map the extent, range and nature of subsequent developments, summarizing the expanding evidence base and identifying areas for future research. METHODS The authors followed the five stages of a scoping review outlined by Arskey and O'Malley. Four online databases and MedEdPublish were searched. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. Included articles described developments in medical education deployed in response to COVID-19 and reported outcomes. Data extraction was completed by two authors and synthesized into a variety of maps and charts. RESULTS One hundred twenty-seven articles were included: 104 were from North America, Asia and Europe; 51 were undergraduate, 41 graduate, 22 continuing medical education, and 13 mixed; 35 were implemented by universities, 75 by academic hospitals, and 17 by organizations or collaborations. The focus of developments included pivoting to online learning (n = 58), simulation (n = 24), assessment (n = 11), well-being (n = 8), telehealth (n = 5), clinical service reconfigurations (n = 4), interviews (n = 4), service provision (n = 2), faculty development (n = 2) and other (n = 9). The most common Kirkpatrick outcome reported was Level 1, however, a number of studies reported 2a or 2b. A few described Levels 3, 4a, 4b or other outcomes (e.g. quality improvement). CONCLUSIONS This scoping review mapped the available literature on developments in medical education in response to COVID-19, summarizing developments and outcomes to serve as a guide for future work.

PLPs are likely involved in bacterial interaction with plants and animals as well as in bacterial pathogenesis. We demonstrated that the PLP genes in bacteria colocalize with the genes of putative conserved proteins. In S. proteamaculans, these two genes form a bicistronic operon. The putative S. proteamaculans protein that we called emfourin (M4in) was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. M4in forms a complex with protealysin with a 1:1 stoichiometry and is a potent slow-binding competitive inhibitor of protealysin (Ki = 52 ± 14 pM); besides, M4in is not secreted from S. proteamaculans constitutively. A comparison of amino acid sequences of M4in and its homologs with those of known inhibitors suggests that M4in is the prototype of a new family of protein inhibitors of proteases.","Chukhontseva, Ksenia N; Berdyshev, Igor M; Safina, Dina R; Karaseva, Maria A; Bozin, Timur N; Salnikov, Vadim V; Konarev, Petr V; Volkov, Vladimir V; Grishin, Alexander V; Kozlovskiy, Viacheslav I; Kostrov, Sergey V; Demidyuk, Ilya V",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385454/,20
131056,"Audio Interview: New SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Results, with Peter Piot.",2020-07-30,"OBJECTIVES Unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (ULVH) is defined as increased wall thickness in the absence of conditions that predispose to hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of masked hypertension in patient with unexplained left ventricle hypertrophy. METHOD A total of 120 consecutive unexplained left ventricle hypertrophy patients without overt hypertension and diabetes and 121 healthy control subjects were included in the study. After a complete medical history and laboratory examination, patients' height, weight, waist circumference heart rate, and office blood pressure were recorded. All subjects underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and transthoracic echocardiography. RESULTS Mean age were similar between patients with ULVH and controls. There was no significant difference in total cholesterol, HDL, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, left ventricle ejection fraction, between the groups. Prevalence of Masked hypertension was significantly higher in patients with ULVH than controls (28.3% vs 6.6%, p < .001). Left ventricular mass index (141.9 ± 16.8 g/cm2 vs. 67.3 ± 10.3 g/cm2, p < .001) was significantly higher in masked hypertensive patients with ULVH compared to normotensive ULVH and control subjects. CONCLUSION In this study, we found high prevalence of masked hypertension in ULVH patients.

We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with men and women who had started PrEP but did not return to the clinic for a refill after a 1, 2 or 3-month period. These 'discontinuation' clients were enrolled in a PrEP demonstration project for the general population in nurse-led, public-sector, primary-care clinics in Eswatini. Reasons for discontinuation included changes to self-perceived HIV risk such as the end of pregnancy and absent partners. Others described PrEP as inaccessible when working away from home and many described difficulties relating to a daily pill regimen and managing side effects. Female clients described being prohibited from using PrEP by their partners and co-wives. From these results, we recommend that client-centred counselling stresses the prevention-effective adherence paradigm, which promotes PrEP use in risk periods that are identifiable and PrEP discontinuation when the risk period has finished. A national scale up of PrEP may mitigate problems accessing PrEP. Extended counselling and support could assist with adherence and the management of side effects. Education and support for partners and families of PrEP clients may also contribute to better PrEP continuation.","Bärnighausen, Kate; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Matse, Sindy; Hettema, Anita; Hughey, Allison B; Dlamini, Phiwa; Mavuso, Mxolisi; Fakudze, David; Kahn, Kathleen; Bärnighausen, Till; McMahon, Shannon A","Culture, health & sexuality",https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2020.1770333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633617/,20

MWA was performed using two systems (system 1: 915 MHz; n = 20; system 2: 2.45 GHz; n = 20). Ablation zone segmentation and ellipticity index calculations were performed using SAFIR (Software Assistant for Interventional Radiology). To validate semi-automatic software calculations, results (2 perpendicular diameters, ellipticity index, volume) were compared with those of manual analysis (intraclass correlation, Pearson's correlation, Mann-Whitney U test; p < 0.05 deemed significant.Results: Manual measurements of mean maximum ablation zone diameters were 43 mm (system 1) and 34 mm (system 2), respectively. Correlations between manual and semi-automatic measurements were r = 0.72 and r = 0.66 (both p < 0.0001) for perpendicular diameters, and r = 0.98 (p < 0.001) for volume. Manual analysis demonstrated that ablation zones created with system 2 had a significantly lower ellipticity index compared to system 1 (mean 1.17 vs. 1.86, p < 0.0001). Results correlated significantly with semi-automatic software measurements (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001).Conclusion: Semi-automatic assessment of ablation zone geometry using SAFIR is feasible. Software-assisted evaluation of ablation zones may prove beneficial with complex ablation procedures, especially for less experienced operators. The 2.45 GHz MWA system generated a significantly more spherical ablation zone compared to the 915 MHz system. The choice of a specific MWA system significantly influences ablation zone geometry.","Vo Chieu, Van Dai; Wacker, Frank; Rieder, Christian; Pöhler, Gesa H; Schumann, Christian; Ballhausen, Hanne; Ringe, Kristina I","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2020.1766704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32468872/,20

Anxiety regarding a greater ability to transmit the virus is largely unfounded and has played a significant role in the decision to allow children to return to school. In some patients, however, especially in infants and in those with underlying comorbidities, severe disease must be anticipated and planned for accordingly. The most relevant severe clinical presentation in addition to the established respiratory complications, is that of a multisystem inflammatory disorder, with features resembling Kawasaki disease. The impact of the pandemic on the economic and social wellbeing of children, including food insecurity and care when parents are ill, cannot be ignored. During this pandemic, it is imperative to ensure access to routine and emergency medical services to sick children. In so doing, potentially devastating medical and socioeconomic consequences can be mitigated.","Hendricks, C L; Green, R J",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2020.v110i9.15023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880269/,20

Viral antigen detection can compete with gold-standard PCR-based nucleic acid diagnostics in terms of better reflection of viral infectivity and reduced risk of contamination from enzymatic amplification. Here, we report the development of a one-step thermophoretic assay using an aptamer and polyethylene glycol (PEG) for direct quantitative detection of viral particles. The assay relies on aptamer binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneous accumulation of aptamer-bound viral particles in laser-induced gradients of temperature and PEG concentration. Using a pseudotyped lentivirus model, a limit of detection of ∼170 particles μL-1 (26 fM of the spike protein) is achieved in 15 min without the need of any pretreatment. As a proof of concept, the one-step thermophoretic assay is used to detect synthetic samples by spiking viral particles into oropharyngeal swabs with an accuracy of 100%. The simplicity, speed, and cost-effectiveness of this thermophoretic assay may expand the diagnostic tools for viral pathogens.","Deng, Jinqi; Tian, Fei; Liu, Chao; Liu, Yuan; Zhao, Shuai; Fu, Ting; Sun, Jiashu; Tan, Weihong",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c02929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944569/,20

134352,Reduced Patient Radiation Exposure during Neurodiagnostic and Interventional X-Ray Angiography with a New Imaging Platform.,2017,"Workload is an essential factor affecting the performance of health care workers (HCWs). High level of mental workload increased their risks of insomnia, anxiety, and depression. This study committed to investigate frontline HCWs' mental workload and analyze its influencing factors during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 802 frontline HCWs completed the online questionnaires. Their total mental workload score was 69.7 ± 16.4. Frontline HCWs were satisfied with their performance (4.0 ± 3.3) and showed a low level of frustration (8.3 ± 5.7). The most important dimensions of mental workload were ""effort"" (16.4 ± 13.7), ""physical demand"" (15.7 ± 4.7), and ""mental demand"" (12.9 ± 5.2). Frontline nurses and HCWs who have higher education level, longer working years, and higher professional title perceived higher mental workload scores (P < .05). In conclusion, frontline HCWs' mental workload was not high as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. They have made tremendous efforts and dedication to caring for COVID-19 patients.

Standards provide limited information about barrier performance of isolation gowns for possible exposure scenarios. One of the most vulnerable areas of the personal protective equipment (PPE) ensemble is considered the glove-gown interface. However, current classification standards do not consider the interface regions of the PPE system while assessing the level of protection. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the fluid leakage through the glove-gown interface by simulating exposures and HCP arm movements in patient care. METHODS We tested fluid leakage of two examination gloves with different cuff lengths and seven isolation gown models designed with varying levels of barrier resistance and multiple cuff types. RESULTS Our results demonstrated that leakage through the glove-gown interface depends on multiple factors, including glove cuff length and gown cuff design. Gowns with the thumb loop design provided better protection than the elastic cuff design, and the elastic cuff design provided better protection compared to the knit cuff design for a given AAMI PB70 level. More importantly, a substantial penetration through gown fabrics was observed. CONCLUSION This research identifies a need to develop a standardized method to evaluate leakage at the glove-gown interface to improve worker protection.","Kahveci, Zafer; Kilinc-Balci, F Selcen; Yorio, Patrick L",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34428530/,20

In order to meet diagnostic needs, it has been necessary to develop new diagnostic procedures. To date, molecular diagnostic tools have represented the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus an alternative and real-time PCR system was required. To this aim, a molecular rapid test which works with direct real-time RT-PCR may be a relevant aid. In the present work, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the bKIT Virus Finder COVID-19 rapid molecular test by Hyris Ltd. was evaluated. Moreover, the influence of a different swab storage medium composition was examined relative to that of a routinely used comparator assay. The Hyris Ltd. assay showed an overall agreement of 100% with the comparator based on a panel consisting of 74 retrospective positive nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), collected either in universal transport medium (UTM) or using ESwab. No false-positive result was achieved on samples that previously tested negative. Cross-reactivity screening on microorganisms that commonly colonize the human upper respiratory tract was not detected, excluding the risk of false-positive results. Simultaneously, drugs frequently administered to cure respiratory diseases did not interfere with the analytical performance of the assay. Our results showed that the Hyris Ltd. bKIT Virus Finder COVID-19 is a reliable assay for rapid qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, providing the advantage of less complex and unambiguous interpretation of results. Indeed, skilled technicians are not required, and thus the Hyris system is suitable as a rapid and easy system for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. IMPORTANCE In order to overcome the increased demand for diagnostic tools for the timely detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the bKIT Virus Finder COVID-19 molecular rapid test by Hyris Ltd. The new system was confirmed as a reliable assay for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection, since sensitivity and specificity parameters were fully satisfied. Moreover, the bKIT Virus Finder COVID-19 provides the advantage of easy results interpretation, since skilled technicians are not required, and thus the Hyris system is a valuable SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnosis system.","Gori Savellini, Gianni; Anichini, Gabriele; Terrosi, Chiara; Prathyumnan, Shibily; Gandolfo, Claudia; Marini, Stefano; Cusi, Maria Grazia",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00205-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643409/,20

As healthcare systems evolve in the face of COVID-19, the use of telehealth platforms has expanded. We present the results of a large survey of patient perspectives on the role of telehealth in the care of spine clinic patients. METHODS All patients at the spine clinic of a large, tertiary, academic medical center were surveyed at their clinic visit from 5/30/20-6/30/20. All responses were anonymous and results were analyzed with standard statistical techniques. RESULTS 176 surveys were returned and 164 were entirely completed. 56.8% of patients were new while 24.4% were post-operative follow-up visits. 54.9% had lumbar symptoms. 85% had pain while more than half also reported weakness. 58% traveled greater than twenty-five miles for their appointment. 96% had transportation readily available. Of all respondents, only 15.3% preferred the appointment via video telehealth while 4% had no preference between in-person appointment or virtual visit. Preference for telehealth appointment was not associated with factors such as new or established in the practice, spinal region of symptoms, pain, weakness, comfort with technology, age or duration of symptoms. There was a significant difference between how far the patient traveled for the clinic appointment and their preference for a telehealth appointment, with patients traveling further distances favoring telehealth (p=0.04). This effect remained significant when stratifying based on 25 miles (p=0.03) or 50 miles (p=0.03) but not when stratifying based on 100 miles (p=0.32). However, the sample size of patients traveling >100 miles was small, limiting any inference regarding that subgroup. Access to transportation was associated with preference for telehealth (88.89% vs. 97.18%, p=0.08) but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Most spine patients prefer in-person clinic appointments to virtual appointments. These preferences should be considered when arranging patient encounters.","Maurer, Robert K; Hallan, David; Maurer, Timothy C; Lee, Charles; Kelleher, John P",Journal of neurosurgical sciences,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0390-5616.20.05220-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393750/,20

OBJECTIVE To determine pathological correlates and clinical factors identifiable during life that predict the presence of severe CAA in persons with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We compared demographic and clinical variables at the earliest visit during life at which participants were found to have cognitive impairment and compared pathological variables between persons ultimately found to have no or severe CAA at autopsy using logistic regression. Analyses were repeated separately for carriers and noncarriers of the APOE ε4 allele. Data were obtained from the Uniform Data Set, which comprises longitudinal clinical assessments performed in the Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded by the National Institute on Aging. Participants included 193 persons with AD and severe CAA and 232 persons with AD and no CAA. All participants had cognitive impairment and met National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute neuropathological criteria for AD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of demographic characteristics and the APOE ε4 allele and odds ratios (ORs) of clinical variables for the prediction of severe CAA. RESULTS Persons with severe CAA compared with those without CAA were more likely to carry an APOE ε4 allele (64.9% vs 42.8%, respectively; P < .001), to be Hispanic (6.8% vs 1.3%, respectively; P = .003), to have had a transient ischemic attack (12.5% vs 6.1%, respectively; OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.4), and to have lower degrees of diffuse amyloid plaque pathology (mean [SD] Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, 1.2 [0.5] vs 1.4 [0.8], respectively; P = .01). Those with CAA compared with those without CAA more commonly had intracerebral hemorrhage (9.3% vs 3.5%, respectively; P = .01), cortical microinfarcts (20.7% vs 12.9%, respectively; P = .03), and subcortical leukoencephalopathy (20.5% vs 12.1%, respectively; P = .02). Noncarriers of the APOE ε4 allele with severe CAA compared with those without CAA had a higher prevalence of stroke (11.1% vs 3.9%, respectively; OR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.0-14.6) and hypercholesterolemia (50.0% vs 32.7%, respectively; OR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.7). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Being Hispanic and having had a transient ischemic attack-like episode were predictors of CAA in persons with AD. Less diffuse parenchymal amyloid pathology in persons with severe CAA suggests a difference in β-amyloid trafficking.","Ringman, John M; Sachs, Michael C; Zhou, Yan; Monsell, Sarah E; Saver, Jeffrey L; Vinters, Harry V",JAMA neurology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797962/,20

The bio-capsule, the fat-rich body, and some body components of the silkworm pupae, which deliver antigens passing through the harsh environment of digestive tract and reaching the intestine, have been used as a vehicle for oral vaccines. In the present study, to develop a novel oral vaccine against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the PEDV spike (S) protein was expressed in silkworm pupae and BmN cells using the BEV system. After three doses of oral administrations with 2-week intervals in pigs, neither PEDV S protein-specific humoral nor mucosal immune responses can be detected. The failure of eliciting the PEDV-specific immune response suggested that the BEV system using BmN cells or silkworm pupae as oral immunogen-expression vehicles was not able to overcome the immunological unresponsiveness, which was possibly due to gastrointestinal specific barriers and oral tolerance. Better strategies to enhance the delivery and immunogenicity of oral vaccines should be further investigated. Nevertheless, the PEDV S protein generated in the BmN cells and silkworm pupae herein provides an efficient tool to produce the recombinant antigen for future applications.","Chang, Chia-Yu; Hsu, Wei-Ting; Tsai, Pei-Shiue; Chen, Chi-Min; Cheng, Ivan-Chen; Chao, Yu-Chan; Chang, Hui-Wen",AMB Express,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13568-020-0952-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31993764/,20

Whether hospitalization rates and in-hospital mortality were affected by the pandemic in patients with acute symptomatic heart failure (HF) was investigated in this study. METHODS Administrative data provided by 67 German Helios hospitals were examined for patients with main discharge diagnosis of HF using ICD-codes. Urgent hospital admissions per day were compared for a study period (March 13th-May 21th, 2020) with control intervals in 2020 (January 1st-March 12th) and 2019 (March 13th-May 21th), resulting in a total of 13 484 patients excluding all patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 infection. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using Poisson regression. Generalized linear mixed models were used for univariable and multivariable analysis to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The number of admissions per day was lower in the study period compared to the same year (IRR 0.69, 95%CI 0.67-0.73, p < 0.01) and the previous year control group (IRR 0.73, 95%CI 0.70-0.76, p < 0.01). Age was similar throughout the intervals, but case-severity increased in terms of distribution within NYHA classes and comorbidities. Within the study period, 30-day rates for urgent hospital readmissions were higher compared to the same year but not the previous year control group. In-hospital mortality was 7.3% in the study period, 6.1% in the same year (p = 0.03) and 6.0% in the previous year control group (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, age, NYHA class and other predictors of fatal outcome were identified but hospitalization during study period was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION Our data showed a significant reduction of urgent hospital admissions for HF with increased case-severity and concomitant in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Identifying causes of reduced inpatient treatment rates is essential for the understanding and valuation with regard to future optimal management of patients with HF.","König, Sebastian; Hohenstein, Sven; Meier-Hellmann, Andreas; Kuhlen, Ralf; Hindricks, Gerhard; Bollmann, Andreas",European journal of heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135851/,20

This stepwise approach integrated virtual bioequivalence trials to simulate the test to reference (T/R) ratio for positive (i.e., bioequivalent) and negative (i.e., non-bioequivalent) control formulations containing ibuprofen, approximated distribution of interoccasion variability (IOV) on ibuprofen peak (Cmax) and extent of exposure (AUC) by bootstrapping resampling methods, post hoc incorporation of IOV to simulated T/R ratios, and power curve analysis. After post hoc incorporation of the bootstrapped IOV to the simulated Cmax T/R geometric mean ratios, the resulting 90% confidence intervals overlapped with the in vivo observations for both pairwise comparisons. On the other hand, simulated and observed AUC TNBE/R geometric mean ratios differed, likely due to the lack of propagating clearance-related IOV to the simulations.

136245,Cytokines and inflammatory mediators as promising markers of polymyositis/dermatomyositis.,2020-09-15,"Introduction: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive gold standard to detect fatty liver, we demonstrate a low-cost and portable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) approach with circumferential abdominal electrodes for liver conductivity measurements. Methods and Results: A finite element model (FEM) was established to simulate decremental liver conductivity in response to incremental liver lipid content. To validate the FEM simulation, we performed EIT imaging on an ex vivo porcine liver in a non-conductive tank with 32 circumferentially-embedded electrodes, demonstrating a high-resolution output given a priori information on location and geometry. To further examine EIT capacity in fatty liver detection, we performed EIT measurements in age- and gender-matched New Zealand White rabbits (3 on normal, 3 on high-fat diets). Liver conductivity values were significantly distinct following the high-fat diet (p = 0.003 vs. normal diet, n=3), accompanied by histopathological evidence of hepatic fat accumulation. We further assessed EIT imaging in human subjects with MRI quantification for fat volume fraction based on Dixon procedures, demonstrating average liver conductivity of 0.331 S/m for subjects with low Body-Mass Index (BMI < 25 kg/m²) and 0.286 S/m for high BMI (> 25 kg/m²). Conclusion: We provide both the theoretical and experimental framework for a multi-scale EIT strategy to detect liver lipid content.

(Review).,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Predictive factors associated with stent-retriever thrombectomy for patients with acute anterior circulation stroke remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate clinical and procedural factors predictive of good outcome and mortality after stent-retriever thrombectomy in a large cohort of patients with acute anterior circulation stroke. METHODS We analyzed clinical and procedural data in 335 patients with acute anterior circulation stroke treated with stent-retriever thrombectomy. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months. The associations between clinical, imaging, and procedural factors and good outcome and mortality, respectively, were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Using multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 0.965; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944-0.986; P=0.001), successful revascularization (OR, 4.658; 95% CI, 2.240-9.689; P<0.001), parenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 0.150; 95% CI, 0.049-0.460; P=0.001), and baseline NIHSS score (OR, 0.908; 95% CI, 0.855-0.965; P=0.002) were independent predictors of good outcome. Independent predictors of mortality were age (OR, 1.043; 95% CI, 1.002-1.086; P=0.041), successful revascularization (OR, 0.171; 95% CI, 0.079-0.370; P<0.001), parenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 2.961; 95% CI, 1.059-8.276; P=0.038), and a history of previous stroke/TIA (OR, 3.124; 95% CI, 1.340-7.281; P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS Age, revascularization status, and parenchymal hemorrhage are independent predictors of both good outcome and mortality after stent retriever thrombectomy for acute anterior circulation stroke. In addition, NIHSS score on admission is independently associated with good outcome, whereas a history of previous stroke is independently associated with mortality.","Yoon, Woong; Kim, Seul Kee; Park, Man Seok; Baek, Byung Hyun; Lee, Yun Young",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2016.00675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28178407/,20

We obtained MRSI data from 31 healthy male volunteers [age range, 22-40 years; mean ± standard deviation (SD), 30.5 ± 5.0 years]. Eleven subjects (age range, 23-40 years; mean ± SD, 30.5 ± 5.2 years) were invited to receive four point-resolved spectroscopy MRSI scans on each of 3 days in both 1.5-T (TR/TE = 1000/144 ms) and 3-T (TR/TE = 1700/144 ms) clinical scanners; a further 20 subjects (age range, 22-40 years; mean ± SD, 30.5 ± 4.9 years) were scanned on a single occasion at 3 T. Data were fitted in the time domain to determine the water-N-acetylaspartate chemical shift difference, from which the temperature was estimated. Temperature data were analysed using a linear mixed effects model to determine variance components and systematic temperature changes during the scanning sessions. To characterise the effects of instrumental drift on apparent MRSI brain temperature, a temperature-controlled phantom was constructed and scanned on multiple occasions. Components of apparent in vivo temperature variability at 1.5 T/3 T caused by inter-subject (0.18/0.17 °C), inter-session (0.18/0.15 °C) and within-session (0.36/0.14 °C) effects, as well as voxel-to-voxel variation (0.59/0.54 °C), were determined. There was a brain cooling effect during in vivo MRSI of 0.10 °C [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.110, -0.094 °C; p < 0.001] and 0.051 °C (95% CI: -0.054, -0.048 °C; p < 0.001) per scan at 1.5 T and 3 T, respectively, whereas phantom measurements revealed minimal drift in apparent MRSI temperature relative to fibre-optic temperature measurements. The mean brain temperature at 3 T was weakly associated with aural (R = 0.55, p = 0.002) and oral (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) measurements of head temperature. In conclusion, the variability associated with MRSI brain temperature mapping was quantified. Repeatability was somewhat higher at 3 T than at 1.5 T, although subtle spatial and temporal variations in apparent temperature were demonstrated at both field strengths. Such data should assist in the efficient design of future clinical studies.","Thrippleton, Michael J; Parikh, Jehill; Harris, Bridget A; Hammer, Steven J; Semple, Scott I K; Andrews, Peter J D; Wardlaw, Joanna M; Marshall, Ian",NMR in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.3050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273188/,20

However, the pipeline of new antibiotics is very limited. Vaccination is one of the most cost effective and promising strategies to prevent infections and can play an important role in combat multidrug resistance A. baumannii and prevent the development of new drug resistance. AREA COVERED This review gives an overview of the research and development of A. baumannii vaccines during the past five years (2015 - 2020), discusses the key progresses and current challenges of the field, and speculates on the future of A. baumannii vaccine development. EXPERT OPINION Moderate progresses have been made in the research and development of A. baumannii vaccine in the last five years, in particular in the areas of identification of new protein targets, development of multicomponent vaccines and use of vaccines and antibodies as adjuncts for antibiotics therapies. However, substantial scientific and logistic challenges, such as selection of lead vaccine candidates and formulation, vaccine clinical trials and targeted population, and financial incentives, remain. Thus, innovative strategies will be needed before an A. baumannii vaccine candidate can be brought into late stage of preclinical development in next five years.","Ma, Crystal; Chen, Wangxue",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1887735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554671/,20
137897,Emerging Approaches to Overcome Acquired Drug Resistance Obstacles to Osimertinib in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is accepted as a minimally invasive treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, RFA is not fully evaluated for treating RCC in patients with von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease who cannot undergo surgery due to serious postoperative morbidity or mortality. PURPOSE To evaluate the role of RFA of RCC in patients with VHL disease previously undergoing renal surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Percutaneous RFA was performed for treating 14 RCCs in six patients who had undergone radical nephrectomy (n = 3) or repeated nephron-sparing surgery (n = 3). Treatment feasibility, complications, outcome, and the change of renal function were evaluated. RESULTS To completely ablate 14 RCCs, 23 ablations during 12 sessions were necessary. Of 14 RCCs, nine were in proximity (<5 mm) to one or more following organs: bowel (n = 4), ureteropelvic junction or pelvis (n = 2), psoas muscle (n = 2), vascular pedicle (n = 1), and pancreas (n = 1). Of 12 sessions, one major complication (pneumothorax) developed in one session (8%). No residual or recurrent tumors were identified at the ablation areas. However, new three solid tumors less than 1 cm in diameter developed during the follow-up period but ablation was withheld until these tumors had grown to more than 1 cm in size. The mean level of serum creatinine increased with 6.4% and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 12.8% after the last ablation compared to those before the initial ablation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Despite technical difficulties, percutaneous RFA is a promising treatment for VHL patients who cannot undergo surgery because of excellent treatment outcome and minimal change of renal function.","Park, Sung Yoon; Park, Byung Kwan; Kim, Chan Kyo; Lee, Hyun Moo; Jeon, Seong Soo; Seo, Seong Il; Jeong, Byong Chang; Choi, Han Yong",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1258/ar.2011.100435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21525107/,20

138281,Diagnosis of respiratory viral infections in cystic fibrosis by PCR using sputum samples.,2011,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemiology and to analyze the influence of risk factors and coinfections over the last years. METHODS Retrospectively all infants, children and adolescents hospitalized due to respiratory disease with positive RSV test [hospitalized for RSV infection (RSV-H)] between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2015, at a tertiary care center in the southern part of Austria were included for analysis. Patients were all identified by a search via International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition codes, and all medical data were collected from the local electronic databases called openMedocs. RSV tests had to prove true infection case definition. RESULTS During a 7-year study period, 745 infants, children and adolescents exhibited RSV-H. Main diagnosis was bronchiolitis (70%). Nearly half of all cases (44%) were born during the first half of the RSV season (November-January), and seasonal peak of RSV-H was in January. Predominant underlying condition was history of prematurity in 15% followed by neurologic impairment (3.5%) and hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (2.95%). Age ≤2 months and underlying conditions/morbidities were associated with more severe disease. The majority of cases (96%) had an age below 24 months, and 91% below 12 months. Viral coinfection (most common influenza virus, adenovirus and rhinovirus) was diagnosed in 37 cases (5%) resulting in a more severe course of disease. Main risk factors of coinfection were siblings and crowding. Mortality was 0.27% (2/745). Both children had coinfection with influenza A virus and were multihandicapped (15 and 20 years of age, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Prematurity and underlying morbidities play a marked role in RSV-H. Viral coinfections aggravated disease with death in 2 multihandicapped adolescents.","Resch, Bernhard; Puchas, Claudia; Resch, Elisabeth; Urlesberger, Berndt",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651808/,20

Thus, the evaluation of the internet search trends may offer an insight into patients' perception of the healthcare system during the pandemic, especially for medical specialties with invasive interventions such as pediatric neurosurgery. METHODS A total of 140 keywords representing a wide range of pediatric neurosurgery related symptoms/signs, diseases, and treatments were defined. Google Trends tool was queried for the predefined keywords within the United States from January 01, 2016, to November 17, 2020. Two periods in 2020, 15 March - 4 July and 5 July - 31 October, were compared with similar periods over the preceding four years (2016-2019). We performed analyses in three sections: symptoms/signs, diseases, and treatments. RESULTS Public interest has shifted from regular pediatric neurosurgery related symptoms/signs, diseases, and treatments to the ones related with neurological aspects of COVID-19 both in initial and short-term stages of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Google Trends highlights that the link between neurosurgeon/pediatric patients/caregivers needs to be further empowered by growing educational efforts.","Güdük, Mustafa; Orhun, Ömer; Dursun, Ahmet T; Küçüksüleymanoğlu, Doğu; Deniz, Zeynep; Usseli, Murat I; Bozkurt, Baran; Kardeş, Sinan; Ekşi, Murat Ş",Journal of neurosurgical sciences,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0390-5616.21.05416-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114435/,20

METHODS A prospective single arm clinical study was performed. Patients with common type of COVID-19 admitted to seven designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Henan Province from January 25th to February 26th, 2020 were enrolled, and treated with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The negative transformation of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid, disease outcome, hospital stay, clinical symptoms and signs scores, and chest imaging performance were observed. RESULTS Totally 86 cases were included in the analysis, including 48 males (55.8%), aged 43.5 (35.0, 53.3) years old, 24 patients (27.9%) with previous medical history. Fifty-eight patients were primarily diagnosed COVID-19 and 28 patients were transferred. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid of 86 cases (100%) turned negative, and the median time of turning negative was 10 (7, 14) days. Eighty-six cases (100%) were discharged from hospital, and none turned into the severe type; the average length of hospital stay was (13.8±5.6) days. The scores of fever, cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and fatigue decreased with the treatment time, and the scores of 7 days and 14 days after treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment [fever (points): 0 (0, 0), 0 (0, 0) vs. 1 (0, 1); cough (points): 1 (0, 1), 0 (0, 1) vs. 1 (0, 2); chest tightness (points): 0 (0, 0), 0 (0, 0) vs. 0 (0, 1); shortness of breath (points): 0 (0, 0), 0 (0, 0) vs. 0 (0, 1); fatigue (points): 0 (0, 1), 0 (0, 1) vs. 1 (0, 1); all P < 0.05]. The improvement rate of X ray and CT image was 42.9% (12/28) and 81.0% (64/79), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The treatment with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine has good curative effect on common type of COVID-19 in 7 designated hospitals of Henan Province. It can improve the clinical symptoms, promote the absorption of pulmonary inflammation, and to some extent control the progress of disease and shorten the time of turning negative of virus nucleic acid and hospital stay.","Xie, Yang; Wang, Jiajia; Li, Suyun; Fu, Lili; Sun, Jie; Zhao, Jinling; Zhang, Huaru; Jia, Kui; Zhao, Qingxia; Li, Bin; Li, Jiansheng",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200528-00485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912403/,20
138874,Reply to Aquino-Jarquin.,2020-06-20,"INTRODUCTION Unfortunately, over 40% of stroke victims have pre-existing diabetes which not only increases their risk of stroke up to 2-6 fold, but also worsens both functional recovery and the severity of cognitive impairment. Our lab has recently linked the chronic inflammation in diabetes to poor functional outcomes and exacerbated cognitive impairment, also known as post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Although we have shown that the development of PSCI in diabetes is associated with the upregulation and the activation of pro-inflammatory microglia, we have not established direct causation between the two. To this end, we evaluated the role of microglia in the development of PSCI. METHODS At 13 weeks of age, diabetic animals received bilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles targeting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). After 14 days, animals were subjected to 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery. Adhesive removal task (ART), novel object recognition (NOR), and 2-trial Y-maze were utilized to evaluate sensorimotor and cognitive function. Tissue from freshly harvested brains was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS CSF1R silencing resulted in a 94% knockdown of residential microglia to relieve inflammation and improve myelination of white matter in the brain. This prevented cognitive decline in diabetic animals. CONCLUSION Microglial activation after stroke in diabetes may be causally related to the development of delayed neurodegeneration and PSCI.","Jackson, Ladonya; Dumanli, Selin; Johnson, Maribeth H; Fagan, Susan C; Ergul, Adviye",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-020-01815-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345303/,20

140326,Application of a Novel Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Endovascular Grading Scale for Transarterial Embolization.,2015,"BACKGROUND When the vulnerabilities of the postnatal period are combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychosocial outcomes are likely to be affected. Specifically, we aim to: a) explore the psychosocial experiences of women in the early postnatal period; b) describe prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression; and c) explore whether psychosocial change occurring as a result of COVID-19 is predictive of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression. METHODS A sample of UK mothers (N = 614) with infants aged between birth and twelve weeks were recruited via convenience sampling. A cross-sectional survey design was utilised which comprised demographics, COVID-19 specific questions, and a battery of validated psychosocial measures, including the EPDS and STAI-S which were used to collect prevalence rates of clinically relevant depression and anxiety respectively. Data collection coincided with the UK government's initial mandated ""lockdown"" restrictions and the introduction of social distancing measures in 2020. FINDINGS Descriptive findings from the overall sample indicate that a high percentage of mothers self-reported psychological and social changes as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures. For women who reported the presence of psychosocial change, these changes were perceived negatively. Whilst seventy women (11.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of depression, two hundred and sixty-four women (43%) reported a score of ≥13 on the EPDS, indicating clinically relevant depression. Whilst one hundred and thirteen women (18.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of anxiety, three hundred and seventy-three women (61%) reported a score of ≥40 on STAI-S, indicating clinically relevant anxiety. After accounting for current clinical diagnoses of depression or anxiety, and demographic factors known to influence mental health, only perceived psychological change occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk of clinically relevant maternal depression (30%) and anxiety (33%). INTERPRETATION To our knowledge, this is the first national study to examine the psychosocial experiences of postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety were extremely high when compared to both self-reported current diagnoses of depression and anxiety, and pre-pandemic prevalence studies. Perceived psychological changes occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk for clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety. This study provides vital information for clinicians, funders, policy makers, and researchers to inform the immediate next steps in perinatal care, policy, and research during COVID-19 and future health crises.","Fallon, Victoria; Davies, Siân M; Silverio, Sergio A; Jackson, Leanne; De Pascalis, Leonardo; Harrold, Joanne A",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596462/,20

Many aspects of this novel virus have raised confusion including the naming of the virus and the disease it causes, the staging of its clinical presentation to highlight a few such occurrences. An emerging aspect of the clinical presentation related to COVID-19 is the long-term effects, which in the absence of any consensus has been termed as long-covid and long-haulers in recent publications. As the COVID-19 is a zoonotic infection and comes under a medically related disease, the term chronic covid syndrome (CCS) would be a more traditional way of symbolizing the so-called long-covid and long-haulers in COVID-19. Though the renaming of this chronic state of now well-recognized chronicity seen in COVID-19 would not affect its prognosis, this is much needed to recognize this entity with a more appropriate nomenclature as published work is making its way into databases like Google Scholar and PubMed.

140901,"Regarding ""Embolization of Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas Using PHIL Liquid Embolic Agent in 26 Patients: A Multicenter Study"".",2017,"BACKGROUND Respiratory viruses (RVs) are frequently present in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) during pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). METHOD AND OBJECTIVES This prospective, longitudinal study was performed to examine the role of RVs in acute exacerbations in children with CF. Sputum samples or additional midturbinate swabs were tested from all children using a polymerase chain reaction panel. The primary aims of the study were to determine the prevalence and etiologic role of RVs in exacerbations of CF and to compare changes with RV-positive and RV-negative infections. The secondary aims were to determine the predictive factors for RV-related exacerbations. RESULTS From 50 patients with PEx, 23 (48.9%) sputum samples were virus-positive. With a combination of sputum and swab, viral positivity increased to 56%. The virus-positive group presented more frequently with hypoxia (oxygen saturation <93%) than the virus-negative group (P = .048). Virus-positive exacerbations were not associated with an increase in colonization rates or greater lung function decline over 12 months. CONCLUSIONS RVs frequently present during PEx of CF. However, predicting viral infections is difficult in this group. Only the presence of hypoxia may raise the suspicion of an accompanying viral agent. The combination of sputum and nasal swab samples increases the diagnostic yield in viral infections of CF. Despite their high frequency, the presence of RVs had no impact on clinical outcomes, such as a decline in lung function and increased colonization rates.","Hizal, Mina; Yalcin, Ebru; Alp, Alpaslan; Ozden, Meltem; Karakaya, Jale; Eryilmaz Polat, Sanem; Tugcu, Gokcen; Dogru, Deniz; Ozcelik, Ugur; Kiper, Nural",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32227679/,20

Natural orifice translumenal endocopic surgery (NOTES) is a new surgical paradigm, and its human application has already been started in some procedures. In the present study, we explore the feasibility of performing an esophagoesophageal anastomosis using a single transthoracic single port combined with a peroral access in a rabbit model to simulate repair of esophageal atresia by hybrid NOTES in a human newborn. Adult male rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus, n=28) were used to perform the surgical protocol. We used a transthoracic telescope with a 3-mm working channel and a flexible endoscope with a 2.2-mm working channel by peroral access. We performed total esophagotomy with peroral scissors followed by an esophagoesophageal anastomosis achieved with a rigid transthoracic scope helped by the peroral operator. Extracorporeal transthoracic knots were performed to complete the anastomosis. The anastomoses were examined in loco and ex loco, after animal sacrifice. We successfully accomplished a complete esophageal anastomosis in all rabbits using a combination of transthoracic and peroral 3-mm instruments. This study provides important insights for a possible translation of hybrid NOTES to human newborns with esophageal atresia. Forward studies to accomplish their feasibility in human newborns will still be necessary.","Henriques-Coelho, Tiago; Soares, Tony R; Miranda, Alice; Moreira-Pinto, João; Correia-Pinto, Jorge",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

144122,Long-acting injectable HIV therapies: the next frontier.,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Breast cancer is one of the most widely recognized harmful tumors in the entire world and the main source of death among women. Where, early cancer diagnostic and treatment very critical for live-saving, leading to patient better prognosis and successful full recovery. During the most recent couple of decades, numerous examinations have been performed on the early discovery of malignant growth utilizing noninvasive or light intrusive methods in lieu of conventional excisional biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo breast tissues provides different responses to light transmission, absorption, and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. We offer the use of Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with advanced image processing and pattern recognition in order to analyze HSI data for breast cancer detection. The spectral signatures were mined and evaluated in both malignant and normal tissue. K-mean clustering was designed for classifying hyperspectral data in order to evaluate and detection of cancer tissue. This method was used to detect ex-vivo breast cancer. Spatial spectral images were created to high spot the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant versus normal tissue. RESULTS Trials showed that the superficial spectral reflection images within 500 nm wavelength showed high variance (214.65) between cancerous and normal breast tissues. On the other hand, image within 620 nm wavelength showed low variance (0.0020).However, the superimposed of spectral region 420-620 nm was proposed as the optimum bandwidth. Finally, the proposed HS imaging system was capable to discriminate the tumor region from normal tissue of the ex-vivo breast sample with sensitivity and a specificity of 95 % and 96 %. CONCLUSIONS High sensitivity and specificity were achieved, which proposes potential for HSI as an edge evaluation method to enhance the surgical outcome compared to the presently available techniques in the clinics.","Aboughaleb, Ibrahim H; Aref, Mohamed Hisham; El-Sharkawy, Yasser H",Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726640/,20

145346,The evolving spectrum of ciliopathies and respiratory disease.,2016,"Yoga is widely regarded as beneficial for physical and emotional health, and as a safe ancillary intervention for managing a range of psychological conditions. Evidence of injury, harm, and abuse in yoga traditions is difficult to square with this emphasis on healing. Drawing mainly from on online memoirs by long-term practitioners of Ashtanga yoga, this paper examines the relationship between suffering and healing in yoga, showing how long-term abuse can be perpetuated and injury sustained in a system widely understood and labelled by its practitioners as therapeutic. The paper argues that elements of healing and harm are present in the rituals of practice, the concepts that support it, and the power structure of the Ashtanga system. The system's organizational dynamics together with a therapeutic discourse that links suffering to its transcendence enabled the same kinds of abuse and trauma that Ashtanga yoga is purported to heal. The analysis raises questions about the overarching narrative of yoga as safe and healthy, and about the connections between healing and harm within therapeutic traditions.","Shaw, Alison",Anthropology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2021.1949942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293979/,20

RespiDisk comprises a RTI-specific implementation of the centrifugal microfluidic LabDisk platform and combines new and existing advanced unit operations for liquid control, thereby automating all assay steps only by a spinning frequency and temperature protocol in combination with the use of a permanent magnet for in situ bead handing. The capabilities of the system were demonstrated with 36 tested quality samples mimicking clinical conditions (clinical and/or cultured material suspended in transport medium or synthetic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) from past external quality assessment (EQA) panels covering 13 of the 19 integrated RTI detection assays. In total, 36 samples × 19 assays/sample resulting in 684 assays were performed with the RespiDisk, and its analytical performance was in full agreement with the routine clinical workflow serving as reference. A strong feature of the platform is its universality since its components allow the simultaneous detection of a broad panel of bacteria and viruses in a single run, thereby enabling the differentiation between antibiotic-treatable diseases. Furthermore, the full integration of all necessary biochemical components enables a reduction of the hands-on time from manual to automated sample-to-answer analysis to about 5 min. The study was performed on an air-heated LabDisk Player instrument with a time-to-result of 200 min.","Rombach, Markus; Hin, Sebastian; Specht, Mara; Johannsen, Benita; Lüddecke, Jan; Paust, Nils; Zengerle, Roland; Roux, Louis; Sutcliffe, Thomas; Peham, Johannes R; Herz, Christopher; Panning, Marcus; Donoso Mantke, Oliver; Mitsakakis, Konstantinos",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an01226b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103683/,20

We present an active 11-year-old girl with bilateral osteochondral defects of the patellae: a rare clinical disorder which was affecting her sporting activities. She had a 12-month history of bilateral anterior knee pain before the diagnosis was achieved with appropriate imaging. Her pain significantly improved with activity modification and physiotherapy. Follow-up will require outpatient clinic assessment and imaging to determine if non-operative management continues to be successful or surgery may be required.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to construct intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis and four or more axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases. METHODS Of the 4736 breast cancer patients (T1-3, N0) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and had SLNs examined intraoperatively with OSNA, 623 with SLN metastasis treated with completion ALN dissection (cALND) were retrospectively analyzed, and were randomly divided into training (n = 312) and validation (n = 311) sets. RESULTS Of the clinicopathological parameters available preoperatively and intraoperatively, the multivariate analysis of the training set revealed that clinical tumor size and total tumor load (TTL) determined by OSNA were significantly associated with NSLN metastasis, and that clinical tumor size, number of macrometastatic SLNs, and TTL were significantly associated with four or more ALN metastases. Nomograms for NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases were constructed using these parameters, and their area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set were both 0.70, with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of previously reported postoperative nomograms. CONCLUSIONS We constructed intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases. These nomograms are as accurate as the conventional postoperative nomograms and might be helpful for decision making regarding the indication for cALND or the choice of adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens and radiation field.","Shimazu, Kenzo; Sato, Nobuaki; Ogiya, Akiko; Sota, Yoshiaki; Yotsumoto, Daisuke; Ishikawa, Takashi; Nakamura, Seigo; Kinoshita, Takayuki; Tsuda, Hitoshi; Ohi, Yasuyo; Akiyama, Futoshi; Noguchi, Shinzaburo",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-018-6633-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29978372/,20

Should he opt out of the care of these patients or does his duty to care override other considerations? Older adults and those with serious medical conditions are at much greater risk for severe disease and death from Covid-19 infection. As a practicing frontline surgeon in a high risk group, the hospital offered the author, and other health care providers at high risk, the option to opt out of the care Covid-19 suspected or infected patients before an anticipated surge. What should the surgeon and other health care providers do? This is a question many are asking and having to answer. In this article, the author describes how difficult the situation of having any choice at all was and then how difficult it was to arrive at a decision. The duty to care and its limits, as well as obligations to society, family, co-workers, and to self, are examined. The author considers how he and others can contribute in other ways to patients and providers. The author arrives at a morally permissible and a rational decision to opt out.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective single-centre observational cohort study. All patients admitted to Adult Intensive Care Unit (AICU) with COVID-19 infection, requiring mechanical ventilation and surgical tracheostomy between April 1st and May 1st 2020 were included (Group 1). Tracheal windows excised at tracheostomy underwent histological analysis. Comparison was made with: tracheal windows from COVID-19 positive AICU ventilated patients admitted between January 1st and March 1st 2021 (Group 2); tracheal windows from COVID-19 negative AICU ventilated patients (Group 3); and, tracheal autopsy samples from COVID-19 positive patients that died without undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation (Group 4). RESULTS Group 1 demonstrated mild/moderate inflammation (tracheitis) in nearly all samples (15/16, 93.8%), with infrequent micro-ulceration (2/16, 12.5%). Group 2 demonstrated similar mild/moderate inflammation in all samples (17/17, 100%), with no ulceration. Histological findings of Groups 1 and 2 COVID-19 positive patients were similar to Group 3 COVID-19 negative patients, which demonstrated mild/moderate inflammation (5/5, 100%), with uncommon superficial erosion (1/5, 20%). Group 4 demonstrated mild chronic inflammation or no significant inflammation, with uncommon micro-ulceration (1/4, 25%). CONCLUSIONS Severe tracheal inflammation was not demonstrated in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 positive patients at the level of the second/third tracheal rings, at the stage of disease patients underwent tracheostomy. Histological findings were similar between mechanically ventilated COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Tracheal ulceration may be a feature of early or severe COVID-19 disease.","Ward, P A; Collier, J; Weir, J; Osborn, M; Hanley, B; Smellie, W J B",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606150/,20

One of the key strategies to improve the patient's prognosis is the early diagnosis, when liver function is still preserved. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the typical wash-in/wash-out pattern in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reaches a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 96-100%. However, in recent years functional MRI sequences such as hepatocellular-specific gadolinium-based dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have been demonstrated to improve the evaluation of treatment success and thus the therapeutic decision-making and the patient's outcome. In the preclinical research setting, the VX2 liver rabbit tumor, which once originated from a virus-induced anaplastic squamous cell carcinoma, has played a longstanding role in experimental interventional oncology. Especially the high tumor vascularity allows assessing the treatment response of locoregional interventions such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transcatheter arterial embolization (TACE). Functional MRI has been used to monitor the tumor growth and viability following interventional treatment. Besides promising results, a comprehensive overview of functional MRI sequences used so far in different treatment setting is lacking, thus lowering the comparability of study results. This review offers a comprehensive overview of study protocols, results, and limitations of quantitative MRI sequences applied to evaluate the treatment outcome of VX2 hepatic tumor models, thus generating a unique basis for future MRI studies and potential translation into the clinical setting.

148632,The evolving burden of viruses in pneumonia.,2019,"CO 2 chemistry including capture and fixation has attracted great attention towards the aim of reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and CO 2 accumulation in the atmosphere. ""CO 2 -philic"" materials are required to achieve good performance owing to the intrinsic properties of the CO 2 molecule, i.e., thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. In this respect, fluorinated materials have been deployed in CO 2 capture (physical and chemical pathway) or fixation (thermo- and electro-catalytic procedure) with good performances, including homogeneous (e.g., ionic liquids and small organic molecules) and heterogeneous counterparts (e.g., carbons, porous organic polymers, covalent triazine frameworks, metal-organic frameworks, and membranes). In this review, these works are summarized and analyzed from the aspects of (1) the strategy used for fluorine introduction, (2) characterization of the targeted materials, (3) performance of the fluorinated systems in CO 2 chemistry and comparison with the nonfluorinated counterparts, (4) the role of fluorinated functionalities in the working procedure, and (5) the relationship between performance and structural/electronic properties of the materials.

Methods: From 2015 to 2017, one Tertiary hospital and one Secondary hospital were chosen as the surveillance sites. Two respiratory tract specimens per case were collected from SARI cases aged 15 years and older. One specimen was tested for 22 respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR, and the other specimen was cultured for 6 respiratory bacteria. Results: A total of 287 SARI cases were enrolled for sampling and lab testing. 70.73% of the cases were aged 60 years and older, with 41.46% (119/287) were positive for at least one pathogen. Influenza virus was the predominant pathogen, accounting for 17.77% (51/287) of all SARI cases. Human rhinovirus/Enterovirus and Coronavirus were both accounting for 7.32% (21/287), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (5.57%, 16/287). The positive rates of parainfluenza virus, bocavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumo virus were all less than 5%. Bacterial strains were identified in seven SARI cases, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (2 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). Two or Three pathogens were co-detected from 40 cases, accounting for 33.61% of 119 positive cases. The most common co-detected pathogens were influenza virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (10 cases). Influenza cases peaked in winter-spring and summer. Mycoplasma pneumoniae peaked in winter-spring season and overlapped with influenza. The positive rates of pathogens were not significantly different between different age groups. Conclusions: Various respiratory pathogens can be detected from SARI cases aged 15 years and older.

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SLS) has been successfully introduced for treating colorectal cancer. Here we describe our experience of APR with SLS plus one port (SLS + 1) for treating advanced rectal cancer. A 65-year-old man underwent the procedure, which involved a 35-mm incision in the left side of the umbilicus for the insertion of a single multichannel port as well as the insertion of a 5-mm port into the right lower quadrant. The sigmoid colon and rectum were mobilized from the pelvic floor using a medial and lateral approach. After the rectum with the mesorectum was completely mobilized according to the total mesorectal excision, the sigmoid colon was intracorporeally transected. The specimen was removed through the perineal wound. Terminal colostomy was fashioned at the left lower trocar site. Lateral pelvic lymph node dissection was bilaterally performed. There were no perioperative complications. The total operating time was 592 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 180 mL.

METHODS We analyzed outcomes of 239 patients who underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coronary imaging between 2009-2011. Multivariable Cox regression was used to identify variables independently associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiac mortality, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), stroke, and unplanned revascularization) during follow-up. RESULTS Mean patient age was 64±9years, 99% were men, and 50% were diabetic, presenting with stable coronary artery disease (61%) or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS, 39%). Target vessel pre-stenting median lipid core burden index (LCBI) was 88 [interquartile range, IQR 50-130]. Median LCBI in non-target vessels was 57 [IQR 26-94]. Median follow-up was 5.3years. The 5-year MACE rate was 37.5% (cardiac mortality was 15.0%). On multivariable analysis the following variables were associated with MACE: diabetes mellitus, prior percutaneous coronary intervention performed at index angiography, and non-target vessel LCBI. Non-target vessel LCBI of 77 was determined using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis to be a threshold for prediction of MACE in our cohort. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for non-target vessel LCBI ≥77 was 14.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.47-133.51, p=0.002). The 5-year cumulative incidence of events in the above-threshold group was 58.0% vs. 13.1% in the below-threshold group.

The sample size of 3,119 HCWs (mean age 43±13) consisted of 75.2% women, 61.1% White individuals and predominantly (62.4%) asymptomatic individuals. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 19.7%. Determinants of seropositivity were preceding symptomatic infection and non-White ethnicity. Regardless of staff role or sex, multivariate regression analysis revealed that non-White HCWs were three times (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.53-3.86, P<0.001) more likely to have antibodies than White staff, and seven times (OR 7.10, 95% CI 5.72-8.87, P<0.001) more likely if there was a history of preceding symptoms. We report relatively high rates of seropositivity in all NHS healthcare workers. Non-White symptomatic HCWs were significantly more likely to be seropositive than their colleagues, independent of age, sex or staff role.","Ken-Dror, Gie; Wade, Charles; Sharma, Shyam S; Irvin-Sellers, Melanie; Robin, Jonathan; Fluck, David; Bentley, Paul; Sharma, Pankaj",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-1096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33757988/,20

We address this issue by devising an automated system to let zebrafish exploit either internal (choice of left or right turn) or external (choice of cue color) navigation information to achieve operant behavior by reward reinforcement learning. The results of behavioral task with repeated rule shift indicate that zebrafish can learn operant behavior using both internal-directional and external-cued information. The learning time is reduced as rule shifts are repeated, revealing the capacity of zebrafish to adaptively retrieve the suitable rule memory after training. Zebrafish with an impairment in the neural pathway from the lateral subregion of the dorsal habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus, known to be potentiated in the winners of social conflicts, show specific defects in the application of the internal-directional rule, suggesting the dual roles of this pathway.","Cherng, Bor-Wei; Islam, Tanvir; Torigoe, Makio; Tsuboi, Takashi; Okamoto, Hitoshi",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937118/,20

The investigation finds the new determinants of economic growth. The empirical results find support from the panel fully modified least squares (FMOLS), panel dynamic least squares (DOLS) and fixed effects (FE) as estimation techniques. The econometric results are consistent with the existing literature. The variables considered in this study are cointegrated in the first difference, as suggested by the panel unit root test. The present study seeks to advance the knowledge of the growth determinants, paying attention to the effect that both the tourism and energy sector exerts on economic growth for EU-28 countries. The empirical results demonstrate that trade openness, tourism arrivals and renewable energy encourage economic growth. Therefore, according to the econometric results, renewable energy allows improving environmental quality. However, CO2 emissions are positively correlated with economic growth, showing that growth is directly correlated by climate change and greenhouse gas. The results also confirm the tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) for the panel. Finally, the empirical results confirm that trade openness, energy use and international tourism contribute to enhance economic growth. Based on these findings, further insights and policy prescription are offered in the concluding section.Graphical abstract.","Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel; Leitão, Nuno Carlos",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10375-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803615/,20

Aims This research is aimed to dictating the effect of SARS CoV2 infections on hematological, biochemical, and arterial blood gas parameters by using their mean values. Settings and Design This retrospective study was included a total no. of 97 SARS CoV2 positive patients from 27 March to 15 May 2020. All positive patients were consented and took all the significant details. Materials and Methods We review the total 97 COVID-19 positive patients after obtaining all the hematological and other relevant clinical data from laboratory and medical records. The subjects were tabulated into three categories named; admitted (Gp A), discharged (Gp B), and expired (Gp C) patients and compared their hematological, biochemical parameters, and arterial blood gas analysis by using blood or serum and processed by proper methods. Statistical Analysis The data was cleaned, edited, checked for completeness, and processed then entered in SPSS version 20 statistical software. Results Blood samples were collected of all positive patients. Most of the patients had X-ray changes. Blood parameters showed that patients who were expired (Gp-C) suffered from anemia, lymphopenia, leucoytosis, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia with high ALT, pCO2 and low pO2 than admitted and expelled patients. Conclusions Result from this study provides that WBC count, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and pO2 were independently associated and an important forecaster of mortality from SARS CoV2.

To slow the spread of virus infections and better respond for community mitigation, by advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the large-scale and up-to-date data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g., disease related data, demographic, mobility and social media data), in this work, we propose and develop an AI-driven system (named α-Satellite), as an initial offering, to provide dynamic COVID-19 risk assessment in the United States. More specifically, given a point of interest (POI), the system will automatically provide risk indices associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state, county, POI) to enable people to select appropriate actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life. To comprehensively evaluate our system for dynamic COVID-19 risk assessment, we first conduct a set of empirical studies; and then we validate it based on a real-world dataset consisting of 5,060 annotated POIs, which achieves the area of under curve (AUC) of 0.9202. As of June 18, 2020, α-Satellite has had 56,980 users. Based on the feedback from its large-scale users, we perform further analysis and have three key findings: i) people from more severe regions (i.e., with larger numbers of COVID-19 cases) have stronger interests using our system to assist with actionable information; ii) users are more concerned about their nearby areas in terms of COVID-19 risks; iii) the user feedback about their perceptions towards COVID-19 risks of their query POIs indicates the challenge of public concerns about the safety versus its negative effects on society and the economy.

Type of glioma and its incidence can vary depending on the age of presentation. In turn, outcomes can vary significantly based on the actual type of glioma (histologically and molecularly) and age of the patient, as well as various tumor specific factors such as size, location, comorbidities, etc. In the last decade we have been able to identify key molecular features that have provided us with greater insight into the behavior of these tumors, but the spectrum of treatment options remains limited. In addition, ultimate causes of death in patients with gliomas are variable and stochastic in nature. Given these complicated factors, prognostication for gliomas remains extremely difficult. This review aims to discuss prognostication in low grade versus high grade gliomas, variability in treatment of these tumors, clinical features of poor prognosis, and differences in prognostic understanding between patients, caregivers, and providers.

Since the effect of wearing a surgical face mask (SFM) on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity has not been systematically reported we aimed to determine the effects of wearing SFM during an incremental walking test on metabolic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary gas exchange responses in sedentary individuals. METHODS The evaluations were performed using a repeated measures study design. Seven sedentary males (age:40years, height:178cm, weight:88kg, BMI:28kg/m2, VO2max:32.7±3.9ml/kg/min) and 7 sedentary female participants (age:34years, height:169cm, weight:62kg, BMI:22kg/m2, VO2max:32.1±6.8 ml/kg/min) volunteered to participate in the current study. Anthropometric parameters were measured using a Bioelectrical impedance analysis prior to each testing session. The measures of lung function assessed by spirometry, breathing pattern, maximal exercise capacity with-and-without mask were measured with a breath-by-breath automated exercise metabolic system during incremental Bruce protocol on a treadmill with two consecutive sessions with 48-h intervals. Blood pressure values (systolic and diastolic pressure) of the individuals were taken and recorded within 1 minute at the end of every ten minutes, without speed changes. RESULTS VO2, VCO2, and VE were significantly lower during exercise performed with SFM (p<0.001). Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also found significantly higher during exercise performed with SFM (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Wearing a SFM during incremental walking predispose a decrease in oxygen delivery while increasing pulmonary ventilation in sedentary individuals. Thus, it could be speculated that surgical face masks have a negative impact on oxygen delivery during exercise which results in decreased exercise performance due to the restricted ventilatory conditions.","Umutlu, Gökhan; Acar, Nasuh E; Sinar, Derya S; Akarsu, Gizem; Güven, Erkan; Yildirim, İrfan",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.21.12313-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885256/,20

However, there is increasing evidence showing that COPD patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of presenting a serious infection, a greater likelihood of requiring ICU support, and a higher mortality than other groups. AREAS COVERED : In this article we address some critical questions on COVID-19 as they pertain to COPD. In particular, we discuss whether the usual algorithms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological management in COPD still apply. EXPERT OPINION Patients with COPD must continue their regular therapy, regardless of whether or not they are affected by COVID-19. Corticosteroids reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients in need of supportive oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation. It is essential that a COPD patient who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 is closely followed over time because any delay in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy could negatively affect his/her prognosis. However, we still do not know if COVID-19 infection occurs and evolves differently in each of recognised COPD phenotypes and, therefore, whether it needs a different management. There are other open questions concerning COVID-19 and COPD that need to be considered. Future studies are absolutely necessary to answer these questions.","Cazzola, Mario; Ora, Josuel; Bianco, Andrea; Rogliani, Paola; Matera, Maria Gabriella",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1929176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975511/,20

In this 5-part series, we describe a model for achieving therapeutic risk management of the potentially violent patient, with essential elements involving: clinical interview augmented by structured screening or assessment tools; risk stratification in terms of temporality and severity; chain analysis to intervene on the functions of ODV ideation and behavior; and a personalized safety plan to mitigate/manage risk. In this fourth column of the series, we describe chain analysis as a critical tool for assessing and intervening on ODV ideation and behavior. We identify the pathways of reinforcement that can cause ODV to persist, and how to navigate potential barriers to completing ODV chains. Using a case example, we demonstrate how to apply chain analysis to ODV ideation and behavior and offer interventional strategies that can be used to disrupt the chain and ultimately reduce the risk for violence.","Borges, Lauren M; Barnes, Sean M; Nazem, Sarra; Gerard, Georgia R; McGarity, Suzanne; Clark, Kaily; Matarazzo, Bridget B; Bahraini, Nazanin H; Wortzel, Hal S",Journal of psychiatric practice,https://doi.org/10.1097/pra.0000000000000552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939375/,20
160157,Toward better clinical data in emerging infectious diseases.,2009,"BACKGROUND Infant non-nutritive suck (NNS), or sucking on a pacifier with no nutrients being delivered, has been used as in index of brain function and has been linked to subsequent neurodevelopment. Yet, no data are available connecting NNS to environmental exposures in utero. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between gestational exposure to phthalates (a group of chemicals found in personal care products, PVC plastics, and other products) and NNS among infants in a birth cohort study in Puerto Rico. METHODS Urinary phthalate metabolite levels were measured in women at up to three time points in pregnancy as a measure of in utero exposure to the child. We calculated the geometric mean of each metabolite for each woman as a measure of exposure across gestation. Infants had their NNS sampled using our custom research pacifier between 4-6 (± 2 weeks) weeks of age, yielding the following NNS dependent measures: cycles/burst, frequency, amplitude, bursts/min, and cycles/min. RESULTS Two hundred and eight mother-infant dyads completed this study We used multiple linear regression to assess associations between individual phthalate metabolites and NNS measurements, adjusting for infant sex, birthweight, and urinary specific gravity. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in mono carboxyisononyl phthalate across pregnancy was associated with 3.5% (95%CI: -6.2, -0.8%) lower NNS frequency and 8.9% (0.6, 17.3%) higher NNS amplitude. Similarly, an IQR increase in mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate was also associated with 3.4% (-6.5, -0.2%) lower NNS frequency, while an IQR increase in di-2-ethylhexyl terephthalate metabolites was associated with 11.2% (2.9, 19.5%) higher NNS amplitude. Gestational exposure to phthalates may alter NNS amplitude and frequency in full-term infants. These findings indicate that the infants may be increasing their NNS amplitude to compensate for their slower NNS frequency. These preliminary findings could have important clinical implications for earlier detection of exposure-related deficits in neurofunction as well as implications for subsequent neurodevelopment and related interventions.","Zimmerman, Emily; Watkins, Deborah J; Huerta-Montanez, Gredia; Rosario Pabon, Zaira; Feric, Zlatan; Manjourides, Justin; Velez-Vega, Carmen M; Figueroa, Abigail; Hines, Morgan; Martens, Alaina; Cordero, José; Alshwabekah, Akram; Meeker, John D",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740674/,20

Understanding the perspectives of primary care providers on delivering medical abortion is pertinent to identifying barriers to medical abortion service provision and increasing access for women globally. OBJECTIVE To understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices of primary healthcare providers regarding medical abortion services. DESIGN Four databases (Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus) were searched using search terms related to medical abortion and primary care. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools were used to appraise the methodological quality of studies included. RESULTS Some 22 studies were identified, conducted across 15 countries, comprising 6072 participants. Study participants comprised doctors and residents (n=8), nurses and nursing students (n=5), and pharmacists (n=3) and six studies were conducted with mixed samples of providers. Medical abortion was deemed acceptable by some doctors, but fear of criminal prosecution, in countries where abortion is still restrictive, left doctors and nurses circumspect about providing medical abortion. Pharmacists referred women to other providers with only a small proportion dispensing medical abortifacients. General practitioners, nurses and trainees had mixed knowledge of medical abortion and emphasised the need for training on delivery of medical abortion and dissemination of guidelines. Conversely, pharmacists reported poor knowledge regarding medical abortion regimens and complications. CONCLUSIONS Increased dissemination of training and resources is pertinent to supporting primary care providers delivering medical abortion services and to increasing access for women on a global scale.","Subasinghe, Asvini K; Deb, Seema; Mazza, Danielle",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2019-200487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31888950/,20

While extant research primarily examined it in the context of affluent consumer segments, the sharing economy may offer opportunities for consumers at the base of the economic pyramid, where ownership risks prevent access to products that could create societal benefits. Drawing from risk perception theory, we examine how access-based services, as an alternative to ownership, can mitigate perceived risk dimensions. An experimental study reveals that, in contrast to consumers with higher income, low-income consumers perceive access-based services to entail less financial risk, resulting in a greater inclination to access a good than to own it. In a second study, we explore these differences by comparing access with a risk mitigation strategy. We find that at the base of the pyramid, access is perceived to entail less financial risk than both ownership and ownership with a warranty. The results indicate the importance of the sharing economy for addressing the limited availability of resources for alleviating poverty. Based on our findings, we derive implications for consumers and service providers at the base of the pyramid, and discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic may be detrimental to the identified opportunities.

In this paper, to realize safe and accurate temperature measurement even when a person's face is partially obscured, we propose a cloud-edge-terminal collaborative system with a lightweight infrared temperature measurement model. A binocular camera with an RGB lens and a thermal lens is utilized to simultaneously capture image pairs. Then, a mobile detection model based on a multi-task cascaded convolutional network (MTCNN) is proposed to realize face alignment and mask detection on the RGB images. For accurate temperature measurement, we transform the facial landmarks on the RGB images to the thermal images by an affine transformation and select a more accurate temperature measurement area on the forehead. The collected information is uploaded to the cloud in real time for COVID-19 prevention. Experiments show that the detection model is only 6.1M and the average detection speed is 257ms. At a distance of 1m, the error of indoor temperature measurement is about 3%. That is, the proposed system can realize real-time temperature measurement in public areas. © 2021 IEEE.","Ma, Z.; Li, H.; Fang, W.; Liu, Q.; Zhou, B.; Bu, Z.","2021 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops, INFOCOM WKSHPS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/infocomwkshps51825.2021.9484616,20

On the other hand, one of the main goals of higher education is to develop students’ cooperative competence. This experimental study pre-sents an online learning environment, consisting of a set of web-based resources such as virtual laboratories, interactive activities, educational videos and a game-based learning methodology. The study also examines the influence of the combination of such resources with active and collaborative learning on the improvement of students’ relationships and the development of cooperative com-petence. To this end, an analysis was conducted based on the data collected from a core subject of the Computer Engineering and Computer Science Engineering degree courses. The answers of an online survey (n = 289) were examined by using the structural equation modeling technique (SEM). The results suggest that the proposed learning environment has a significant and positive impact on the two dimensions of relational coordination;communication and relationships, and plays a key role in the acquisition and development of cooperative competence. Findings also indicate that effective, accurate, frequent and timely communication, positively influences on students’ relation-ships.

Proper assessment of development in these territories is necessary to improve decision-making and to inform public policy, while ensuring biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services supply. Rural areas include high ecological value systems but the vulnerability of environmental components in development indicators has not been sufficiently pinpointed. The main objective of this work was to propose a new sustainable rural development composite indicator (nSRDI) while considering an environmental dimension indicator based on ecosystem services vulnerability and social and economic dimension indicators established using a sequentially Benefit of the Doubt-Data Envelopment Analysis (BoD-DEA) model. It aimed also to test effects of weighting methods on nSRDI. The composite indicator was applied to 10 regions (comarcas) in the Huesca province, Spain, producing a ranking of regions accordingly. The indicator was further tested through the analysis of the effect of an equal and optimum weighting method on scores and rankings of regions. Results showed substantial differences in nSRDI scores/rankings when vulnerability was added to the process, suggesting that the environmental dimension and the perspective from which it is conceived and applied matters when addressing sustainable rural development.","Pascual Fernández, Martínez Mónica de Castro-Pardo Víctor Martín Barroso Azevedo João C.",Land,https://doi.org/10.3390/land9070222,20
166710,Respiratory viral infections and associated neurological manifestations,2021,"Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was recognized during the 2020 pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. Because of the relative rarity current knowledge is limited, especially in the European Caucasian population. Objectives: To report the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with MIS-C in a nationwide cohort study in Slovenia. Methods: This is a nationwide prospective cohort study of all consecutive patients with MIS-C, admitted from the beginning of epidemics to 31st December 2020 to University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia, the only tertiary care pediatric rheumatology center in the country. The inclusion criteria were meeting the CDC criteria for MIS-C. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in all patients by positive antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Data were collected from the patients' medical records. Data on the COVID-19 epidemics in Slovenia were collected from National Institute of Public Health. Population data were provided by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia. Results: Twenty-three patients with MIS-C were diagnosed nationwide in Slovenia, all of them in the second wave of epidemics from 14th September to 31st December 2020. All patients were Caucasian and the estimated prevalence of MIS-C was 5.8/100 000 persons younger than 19 years of age. Detailed analyses were available in 20 patients of which 14 were boys (70 %), median age was 12.4 years (4 months to 17.7 years). Two patients (10 %) were treated in the intensive care unit and none of the patients died. Troponin was elevated in 15/20 (75 %) patients during the disease course, and 7/15 (47 %) of these had normal troponin level at admission. The serum level of troponin closely followed the serum level of CRP. Six out of 20 (30 %) patients had elevated pancreatic enzymes in the second week of the disease after treatment was already given,and one patient developed asymptomatic acute pancreatitis with serum lipase level reaching the maximum of 25μkat/L. All patients had elevated levels of D-dimer with no signs of thrombosis. Five patients (5/20;25 %) had pleural effusions and five patients (5/20, 25 %) had ascites. Half of the patients (10/20;50 %) had hepatosplenomegaly and eight (8/20;40 %) had mesenterial lymphadenopathy. Three patients (3/20;15 %) had radiologic signs of cholecystitis. Two patients had thickened lung parenchyma. All patients received IVIG and systemic glucocorticosteroids. Because of resistant or organ threatening disease 4 patients (4/20, 20%) received high dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Biologic therapy with anakinra was started in 2 patients. Nineteen patients (19/20, 95%) received acetylsalicylic acid and prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed in 15/20 (75%) of patients. The mean follow up was 50 days (14 -122). At the last follow-up visit all patients had normal laboratory parameters of inflammation, troponin, pro-BNP, d-dimer values and normal heart function. Conclusion: A very high incidence of MIS-C, estimated 5.8/100 000 persons under the age of 19 with a predominantly cardiac involvement but very good outcome was noted in European Caucasian population in a nationwide cohort study in Slovenia. Attention to newly described pancreatic involvement should be raised.","Zajc Avramovic, M.; Vincek, K.; Mlakar, G.; Emersic, N.; Plankar Srovin, T.; Avsic-Zupanc, T.; Ihan, A.; Avcin, T.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3022,20

The initial and well-publicised success of Insinnova’s 3D printed venturi ventilator valve to boost supply, as well as global panic regarding the availability of intensive care unit ventilators, has led the open-source community to focus on this area when considering projects. However, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome such as that caused by COVID-19 are notoriously difficult to ventilate, with clinical experience suggesting that even slight adjustments in ventilator pressures or modes can lead to a dramatic deterioration in already profoundly unstable patients. In the following chapter, we review strategies for the production of open-source and 3D printed solutions to critical care technology in response to the pandemic. We focus on open-source ventilators in this chapter, and discuss the positive and negative implications of open-source ventilator designs on clinical management of patients, as well as the highly discouraging prospect of ventilator splitting for management of multiple patients with a single ventilator. We discuss possible further opportunities in critical care technology for makers to explore, including haemofiltration devices, and infusion pumps. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Frazer, J.

Using Wavelet coherence analysis and spillover index methodologies in bivariate and multivariate settings, this study examines the correlation of these assets for different investment horizons. The findings suggest that gold, oil and Bitcoin exhibited low coherency with each stock index across almost all considered investment horizons until the onset of the COVID-19. Conversely, with the outbreak of the pandemic, the return spillover is more intense across financial assets, and a significant pairwise return connectedness between each equity index and hedging asset is observed. Hence, gold, oil, and Bitcoin do not exhibit safe-haven characteristics. However, by decomposing the time-varying co-movements into different investment horizons, we find that total and pairwise connectedness among the assets are primarily driven by a higher-frequency band (up to 4 days). It indicates that investors have diversification opportunities with gold, oil, and Bitcoin at longer horizons.

170766,Measuring the Impact of Infectious Diseases on Tourists’ Willingness to Pay to Visit Island Destinations,2020,"The development of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths in selected nations and states is compared to the result of calculations using a conventional SEIR model of pandemic development. The model is based on the infection multiplier, R0, defined as the number of people infected by each infectious person. The infection rate increases exponentially when R0 >1.0; it remains constant at R0 = 1.0 and decreases for R0 < 1.0. R0 is determined by population behavior (frequency and proximity of interactions) and the ease by which a victim is infected by an infectious person (virus' virulence). It is reduced by herd immunity when a large fraction of the population acquires immunity by vaccination or by recovering from infection. The daily death rates in the U.S. and northern Europe exhibited peaks in April/May 2020 and Dec. 2020/Jan. 2021 with more a modest rate during the summer of 2020 and a gradually decreasing rate since Jan. 2021. The model produces this type of oscillatory response if it assumes that the population's R0 responds to information reported about the pandemic, but with a delay between infections and resulting behavioral adjustments. Oscillatory behavior is typical of a control loop with delay in its feedback. The analysis concludes that: Given the history of R0 the model predicts the development of pandemic deaths. However, since R0 is determined by the population's behavior, control of the pandemic in democracies depends primarily on preparation and the persuasive power of political and scientific authorities. Data for S. Korea and New Zealand demonstrate the effectiveness of such methods. For each death in the U.S. about 169 persons were infected, but fewer than half of them were identified as cases. The pandemic was prolonged in the U.S. because the population chose to keep R0 near 1.0 by relaxing restrictions once the death rate subsided. Initial values of R0 as high as 5.0 were observed, leading to infections doubling about every 2 days. If unabated, the resulting exponential growth increases the infected population by a factor of about 5000 before the death from the first infections is recorded. Arrival from Italy probably initiated the pandemic in the eastern U.S., but, by the time the first death was recorded the number of domestic infections exceeded by far those that were imported. Import restrictions beyond this point are ineffective except in delaying the arrival of more virulent mutations. If no social restrictions had been adopted, approximately 1.6 million deaths would have resulted in the U.S. The vaccine, although developed and deployed at record speed, was too late to ameliorate this result. A third peak in death rate in Sept. 2021 may be prevented if more than 80% of the population is vaccinated.","van Lint, V. A. J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.12.21260326v1?rss=1,20
174395,Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells☆,2022,"Due to the large number of negative tests, individually screening large populations for rare pathogens can be wasteful and expensive. Sample pooling methods improve the efficiency of large-scale pathogen screening campaigns by reducing the number of tests and reagents required to accurately categorize positive and negative individuals. Such methods rely on group testing theory which mainly focuses on minimizing the total number of tests; however, many other practical concerns and tradeoffs must be considered when choosing an appropriate method for a given set of circumstances. Here we use computational simulations to determine how several theoretical approaches compare in terms of (a) the number of tests, to minimize costs and save reagents, (b) the number of sequential steps, to reduce the time it takes to complete the assay, (c) the number of samples per pool, to avoid the limits of detection, (d) simplicity, to reduce the risk of human error, and (e) robustness, to poor estimates of the number of positive samples. We found that established methods often perform very well in one area but very poorly in others. Therefore, we introduce and validate a new method which performs fairly well across each of the above criteria making it a good general use approach.","Furstenau, Tara N.; Cocking, Jill H.; Hepp, Crystal M.; Fofanov, Viacheslav Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.206060,20

Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. Simulations for each time window and for different types of vaccines and production rates were run to find the optimal time window between doses, that is, the one that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to apply the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the optimal window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the optimal window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths. These conclusions point to the need to carefully take into account both vaccine characteristics and roll-out speed to optimize the outcome of vaccination strategies.","Ferreira, L.

175361,Short-range airborne route dominates exposure of respiratory infection during close contact,,"The approach is developed to specify a reconstruction of complicated functions using samples of limited size with invariant properties regarding the desired parameters. The idea is based on solutions to inverse problems, which should identify various representations of unknown parameters of a mathematical model and do so in a series. The sequential solutions to inverse problems ensure the identifiability of desired parameters that belong to an invariant family. The locally sequential refinement restricts local spikes additionally to the general regularization under a scheme of separate matching with observations. A simulation with inverse problems is applied to refine the known features of population dynamics. The reconstruction shows that the parameters of the Verhulst equation should be introduced as oscillatory functions. Based on the novel functional representation of the Verhulst equation parameters, the patterns of the COVID-19 spread and its progression in a given region are determined. The results emphasize the Verhulst equation’s character as a generalized and fruitful model for an object growth simulation.

Aberrant neuroimmune activation is associated with dysregulation of memory and emotion, though the precise mechanisms at play are complex and highly context dependent. Sex differences neuroimmune activation and function further complicate our understanding of its roles in cognitive and affective regulation. Methods Here, we characterized the physiological sickness and inflammatory response of the hippocampus following intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of a synthetic viral mimic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), in both male and female C57Bl/6 mice. Results We observed that poly I:C induced weight loss, fever, and elevations of cytokine and chemokines in the hippocampus of both sexes. Specifically, we found transient increases in gene expression and protein levels of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, TNFα, CCL2, and CXCL10, where males showed a greater magnitude of response compared with females. Only males showed increased IFNα and IFNγ in response to poly I:C, whereas both males and females exhibited elevations of IFNβ, demonstrating a specific sex difference in the anti-viral response in the hippocampus. Conclusion Our data suggest that type I interferons are one potential node mediating sex-specific cytokine responses and neuroimmune effects on cognition. Together, these findings highlight the importance of using both males and females and analyzing a broad set of inflammatory markers in order to identify the precise, sex-specific roles for neuroimmune dysregulation in neurological diseases and disorders.","Posillico, Caitlin K.; Garcia-Hernandez, Rosa E.; Tronson, Natalie C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.394742,20

The chronic high degree stress has made burnout in health care workers (HCWs) a reality that needs urgent attention which can otherwise lead to compromised patient care apart from their own suffering. Aims and Objectives: This study was planned to assess and compare the burnout in doctors and nurses of our dedicated COVID 19 hospital, to understand its correlates, and look for any implications on future policy decisions. Materials and Methods: Our study assessed and compared the burnout in 150 doctors and 150 nurses of our dedicated COVID 19 hospital using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). The CBI Scale is a 19 item scale including three domains of burnout in the form of personal (1-6), work related (7-13), and patient related burnout (14-19). More than 25% average score on these items is taken as the presence of burnout. Results: We found burnout in 58% of all HCWs with 78% in doctors (n = 150) and 38% in nurses (n = 150), the difference being statistically significant. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to find common factors affecting burnout among both the groups, which were female gender, facing stigma due to COVID 19 duty, regular exercise/yoga, and dissatisfaction with administrative services. Our findings propose to emphasize the need to address the impact of working under pressure for sustained periods among HCWs.","Parikh, M. N.; Patel, D. S.; Patel, V. A.; Kansagra, P.

Visualizing such data in an interactive form is essential for public sharing and geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. The Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi) framework has been used as an integrative model layered atop geospatial data, and its deployment within the dynamic ArcGIS universe would open up powerful new avenues for sophisticated, interactive GIS analysis. Objective: We propose an actively developed suite of software, the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit, for creating, viewing, sharing, and analyzing interactive ToxPi figures in ArcGIS. Methods: The ToxPi*GIS Toolkit is a collection of methods for creating interactive feature layers that contain ToxPi diagrams. It currently includes an ArcGIS Toolbox (ToxPiToolbox.tbx) for drawing geographically located ToxPi diagrams onto a feature layer, a collection of modular Python scripts that create predesigned layer files containing ToxPi feature layers from the command line, and a collection of Python routines for useful data manipulation and preprocessing. We present workflows documenting ToxPi feature layer creation, sharing, and embedding for both novice and advanced users looking for additional customizability. Results: Map visualizations created with the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit can be made freely available on public URLs, allowing users without ArcGIS Pro access or expertise to view and interact with them. Novice users with ArcGIS Pro access can create de novo custom maps, and advanced users can exploit additional customization options. The ArcGIS Toolbox provides a simple means for generating ToxPi feature layers. We illustrate its usage with current COVID-19 data to compare drivers of pandemic vulnerability in counties across the United States. Significance: Development of new features, which will advance the interests of the scientific community in many fields, is ongoing for the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit, which can be accessed from www.toxpi.org.","Fleming, J.; Marvel, S.

177272,The truth inside the comedy,2021,"Machine learning methods offer great promise for fast and accurate detection and prognostication of COVID-19 from standard-of-care chest radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) images. Many articles have been published in 2020 describing new machine learning-based models for both of these tasks, but it is unclear which are of potential clinical utility. In this systematic review, we search EMBASE via OVID, MEDLINE via PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv for published papers and preprints uploaded from January 1, 2020 to October 3, 2020 which describe new machine learning models for the diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 from CXR or CT images. Our search identified 2,212 studies, of which 415 were included after initial screening and, after quality screening, 61 studies were included in this systematic review. Our review finds that none of the models identified are of potential clinical use due to methodological flaws and/or underlying biases. This is a major weakness, given the urgency with which validated COVID-19 models are needed. To address this, we give many recommendations which, if followed, will solve these issues and lead to higher quality model development and well documented manuscripts.","Roberts, Michael; Driggs, Derek; Thorpe, Matthew; Gilbey, Julian; Yeung, Michael; Ursprung, Stephan; Aviles-Rivero, Angelica I.; Etmann, Christian; McCague, Cathal; Beer, Lucian; Weir-McCall, Jonathan R.; Teng, Zhongzhao; Gkrania-Klotsas, Effrossyni; Rudd, James H.F.; Sala, Evis; Schonlieb, Carola-Bibiane",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06388v4.pdf,20
178597,The changing face of meningococcal infection,2021,"Fungal infection is an important public health problem afflicting more than a billion people worldwide. Mycoses are especially important in Latin America, and in Brazil in particular. Paracoccidioides is the genus of fungi responsible for paracoccidioidomycosis comprising two species, P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii. The lungs are the primary infection site, but oral mucosa and airways can also be affected. The glycoprotein gp43 is involved in fungi adhesion to epithelial cells and is the most studied protein of P. brasiliensis. Seminal work identified a specific stretch of 15 amino acids that spans the region 181-195 (called P10) as an important epitope of gp43, being recognized by T lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of mice and humans and is envisioned as a potential vaccine component. Here, we show by using thioflavin T (ThT), transmission electron microscopy and other methods that synthetic P10 forms typical amyloid aggregates in solution in very short times, a property that could hamper vaccine development. In silico, aggregation analysis reveals several aggregation-prone regions (APR) in the P10 sequence that are capable of forming amyloid cores with steric zipper architecture. Seeds of P10 obtained by fibril mechanical fragmentation were able to induce the aggregation of P4 but not P23, as evidenced by ThT binding and mass spectrometry. These two peptides, also derived from gp43, are potent modulators of local and systemic inflammation. In-silico proteolysis studies with gp43 revealed that aggregation-prone, P10-like peptides could be generated by the action of several proteases such as proteinase K, trypsin and pepsin, which suggests that P10 could be formed upon gp43 digestion in a physiological condition. Considering our data in the context of a potential vaccine development, we redesigned the sequence of the P10 peptide, maintaining the antigenic region (HTLAIR), but drastically reducing its aggregation propensity.","Cardim-Pires, Thyago R.; Sant’Anna, Ricardo; Foguel, Debora",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.451661,20

The tasks include the diversity conditions in real-world scenarios. The goals of this system are learning to think as a professional in a certain discipline. While the substantive, psychological, instructional, and task developmental aspects of the assessment have been investigated, few analytic methods have been proposed that allow us to provide feedback to learners in a formative way. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework of a learning analytic method including (1) an assessment design through evidence-centered design (ECD), (2) a data mining method using social network analysis, and (3) an analytic method using a Bayesian network. This analytic framework can analyze the learners’ performances based on a computational psychometric framework. The tasks were designed to measure 21st century learning skills. The 250 samples of data collected from the system were analyzed. The results from the social network analysis provide the learning path during a course. In addition, the 21st century learning skills of each learner were inferred from the Bayesian network over multiple time points. Therefore, the learning analytics proposed in this study can offer the student learning progression as well as effective feedback for learning.","Choi, Younyoung Young Il Cho",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12197950,20

Assessing the sustainability of wild edible plant foraging by linking local perception to ecological inference,2021-09-27,"AI has the immense caliber to perform efficiently according to the industry's needs. One of the reasons is AI's image processing technology. Since ophthalmology requires the processing of images of the eyes for different eye conditions, AI is playing a significant role in the field. It has allowed the growth of 'intelligent diagnosis' Through this study, a model will be proposed for the earliest detection of glaucoma using AI specifically Deep Learning (DL) and Virtual Reality (VR). This would help patients to begin treatment at the earliest stages to prevent complete loss of vision. The idea of designing this model as compared to more efficient yet complex techniques available in hospitals is because in the delay of glaucoma detection, precious time is lost and with it, irreparable damage is inflicted upon the eye. The diagnosis of glaucoma depends on the optic disc and surrounding retinal nerve fiber layer assessment performed by a trained professional. Therefore, the detection of glaucoma has always been limited in its economic value due to the precise skills required and its labor-intensive nature. Given the growing public health concern, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, improvements towards the field of screening and diagnosis of glaucoma are endorsed. The proposed methodology would consist of a VR environment for obtaining information required like maximum peripheral distance combined with various inputs that would be taken for the DL model, an efficient and precise diagnosis would be expected which would highly cut the cost of performing expensive eyes tests. © 2021 IEEE.","Khan, Z.; Akhter, M.

182583,A novel gene-by-environment quantitative trait locus on mouse chromosome 15 underlies susceptibility to acute ozone-induced lung injury,2021-05-20,"Background: PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is generally considered the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. However, in our rheumatology outpatient clinic we observed a significant discrepancy between clinical evidence of COVID-19 and PCR results. Objectives: Aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the significance of PCR and serologic tests in the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) in a cohort of patients with rheumatic diseases. Methods: Between March 2020 and January 2021, 35 patients with a history of established COVID-19 or typical signs and symptoms were identified on the occasion of a routine rheumatology follow-up examination in our institution. Previous diagnostic work-up in external facilities (results of PCR or antibody testing, imaging) was documented. Antibody ELISA-tests (IgG, IgA, IgM, Euroimmun) were performed in patients reporting typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in the past. Results: PCR diagnostics had been performed in 15/35 patients (43%), in 13/35 (39%) at the onset of the first symptoms, in 2 subjects only 2 months later. PCR was positive in 7/13 (54%) of those tested early, but negative in the two patients tested later. In 29/35 patients (83%) SARS-CoV-2-ELISA tests were performed on the occasion of the routine rheumatologic examination (interval between first symptoms and testing on average 98 days, median86, range 4-283 days). In two of the initially negative individuals the second PCR was positive. ELISA tests were positive in all patients. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were positive in only two patients (however 55 and 71 days after disease onset), n=8/29 (28%) IgG only, n=9/29 (31%) IgG and IgA, n=12/29 (41%) IgA only. In these subjects, IgG antibodies did not develop even in the further course. Antibody titers were in part very high, but in part also very low (only just above the normal value), so even low titers were diagnostic obviously. In all patients with negative PCR, ELISA was positive and retrospectively led to confirmation of the diagnosis. Only in 13/35 patients (37%) diagnosis had been made with the onset of the first symptoms or in the course of clinically manifest disease and had led to appropriate quarantine measures and contact tracing by the health authorities. In contrast, in the majority of patients (63%), the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was only made retrospectively on the occasion of a routine rheumatologic follow-up. However, 5 of these 22 patients (23%) had quarantined themselves during the symptomatic phase. Titer histories were available from 12 patients. The titer became negative in 7 patients, after a mean of 188 days (median 202, min 51, max 296 days), and remained positive in 5 individuals (mean 190 days, median 191, min 122, max 260 days). The change of the titer was independent of disease severity or antirheumatic therapy. Conclusion: The results suggest that the importance of PCR in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be overestimated. Therefore, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of clinical suspicion and negative PCR. In antibody diagnostics, special features were observed compared to other viruses, in particular, in some patients only low antibody titers or the absence of seroconversion with lack of development of IgG antibodies. Normalization of antibody titers in some patients supports the recommendation to vaccinate even after expired COVID-19 disease.","Werner, S. G.; Langer, H.

To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 and disease recovery in convalescent patients, we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury. ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19. Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery. In summary, our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption, whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity.","Ruhl, L.; Pink, I.; Kuehne, J.

Precognitive diagnoses are characterized by lightheadedness, nausea, severe fatigue, and an elevated heart rate. As a result, it’s important to seek care as soon as possible after experiencing syncope. Since receiving a correct diagnosis and appropriate care, the majority of patients may avoid complications with syncope. Syncope appears to be a sign of COVID 19 in people with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, a sudden heart attack might result in acute syncope. In a few circumstances, machine learning classification techniques may not be precise. For paraplegia patients, prediction vasovagal syncope needs more precise results in order to save their lives.

We aimed to synthesize the prevalence of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic and general distress of major virus epidemics since 2002. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase from 2002 until April 14, 2021 for peer-reviewed studies reporting prevalence of MHP in adults with laboratory-confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, H7N9, Ebolavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included studies that assessed MHP with well-validated and frequently used scales. A three-level random-effects meta-analysis for dependent sizes was conducted to account for multiple outcome reporting. We pooled MHP jointly and separately for mild or moderate-to-severe severity by acute (one month), ongoing (one to three month), and post-illness phase (longer than three months). A meta-regression was conducted to test for moderating effects. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020194535. Findings: We identified 59 studies providing a total of 187 effect sizes. Range for sample size (n=14-n=1002), females (22-79%), and mean age (32-72 years). MHP prevalence was higher for mild (35.5-46.3%) compared to moderate-to-severe MPH (17.3-22.3). MHP, in general, decreased from acute to post-illness from 46.3% to 38.8% and for mild and moderate-to-severe from 22.3% to 18.8%, respectively. We found no evidence of moderating effects except for non-random sampling and H1N1 showing higher proportions. Interpretation: MHP decreased over time but were still on a substantial level at post-illness.

183819,Cytokine profiles in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy.,2005,"Pre-existing T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in individuals without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in several studies. While emerging evidence hints toward prior exposure to common-cold human coronaviruses (HCoV), the extent of- and conditions for-cross-protective immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs remain open. Here, by leveraging a comprehensive pool of publicly available functionally evaluated SARS-CoV-2 peptides, we report 126 immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides with high sequence similarity to 285 MHC-presented target peptides from at least one of four HCoV, thus providing a map describing the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 shared and private immunogenic peptides with functionally validated T cell responses. Using this map, we show that while SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides in general exhibit higher level of dissimilarity to both self-proteome and -microbiomes, there exist several SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides with high similarity to various human protein coding genes, some of which have been reported to have elevated expression in severe COVID-19 patients. We then combine our map with a SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR repertoire data from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls and show that whereas the public repertoire for the majority of convalescent patients are dominated by TCRs cognate to private SARS-CoV-2 peptides, for a subset of patients, more than 50% of their public repertoires that show reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, consist of TCRs cognate to shared SARS-CoV-2-HCoV peptides. Further analyses suggest that the skewed distribution of TCRs cognate to shared and private peptides in COVID-19 patients is likely to be HLA-dependent. Finally, by utilising the global prevalence of HLA alleles, we provide 10 peptides with known cognate TCRs that are conserved across SARS-CoV-2 and multiple human coronaviruses and are predicted to be recognised by a high proportion of the global population. Overall, our work indicates the potential for HCoV-SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells, which is likely dependent on differences in HLA-coding genes among individuals. These findings may have important implications for COVID-19 heterogeneity and vaccine-induced immune responses as well as robustness of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","Buckley, Paul R.; Lee, Chloe H.; Pinho, Mariana Pereira; Babu, Rosana Ottakandathil; Woo, Jeongmin; Antanaviciute, Agne; Simmons, Alison; Ogg, Graham; Koohy, Hashem",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.17.452778,20

183933,Pneumonia in the elderly.,2004,"AimsThe coronavirus pandemic has led to an increased reliance on remote patient-clinician interactions, mainly the use of telephone and video consultations. Video consultations are key in psychiatric care, as telephone appointments do not sufficiently allow clinicians to accurately ascertain a patient's mental status and perform a risk assessment. The aim of our quality improvement project was to increase the uptake of video consultations within a community mental health team, focusing on substituting telephone consultations for video.MethodWe accessed Electronic Patient Records to retrospectively quantify the method of contact for 130 consultations delivered over a 4-week period. After collecting baseline data, we conducted focused interviews with 10 care providers, identifying the specific clinician and patient barriers to video uptake that informed our intervention design.Our intervention consisted of two 4-week Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles.PDSA 1 involved delivering a focused PowerPoint presentation to the care team, highlighting the benefits of video consultation technology and encouraging clinicians to use it as their primary method of remote communication with patients. Additionally, we conducted qualitative interviews with members of the team to highlight the successes and challenges thus far.PDSA 2 involved creating a video consultation instructional PDF which highlighted how to operate the technological aspects of both Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp Video Call. This included: how to set-up video calls, accept invitations, and overcome common troubleshooting issues.The proportion of remote consultations was quantified retrospectively to compare trends in video consultation uptake from baseline to the conclusion of PDSA 2.ResultOverall, we saw a 15% increase in video consultations with respect to baseline. The greatest change was attributable to PDSA cycle 1, which incurred an 8% increase in video consultation uptake, from 13.85% to 21.9%. PDSA cycle 2 further increased video consultation uptake by 6.97%, from 21.9% to 28.87%. Specifically focusing on remote consultations, the proportion conducted with video rather than telephone increased by 17.3%. Interviewed clinicians reported limited financial access, technological fluency, and issues with patient privacy as the most important barriers to the uptake of video consultations.ConclusionOur project successfully increased the proportion of consultations conducted by video. This was achieved by targeting interventions to address both patient and clinician barriers to video consultation uptake. Moreover, we understand that motivating and mobilising the care team was a key factor. Possible future work includes improving the sustainability of the interventions and assessing their efficacy in other care teams.","Kotwal, Tejas Kerushan Thomas Carlos Escudero King Gupta Avirup; en,",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.540,20

Despite the dramatically increased flow of information to shareholders and the public, this information flow has not always been meaningful or useful. Often it seems that it is not possible to see the wood for the trees. Financial scalds continue, as Wirecard, NMC Health, Patisserie Valerie, going back to Carillion (and many more) demonstrate. Financial and corporate reporting have never been so fraught with difficulties as companies fail to give guidance about the future in an increasingly uncertain world aided and abetted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This concise book argues that the changes have simply masked an increase in the use of corporate PR, impression management, bullet points, glossy images, and other simulacra which allow poor performance to be masked by misleading information presented in glib boilerplate texts, images, and tables. The tone of the narrative sections in annual reports is often misleading. Drawing on extensive research and interviews with insiders and experts, this book charts what has gone wrong with financial reporting and offers a range of solutions to improve information to both investors and the public. This provides a framework for a new era of forward-looking corporate reporting and guidance based on often conflicting multiple corporate goals. The book also examines and contrasts the latest thinking by the regularity authorities.

Most of the existing work on epidemiological models focuses on scenario-based forecasting via simulation but techniques for explicit control of epidemics via an analytical framework are largely missing. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the optimal policy for transmission control assuming SIR dynamics, which is the most widely used epidemiological paradigm. We first demonstrate that the SIR model with infectious patients and susceptible contacts (i.e., product of transmission rate and susceptible population) interpreted as predators and prey respectively reduces to a Lotka-Volterra (LV) predator-prey model. The modified SIR system (LVSIR) has a stable equilibrium point, an energy conservation property, and exhibits bounded cyclic behaviour similar to an LV system. This mapping permits a theoretical analysis of the control problem supporting some of the recent simulation-based studies that point to the benefits of periodic interventions. We use a control-Lyapunov approach to design adaptive control policies (CoSIR) to nudge the SIR model to the desired equilibrium that permits ready extensions to richer compartmental models. We also describe a practical implementation of this transmission control method by approximating the ideal control with a finite, but a time-varying set of restriction levels and provide simulation results to demonstrate its efficacy.","Maheshwari, H.; Shetty, S.; Bannur, N.; Merugu, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.10.20211995v1?rss=1,20

185941,Multiple sclerosis and viruses.,1997,"Objectives. Describe the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of SARS-CoV-2 infected children at a tertiary pediatric center in Portugal during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design. Single center, descriptive study of pediatric patients, who had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 7 to September 20, 2020. Setting. Tertiary Pediatric referral center. Patients. 18 years or younger. Main outcome measures. Incidence, mortality, age of infection, clinical characteristics, treatment prescribed and outcome. Results. A total of 300 patients were included with a median age of 5 years (IQR 1-11) and in 67% a contact was identified (co-habitant in 52.7%). 56 (18.7%) had pre-existing medical conditions. A mode of three days mediated symptom appearance to diagnose. The most common symptoms were fever (55.7%), cough (38.3%), and nasal congestion (24%). 23% of the patients were admitted due to complications related to COVID-19 and 2% required intensive care. We used drugs with antiviral activity in 9% of the patients, immunomodulatory medication with corticosteroids in 3.3%, and intravenous immunoglobulin in 1.7%. Two (0.6%) children died and 2.3% reported short-term sequelae. Conclusions. COVID-19 is usually a mild disease in children, but a small proportion of patients develop severe and critical disease. Fatal outcomes were rare overall and exclusive of severe previous medical conditions. Suspecting and diagnosing COVID-19 in children based on their symptoms without epidemiologic information and virus testing is very challenging. Our data also reflect the uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.","Milheiro Silva, T.; Garcia, A.

BACKGROUND: Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide, particularly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration. Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and, of course, as the trend continues. METHODS: We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy, Iran and South Korea individually. If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions, the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities. RESULTS: Our results for Italy showed higher death number, but the rate would be more for Iran. South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month. CONCLUSION: Given the prevailing conditions around the world and the increasing number of casualties, it is essential that all countries, especially those with fewer days of involvement, shall do their best to avoid major losses and damages.","Shojaee, Sajad; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Ashtari, Sara; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Asadzadeh-Aghdaei, Hamid; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149809/,20

BACKGROUND: Estimating the epidemiological parameters of new public health threat (COVID-19) is essential to support and inform public health decision-making in different communities including Iran. METHODS: We established a mathematical model to estimate the epidemiological parameters from 19 Feb to 15 March based on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran. Then, we estimated the effect of early traffic restriction on our estimation. RESULTS: We estimated the R0 at 2.11 (95% CI, 1.87-2.50) and the infected number at 92,260 (95% CI: 59,263 -152,212) by 15 March. Our estimate for the ascertainment rate was about 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4). The latent period estimation was 4.24 (95% CI: 2.84-6.65). We observed a decline in our estimate after considering the traffic restriction. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that health authorities in Iran must take impactful strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak to reach R0<1. Therefore, the establishment of complementary, multilateral, and cost-effective measures for the treatment of symptomatic and early diagnosis and isolation of asymptomatic cases/contacts are strongly recommended because of low ascertainment rate and large number of infected cases. We additionally recommend that traffic restriction be combined with other controlling measures.","Olfatifar, Meysam; Alali, Walid Q.; Houri, Hamidreza; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Babaee, Ebrahim; Seifollahi, Romian; Sharifian, Afsaneh; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881402/,20

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as well as to evaluate the RT-PCR crossing point (Cp) value and correlate blood test abnormalities and the Cp value with patients survival. Two hundred thirty patients with positive RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study. Molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by RT-PCR (LightMix, TibMolbiol, Germany). Clinical information, biochemical parameters and Cp values were collected in an anonymized database and variables were analyzed with SPSS v25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). No-survivors were significantly older (>65 years old) than survivors (p=0.007). A higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in patients who died than in those who survived was found (p=0.002). Statistically significant differences were obtained comparing RT-PCR Cp values for the E-gene of patients who died and those who survived, being lower (<=28) those of patients who died (p=0.004). No-survivors had significantly higher levels of CRP (>100) (p=0.007). E-gene Cp values <=28, which correlate with a high number of copies of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several demographical and biochemical parameters (Age above 65 years old, CRP levels >100 mg/L or cardiovascular comorbidities) could be useful markers of death risk in these patients.","Bellés-Bellés, Alba; Bernal, María; Gómez-Arbonés, Javier; Bernet, Albert; Picó, Silvia; Bueno, Jessica; Chávez, Carlos; García-González, Mercè; Ibarz, Mercè",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941061/,20

Additional challenges related to healthcare access, substance use, cultural characteristics, and social capital are highlighted in their relation to pulmonary health within Central Appalachia. Lastly, the review describes strategies that hold promise to reduce regional health disparities. Several healthcare and community-centered initiatives are highlighted as successful examples of collaborative efforts working towards improving pulmonary health outcomes in the region. However, significant challenges related to social, economic, and environmental factors remain.

However, no cis-replicating elements have been identified in the coding sequences of the HCV polyprotein until very recently. The existence of highly conserved and stable stem-loop structures in the RNA polymerase NS5B coding sequence, however, has been previously predicted (A. Tuplin, J. Wood, D. J. Evans, A. H. Patel, and P. Simmonds, RNA 8:824-841, 2002). We have selected for our studies a 249-nt-long RNA segment in the C-terminal NS5B coding region (NS5BCR), which is predicted to form four stable stem-loop structures (SL-IV to SL-VII). By deletion and mutational analyses of the RNA structures, we have determined that two of the stem-loops (SL-V and SL-VI) are essential for replication of the HCV subgenomic replicon in Huh-7 cells. Mutations in the loop and the top of the stem of these RNA elements abolished replicon RNA synthesis but had no effect on translation. In vitro gel shift and filter-binding assays revealed that purified NS5B specifically binds to SL-V. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by unlabeled homologous RNA, to a small extent by 3' NTR RNA, and only poorly by 5' NTR RNA. The other two stem-loops (SL-IV and SL-VII) of the NS5BCR domain were found to be important but not essential for colony formation by the subgenomic replicon.

Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which are used to model human autoimmune diabetes, are resistant to costimulation blockade-induced allograft tolerance. We tested the hypothesis that NOD mice would also be resistant to costimulation blockade-induced rat xenograft tolerance. We report that rat islet xenograft survival is short in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice treated with a tolerizing regimen of donor-specific transfusion and anti-CD154 antibody. Rat islet xenograft survival is only marginally longer in chemically diabetic NOD mice treated with costimulation blockade but is prolonged further in NOD Idd congenic mice bearing C57-derived chromosome 3 loci. Reciprocally, the presence of NOD-derived chromosome 3 loci shortens islet xenograft survival in tolerized C57BL/6 mice. Islet xenograft survival is longer in tolerized NOD.CD4a(-/-) and (NOD x C57BL/6)F1 mice than in NOD mice but still much shorter than in C57BL/6 mice. Skin xenograft survival in (NOD x C57BL/6)F1 mice treated with costimulation blockade is short, suggesting a strong genetic resistance to skin xenograft tolerance induction. We conclude that the resistance of NOD mice to xenograft tolerance induction involves some mechanisms that also participate in the expression of autoimmunity and other mechanisms that are distinct.","Gordon, Ethel J; Wicker, Linda S; Peterson, Laurence B; Serreze, David V; Markees, Thomas G; Shultz, Leonard D; Rossini, Aldo A; Greiner, Dale L; Mordes, John P",Diabetes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15616017/,20

Following the introduction of our ERAS protocol, we sought to review our ERAS experience. Our aims were to evaluate the LOS, post-operative complications, discharge analgesia, patient satisfaction and our ERAS protocol compared to the literature. METHODS This was a retrospective review of all our prospectively managed database between January 2016 and December 2016. Patient demographics, LOS, discharge analgesia and complications were collected. Patient satisfaction was determined using a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 70 patients underwent breast reconstruction using free deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEP) flaps. The mean age at surgery was 51 years (range 23-71). The mean LOS was 4.89 days (range 4-10). 61 patients (87%) were discharged within 5 days. 65 patients (93%) were discharged home on no controlled opioids. Major and minor complications were encountered in 3 patients (4%) and 5 (7%) patients respectively. There were no cases of complete or partial flap failure. 30-day patient satisfaction was high (>9/10) across all domains but patients complained of nausea & vomiting. CONCLUSION The adoption of our enhanced recovery protocol for autologous breast reconstruction has resulted in a mean LOS and opioid use reduction similar to contemporary literature. However, we have seen that there are further refinements that can be made to our ERAS protocol and there is still a need to develop a stronger evidence base to support our practices. This is in parallel with ongoing education and audit cycles to foster a culture of ERAS that can safely optimise patient outcomes.","Yim,; Lewis, C; Oates, C; Holmes,; Proussakaia, E; Wilson,",Acta chirurgiae plasticae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911937/,20

Thus, it is possible to convey in a single immunological tool the potential to protect against multiple infections, in theory all those caused by beta-glucan-expressing fungi.

The importance of laboratory biosafety was demonstrated by the occurrence of laboratory incidents in Singapore, Taiwan and Beijing. It is imperative that safe practice and techniques, safety equipment and appropriate facility design should be in place to reduce or eliminate exposure of laboratory workers, other persons and the outside environment to SARS-CoV containing materials. Discussion on laboratory containment of SARS-CoV was initiated in Hong Kong in August 2003. It was agreed that an inventory of all specimens with the potential presence of SARS-CoV collected for any diagnostic or research purposes from November 2002 to July 2003 should be established in each laboratory. They should be stored in a secure place at the appropriate biosafety level with access control. Un-needed samples collected during the period should be destroyed. These laboratories should be audited to ensure inventories are updated. The audit should include safety and security measures to detect irregularities. Any laboratory accidents involving materials suspected of containing SARS-CoV should be reported to the authorities and all personnel exposed closely followed medically. A contingency plan should be in place in the laboratory and a drill conducted regularly to test its efficacy. By January 2004, all clinical laboratories performing SARS-CoV testing in Hong Kong set up inventories to document location and types of SARS-CoV containing materials retained in their laboratory.

188780,The Tecumseh study of respiratory illness. VIII. Acute infection in chronic respiratory disease and comparison groups.,1975,"OBJECTIVE To describe a hospital outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and summarize its clinical features and therapeutic approaches. METHODS The outbreak started with a SARS patient from the community, and a total of 96 people (76 women and 20 men, mean age (29.5 +/- 10.3) years, 93.8% of whom were health care workers) who had exposure to this source patient became infected in a short time. Clinical data in this cohort were collected prospectively as they were identified. RESULTS (1) The incubation period ranged from 1 to 20 (mean: 5.9 +/- 3.5) days. The duration of hospitalization was (17.2 +/- 8.0) days. (2) The initial temperature was (38.3 +/- 0.6) degrees C, while the highest was (39.2 +/- 0.6) degrees C (P < 0.001), with fever duration of (9.0 +/- 4.2) days. (3) Other most common symptoms included fatigue (93.8%), cough (85.4%), mild sputum production (66.7%), chills (55.2%), headache (39.6%), general malaise (35.4%) and myalgia (21.9%). (4) The radiographic changes were predominantly bilateral in the middle or lower lung zones. The number of affected lung fields was 1.2 +/- 0.8 on presentation, which increased to 2.9 +/- 1.4 after admission (P < 0.001). The interval from the beginning of fever to the onset of abnormal chest radiographs was (3.5 +/- 2.3) days, which increased in size, extent, and severity to the maximum (6.7 +/- 3.5) days later. The time before the lung opacities were basically absorbed was (14.9 +/- 7.8) days. (5) Leukopenia was observed in 67.7% of this cohort. The time between the onset of fever and leukopenia was (4.4 +/- 2.3) days, with the lowest white blood cell count of (2.80 +/- 0.72) x 10(9)/L. (6) The lowest arterial oxygen saturation was (94.8 +/- 3.1)% with supplementary oxygen. (7) Antibiotical therapies included tetracyclines (91.0%), aminoglycosides (83.3%), quinolones (79.2%); 18.8% of the patients received a combination of tetracyclines and aminoglycosides, while 11.5% received a combination of tetracyclines and quinolones, and 63.5% received a combination of tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and quinolones. Vancomycin was used in 13.5% of the patients. (8) 68.8% of the patients were treated with methylprednisolones for a mean interval of (4.9 +/- 2.4) days. The initial dose was (67.3 +/- 28.2) mg/d and the maximal dose was (82.4 +/- 30.5) mg/d. (9) Human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, antiviral drugs (oral ribavirin or oseltamivir) were used respectively in 68.6%, 46.9% and 92.7% of the patients. (10) Ninety-five patients (99.0%) had a complete clinical recovery, and only 1 patient (1.0%) died. CONCLUSIONS SARS appears to be quickly infectious and potentially lethal among health care workers, characterized by acute onset and rapid progression, and mostly bilateral lung involvement on chest radiographs. Proper administration of glucocorticosteroids seems to be of some benefits. Antibiotics, human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, and antiviral drugs, although empirically, might be useful to shorten the clinical course.","Wu, Wei; Wang, Jingfeng; Liu, Pinming; Chen, Weixian; Yin, Songmei; Jiang, Shanping; Yan, Li; Zhan, Jun; Chen, Xilong; Li, Jianguo; Huang, Zitong; Huang, Hongzhang",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12877785/,20

The SARS experience has provided at least 4 enduring lessons. First, by providing a test of the capacity of each part of the public health system, from national to local and hospital responses, it has better prepared the world for the anticipated and much-feared next real pandemic. Second, SARS has reemphasized that from housing, sexual practices, and slaughtering techniques to health care capacity, the situation in other, especially developing, countries affects us. Global cooperation is necessary not only for justice but to ensure our own health. Third, despite trends toward commercialization, easier lives, and self-centered individualism, the response of health care professionals to SARS reaffirmed dedication to caring for the sick even at great personal risks as the core ethical principle of medicine. Finally, SARS also emphasized the importance of the duty of health care administrators and senior physicians to rapidly institute procedures to maximize the safety of frontline physicians and nurses.

The course of infection varies from mild to severe. The ability to control infection is limited because there are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV. Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment. The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs (tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand and all available services and resources on the other. Precise analysis and separation of individual tasks can enable the creation of a real crisis management plan.","Płusa, Tadeusz",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352944/,20

Objective of the study was to compare the Healthcare personnel (HCP) and non-HCP COVID-19 cases. This prospective observational study was carried out in National Heart Foundation Hospital and Research Institute of Bangladesh from March 08, 2020 to July 20, 2020. During this study period all admitted non-HCP who subsequently was diagnosed as COVID-19 positive by rRT-PCR and HCP of this hospital, who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms or came in close contact with COVID-19 patients at home or their workplace and become COVID-19 positive, were included. Out of 320 infected patients, 181(56.6%) patients were non-HCP and 139(43.4%) were HCP. Non-HCP were older than HCP (Mean age: 52.95±13.82 years vs. 34.08±11.11 years; p=0.001). Non-HCP were predominantly male and HCP were predominantly female (73.5% vs. 41% & 26.5% vs. 59%; p=0.001). Non-HCP had more risk factors and co-morbidities than HCP (p=0.001). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever and cough were prevalent in HCP. More aggressive treatment was required for non-HCP. Non-HCP had more severe disease and higher case fatality rate (9.4% vs. 0.7%; p=0.001) than HCP. Disease severity (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.15) and DM (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.94) were the independent predictor of mortality. Non-HCP was older in age, predominantly male and had more co-morbidities than HCP. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 were prevalent in HCP.

190669,Drug targets for rational design against emerging coronaviruses.,2013,"Like most coronaviruses, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) exhibits strong species specificity, causing natural infection only in mice. MHV-A59 virions use as a receptor a 110- to 120-kDa glycoprotein (MHVR) in the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of glycoproteins (G. S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991; and R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). The role of virus-receptor interactions in determining the species specificity of MHV-A59 was examined by comparing the binding of virus and antireceptor antibodies to cell lines and intestinal brush border membranes (BBM) from many species. Polyclonal antireceptor antiserum (anti-MHVR) raised by immunization of SJL/J mice with BALB/c BBM recognized MHVR specifically in immunoblots of BALB/c BBM but not in BBM from adult SJL/J mice that are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, indicating a major difference in epitopes between MHVR and its SJL/J homolog which does not bind MHV (7). Anti-MHVR bound to plasma membranes of MHV-susceptible murine cell lines but not to membranes of human, cat, dog, monkey, or hamster cell lines. Cell lines from these species were resistant to MHV-A59 infection, and only the murine cell lines tested were susceptible. Pretreatment of murine fibroblasts with anti-MHVR prevented binding of radiolabeled virions to murine cells and prevented virus infection. Solid-phase virus-binding assays and virus overlay protein blot assays showed that MHV-A59 virions bound to MHVR on intestinal BBM from MHV-susceptible mouse strains but not to proteins on intestinal BBM from humans, cats, dogs, pigs, cows, rabbits, rats, cotton rats, or chickens. In immunoblots of BBM from these species, both polyclonal and monoclonal antireceptor antibodies that block MHV-A59 infection of murine cells recognized only the murine CEA-related glycoprotein and not homologous CEA-related glycoproteins of other species. These results suggest that MHV-A59 binds to a mouse-specific epitope of MHVR, and they support the hypothesis that the species specificity of MHV-A59 infection may be due to the specificity of the virus-receptor interaction.","Compton, S R; Stephensen, C B; Snyder, S W; Weismiller, D G; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1279203/,20
191170,A novel coronavirus and SARS.,2003,"Over recent years, an increasing number of patients with intracranial aneurysms are treated by endovascular techniques, which have the advantage of avoiding craniotomy and retraction of cerebral parenchyma, while reducing the postoperative hospital stay. The key concept is that aneurysm is a disease of the arterial wall and that treatment must ideally only concern the vessel. The short-term efficacy of endovascular treatment has been established, especially for the prevention of early rebleeding, but its long-term efficacy has not yet been formally demonstrated due insufficient follow-up. Ideally, the management of intracranial aneurysms should be based on close collaboration between neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists and the approach (conventional surgery or endovascular) should be discussed case by case.","Weill, A; Piotin, M; Castaings, L; Moret, J",Annales de cardiologie et d'angeiologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12555355/,20

The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been shown to be localized on the apical plasma membrane of polarized respiratory epithelial cells and to mediate infection from the apical side of these cells. Here, these results were confirmed and extended by including a colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2), a lung carcinoma cell line (Calu-3) and Vero E6 cells in our analysis. All three cell types expressed human ACE2 on the apical membrane domain and were infected via this route, as determined with vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes containing the S protein of SARS-CoV. In a histological analysis of the respiratory tract, ACE2 was detected in the trachea, main bronchus and alveoli, and occasionally also in the small bronchi.

VeroE6 cells, fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were the only cells known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV. We developed a multiplex reverse transcription-PCR assay to analyze the susceptibility of cells derived from a variety of tissues and species to SARS-CoV. Additionally, productive infection was determined by titration of cellular supernatants. Cells derived from three species of monkey were susceptible to SARS-CoV. However, the levels of SARS-CoV produced differed by 4 log(10). Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) and R-Mix, a mixed monolayer of human lung-derived cells (A549) and mink lung-derived cells (Mv1Lu), are used by diagnostic laboratories to detect respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza virus); they were also infected with SARS-CoV, indicating that the practices of diagnostic laboratories should be examined to ensure appropriate biosafety precautions. Mv1Lu cells produce little SARS-CoV compared to that produced by VeroE6 cells, which indicates that they are a safer alternative for SARS-CoV diagnostics. Evaluation of cells permissive to other coronaviruses indicated that these cell types are not infected by SARS-CoV, providing additional evidence that SARS-CoV binds an alternative receptor. Analysis of human cells derived from lung, kidney, liver, and intestine led to the discovery that human cell lines were productively infected by SARS-CoV. This study identifies new cell lines that may be used for SARS-CoV diagnostics and/or basic research. Our data and other in vivo studies indicate that SARS-CoV has a wide host range, suggesting that the cellular receptor(s) utilized by SARS-CoV is highly conserved and is expressed by a variety of tissues.","Gillim-Ross, Laura; Taylor, Jill; Scholl, David R; Ridenour, Jared; Masters, Paul S; Wentworth, David E",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15243082/,20

CDRs of the acceptor chicken antibody that showed a high homology to the FRs of m3D8 were replaced with those of m3D8, resulting in the chickenized antibody (ck3D8). ck3D8 retained the biochemical properties (DNA binding, DNA hydrolysis, and cellular internalizing activities) and three-dimensional structure of m3D8 and showed reduced immunogenicity in chickens. Our study demonstrates that CDR grafting can be applied to the chickenization of a mouse antibody, probably due to the interspecies compatibility of the FRs.","Roh, Jooho; Byun, Sung June; Seo, Youngsil; KIm, Minjae; Lee, Jae-Ho; Kim, Songmi; Lee, Yuno; Lee, Keun Woo; Kim, Jin-Kyoo; Kwon, Myung-Hee",Molecular immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25458312/,20

193601,Overview of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2005,"The genomes of positive-strand RNA [+RNA] viruses perform two mutually exclusive functions: they act as mRNAs for the translation of viral proteins and as templates for viral replication. A universal key step in the replication of +RNA viruses is the coordinated transition of the RNA genome from the cellular translation machinery to the viral replication complex. While host factors are involved in this step, their nature is largely unknown. By using the ability of the higher eukaryotic +RNA virus brome mosaic virus (BMV) to replicate in yeast, we previously showed that the host Lsm1p protein is required for efficient recruitment of BMV RNA from translation to replication. Here we show that in addition to Lsm1p, all tested components of the Lsm1p-7p/Pat1p/Dhh1p decapping activator complex, which functions in deadenylation-dependent decapping of cellular mRNAs, are required for BMV RNA recruitment for RNA replication. In contrast, other proteins of the decapping machinery, such as Edc1p and Edc2p from the deadenylation-dependent decapping pathway and Upf1p, Upf2p, and Upf3p from the deadenylation-independent decapping pathway, had no significant effects. The dependence of BMV RNA recruitment on the Lsm1p-7p/Pat1p/Dhh1p complex was linked exclusively to the 3' noncoding region of the BMV RNA. Collectively, our results suggest that the Lsm1p-7p/Pat1p/Dhh1p complex that transfers cellular mRNAs from translation to degradation might act as a key regulator in the switch from BMV RNA translation to replication.","Mas, Antonio; Alves-Rodrigues, Isabel; Noueiry, Amine; Ahlquist, Paul; Díez, Juana",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16352549/,20

The prevalence of these two BEC genotypes in cattle is unknown. Although reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) primers for human NLV recognize NLV-BECs, the genetic relationships between NLV from humans and the NLV-BECs commonly circulating in cattle is undefined. In the present study, veal calf fecal samples were assayed for enteric caliciviruses by using six RT-PCR primer sets designed for the detection of human NLVs or BECs. Caliciviruses genetically related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains or to the recently characterized NB BEC strain were identified in three of four and four of four sampled veal herds, respectively. Extended 3'-terminal genome sequences of two NLV-BECs, designated CV95-OH and CV186-OH, encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; open reading frame 1 [ORF-1]), VP1 (ORF-2), and VP2 (ORF-3) genes were determined. Phylogenetic and sequence identity analyses of each genome region demonstrated these viruses to be most closely related to the NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2 strains. In initial testing, the human P289-P290 (P289/290) primer set was found to be the most sensitive for calicivirus detection. However, its failure to identify all positive fecal pools (as determined by other assays) led us to design two new primer sets, CBECU-F/R and NBU-F/R, for the sensitive and specific detection of NLV-BEC (NLV-BEC Jena and NA-2) and BEC-NB-like viruses, respectively. The RT-PCR assays with the new primers were compared against other primer sets, including P289/290. Composite results of the tests completed by using the new assays identified 72% (54 of 75) of veal calf fecal samples as positive, with 21 of 21 sequenced reaction products specific for the target RdRp gene. The same design strategy used for the new BEC assays may also be applicable to the design of similar assays for the detection of human caliciviruses (HuCVs). Our data support the genetic relationship between NLV-BECs and NLV-HuCVs but with the NLV-BECs comprising two clusters within a third NLV genogroup.","Smiley, J R; Hoet, A E; Tråvén, M; Tsunemitsu, H; Saif, L J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12843048/,20

Over 8439 SARS cases and 812 SARS-related deaths were reported to the World Health Organization from 32 countries around the world up to 5 July 2003. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV has been limited only to close contacts with patients. Attention was focused on possible transmission by the sewage system because laboratory studies showed that patients excreted coronavirus RNA in their stools in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong. To explore whether the stool of SARS patients or the sewage containing the stool of patients would transmit SARS-CoV or not, we used a style of electropositive filter media particle to concentrate the SARS-CoV from the sewage of two hospitals receiving SARS patients in Beijing, as well as cell culture, semi-nested RT-PCR and sequencing of genes to detect and identify the viruses from sewage. There was no live SARS-CoV detected in the sewage in these assays. The nucleic acid of SARS-CoV was found in the sewage before disinfection from both hospitals by PCR. After disinfection, SARS-CoV RNA could be detected from some samples from the 309th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but not from Xiao Tang Shan Hospital after disinfection. In this study, we found that the virus can survive for 14 days in sewage at 4 degrees C, 2 days at 20 degrees C, and its RNA can be detected for 8 days though the virus had been inactivated. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the RNA of SARS-CoV could be detected from the concentrates of sewage of both hospitals receiving SARS patients before disinfection and occasionally after disinfection though there was no live SARS-CoV; thus much attention should be paid to the treatment of stools of patients and the sewage of hospitals receiving SARS patients.","Wang, X W; Li, J; Guo, T; Zhen, B; Kong, Q; Yi, B; Li, Z; Song, N; Jin, M; Xiao, W; Zhu, X; Gu, C; Yin, J; Wei, W; Yao, W; Liu, C; Ou, G; Wang, M; Fang, T; Wang, G; Qiu, Y; Wu, H; Chao, F",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16312970/,20
198000,Development of human monoclonal antibodies against diseases caused by emerging and biodefense-related viruses.,2006,"PURPOSE To investigate the effects of quercetin supplementation on incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and exercise-induced changes in immune function. METHODS Trained male cyclists (N=40) were randomized to quercetin (N=20) or placebo (N=20) groups and, under double-blind procedures, received 3 wk quercetin (1000 mg.d(-1)) or placebo before, during, and for 2 wk after a 3-d period in which subjects cycled for 3 h.d(-1) at approximately 57% Wmax. Blood and saliva samples were collected before and after each of the three exercise sessions and assayed for natural killer cell activity (NKCA), PHA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation (PHA-LP), polymorphonuclear oxidative-burst activity (POBA), and salivary IgA output (sIgA). RESULTS Pre- to postexercise changes in NKCA, PHA-LP, POBA, and sIgA did not differ significantly between quercetin and placebo groups. URTI incidence during the 2-wk postexercise period differed significantly between groups (quercetin=1/20 vs placebo=9/20, Kaplan-Meier analysis statistic=8.31, P=0.004). CONCLUSION Quercetin versus placebo ingestion did not alter exercise-induced changes in several measures of immune function, but it significantly reduced URTI incidence in cyclists during the 2-wk period after intensified exercise.","Nieman, David C; Henson, Dru A; Gross, Sarah J; Jenkins, David P; Davis, J Mark; Murphy, E Angela; Carmichael, Martin D; Dumke, Charles L; Utter, Alan C; McAnulty, Steven R; McAnulty, Lisa S; Mayer, Eugene P",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17805089/,20
198490,Avian influenza: an omnipresent pandemic threat.,2005,"Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) is a causative agent associated with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) in turkeys worldwide. The disease is an acute, highly contagious enteric disease that is characterized by depression, anorexia, diarrhea, and high mortality in commercial turkey flocks. The presence of TCoV in 12 intestinal-content samples, from turkey flocks aged between 10 and 104 days and exhibiting severe enteritis, was monitored during the period of 2004 to 2006. TCoV detection was accomplished by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through amplification of the 3' UTR region, followed by amplification of genes 3 and 5. Molecular characterization of the viruses was done through amplification of genes 3 and 5 and showed evidence of genetic similarity between them, although they differed from sequences of other TCoVs described in the literature. In relation to gene 3, samples showed a greater relationship with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), while gene 5 showed greater identity with pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV). Our results suggest that the strategy of amplification of the 3' UTR region, followed by sequencing of genes 3 and 5, has proven to be an effective means of detecting TCoV in intestinal contents.","Bunger, Amarilis N D'Elboux; Chacón, Jorge Luis; Jones, Richard C; Ferreira, Antonio J Piantino",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19848072/,20
198695,[Epidemiology of respiratory viral infection in 2004-2006.].,2006,"Rapid advances are being made in the engineering of replication-competent viruses to treat cancer. Adenovirus is a mildly pathogenic human virus that propagates prolifically in epithelial cells, the origin of most human cancers. While virologists have revealed many details about its molecular interactions with the cell, applied scientists have developed powerful technologies to genetically modify or regulate every viral protein. In tandem, the limited success of nonreplicative adenoviral vectors in cancer gene therapy has brought the old concept of adenovirus oncolysis back into the spotlight. Major efforts have been directed toward achieving selective replication by the deletion of viral functions dispensable in tumor cells or by the regulation of viral genes with tumor-specific promoters. However, the predicted replication selectivity has not been realized because of incomplete knowledge of the complex virus-cell interactions and the leakiness of cellular promoters in the viral genome. Capsid modifications are being developed to achieve tumor targeting and enhance infectivity. Cellular and viral functions that confer greater oncolytic potency are also being elucidated. Ultimately, the interplay of the virus with the immune system will likely dictate the success of this approach as a cancer therapy.","Alemany, R; Balagué, C; Curiel, D T",Nature biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10888838/,20
198750,Differential expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines between nasal and small intestinal mucosae: implications for T- and sIgA+ B-lymphocyte recruitment.,2007,"AIM The present study was conducted to assess the perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission in dental professionals (DPs), that include dentists and dental auxiliary staffs, and whether rapid tests should be a recommended tool to constrain the transmission of the COVID-19, and who should be bearing their cost (governments, dentists, or patients) through an online survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS A sample size of n = 700 was recruited in the study. The study included DPs from all over the world. A randomized selection of samples was done through dental groups present on social networks. An online survey was conducted in April 2020, using the Google Form software to provide questions and collect and elaborate answers. Data were analyzed using the statistical software STATA and presented in terms of percentages. RESULTS About 78% of the study participants perceived a very high risk of COVID-19 contamination in dental settings. Nearly 80% of the study participants were willing to be subjected to rapid tests and the same could be performed on patients visiting their dental clinics, which could prevent the spread of the disease. About 55% of the participants had reported that additional costs for the rapid tests should be borne by the governments. CONCLUSION The results of the present survey report that DPs do not feel safe and perceive a high risk of COVID-19 contagion and prevention of the disease could be done by performing rapid tests on dentists, dental staff, and patients visiting the dental clinics irrespective of age and gender of the participants. SIGNIFICANCE Since all the dentists and allied staff have perceived increased risk for COVID-19 transmission, it is important that preventive measures are implemented through rapid test kits at the earliest.","Gambarini, Elisa; Galli, Massimo; Di Nardo, Dario; Miccoli, Gabriele; Patil, Shankargouda; Bhandi, Shilpa; Giovarruscio, Massimo; Testarelli, Luca; Gambarini, Gianluca",The journal of contemporary dental practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020352/,20

198968,"Predictive Analysis of the Neutralization Activity in Convalescent Plasmas From COVID-19 Recovered Patients in Zhejiang Province, China, January-March, 2020",2021,"A 28-kilodalton protein has been suggested to be the amino-terminal protein cleavage product of the putative coronavirus RNA polymerase (gene A) (M.R. Denison and S. Perlman, Virology 157:565-568, 1987). To elucidate the structure and mechanism of synthesis of this protein, the nucleotide sequence of the 5' 2.0 kilobases of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM genome was determined. This sequence contains a single, long open reading frame and predicts a highly basic amino-terminal region. Cell-free translation of RNAs transcribed in vitro from DNAs containing gene A sequences in pT7 vectors yielded proteins initiated from the 5'-most optimal initiation codon at position 215 from the 5' end of the genome. The sequence preceding this initiation codon predicts the presence of a stable hairpin loop structure. The presence of an RNA secondary structure at the 5' end of the RNA genome is supported by the observation that gene A sequences were more efficiently translated in vitro when upstream noncoding sequences were removed. By comparing the translation products of virion genomic RNA and in vitro transcribed RNAs, we established that our clones encompassing the 5'-end mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA encode the 28-kilodalton N-terminal cleavage product of the gene A protein. Possible cleavage sites for this protein are proposed.","Soe, L H; Shieh, C K; Baker, S C; Chang, M F; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2824826/,20

203762,Influence of Hypoxia on the Epithelial-Pathogen Interactions in the Lung: Implications for Respiratory Disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: Milder symptoms were observed in children with COVID-19. However, whether this also holds true for neonates is not known. METHODS: The clinical data of a total of 3213 patients aged 2 years or below, including 749 neonates, in Brazil nationwide were studied. Comparisons were made between neonate and infant patients by conducting statistical tests. RESULTS: Neonates appeared to bear more severe clinical courses. In addition to higher case fatality rates, newborns with COVID-19 had much shorter time from symptom onset to death and longer time from symptom onset to discharge. Dyspnoea, sore throat and cough were more prominent in neonate patients, suggestive of both upper and lower respiratory tract infection, as opposed to upper respiratory tract symptoms mostly observed in children. CONCLUSION: Findings suggested that trained immunity provides a possible explanation because the innate immune system in newborns is not ""well-trained"" while that in adult tends to hyperactive.","Leung, Char",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,20
207575,Infectious Diseases and Patient Care Practices,2020,"Background: Children and adolescents are affected in various ways by the lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in this age-group. Objective: The objective was to investigate and compare the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in three age groups (1–6 years, 7–10 years, 11–19 years) and to examine the associations with psychological factors. Methods: An anonymous online survey was conducted from 9 April to 11 May 2020 during the acute phase of major lockdown measures. In this cross-sectional study, children and adolescents aged between 1 and 19 years were recruited as a population-based sample. They were eligible if they were residents in Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, were parents/caregivers of a child aged between 1 and 10 years or adolescents ≥11 years, had sufficient German language skills and provided informed consent. Results: Among 5823 participants, between 2.2% and 9.9% reported emotional and behavioural problems above the clinical cut-off and between 15.3% and 43.0% reported an increase in these problems during the pandemic. Significant age-related effects were found regarding the type and frequency of problems (χ2(4)≥50.2, P ≤ 0.001). While preschoolers (1–6 years) had the largest increase in oppositional-defiant behaviours, adolescents reported the largest increase in emotional problems. Adolescents experienced a significantly larger decrease in emotional and behavioural problems than both preschoolers and school-children. Sociodemographic variables, exposure to and appraisal of COVID-19, psychotherapy before COVID-19 and parental mental health significantly predicted change in problem-scores (F ≥ 3.69, P ≤ 0.001). Conclusion: A substantial proportion of children and adolescents experience age-related mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. These problems should be monitored, and support should be offered to risk-groups to improve communication, emotion regulation and appraisal style. © 2021 The Author(s).

A diagnosis of Guillain Barré syndrome was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroneurography (ENG). In all of them therapeutic approach included the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 gr/kg for 5 days), which resulted in the improvement of neurological symptoms. Clinical neurophysiology revealed the presence of conduction block, absence of F waves, and in two cases significant decrease in amplitude of compound motor action potential cMAP. Due to the potential role of inflammation on symptoms development and prognosis, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8) levels were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during the acute phase, while only serum was tested after recovery. Both IL-6 and IL-8 were found increased during the acute phase, both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, whereas four months after admission (at complete recovery), only IL-8 remained elevated in serum. These results confirm the inflammatory response that might be linked to peripheral nervous system complications, and encourage the use of IL-6 and IL-8 as prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19.

Herein, we report a case of POT that occurred in the right maxilla of a 10-year-old boy and reveal unique features in comparison with those previously reported. Radiologically, the lesion presented as a well-defined, unilocular radiolucency with notable radiopaque foci on the periphery. Microscopically, the tumor was mainly composed of dental papilla-like myxoid fibrous connective tissue, largely surrounded by non-keratinized squamous epithelium with numerous calcified particles, and partly enclosed by inner enamel epithelium-like columnar cells and enamel organ-like structures accompanied with cuboidal and/or stellate reticulum-like cells. Immunohistochemically, the epithelium tested positive for cytokeratin 14 and 19. Moreover, amelogenin and ameloblastin, matrix proteins relating to enamel formation, were positive in the covering epithelium. The tumor was enucleated as a whole, and no recurrence was recorded thereafter. Although the presence of numerous calcified particles was unique, we diagnosed this lesion as POT based on the above-described features. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the differential diagnosis of POT and other odontogenic tumors that resemble corresponding tooth germ components.","Kayamori, Kou; Tsuchiya, Maiko; Michi, Yasuyuki; Kuribayashi, Ami; Mikami, Toshinari; Sakamoto, Kei; Yoda, Tetsuya; Ikeda, Tohru",Pathol. int,,20

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The modified online OSCE comprising of eight question entities was organised simultaneously in all four dental institutes of Finland using the Moodle virtual learning environment. All fourth-year students (n = 179) attended the examination online at home. Student feedback was collected via an anonymous questionnaire with multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions concerning attitudes towards the modified online OSCE, as well as content and usability of the question entities in the examination. Means and standard deviations were calculated for multiple-choice questions. Content analysis was used for open-ended questions. RESULTS: Of 179 students, 119 (66%) consented to the study. Students experienced they had received adequate information (mean 3.8; SD 1.2), had a positive attitude before the examination (4.0; 1.0) and found the practice test useful (3.7; 1.1) (range 1-5). Technical implementation (2.7; 0.7) and the difficulty of the questions (2.9; 0.6) (range 1-4) were found to be good. The teaching students received during their studies was sufficient (3.2; 0.5) (range 1-4). Content (mean 3.2; 0.4) and usability (2.9; 0.4) of the question entities were good (range 1-4). The themes arising from open-ended questions were importance and practicality of the topic (in questions) in relation to the work of a dentist and gratitude for the rapid conversion of the OSCE into an online examination despite COVID-19. The themes arising from negative experiences included difficulties in completing the examination within the time allocated, and dissatisfaction with the model answers provided after the examination.

218579,Tax or Subsidy on Interregional Travel with Infectious Diseases (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: The effects of chronic inhaled and systemic corticosteroids use on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are unclear. Since many patients with chronic pulmonary diseases rely on corticosteroids to control disease, it is important to understand the risks of their use during the pandemic. We aim to study if the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids affects the likelihood of developing COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We used the National Jewish Health electronic medical record research database to identify a cohort of all subjects who were tested for suspected COVID-19 between March 11 - June 23, 2020. Testing results, medication use, and comorbidities were obtained from the medical record. Following a comparison of different propensity score weighting methods, overlap propensity score weighting was used to analyze the association between medication use and COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 928 patients, of which 12% tested positive. The majority (66%) of patients had a history of chronic pulmonary diseases. There was no significant association between inhaled corticosteroid use and testing positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, systemic corticosteroid use was associated with a lower odds ratio (0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99) of testing positive for COVID-19. Similar results were noted when the analysis was restricted to those with any chronic pulmonary diseases, with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the recommendation that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma and COPD who require treatment with either inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, should continue their use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liao, Shu-Yi; Petrache, Irina; Fingerlin, Tasha E; Maier, Lisa A",Respir Med,,20

Unlike activity data, our observation-based analysis deploys independent measurement of pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere to correct misrepresentation in the bottom-up data and can provide more detailed insights into spatially explicit changes. Specifically, we use TROPOMI observations of NO2 to deduce 10-day moving averages of NO x and CO2 emissions over China, differentiating emissions by sector and province. Between January and April 2020, China's CO2 emissions fell by 11.5% compared to the same period in 2019, but emissions have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels before the coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of January 2020 owing to the fast economic recovery in provinces where industrial activity is concentrated.","Zheng, Bo; Geng, Guannan; Ciais, Philippe; Davis, Steven J; Martin, Randall V; Meng, Jun; Wu, Nana; Chevallier, Frederic; Broquet, Gregoire; Boersma, Folkert; van der A, Ronald; Lin, Jintai; Guan, Dabo; Lei, Yu; He, Kebin; Zhang, Qiang",Sci.

One area of particular focus is the effect that this illness may have on pregnancy and maternal-fetal disease. As of April 24, 2020, we identified 55 English language reports in the scientific literature summarizing data for 339 women and 258 fetuses and neonates. The majority of these data have focused on maternal-fetal transmission and neonatal outcomes. One systematic review and meta-analysis including the spectrum of coronaviruses [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19] in pregnancy noted increased rates of adverse outcomes associated with this group of infections. Here, we report the case of a COVID-19 positive woman presenting to our emergency department (ED) at 34 weeks gestation with preeclampsia.

It has saved millions of lives and prevented disease worldwide and millions more have been spared the permanent disabilities caused by diseases such as polio and the long-term morbidity caused by other diseases such as measles. Despite the compelling evidence of the public health and economic value of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy has become a growing concern globally. By calling into question the safety and efficacy of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy threatens the progress made in combating morbidity and mortality including efforts to introduce COVID-19 vaccines. This paper a) examines key factors that drive limited demand for vaccines and vaccine hesitancy, (b) highlights the role of demand promotion for immunization and of risk communication and community engagement to address those challenges, (c) discusses vaccine demand and hesitancy in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and (d) makes recommendations for public health policy and programming for the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine and beyond.Recommendations include strengthen social listening and digital engagement to address the concerns of caregivers and healthcare professionals, improve the availability and use of social data for evidence-based programming, reinforce public trust in health institutions and service providers, mainstream demand for immunization, strengthen the communication competencies of health service providers, test and apply solutions based on behavioral insights to reinforce demand, engage regularly with local governments and local actors, and strengthen resilience and response capacities for diseases outbreaks and public health emergencies.","Obregon, Rafael; Mosquera, Mario; Tomsa, Sergiu; Chitnis, Ketan",J Health Commun,,20

230550,Functional exhaustion of antiviral lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Validation of a non-invasive smart-phone based screening tool for atherosclerosis and coronary arterial disease (CAD), which is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. METHODS: We designed a three-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) device that connects to a smart phone application for measuring pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) using PPG probes that are simultaneously clipped onto to the ear, index finger, and big toe, respectively. Validation was performed through a clinical study with 100 participants (age 20 to 77) at a research hospital in Nagpur, India. Study subjects were stratified by age and divided into three groups corresponding to the disease severity: Coronary Arterial Disease (""CAD""), hypertensive (""Pre-CAD""), and Healthy. MAIN RESULTS: PWV values derived from the Ear-Toe measurements increased monotonically as a function of disease severity and age, with median values of 14.2 m/s for the older-patient CAD group, 12.2 m/s for the younger-patient CAD group, 11.6 m/s for the older-patient Pre-CAD group, 10.2 m/s for the younger-patient Pre-CAD group, 9.7 m/s for the older healthy controls, and 8.4 m/s for the younger healthy controls. Using just two simple features, the PTT and patient height, we demonstrate a machine learning prediction model for CAD with a median accuracy of 0.83 (AUC). SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates the ability to predict atherosclerosis and CAD using a simple low-cost multi-site PPG tool that is powered by a mobile phone and does not require any electrocardiogram (ECG) reference. Furthermore, this method only requires a single anthropometric measurement, which is the patient's height.","Ouyang, Victoria; Ma, Botong; Pignatelli, Niccolo; Sengupta, Shantanu; Sengupta, Partho; Mungulmare, Kunda; Fletcher, Richard Ribón",Physiol. meas,,20

232359,Literature analysis on efficacy and safety of chloroquine phosphate in infectious diseases,2020,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine is one of several agents being evaluated in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to examine whether patients with rheumatological conditions receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy are at less risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not receiving hydroxychloroquine. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included de-identified information of all veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration clinical administrative database aged 18 years or older with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or associated rheumatological conditions (based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, diagnostic codes) who were alive on March 1, 2020. A propensity score was calculated for each patient, and each patient who was receiving hydroxychloroquine was matched to two patients who were not receiving hydroxychloroquine (controls). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among those receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine versus the propensity-matched patients not receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; intensive care requirement associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and overall rates of any hospital admission and mortality (ie, all cause). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent variables for the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings: Between March 1 and June 30, 2020, 10â703 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 21â406 patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine were included in the primary analysis. The incidence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period did not differ between patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine (31 [0·3%] of 10â703 vs 78 [0·4%] of 21â406; odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·52-1·20, p=0·27). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups in patients who developed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. For all patients in the study, overall mortality was lower in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the group of patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 0·70, 95% CI 0·55-0·89, p=0·0031). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, receipt of hydroxychloroquine was not associated with the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·51-1·42). Interpretation: Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a preventive effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large group of patients with rheumatological conditions.

235613,On the motion of an evaporating respiratory droplet,2021-05-19,"Background: To contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, public life was reduced through contact restriction measures (referred to as ""lockdown"" in the further course for reading simplicity), among other things to make health system resources available for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In parallel, a decrease in emergency patients was observed in the public health system. Methods: For two 10-week periods before and during the lockdown, ambulance service deployment rates were analysed in 6 ambulance service areas for 6 tracer diagnoses. Random effects were minimised by comparing the results with the corresponding 2018 and 2019 time periods and a calculated expected value. Results: For emergency ambulance service calls, there was a reduction in call numbers (-16%) during the lockdown. A 20% reduction for the categories cardiac and cerebral ischaemia was found. In the urban area, the reduction in cardiac ischaemia was less pronounced at 14% than in the surrounding area at 23%. The deployment figures for intoxications decreased by 27% and for psychiatric emergencies by 16%. Conclusion: The public ambulance service was not overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic; there was a decrease in depolyments during the lockdown. For the reduction in cerebral or cardiac ischaemias, the explanatory models for the influence of the lockdown are missing. Further studies on the utilisation behaviour of the ambulance service during a lockdown appear necessary in order to detect potentially fatal reductions in utilisation for the patient outcome and to be able to counteract them through education.","Naujoks, Frank; Schweigkofler, Uwe; Lenz, Wolfgang; Blau, Jörg; Brune, Ingo; Lischke, Volker; Adler, Holger; Schindelin, Ina; Rouchi, Hasti; Chobotsky, Holger; Gottschalk, René",Notf Rett Med,,20
236422,Mesenchymal stem cells and exosome therapy for COVID-19: current status and future perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cohorts of severely ill patients with COVID-19 have been described in several countries around the globe, but to date there have been few published reports from the United Kingdom (UK). Understanding the characteristics of the affected population admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in the UK is crucial to inform clinical decision making, research and planning for future waves of infection. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to a large UK ICU from March to May 2020 with follow-up to June 2020. Data were collected from health records using a standardised template. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyse the factors associated with ICU survival. RESULTS: Of the 156 patients included, 112 (72%) were male, 89 (57%) were overweight or obese, 68 (44%) were from ethnic minorities, and 89 (57%) were aged over 60 years of age. 136 (87%) received mechanical ventilation, 77 (57% of those intubated) were placed in the prone position and 95 (70% of those intubated) received neuromuscular blockade. 154 (99%) patients required cardiovascular support and 44 (28%) required renal replacement therapy. Of the 130 patients with completed ICU episodes, 38 (29%) died and 92 (71%) were discharged alive from ICU. In multivariable models, age (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.07-1.21]), obesity (OR 3.06 [95% CI 1.16-8.74]), lowest P/F ratio on the first day of admission (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.67-0.98]) and PaCO2 (OR 1.52 [95% CI 1.01-2.39]) were independently associated with ICU death. CONCLUSIONS: Age, obesity and severity of respiratory failure were key determinants of survival in this cohort. Multiorgan failure was prevalent. These findings are important for guiding future research and should be taken into consideration during future healthcare planning in the UK.","Thomson, Ross J; Hunter, Jennifer; Dutton, Jonathan; Schneider, James; Khosravi, Maryam; Casement, Alisha; Dhadwal, Kulwant; Martin, Daniel",PLoS One,,20
236858,2021 American Society for Microbiology Awards Program: Clinical Microbiology Honorees,2021,"The contributions of asymptomatic infections to herd immunity and community transmission are key to the resurgence and control of COVID-19, but are difficult to estimate using current models that ignore changes in testing capacity. Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13 to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with presymptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates as symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection subpopulations have reproductive numbers lower than three. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss. Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) should be reconsidered.","Subramanian, Rahul; He, Qixin; Pascual, Mercedes",Proc.

However, they lack inherent target specificity and can be sensitive to temperature variations and other noise sources. In this letter, we introduce a concept of the High Contrast Probe Cleavage Detection (HCPCD) mechanism, which makes use of the dramatic optical signal amplification caused by cleavage of large numbers of high-contrast nanoparticle labels instead of the adsorption of low-index biological molecules. We illustrate numerically the HCPCD detection mechanism with an example of a silicon ring resonator as an optical transducer with gold and silicon nanoparticles as high-contrast labels. Simulations show that it is possible to detect a single cleavage-event by monitoring spectral shifts of micro-ring resonances. Furthermore, detection specificity and signal amplification can be achieved through the use of collateral nucleic acid cleavage caused by enzymes such as CAS12a and CAS13 after binding to a target DNA/RNA sequence.","Dubrovsky, Michael; Blevins, Morgan; Boriskina, Svetlana V.; Inc., Diedrik Vermeulen SiPhox; Cambridge,; MA,; USA,; Technology, Massachusetts Institute of",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00874v1.pdf,20

METHODS: We collected serial nasopharyngeal specimens at various time points from 109 individuals with rRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in Utah and Wisconsin. We calculated probability of viral RNA shedding resolution using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and evaluated characteristics associated with shedding resolution using Cox proportional hazards regression. We attempted viral culture for 35 rRT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal specimens collected &#8805;10 days after symptom onset. RESULTS: The likelihood of viral RNA shedding resolution at 10 days after symptom onset was approximately 3%. Time to shedding resolution was shorter among participants aged <18 years (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR]: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.6-5.6) and longer among those aged &#8805;50 years (aHR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) compared to participants aged 18-49 years. No replication-competent viruses were recovered.

Beyond the Hippocratic notion of doing no harm, nephrologists also have duties to respect their patients' autonomy and dignity, to meet their patients' care goals in the least invasive way, to act impartially, and, ultimately, to do what is (clinically) beneficial for their patients. Juggling these often-conflicting duties can be challenging at the best of times, but can prove especially difficult when patients are not fully adherent to treatment. When a patient's nonadherence begins to cause harm to themselves and/or others, it may be questioned whether discontinuation of care is appropriate. We discuss how nephrologists can meet their ethical duties when faced with nonadherence in patients undergoing hemodialysis, including episodic extreme agitation, poor renal diet, missed hemodialysis sessions, and emergency presentations brought on by nonadherence. Furthermore, we consider the impact of cognitive impairment and provider-family conflict when making care decisions in a nonadherence context, as well as how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic might affect responses to nonadherence.

We perform multiomics experiments using recently developed technology to identify the features of HIV-1-infected cells. Genome-wide HIV-1 integration-site analysis reveals that productive HIV-1 infection tends to occur in cells with viral integration into transcriptionally active genomic regions. Bulk transcriptome analysis reveals that a high level of viral mRNA is transcribed in HIV-1-infected cells. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis shows the heterogeneity of HIV-1-infected cells, including CXCL13high cells and a subpopulation with low expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which can contribute to efficient viral spread in vivo. Our findings describe multiple characteristics of HIV-1-producing cells in vivo, which could provide clues for the development of an HIV-1 cure.","Aso, Hirofumi; Nagaoka, Shumpei; Kawakami, Eiryo; Ito, Jumpei; Islam, Saiful; Tan, Benjy Jek Yang; Nakaoka, Shinji; Ashizaki, Koichi; Shiroguchi, Katsuyuki; Suzuki, Yutaka; Satou, Yorifumi; Koyanagi, Yoshio; Sato, Kei",Cell Rep,,20

258451,Respiratory syncytial virus and palivizumab prophylaxis in the COVID-19 era,2021,"Wastewater-based epidemiology has potential as an early-warning tool for determining the presence of COVID-19 in a community. The University of Arizona (UArizona) utilized WBE paired with clinical testing as a surveillance tool to monitor the UArizona community for SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time, as students re-entered campus in the fall. Positive detection of virus RNA in wastewater lead to selected clinical testing, identification, and isolation of three infected individuals (one symptomatic and two asymptomatic) that averted potential disease transmission. This case study demonstrated the value of WBE as a tool to efficiently utilize resources for COVID-19 prevention and response. Thus, WBE coupled with targeted clinical testing was further conducted on 13 dorms during the course of the Fall semester (Table 3). In total, 91 wastewater samples resulted in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that successfully provided an early-warning for at least a single new reported case of infection (positive clinical test) among the residents living in the dorm. Overall, WBE proved to be an accurate diagnostic for new cases of COVID-19 with an 82.0% positive predictive value and an 88.9% negative predictive value. Increases in positive wastewater samples and clinical tests were noted following holiday-related activities. However, shelter-in-place policies proved to be effective in reducing the number of daily reported positive wastewater and clinical tests. This case study provides evidence for WBE paired with clinical testing and public health interventions to effectively contain potential outbreaks of COVID-19 in defined communities.","Betancourt, Walter Q; Schmitz, Bradley W; Innes, Gabriel K; Prasek, Sarah M; Pogreba Brown, Kristen M; Stark, Erika R; Foster, Aidan R; Sprissler, Ryan S; Harris, David T; Sherchan, Samendra P; Gerba, Charles P; Pepper, Ian L",Sci Total Environ,,20

262333,Assessment of the Diagnostic Ability of Four Detection Methods Using Three Sample Types of COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has required measures to contain the contagion, including social isolation. However, this and other factors have caused mental health problems, both in patients and health professionals and in family members or asymptomatic population. Religious support can be an ally for this type of confrontation. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, spiritual/religious care has been restricted and insufficient. When accessible to patients and frontline professionals, they are offered by virtual means, almost always by recorded media and made available in bulk. This essay argues, based on references in the areas of psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, biosafety, and military, that the face-to-face and personalized relationship between religious leaders, patients, health professionals, family members, and faith communities is as essential as possible for the dignified treatment victims, referral to spiritual needs and resilience of society, in addition to contributing to the improvement of the immune response of all. Practical examples are cited in the areas of military chaplaincy and hospital civilian chaplaincy. The essay also proposes the adoption of protocols already published by WHO and other safety measures such as the use of robotics and the recruitment/training of mass chaplains. In addition to contributing to the improvement of COVID-19 pandemic coping processes, the study also contributes to improving the delivery of spiritual/religious care as an ally to physical and mental, individual, and collective health.","Dutra, Cláunei C D; Rocha, Henrique S",J Relig Health,,20

The aim of this study was to describe the infective and immune status of professional football players, team staff and league officials over a truncated football season resumed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates and to investigate the clinical symptoms related to COVID-19 infection in professional football players. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 1337 football players, staff and officials during a truncated football season (9 weeks) with a tailored infection control programme based on preventive measures and regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing (every 3-5 days) combined with serology testing for immunity (every 4 weeks). Clinical symptoms in positive participants were recorded using a 26-item, Likert-Scale-based scoring system. RESULTS: During the study period, 85 subjects returned positive (cycle threshold (cT) &#8804;30) or reactive (30<cT<40) PCR tests, of which 36 were players. The infection rate was consistent with that of the general population during the same time period. More than half of infected subjects were asymptomatic, and the remaining had only mild symptoms with no one requiring hospitalisation. Symptom severity was associated with lower cT values. Social contacts and family were the most common sources of infection, and no infection could be traced to training or matches. Of the 36 infected players, 15 presented positive serology during the study period.

Recent studies have shown that TMPRSS2 expressed on cell surface of host cells could play a crucial role in activation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein which facilitates the rapid early entry of the virus into host cells. In addition, direct suppression of TMPRSS2 using small drug inhibitors has been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, which presents TMPRSS2 protease as a potential therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be capable of infecting gastrointestinal enterocytes and to provoke gastrointestinal disorders in patients with COVID-19 disease, which is considered as a new transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight the biochemical properties of TMPRSS2 protease and discuss the potential targeting of TMPRSS2 by inhibitors to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 spreading through gastro-intestinal tract system as well as the hurdles that need to be overcome.","Mahmoud, Ismail Sami; Jarrar, Yazun Bashir",Mol Biol Rep,,20

Italy has been the most affected country in the world, right after China. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were among the hardest hit by this event from both a working and psychological point of view. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian Occupational Physicians' well-being and psychological distress, in relation to demographic and occupational characteristic, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey questionnaire from April 1 to April 21st, 2020. To evaluate the level of psychological distress and the level of well-being, the general Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the WHO-5 Wellbeing Index were utilized. Since the statistical assumptions were respected, we proceeded with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to ascertain the differences between the averages of the scores of the GHQ-12. Doctors who live in the most affected regions have a prevalence of psychological distress higher than their colleagues from the rest of Italy. ANOVA shows significant differences relating to the female gender, and to the life changes provoked by the lockdown for example not feeling sheltered at home or suffering from loneliness. This study showed a high prevalence of psychological distress in occupational physicians. To prevent the occurrence of mental disorders among Occupational Physicians, it is urgent to put in place policies of psychological support and well-being preservation.","De Sio, Simone; La Torre, Giuseppe; Buomprisco, Giuseppe; Lapteva, Ekaterina; Perri, Roberto; Corbosiero, Paola; Ferraro, Pietro; Giovannetti, Arianna; Greco, Emilio; Cedrone, Fabrizio",PLoS One,,20

Objective: To identify and quantify the association of race/ethnicity-based, sex-based, and income-based inequities of state-specific lockdowns with 6 well-being dimensions in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pooled, repeated cross-sectional study used data from 14â¯187â¯762 households who participated in phase 1 of the population-representative US 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Households were invited to participate by email, text message, and/or telephone as many as 3 times. Data were collected via an online questionnaire from April 23 to July 21, 2020, and participants lived in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Exposures: Indicators of race/ethnicity, sex, and income and their intersections. Main Outcomes and Measures: Unemployment; food insufficiency; mental health problems; no medical care received for health problems; default on last month's rent or mortgage; and class cancellations with no distance learning. Race/ethnicity, sex, income, and their intersections were used to measure distributional implications across historically marginalized populations; state-specific, time-varying population mobility was used to measure lockdown intensity. Logistic regression models with pooled repeated cross-sections were used to estimate risk of dichotomous outcomes by social group, adjusted for confounding variables. Results: The 1â¯088â¯314 respondents (561â¯570 [51.6%; 95% CI, 51.4%-51.9%] women) were aged 18 to 88 years (mean [SD], 51.55 [15.74] years), and 826â¯039 (62.8%; 95% CI, 62.5%-63.1%) were non-Hispanic White individuals; 86â¯958 (12.5%; 95% CI, 12.4%-12.7%), African American individuals; 86â¯062 (15.2%; 95% CI, 15.0%-15.4%), Hispanic individuals; and 50â¯227 (5.6%; 95% CI, 5.5%-5.7%), Asian individuals. On average, every 10% reduction in mobility was associated with higher odds of unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4), food insufficiency (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2), mental health problems (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1), and class cancellations (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2). Across most dimensions compared with White men with high income, African American individuals with low income experienced the highest risks (eg, food insufficiency, men: OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.8-3.7; mental health problems, women: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.8-2.1; medical care inaccessibility, women: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.9; unemployment, men: OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.2; rent/mortgage defaults, men: OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 4.7-7.1). Other high-risk groups were Hispanic individuals (eg, unemployment, Hispanic men with low income: OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.5-3.4) and women with low income across all races/ethnicities (eg, medical care inaccessibility, non-Hispanic White women: OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-2.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, African American and Hispanic individuals, women, and households with low income had higher odds of experiencing adverse outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders. Blanket public health policies ignoring existing distributions of risk to well-being may be associated with increased race/ethnicity-based, sex-based, and income-based inequities.","Chakrabarti, Suman; Hamlet, Leigh C; Kaminsky, Jessica; Subramanian, S V",JAMA Netw Open,,20

303903,The emotional toll of global infectious diseases,2020,"BACKGROUND: : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging and rapidly evolving disease, with no recommended effective anti-coronavirus treatments. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China, and the most used one is Lianhuaqingwen (LH). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LH combined with usual treatment vs usual treatment alone in treating mild or moderate COVID-19 by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: : We systematically searched the Medline (OVID), Embase, the Cochrane Library, and 4 Chinese databases from inception to July 2020 to include the RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of LH in combination with usual treatment vs usual treatment for mild or moderate COVID-19. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: : A total of 5 RCTs with 824 individuals with mild or moderate COVID 19 were included. Compared with the usual treatment alone, LH in combination with usual treatment significantly improved the overall clinical efficacy (RRâ=â2.39, 95% CI 1.61-3.55), increased the rate of recovery of chest computed tomographic manifestations (RRâ=â1.80, 95% CI 1.08-3.01), reduced the rate of conversion to severe cases (RRâ=â0.47, 95% CI 0.29-0.74), shorten the duration of fever (MDâ=â-1.00, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.84). Moreover, LH in combination with usual treatment did not increase the occurrence of the adverse event compared to usual treatment alone. CONCLUSION: : Our meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that LH in combination with usual treatment may improve the clinical efficacy in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 without increasing adverse events. However, given the limitations and poor quality of included trials in this study, further large-sample RCTs or high-quality real-world studies are needed to confirm our conclusions.","Fan, Zheng; Guo, Guiming; Che, Xiaoping; Yang, Ying; Liu, Yang; Li, Luyang; Chang, Xinyu; Han, Lijuan; Cai, Xiaorong; Tang, Huilin",Medicine (Baltimore),,20

However, there is no comprehensive study reported about the currents status of stroke-related apps available to adopt in Chinese app market. The aim of this study is to assess the current status of stroke-related apps available to adopt in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Stroke-related keywords written in either Chinese or English, the top 6 most prevalent apps online stores in China were searched from June to August 2018, including android market, 360 app market, wan dou jia, baidu mobile app, ying yong bao, apple app store. The basic features of selected apps were analyzed based on operating system, cost, target people, engagement, online interaction, release date, size, popularity, and usefulness. The information accountability of selected apps was evaluated with the Silberg scale. The functionality of selected apps targeting stroke patients at home were reviewed by researchers. RESULTS: Our study showed that the downloads of stroke-related apps from android platform and the engagement of health professionals in apps development were critically insufficient. And most apps didn't offer a platform to facilitate online interaction with health professional. The information accountability of apps also presented a huge room for improvement. The average Silberg score of 127 apps was 3.5 (out of 9) with most apps not disclosing sponsorship, authors' affiliations, credentials, and sources or references of information. Few apps were modified in the past months. What's more, although the apps targeting stroke patients at home have covered 9 functionalities, most apps had only a simple functionality. CONCLUSION: This study identified areas for improvement concerning information accountability of stroke-related apps available for adoption in China and reviewed functionality of apps targeting stroke patients at home. The findings might guide the development for stroke-related apps in China in the future.","Zhang, Huixia; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Zhenxiang; Lin, Beilei; Mei, Yongxia; Zhang, Yongchao; Chen, Gang",Medicine (Baltimore),,20

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses are limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), were used. Descriptive single factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring the related influencing factors. RESULTS: The SOS (39.91 ± 12.92) and SAS (32.19 ± 7.56) scores of this nurse group were positively correlated (r = 0.676, p < .05). Multiple regression analysis showed that only children, working hours per week and anxiety were the main factors affecting nurse stress (p = .000, .048, .000, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses who fight against COVID-19 were generally under pressure. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse leaders should pay attention to the work stress and the influencing factors of the nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection, and offer solutions to retain mental health among these nurses.","Mo, Yuanyuan; Deng, Lan; Zhang, Liyan; Lang, Qiuyan; Liao, Chunyan; Wang, Nannan; Qin, Mingqin; Huang, Huiqiao",J Nurs Manag,,20

We found that during rhythmic whisker movement, 54 of 115 active neurons (47%) represented self-motion. This population was significantly more modulated by whisker angle than by phase. Upon active touch, a distinct pattern of activity was evoked across L5, which represented the whisker angle at the time of touch. Object location was decodable with submillimeter precision from the touch-evoked spike counts of a randomly sampled handful of these neurons. These representations of whisker angle during self-motion and touch were independent, both in the selection of which neurons were active and in the angle-tuning preference of coactive neurons. Thus, the output of S1 transiently shifts from a representation of self-motion to an independent representation of explored object location during active touch.","Cheung, Jonathan Andrew; Maire, Phillip; Kim, Jinho; Lee, Kiana; Flynn, Garrett; Hires, Samuel Andrew",PLoS Biol,,20
315896,CDCP1 on Dendritic Cells Contributes to the Development of a Model of Kawasaki Disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: Moderate to severe anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social phobia and panic disorder are common, and affect approximately 11-16% of women in pregnancy. Psychological treatments for anxiety disorders, primarily cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), have a substantial evidence base and recently time-intensive versions have been found as effective as weekly treatments. However, this has not been trialled in women who are pregnant, where a shorter intervention may be desirable. METHODS: The ADEPT study is a feasibility randomised controlled trial with two parallel intervention groups. Time-intensive one-to-one CBT and standard weekly one-to-one CBT delivered during pregnancy will be compared. Feasibility outcomes including participation and follow-up rates will be assessed, alongside the acceptability of the interventions using qualitative methods. DISCUSSION: The study will provide preliminary data to inform the design of a full-scale randomised controlled trial of a time-intensive intervention for anxiety during pregnancy. This will include information on the acceptability of time-intensive interventions for pregnant women with anxiety disorders.

This research is based on empiricaland analytical data from WHO, Bloomberg's financial information provider. During the research, the following methods have been used: statistical, system-structural analysis, content-analysis, comparison, grouping and forecasting.CONCLUSIONConclusions: Under the conditions of pandemic, attention should be paid to strengthening both administrative and criminal liability for violating quarantine, which will serve as a prerequisite for improving the legal mechanism of combating threats to the country's demographic security. The protection of the right to health requires the state to create conditions to prevent the risk of occupational diseases among health care workers and others involved in the response to COVID-19.","Omelchuk, Oleh M.; Shevchuk, Inna V.; Danilova, Anna V.","Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",,20
316632,Research in brief,2021,"Social distancing as a form of nonpharmaceutical intervention has been enacted in many countries as a form of mitigating the spread of COVID-19. There has been a large interest in mathematical modeling to aid in the prediction of both the total infected population and virus-related deaths, as well as to aid government agencies in decision making. As the virus continues to spread, there are both economic and sociological incentives to minimize time spent with strict distancing mandates enforced, and/or to adopt periodically relaxed distancing protocols, which allow for scheduled economic activity. The main objective of this study is to reduce the disease burden in a population, here measured as the peak of the infected population, while simultaneously minimizing the length of time the population is socially distanced, utilizing both a single period of social distancing as well as periodic relaxation. We derive a linear relationship among the optimal start time and duration of a single interval of social distancing from an approximation of the classic epidemic SIR model. Furthermore, we see a sharp phase transition region in start times for a single pulse of distancing, where the peak of the infected population changes rapidly; notably, this transition occurs well before one would intuitively expect. By numerical investigation of more sophisticated epidemiological models designed specifically to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, we see that all share remarkably similar dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one-shot changes, and hence lead us to conclude that these features are universal in epidemic models. On the other hand, the nonlinearity of epidemic models leads to non-monotone behavior of the peak of infected population under periodic relaxation of social distancing policies. This observation led us to hypothesize that an additional single interval social distancing at a proper time can significantly decrease the infected peak of periodic policies, and we verified this improvement numerically. While synchronous quarantine and social distancing mandates across populations effectively minimize the spread of an epidemic over the world, relaxation decisions should not be enacted at the same time for different populations.","Sadeghi, Mahdiar; Greene, James M; Sontag, Eduardo D",Annual reviews in control,,20

To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly up-regulation of the TNF/IL-1ß-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response co-existed with the TNF/IL-1ß-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19. Interestingly, we documented type I IFN-driven inflammatory features in patients with severe influenza as well. Based on this, we propose that the type I IFN response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating inflammation in severe COVID-19.","Lee, Jeong Seok; Park, Seongwan; Jeong, Hye Won; Ahn, Jin Young; Choi, Seong Jin; Lee, Hoyoung; Choi, Baekgyu; Nam, Su Kyung; Sa, Moa; Kwon, Ji-Soo; Jeong, Su Jin; Lee, Heung Kyu; Park, Sung Ho; Park, Su-Hyung; Choi, Jun Yong; Kim, Sung-Han; Jung, Inkyung; Shin, Eui-Cheol",Sci. immunol,,20

PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from the 140 000 eligible participants of Lifelines and the Lifelines NEXT birth cohort, who are all residents of the three northern provinces of the Netherlands. Participants filled out detailed questionnaires about their physical and mental health and experiences on a weekly basis starting in late March 2020, and the cohort consists of everyone who filled in at least one questionnaire in the first 8 weeks of the project. FINDINGS TO DATE: >71 000 unique participants responded to the questionnaires at least once during the first 8 weeks, with >22 000 participants responding to seven questionnaires. Compiled questionnaire results are continuously updated and shared with the public through the Corona Barometer website. Early results included a clear signal that younger people living alone were experiencing greater levels of loneliness due to lockdown, and subsequent results showed the easing of anxiety as lockdown was eased in June 2020. FUTURE PLANS: Questionnaires were sent on a (bi)weekly basis starting in March 2020 and on a monthly basis starting July 2020, with plans for new questionnaire rounds to continue through 2020 and early 2021. Questionnaire frequency can be increased again for subsequent waves of infections. Cohort data will be used to address how the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the northern provinces of the Netherlands, which environmental and genetic risk factors predict disease susceptibility and severity and the psychological and societal impacts of the crisis. Cohort data are linked to the extensive health, lifestyle and sociodemographic data held for these participants by Lifelines, a 30-year project that started in 2006, and to data about participants held in national databases.","Mc Intyre, Katherine; Lanting, Pauline; Deelen, Patrick; Wiersma, Henry H; Vonk, Judith M; Ori, Anil P S; Jankipersadsing, Soesma A; Warmerdam, Robert; van Blokland, Irene; Boulogne, Floranne; Dijkema, Marjolein X L; Herkert, Johanna C; Claringbould, Annique; Bakker, Olivier; Lopera Maya, Esteban A; Bültmann, Ute; Zhernakova, Alexandra; Reijneveld, Sijmen A; Zijlstra, Elianne; Swertz, Morris A; Brouwer, Sandra; van Ooijen, Raun; Angelini, Viola; Dekker, Louise H; Sijtsma, Anna; Scherjon, Sicco A; Wijmenga, Cisca; Dekens, Jackie A M; Mierau, Jochen; Boezen, H Marike; Franke, Lude",BMJ Open,,20

327180,Phylogenomics Analysis of SARS-CoV2 Genomes Reveals Distinct Selection Pressure on Different Viral Strains,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the need to develop safe and effective vaccines with a top priority. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, and several vaccines are currently available. Efforts need to be undertaken to counter the threat of the global COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, EBY100/pYD1-RBD, in which the full-length receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed on the surface of yeast. Mice vaccinated orally with unadjuvanted EBY100/pYD1-RBD could produce significant humoral and mucosal responses as well as robust cellular immune responses. Notably, EBY100/pYD1-RBD elicited a mixed Th1/Th2-type cellular immune response with a Th1-biased immune response in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of the RBD as a key target to design and develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and provide evidence of oral administration of a S. cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eliciting significant immune responses. Most importantly, the S. cerevisiae surface display system can serve as a universal technology platform and be applied to develop other oral viral or bacterial vaccines.","Gao, Tong; Ren, Yi; Li, Shuangqin; Lu, Xin; Lei, Han",Microb Cell Fact,,20

Although the current focus is on the management of acute COVID-19, there is growing concern about long-term effects of COVID-19 (Long Covid), such as fibroproliferative changes in the lung, heart and kidney. Therefore, the identification of therapeutic targets not only for the management of acute COVID-19 but also for preventing Long Covid are needed, and would mitigate against long-lasting health burden and economic costs, in addition to saving lives. COVID-19 induces pathological changes via multiple pathways, which could be targeted simultaneously for optimal effect. We discuss the potential pathologic function of increased activity of the endocannabinoid/CB1 receptor system and inducible NO synthase (iNOS). We advocate a polypharmacology approach, wherein a single chemical entity simultaneously interacts with CB1 receptors and iNOS causing inhibition, as a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19-related health complications.","Cinar, Resat; Iyer, Malliga R; Kunos, George",Br. j. pharmacol,,20

Objective: To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 211 counties, representing state capitals and cities with at least 100â¯000 residents and including 178â¯892â¯208 US residents, in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020, and April 23, 2020. Exposures: Social distancing, measured by percentage change in visits to nonessential businesses; population density; and daily wet-bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), or cases generated by each incident case at a given time, estimated from daily case incidence data. Results: The 211 counties contained 178â¯892â¯208 of 326â¯289â¯971 US residents (54.8%). Median (interquartile range) population density was 1022.7 (471.2-1846.0) people per square mile. The mean (SD) peak reduction in visits to nonessential business between April 6 and April 19, as the country was sheltering in place, was 68.7% (7.9%). Median (interquartile range) daily wet-bulb temperatures were 7.5 (3.8-12.8) °C. Median (interquartile range) case incidence and fatality rates per 100â¯000 people were approximately 10 times higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2 [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2 [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) Rt in the first 2 weeks was 5.7 (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to nonessential businesses was associated with a 45% decrease in Rt (95% CI, 43%-49%). From a relative Rt at 0 °C of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89-2.40), relative Rt decreased to a minimum as temperatures warmed to 11 °C, increased between 11 and 20 °C (1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at temperatures greater than 20 °C. With a 70% reduction in visits to nonessential business, 202 counties (95.7%) were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 17 of 21 counties (81.0%) in the top density decile and 52 of 53 counties (98.1%) in the lowest density quartile.2. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather were associated with a decreased Rt for SARS-CoV-2 in counties across the United States. These associations could inform selective public policy planning in communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Rubin, David; Huang, Jing; Fisher, Brian T; Gasparrini, Antonio; Tam, Vicky; Song, Lihai; Wang, Xi; Kaufman, Jason; Fitzpatrick, Kate; Jain, Arushi; Griffis, Heather; Crammer, Koby; Morris, Jeffrey; Tasian, Gregory",JAMA Netw Open,,20

The retriever is built from a Siamese-BERT encoder that is linearly composed with a TF-IDF vectorizer, and reciprocal-rank fused with a BM25 vectorizer. The ranker is composed of a multi-hop question-answering module, that together with a multi-paragraph abstractive summarizer adjust retriever scores. To account for the domain-specific and relatively limited dataset, we generate a bipartite graph of document paragraphs and citations, creating 1.3 million (citation title, paragraph) tuples for training the encoder. We evaluate our system on the data of the TREC-COVID information retrieval challenge.

The most common presenting symptoms were cough, myalgia, fever/chills, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), with a prevalence of 62.50%, 43.87%, 53.68%, and 27.21%, respectively. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.08; P < .001), body mass index (OR, 1.07; CI, 1.04-1.11; P < .001), elevated serum ferritin (OR, 1.99; CI, 1.08-3.66; P < .02), C-reactive protein (OR, 2.42; CI, 1.36-4.33; P < .01), and D-dimers (OR, 3.79; CI, 2.21-6.50; P < .001) at the time of presentation were identified as the independent predictors of mortality. Cough, shortness of breath, fever/chills, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgia were the predominant presentation among AAs hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Advanced age, higher body mass index, elevated serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers are independent predictors of mortality among hospitalized AAs with COVID-19 infection.","Gayam, Vijay; Chobufo, Muchi Ditah; Merghani, Mohamed A; Lamichhane, Shristi; Garlapati, Pavani Reddy; Adler, Mark K",J. med. virol,,20

343458,Web Watch,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility and safety of tracheostomy for patients with respiratory failure from COIVD-19 and describe patient clinical characteristics and process of management. METHODS: Case series of the first 24 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at our institution, a single-center tertiary care community hospital intensive care/ventilator weaning unit. The patients all had respiratory failure from COVID-19 and required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Outcomes reviewed include mortality, percent discharged, percent liberated from mechanical ventilation, percent decannulated, time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation and discharge, and number of staff infected with COVID-19 during tracheostomy and management. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients who underwent tracheostomy, 21 (88%) of 24 survived. Twenty (83%) were liberated from mechanical ventilation, and 19 (79%) were discharged. Fourteen (74%) of the discharged had been decannulated. The average (± SD) time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 9 ± 4.3 days and from tracheostomy to discharge 21 ± 9 days. All discharged patients had been liberated from mechanical ventilation. No health care workers became infected with COVID-19 during the procedure or subsequent patient management. CONCLUSION: Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy had a high likelihood of being liberated from mechanical ventilation and discharged. Tracheostomy and subsequent ventilator weaning management can be performed safely. Tracheostomy allowed for decompression of higher acuity medical units in a safe and effective manner.","Cardasis, John J; Rasamny, J K; Berzofsky, Craig E; Bello, Jennifer A; Multz, Alan S",Ear Nose Throat J,,20

This article combines pre-COVID-19 research with emerging industry and policy evidence to identify where key impacts on inclusive practice and, consequently, workforce participation and advancement in the cultural economy are likely to occur. The article demonstrates how considering the cultural economy’s typical business models and resultant work and employment practices allows understanding that the inclusion and diversity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be driven by more than workers’ differing abilities to buffer short-term income insecurity. The article highlights four areas relevant to inclusion and workforce diversity that research and policy responses to COVID-19 should attend to in revising existing and designing new responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Eikhof, Doris Ruth",Cult.

345454,Therapeutic Effect of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Patients with Critical COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of all healthcare workers. Anesthesiologists frequently perform virus-aerosolizing procedures, such as intubation and extubation, that place them at increased risk of infection. We sought to determine how the initial COVID-19 outbreak affected members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) on both personal and professional levels. Specifically, we examined the potential effects of gender and age on personal stress, burnout, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression, assessed job satisfaction, and explored financial impact. METHODS: After receiving approval from the SPA Committees for Research and Quality and Safety, and the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, we emailed a questionnaire to all 3,245 SPA members. The survey included 22 questions related to well-being and 13 questions related to effects of COVID-19 on current and future practice, finances, retirement planning, academic time and productivity, and clinical and home responsibilities. To address low initial response rates and quantify nonresponse bias, we sent a shortened follow-up survey to a randomly selected subsample (n=100) of SPA members who did not respond to the initial survey. Response differences between the two cohorts were determined. RESULTS: A total of 561 (17%) members responded to the initial questionnaire. Because of COVID-19, 21.7% of respondents said they would change their clinical responsibilities and 10.6% would decrease their professional working time. Women were more likely than men to anticipate a future COVID-19-related job change (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.63, P = 0.011), perhaps because of increased home responsibilities (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.74 to 4.00, P <0.001). Additionally, 14.2% of respondents planned to retire early and 11.9% planned to retire later. Women and non-whites had higher likelihoods of burnout on univariate analysis (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.94, P = 0.026 and OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.08 to 3.04, P = 0.017, respectively) and 25.1% of all respondents felt socially isolated. In addition, both changes in retirement planning and future occupational planning were strongly associated with total job satisfaction scores (both P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of pediatric anesthesiologists, albeit not equally, as women and non-whites have been disproportionately impacted. The pandemic has significantly affected personal finances, home responsibilities, and retirement planning, reduced clinical and academic practice time and responsibilities, and increased feelings of social isolation, stress, burnout, and depression/anxiety.","Margolis, Rebecca D; Strupp, Kim M; Beacham, Abbie O; Yaster, Myron; Austin, Thomas M; Macrae, Andrew W; Diaz-Berenstain, Laura; Janosy, Norah R",,,20
346968,Network-based prediction of the 2019-nCoV epidemic outbreak in the Chinese province Hubei,2020,"In six weeks the world has changed: COVID-19 - Family-centered care in the intensive care unit Abstract. Background and problem definition: The admission of patients to an intensive care unit is extremely stressful for relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they are not allowed to visit their family members due to a visitation restriction. OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic and to derive support information for health professionals. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of three written testimonies of relatives whose family members were hospitalized with COVID-19 or other disease at intensive care unit. RESULTS: Relatives report the sudden, unexpected occurrence of the disease. ""It was there, out of nowhere, hits the heart of life, doesn't just go away, does what it wants. It is an unknown virus that we have to get to know very closely."" The ban on visiting was harsh, it made her faint. The first visit was an indescribable joy. Knowing how the family member was and that the health care professionals were taking professional and empathetic care of the sick person were the only things the relatives could hold on to. DISCUSSION: Relatives were reassured when they experienced a high level of commitment on the part of health professionals and received repeated comprehensible information by phone. Limitations and transfer: Restrictions on visits depend on national legislation. Measures such as video calls can also be useful outside of a pandemic to build relationships with relatives.","Jeitziner, Marie-Madlen; Zante, Björn; Jenni-Moser, Béatrice",Pflege,,20
347707,Variability in digestive and respiratory tract Ace2 expression is associated with the microbiome,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of over 350,000 people and infected more than 6 million people worldwide. Several search engines have surfaced to provide researchers with additional tools to find and retrieve information from the rapidly growing corpora on COVID-19. These engines lack extraction and visualization tools necessary to retrieve and interpret complex relations inherent to scientific literature. Moreover, because these engines mainly rely upon semantic information, their ability to capture complex global relationships across documents is limited, which reduces the quality of similarity-based article recommendations for users. In this work, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph (CKG), a heterogeneous graph for extracting and visualizing complex relationships between COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG combines semantic information with document topological information for the application of similar document retrieval. The CKG is constructed using the latent schema of the data, and then enriched with biomedical entity information extracted from the unstructured text of articles using scalable AWS technologies to form relations in the graph. Finally, we propose a document similarity engine that leverages low-dimensional graph embeddings from the CKG with semantic embeddings for similar article retrieval. Analysis demonstrates the quality of relationships in the CKG and shows that it can be used to uncover meaningful information in COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG helps power www.cord19.aws and is publicly available.","Wise, Colby; Ioannidis, Vassilis N.; Calvo, Miguel Romero; Song, Xiang; Price, George; Kulkarni, Ninad; Brand, Ryan; Bhatia, Parminder; Karypis, George",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12731v1.pdf,20

METHODS: We attempted to address this question by reviewing our single-center experience during the first two months of the pandemics at a high incidence area. RESULTS: Nineteen adult patients (5 females) were diagnosed by May 5th, 2020. Median age was 58 (range 55-72), and median follow-up since transplantation was 83 (range 20-183) months. Cough (84.2%), fever (57.9%) and dyspnea (47.4%) were the most common symptoms. Thirteen patients (68.4%) had pneumonia in X-ray/CT scan. Hydroxychloroquine was administered in 11 patients, associated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon ß in 2 cases each. Immunomodulatory therapy with tocilizumab was used in 2 patients. Immunosuppression (IS) was halted in one patient, and modified in only other two due to potential drug interactions. Five (26.3%) patients were managed as outpatient. Two patients (10.5%) died, 10 (52.6%) were discharged home, and 2 (10.5%) were still hospitalized after a median follow-up of 41 days from the onset of symptoms.

First, we empirically estimate the reproduction numbers for two different states. Then, we develop an age-structured compartmental simulation model for the disease spread to demonstrate the variation in the observed outbreak. Finally, we analyze the computational results and show that early trigger social distancing strategies result in smaller death tolls; however, there are relatively larger second waves. Conversely, late trigger social distancing strategies result in higher initial death tolls but relatively smaller second waves. This study shows that decision analytic tools can help policy makers simulate different social distancing scenarios at the early stages of a global outbreak. Policy makers should expect multiple waves of cases as a result of the social distancing policies implemented when there are no vaccines available for mass immunization and appropriate antiviral treatments.","Ertem, Zeynep; Araz, Ozgur M; Cruz-Aponte, Mayteé",Decis Support Syst,,20

States' actions to address the pandemic have varied widely, and federal and state officials have provided conflicting messages. This fragmented approach surely cost time and lives. Federalism will shape the long-term health and economic impacts of COVID-19, including plans for the future, for at least two reasons: First, federalism exacerbates inequities, as some states have a history of under-investing in social programs, especially in certain communities. Second, many of the states with the deepest needs are poorly equipped to respond to emergencies due to low taxes and distrust of government, leading to inadequate infrastructure. These dynamics are not new, but they have been laid bare by this crisis. What can policymakers do to address the inequities in health and economic outcomes that federalism intensifies? The first section of this paper offers a case study, using the Mississippi Delta to illustrate the role of federalism in perpetuating the connection between place, health, and economics. The second section examines challenges that safety net programs will face moving beyond the acute phase of COVID-19.

In order to evaluate stress levels of pregnant woman in this difficult time, the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Scale (PREPS) was introduced in the US. The present study introduces and validates the German version of the PREPS. STUDY DESIGN: In total, 1364 German-speaking pregnant women from Germany and Switzerland took part in this online cohort study and completed the PREPS as well as gave information on sociodemographic, obstetric and other psychological factors. RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis of the PREPS showed very good psychometric values and confirmed the structure of the original questionnaire. The PREPS comprises three dimensions: Infection Stress (5 items), Preparedness Stress (7 items) and Positive Appraisal (3 items). Furthermore, correlations between the PREPS and other psychological factors such as Pregnancy Specific Stress and Fear of Childbirth highlight convergent validity. The sensitivity of the questionnaire was demonstrated by its associations with several obstetric and COVID-19 related factors. CONCLUSION: The German PREPS showed good psychometric properties and is a useful instrument for future studies which aim to investigate the impact of pandemic-related stress on birth outcomes and postpartum factors.","Schaal, Nora K; Marca-Ghaemmaghami, Pearl La; Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Lobel, Marci; Amiel Castro, Rita",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,20

The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among patients receiving haemodialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to explore the contributing predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics software was performed. Data were collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the predictors that were associated with fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients undergoing haemodialysis who participated, 53.7% (n = 66) reported fatigue, 43.9% (n = 54) reported anxiety, 33.3% (n = 41) reported depression and 56.9% (n = 70) reported poor sleep. Fatigue, anxiety and sleep quality (P < .05) were significantly associated with being female, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. Logistic regression showed that being within the age group 31-40, having a secondary education level, anxiety, depression and sleep quality were the main predictors affecting the fatigue group. CONCLUSION: Fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality are significant problems for patients receiving haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to monitor and reduce fatigue, psychological problems and sleep quality amongst these patients are needed. This can help to strengthen preparations for responding to possible future outbreaks or pandemics of infectious diseases for patients receiving haemodialysis.","Al Naamani, Zakariya; Gormley, Kevin; Noble, Helen; Santin, Olinda; Al Maqbali, Mohammed",BMC Nephrol,,20

We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral genome is 29,881â nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into ß-coronavirus genus.

The pandemic period from 1/3/2020 to 31/7/2020 was compared with the same period in 2019. Overall, in 2020 there was a 2.4% reduction in the number of allo-HCT cases compared to 2019. Interestingly, this deflection did not affect the acute leukemia cases (+5.7% in 2020). The use of peripheral blood-derived stem cells (+10.7%) and cryopreservation (97.4% of the centers) was highly adopted in 2020. Despite the sanitary emergency, almost all of the surveyed centers declared no impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on the transplant timing and outcomes, and the sanitary policy was positively evaluated by the majority of centers. The emergency measures ensured that only a minority of the allo-HCT patients had been infected by SARS-CoV2; however, a mortality of 42.1% among the allo-HCT patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was recorded. This survey gives us the information that the GITMO Group reacted positively to the pandemic. Thanks to the emergency strategies, the Italian allo-HCT activity continued safely, showing only a minor deflection and offering the same probability of cure to the transplanted patients.","Russo, Domenico; Polverelli, Nicola; Malagola, Michele; Farina, Mirko; Leoni, Alessandro; Bernardi, Simona; Mammoliti, Sonia; Sacchi, Nicoletta; Martino, Massimo; Ciceri, Fabio",Bone marrow transplant,,20
363048,A preview of selected articles,2021,"BACKGROUND: With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, rapid diagnostics are paramount to contain the current pandemic. The routinely used realtime RT-PCR is sensitive, specific and able to process large batches of samples. However, turnaround time is long and in cases where fast obtained results are critical, molecular point of care tests (POCT) can be an alternative. Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. STUDY DESIGN: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. RESULTS: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected. In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100 % compared to all in-house RT-PCRs CONCLUSION: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence.","Wolters, Femke; van de Bovenkamp, Jeroen; van den Bosch, Bart; van den Brink, Sharon; Broeders, Maaike; Chung, Ngoc Hoa; Favié, Barbara; Goderski, Gabriel; Kuijpers, Judith; Overdevest, Ilse; Rahamat-Langedoen, Janette; Wijsman, Lisa; Melchers, Willem Jg; Meijer, Adam",J Clin Virol,,20

Thus, numerous clinical trials were conducted to find specific medicine for COVID-19 recently. However, it remains unanswered whether they are beneficial. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of the COVID-19 medicine. METHODS: Studies were determined through searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Medline. The studies of COVID-19 medicine were involved with eligible end points containing mortality, discharge rate, rate of clinical improvement, and rate of serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies involving 37,879 patients were included in our study, whose intervening measures contained three major types of COVID-19 medicine, ACEI/ARB, antiviral medicine, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Compared to control group, COVID-19 drugs have no distinct effect on mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11, Pâ=â.43) and discharge rate (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.14, Pâ=â.13). However, antiviral medicine presents the obvious advantage in clinical improvement (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23, Pâ<â.05). In addition, the serious adverse events rate (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.88, Pâ<â.05) of COVID-19 medicine is lower than control group. CONCLUSION: The results indicated antiviral medicine was potential specific medicine for COVID-19 treatment by improving clinical symptoms, but it failed to increase the discharge rate and reduce mortality. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and ACEI/ARB had no significant effect on treatment of COVID-19, thus they were not recommended for routine medication. Moreover, more trials are needed to find effective drugs to lower the mortality of COVID-19 patients.","Qiu, Rong; Li, Jingwei; Xiao, Yuxuan; Gao, Ziyi; Weng, Yihang; Zhang, Qiran; Wang, Chengdi; Gong, Hanlin; Li, Weimin",Medicine (Baltimore),,20
367890,Acute asthma management during SARS-CoV2-pandemic 2020,2020,"Over the past few decades, automated machine based Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) has made a significant progress, guided by its relevance for applications in various areas of neuroscience, health, defense, entertainment and Human Robot Interaction (HRI). Most of the work on FER is focused on controlled conditions for non-occluded faces. In the present Covid-19 scenario, when more individuals cover their face partially to prevent spread of corona virus, developing a system/technique that can recognize facial emotion with facial mask constraint is desirable. In this research work, a FER system built using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) technique is proposed. In the proposed work, eyes and forehead segment is used to train model. This system is implemented using Raspberry Pi 3 B + and Robotic Process automation (RPA) for HRI. The proposed system achieves 79.87% average accuracy with 5-fold cross validation and also tested in real time scenario. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Saxena, S.; Tripathi, S.; Sudarshan, T.

369295,Mesenchymal stromal cells for sepsis and septic shock: Lessons for treatment of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Associations between ambient temperature exposure during pregnancy and stillbirth have been reviewed and described in the literature. However, there is no existing review of environmental and epidemiologic methods applied to measure stillbirths resulting from exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy. The objective of this study is to systematically review published methods, data sources, and data linkage practices to characterize associations between ambient temperature and stillbirth to inform stillbirth prevention and risk management strategies. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies that assess the association between ambient temperature exposure during pregnancy using any measures or approach and stillbirth was undertaken in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science of studies (2000-2020, inclusive). Selection of studies were assessed by pre-specified eligibility criteria and documented using PRISMA. Citations were managed using EndNote X8 whilst selection, reviewing, and data extraction were performed using Covidence. The screening, selection, and data extraction process consisted of two blind, independent reviews followed by a tertiary independent review. An adapted Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist was used to assess quality and bias. The main findings and characteristics of all studies was extracted and summarized. Where appropriate, a meta-analysis will be performed for measures of association. RESULTS: Among 538 original records, 12 eligible articles were identified that analysed associations between ambient temperature exposure and stillbirth for 42,848 stillbirths among 3.4 million births across seven countries. Varied definitions of stillbirth were reported based on gestational age, birthweight, both, or neither. The overall rate of stillbirth ranged from 1.9 to 38.4 per 1000 among six high-income countries and one low-middle-income country. All study designs were retrospective and included ten cohort studies, three case-crossover studies, and two additional case-control subgroup analysis. Exposure data for ambient temperature was mostly derived from standard municipal or country-level monitors based on weather stations (66.6%) or a forecasting model (16.7%); otherwise, not reported (16.7%). Results were not statistically pooled for a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of methods and models among included studies. All studies reported associations of increased risk of stillbirth with ambient temperature exposures throughout pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy. One study estimates 17-19% (PAR) of stillbirths are potentially attributable to chronic exposure to hot and cold ambient temperatures during pregnancy. Overall, risk of stillbirth was observed to increase below 15 °C and above 23.4 °C, where highest risk is above 29.4 °C. CONCLUSION: Exposure to hot and cold temperatures during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, although a clear causative mechanism remains unknown. Despite lack of causal evidence, existing evidence across diverse settings observed similar effects of increased risk of stillbirth using a variety of statistical and methodological approaches for exposure assessments, exposure windows, and data linkage. Managing exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy could potentially decrease risk of stillbirth, particularly among women in low-resource settings where access to safe antenatal and obstetric care is challenging. To fully understand the effects or dose-response relationship of maternal exposure to ambient temperatures and stillbirth, future studies should focus on biological mechanisms and contributing factors in addition to improving measurement of ambient temperature exposure.","Sexton, Jessica; Andrews, Christine; Carruthers, Selina; Kumar, Sailesh; Flenady, Vicki; Lieske, Scott",Environ Res,,20
370374,Mesenchymal stem cell infusion shows promise for combating coronavirus (COVID-19)-induced pneumonia,2020,"Background. A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been affecting almost all nations around the world. Most infected patients who have been admitted to intensive care units show SARS signs. In this study, we aimed to achieve a better understanding of pathological alterations that take place during the novel coronavirus infection in most presumed affected organs. Methods. We performed postmortem core needle biopsies from lung, heart, and liver on 7 deceased patients who had died of coronavirus disease 2019. Prepared tissue sections were observed by 2 expert pathologists. Results. Diffuse alveolar damage was the main pathologic finding in the lung tissue samples. Patients with hospitalization durations of more than 10 days showed evidence of organization. Multinucleated cells in alveolar spaces and alveolar walls, atypical enlarged cells, accumulation of macrophages in alveolar spaces, and congestion of vascular channels were the other histopathologic alteration of the lung. None of our heart biopsy samples met the criteria for myocarditis. Liver biopsies showed congestion, micro- and macro-vesicular changes, and minimal to mild portal inflammation, in the majority of cases. Conclusions. Similar to the previous coronavirus infection in 2003, the main pathologic finding in the lung was diffuse alveolar damage with a pattern of organization in prolonged cases. The SARS-CoV-2 infection does not cause myocarditis, and the ischemia of myocardium is the most probable justification of the observed pathologic changes in the heart. Liver tissue sections mostly showed nonspecific findings; however, ischemia of the liver can be identified in some cases.","Beigmohammadi, Mohammad Taghi; Jahanbin, Behnaz; Safaei, Masoomeh; Amoozadeh, Laya; Khoshavi, Meysam; Mehrtash, Vahid; Jafarzadeh, Bita; Abdollahi, Alireza",Int J Surg Pathol,,20

372159,Liver progenitor cell-driven liver regeneration,2020,"BACKGROUND: The stay-at-home orders imposed in early April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in various states complicated mosquito control activities across the United States (US), and Florida was no exception. Mosquito control programs are the first line of defense against mosquito-borne pathogens. The purpose of this study was to examine the capabilities of Florida mosquito programs to implement key mosquito measures during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: Using a self-administered online survey, we examined the capabilities of all Florida mosquito control programs (both state-approved mosquito districts, N = 63; and open programs, N = 27) at a time when the state of Florida was still under heightened awareness of, stay-at-home orders and planning a phase 1 reopening over the COVID-19 pandemic (June to July 2020). The final sample included mosquito control programs structured as the Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) (n = 42), independent tax district (n = 16), municipal (n = 10), and health or emergency department (n = 5). We used descriptive statistics to summarize information about the characteristics of responding programs, their implemented mosquito control and surveillance activities. wWe used bivariate analysis to compare the characteristics of responding programs and the self-reported mosquito measures. RESULTS: Of the recruited mosquito control programs, 73 completed the survey (81.1% response rate; 73/90). Of these, 57.5% (n = 42) were Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) mosquito control programs, 21.9% (n = 16) were independent tax district programs, 13.7% (n = 10) were municipal mosquito control programs, and only 6.8% (n = 5) were either health or emergency department mosquito control programs. Except for arbovirus surveillance, most programs either fully or partially performed larval (61.8%) and adult (78.9%) surveillance; most programs conducted species-specific control for Aedes aegypti (85.2%, n = 54), Aedes albopictus (87.3%, n = 55), Culex quinquefasciatus (92.1%, n = 58), and Culex nigripalpus (91.9%, n = 57). CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the importance of ongoing mosquito control activities, and suggest that Florida mosquito control programs are vigilant and have significant capability to handle potential mosquito-borne disease threats, but arbovirus surveillance systems (laboratory testing of mosquito pools and testing of human and nonhuman specimens for arboviruses) are needed during pandemics as well.","Moise, Imelda K; Ortiz-Whittingham, Lola R; Omachonu, Vincent; Clark, Marah; Xue, Rui-De",BMC Public Health,,20

376074,"Targeting Nonsense: Optimization of 1,2,4-Oxadiazole TRIDs to Rescue CFTR Expression and Functionality in Cystic Fibrosis Cell Model Systems",2020,"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; no specific effective medication to treat the disease has been identified to date. We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19.This single-center, retrospective, observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Data on demographics, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and 8 patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively.All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all 8 severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; 4 received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all 8 in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; 2 received linezolid). Moreover, 7 patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and 9 (16.36%) with immunomodulators.Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary. Randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials remain necessary for more accurate conclusions.","Fan, Lichao; Liu, Huan; Li, Na; Liu, Chang; Gu, Ye; Liu, Yongyu; Chen, Yu",Medicine (Baltimore),,20
377165,Telemedicine in Pediatric Infectious Diseases,2021,"PURPOSE: Our research aimed to examine the role of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in psychological distress (PD) among women with ovarian cancer. Fear of COVID-19 (FCOV) was examined as a mediator, and participant health status and the reopening status of their geographic region were examined as moderators. DESIGN: A cross-sectional quantitative design was employed. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 100) were recruited through various online sources and completed the study via Qualtrics. METHODS: Moderated mediation models and post-hoc linear regression analyses were used to determine the role of predictor variables in PD. RESULTS: No significant moderators or mediators were found. Despite a strong correlation between FCOV and IU, both variables explained unique variance in the anxiety and stress models, while FCOV was not significant in the depressive symptoms model. IMPLICATIONS FOR PROVIDERS: Both IU and FCOV should be considered in helping women with ovarian cancer manage their PD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hill, Erin M; Frost, Andriana; Martin, Jamie D",J Psychosoc Oncol,,20

380680,Dental Office Prevention of Coronavirus Infection,2020,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily behaviours of children and youth. Yet, little is known about how they are mentally coping with the pandemic-time changes to their lives. This study explores children and youths’ self-reported subjective well-being (SWB) during the pandemic, and provides novel insights into the correlates of potential decrease, using data from a pan-Canadian online survey of 932 children/youth and their parents. SWB was measured based on perceived changes in 12 affective/emotional states. The results indicate that in spring 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, many children and youth were more bored (37.6%) and worried (31%) compared to pre-pandemic time. At the same time, many self-reported that they felt calmer (31.9%) and more rested (30%). A latent class analysis revealed that nearly half (49.4%) of surveyed children and youth reported patterns in changes in their emotional state that may contribute to lower SWB. Results from binomial logistic regression suggest that socio-demographic characteristics and size of the municipality were not associated with low pandemic-time SWB. Instead, other potentially modifiable factors such as having access to friends, indoor and outdoor spaces/places to play and exercise, and healthy movement behaviours during the pandemic, were correlated with a lower likelihood of reporting low SWB. The findings can inform pandemic-time public health policy relating to physical distancing, and in the longer term, mental and physical health promotion. The results will also help improve urban planning and design practices in creating healthier, more resilient and equitable communities.","Mitra, Raktim Owen D.

Severe forms of infection associate cytokine release syndrome and acute lung injury due to hyperinflammatory responses even though virus clearance is achieved. Key components of inflammation include immune cell recruitment in infected tissues, a step which is under the control of endothelial cells. Here, we review endothelial cell responses in inflammation and infection due to SARS-CoV-2 together with phenotypic and functional alterations of monocytes, T and B lymphocytes with which they interact. We surmise that endothelial cells function as an integrative and active platform for the various cells recruited, where fine tuning of immune responses takes place and which provides opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Degauque, Nicolas; Haziot, Alain; Brouard, Sophie; Mooney, Nuala",FASEB J,,20

METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, China were categorized into Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated and nonvaccinated groups. Clinical records, demography, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: No adverse events were observed, except for an increased frequency of chills in the Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated group compared with that in the unvaccinated group (p=0.014). There were no significant differences in oxygen demand for breathing, computed tomography scans, treatments, or outcomes between the 2 groups. However, Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated group had significantly less severe pneumonia (p=0.028) and milder deficiency in liver function, consistent with a lower death rate than in the unvaccinated group. CONCLUSIONS: Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination received in childhood is associated with less severe COVID-19 pneumonia and milder liver function deficiency in addition to a lower death rate in Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated patients than in nonvaccinated individuals.","Chen, Fan; Chen, Guo X; Zhou, Jing; Xue, Yun; Wu, Mei X",Am. j. prev. med,,20

385817,Pharmacological rationale for antihypertensive drug choice on COVID-19-affected patients: ACEI/ARB might not increase their susceptibility,2020,"There currently is no specific antiviral drug or a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infections; now exceeding 10,300,000 infections worldwide. In the absence of animal models to test drugs, we need to find molecular explanations for any unforeseen peculiarities in clinical data, especially the recent reports describing an unexpected asthma paradox. Asthma is considered a high medical risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, yet asthma is not on the list of top 10 chronic health problems suffered by people who died from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Resolving this paradox requires looking beyond the binary model of a viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) attaching to the ACE-2 receptor. A NCBI pBlast analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein contains key two calcium-dependent fusion domains that are almost identical to those that were recently discovered SARS-CoV-1. These viral calcium-dependent binding domains can facilitate membrane fusion only after cleavage by the host surface protease TMPRSS2. Importantly, TMPRSS2 also requires calcium for its SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain and itsLDLRA(LDL receptor class A) domain. Thus, the presence of EDTA excipients in nebulized ß2-agonist medicines can disrupt SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection and can explain the asthma paradox. This model validates repurposing EDTA in nebulizer solutions from a passive excipient to an active drug for treating COVID-19 infections. Repurposed EDTA delivery to respiratory tissues at an initial target dose of 2.4 mg per aerosol treatment is readily achievable with standard nebulizer and mechanical ventilator equipment. EDTA warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in consideration of the new calcium requirements for virus infection and the regular presence of EDTA excipients in common asthma medications such as Metaproterenol. Finally, the natural history of Coronavirus diseases and further analysis of the fusion loop homologies between the Betacorona SARS-CoV-2 virus and the less pathogenic Alphacorona HC0V-229E virus suggest how to engineer a hybrid virus suitable for an attenuated alpha-beta SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, replacing SARS-CoV-2 fusion loops (amino acids 816-855) with the less pathogenic HCoV-229E fusion loop (amino acids 923-982) may provide antigenicity of COVID-19, but limit the pathogenicity to the level of HCoV-229E.","Cashman, Daniel P",Med Hypotheses,,20

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented strain on healthcare workers internationally. Rising infection rates, inadequate personal protective equipment, and the lack of availability of hospital beds has resulted in further deterioration of the already-fragile mental health of healthcare workers. Resilient workers have lower rates of burnout and improved patient outcomes. EVALUATION: PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases were searched using the terms resilience, nurse and COVID-19 to identify studies on resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results were organized by outcome measures for comparison. KEY ISSUES: Resilience scores among frontline healthcare workers worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic in the studies reviewed were overall found to be in the moderate range. Data from the United States showed a decrease in nurse resilience, whereas participants from China had increased resilience compared with pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: Building resilience in nurses and other healthcare workers can serve as a protective factor against negative outcomes related to the job, including burnout, anxiety and depression, and can improve patient outcomes.

However, the information found on the internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms ""Prevention coronavirus,"" ""Prevention COVID-19,"" ""Prevención coronavirus,"" and ""Prevención COVID-19"". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was ""wash your hands frequently"" (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to ""stay home if you feel unwell"" (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as ""wash your hands frequently"" (OR 9.82), ""cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze"" (OR 4.59), or ""stay home if you feel unwell"" (OR 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the internet.

401277,Cumulative Effects of Particulate Matter Pollution and Meteorological Variables on the Risk of Influenza-Like Illness,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as an emergency global public health concern on 30 January 2020. This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was first identified in Wuhan city, China; which soon affected around 185 countries and territories all over the world through various transmission mechanisms. Having found no permanent cure to date, this pandemic threatens humanity for its very existence. OBJECTIVE: In the light of rising menace, this review aims at providing collective and prominent information on the current outbreak covering its origin, structure, transmission, clinical features, potential treatment approaches, and clinical trial details. METHOD: Literature published in Scopus and PubMed indexed journals were reviewed and clinical trial data was retrieved from the ClinicalTrials.gov database. RESULTS: Present review puts forth detailed insights on history, epidemiology, structure, genetic makeup, reservoirs, entry mechanisms, reproduction capacity, pathogenesis, routes of transmission, clinical features, diagnostics, the role of chloroquine in treatment, current promising therapies, and vaccination trials. CONCLUSION: At present, early detection, isolation of infected patients, and supportive care with a few recently USFDA approved alternative medications are being used as per the standard government guidelines. Due to insufficient proof available regarding current therapies to produce therapeutic activity against COVID-19, safety precautions, prevention methods, maintaining hygiene and management therapy with intensive care medicine is the only way to fight this current situation.","Sodum, Nalini; Kumar, Gautam; Rao, Vanishree; Kumar, Nitesh; Rao, Chamallamudi Mallikarjuna",Mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry (Online),,20

We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. Twenty-nine patient files were investigated in group 1 and group 2 was created with 52 consecutive patients with COVID-19 having age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, and disease course. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of inhospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in the group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay, and transferred to intensive care unit were found to be statistically significantly higher in the group 1. In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared with consecutive patients with COVID-19 presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters.","Ikitimur, Hande; Borku Uysal, Betul; Cengiz, Mahir; Ikitimur, Baris; Uysal, Harun; Ozcan, Erkan; Islamoglu, Mehmet Sami; Seyhan, Serhat; Yavuzer, Hakan; Yavuzer, Serap",J Med Virol,,20

Psychological factors that promote resilience might beneficially contribute also to promoting a better HRQoL among elderly subjects. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the contribution of dispositional optimism and expressive flexibility on the HRQoL of elderly outpatients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The outpatients were recruited from October 2018 to October 2019, and then followed-up during April 2020, by evaluating their HRQoL. The baseline sample consisted of 141 elderly outpatients (mean age 80.31 ± 6.84 years); the final number of outpatients included in the follow-up evaluation was 104 (mean age 80.26 ± 6.39). Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were developed to explore significant associations with the physical and mental component of HRQoL. Baseline dispositional optimism was a predictor of the mental component of HRQoL at follow-up; the flexible suppression of emotional expression was a predictor of the physical component of HRQoL at follow-up. From a psychogeriatric perspective, the accurate assessment of psychological factors, such as dispositional optimism and expressive flexibility, might help physicians and psychologists to recognize additional patients' vulnerabilities during the current emergency.","Sardella, Alberto; Lenzo, Vittorio; Bonanno, George A; Basile, Giorgio; Quattropani, Maria C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,20

This study aimed to explore the families' experiences and needs collected during these calls, and the role that the psychologists played through the call. A total of 246 families were called over 3 months. Multiple qualitative methods included: (i) written reports of the calls with relatives of patients who died at the hospital for COVID-19; (ii) qualitative semi-structured interviews with psychologists involved in the calls; (iii) observation of psychologists' peer group discussions. A thematic analysis was conducted. Six themes emerged: without death rituals, solitary, unexpected, unfair, unsafe, coexisting with other stressors. Families' reactions were perceived by psychologists as close to a traumatic grief. Families' needs ranged from finding alternative rituals to giving meaning and expressing different emotions. The psychologists played both a social-institutional and a psychological-human role through the calls (e.g., they cured disrupted communication or validated feelings and choices). This study highlighted the potential of traumatic grief of families of COVID-19 victims, and provided indications for supporting them within the space of a short phone call.","Menichetti Delor, Julia Paola; Borghi, Lidia; Cao di San Marco, Eugenia; Fossati, Ivan; Vegni, Elena",,,20

This raises the question of quality assurance. While some groups have already established standards for online courses, teaching and programs yet very little information is included on methodology of their development and very little emphasis is placed on the online learning experience. Nevertheless, no work has been done specifically for medical education institutions. AIM: To develop a set of descriptors for best practice in online learning in medical education utilizing existing expertise and needs. METHODS: This work utilizes a qualitative multistage approach to identify the descriptors of best practice in online learning starting with a question guided focus group, thematic analysis, Delphi technique and an expert consensus session done simultaneously for triangulation. This was done involving 32 institution in 19 countries. RESULTS: This materialized into the development of a set of standards, indicators, and development of a checklist for each standard area. The standard areas identified were organizational capacity, educational effectiveness, and human resources each of which listed a number of standards. Expert consensus sessions identified the need for qualification of data and thus the development of indicators for best practice. CONCLUSION: Standards are needed for online learning experience and their development and redesign is situational and needs to be enhanced methodologically in axes that are pertaining to the needs of the education community. Taking such axes into consideration by educators and institutions will lead to planning and implementing successful online learning activities, while taking them into consideration by the evaluators will help them conduct comprehensive audits and provide stakeholders with highly informative evaluation reports.","Wasfy, Nourhan F; Abouzeid, Enjy; Nasser, Asmaa Abdel; Ahmed, Samar A; Youssry, Ilham; Hegazy, Nagwa N; Shehata, Mohamed Hany K; Kamal, Doaa; Atwa, Hani",BMC Med Educ,,20

Unlike precision agriculture, aquaculture remains an under-equipped farming activity. To fully realise a vision of \textit{precision aquaculture}, smart IoT can offer the essential tools to local producers worldwide. This paper addresses the question of whether it is feasible to deploy a water quality sensor network in aquaculture for real-time user visualisation and decision making. The proposed system design and its implementation have been validated in a typical aquaculture farming facility. Preliminary results suggest the approach is feasible for short to medium LoRa communication range (up to 110m from outdoor water tanks). Although sensor data loss occurred, the end-to-end data path from the water sensors up to the user's monitoring app has been a positive outcome.

Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus. On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.","Jahangiri, Mehdi; Jahangiri, Milad; Najafgholipour, Mohammadamir",Sci Total Environ,,20

We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-led oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) intervention in Kasensero, a hyperendemic fishing community (HIV prevalence: 37-41%) in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS: This study was conducted among young people (15-24 years) and adult men (25+ years) between May and August 2019. The study entailed distribution of HIVST kits by trained ""peer-leaders,"" who were selected from existing social networks and trained in HIVST distribution processes. Peer-leaders received up to 10 kits to distribute to eligible social network members (i.e. aged 15-24 years if young people or 25+ years if adult man, not tested in the past 3 months, and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status at enrolment). The intervention was evaluated against the feasibility benchmark of 70% of peer-leaders distributing up to 70% of the kits that they received; and the acceptability benchmark of >80% of the respondents self-testing for HIV. RESULTS: Of 298 enrolled into the study at baseline, 56.4% (n = 168) were young people (15-24 years) and 43.6% (n = 130) were adult males (25+ years). Peer-leaders received 298 kits and distributed 296 (99.3%) kits to their social network members. Of the 282 interviewed at follow-up, 98.2% (n = 277) reported that they used the HIVST kits. HIV prevalence was 7.4% (n = 21). Of the 57.1% (n = 12) first-time HIV-positives, 100% sought confirmatory HIV testing and nine of the ten (90%) respondents who were confirmed as HIV-positive were linked to HIV care within 1 week of HIV diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a social network-based, peer-led HIVST intervention in a hyperendemic fishing community is highly feasible and acceptable, and achieves high linkage to HIV care among newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals.","Matovu, Joseph K B; Bogart, Laura M; Nakabugo, Jennifer; Kagaayi, Joseph; Serwadda, David; Wanyenze, Rhoda K; Ko, Albert I; Kurth, Ann E",PLoS One,,20
417968,Evaluating the evidence for direct central nervous system invasion in patients infected with the nCOVID-19 virus,2020,"Gambling disorder is associated with severe financial, social, and psychological consequences, but treatment-seeking rates have been described to be low. Apart from formal treatment, motivational interventions in nontreatment-seeking high-risk gamblers have been shown to be promising. However, little is known about the effectiveness and acceptability of such motivational interventions carried out by a gambling operator as part of the company's responsible gambling policies. Early experiences of such interventions are limited by the risk that gambling in individuals reached with the intervention may continue with a different gambling operator. The present study aims to evaluate effectiveness and user acceptability of a responsible gambling intervention continuously carried out by the Swedish state-owned gambling operator Svenska Spel Sport & Casino. This intervention for high-risk gamblers, identified either through substantial monetary losses or through a voluntary self-test by the gambler, includes a motivational telephone intervention aiming to encourage the gambler to set deposit limits, practice self-exclusion, or seek help. This protocol paper describes the two-tailed evaluation of this intervention: (1) A retrospective, register-based study of the effectiveness of the motivational intervention on gambling expenditures, deposit limits, and self-exclusions in comparison to control individuals not reached by the intervention, including all clients reached or attempted to be reached during September 2019-April 2020 (total n = 3626), as well as a one-to-one matched comparison of clients reached (n = 1404) and not reached; and (2) a prospective web survey study in individuals reached by the same ongoing telephone intervention practice from November 2020 (target n = 200), measuring clients' attitudes to the intervention, perceived effects of the intervention on gambling, and their self-reported gambling on all operators after the intervention.","Håkansson, Anders; Franklin, Katja; Dahlström, Maria; Lyckberg, Axel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,20
417972,LncRNA CCAT1 downregulation increases the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells,2021,"During the early stages of the pandemic, some coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients were misdiagnosed as having influenza, which aroused the concern that some deaths attributed to influenza were actually COVID-19-related. However, little is known about whether coinfection with influenza contributes to severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the optimal therapeutic strategy for these patients. We retrospectively studied 128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients were positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive by nucleic acid detection. Sixty-four cases were coinfected with influenza A/B and the other 64 were influenza negative, matched by age, sex, and days from onset of symptoms. Among the 64 coinfected patients, 54 (84.4%) were coinfected with influenza A, and 10 (15.6%) with influenza B. The median duration of viral shedding time from admission was longer for patients with influenza coinfection (17.0 days) than for those without influenza coinfection (12.0 days) (P < .001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazards ratio of resolution in lung involvement was 1.878 (P = .020) for patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with those not administered lopinavir/ritonavir (95% confidence interval: 1.103-3.196). Among influenza coinfected patients, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited faster pneumonia resolution within 2 weeks after symptom onset (37% vs 1%; P = .001). There was no difference in lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir eliminated the difference of lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19.","Yu, Chong; Zhang, Zhiguo; Guo, Yujiao; Shi, Jing; Pei, Guangchang; Yao, Ying; Liao, Wenhui; Zeng, Rui",J. med. virol,,20

DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 402 married individuals. FINDINGS: The total score of interpersonal cognitive distortions and task performance scores were higher in males. The individuals who go to the workplace during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) process have higher unrealistic relationship expectancy score and total score of interpersonal cognitive distortion. Interpersonal cognitive distortions were determined to explain 5% of task and relationship performance in family role performance. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It was determined that the relationships in the spouses were associated with cognitive distortions and family role performance. Interpersonal cognitive distortions in spouses were found to affect role performance in the family.,"Aydin, Adeviye; Malak Akgün, Bahanur",Perspect. psychiatr. care,,20

In this work, we designed and described a set of primers and probes targeting conserved regions identified from a multiple sequence alignment of 2341 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). We subsequently validated those primers and probes in 211,833 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences. We obtained nine systems (forward primer + reverse primer + probe) that potentially anneal to highly conserved regions of the virus genome from these analyses. In silico predictions also demonstrated that those primers do not bind to nonspecific targets for human, bacterial, fungal, apicomplexan, and other Betacoronaviruses and less pathogenic sub-strains of coronavirus. The availability of these primer and probe sequences will make it possible to validate more efficient protocols for identifying SARS-CoV-2.","Davi, Maria Júlia P; Jeronimo, Selma M B; Lima, João P M S; Lanza, Daniel C F",Sci Rep,,20

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents proved to be to a force to be reckon with in many complex games like Chess and Go. We can look at the stock market historical price series and movements as a complex imperfect information environment in which we try to maximize return - profit and minimize risk. This paper reviews the progress made so far with deep reinforcement learning in the subdomain of AI in finance, more precisely, automated low-frequency quantitative stock trading. Many of the reviewed studies had only proof-of-concept ideals with experiments conducted in unrealistic settings and no real-time trading applications. For the majority of the works, despite all showing statistically significant improvements in performance compared to established baseline strategies, no decent profitability level was obtained. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental testing in real-time, online trading platforms and a lack of meaningful comparisons between agents built on different types of DRL or human traders. We conclude that DRL in stock trading has showed huge applicability potential rivalling professional traders under strong assumptions, but the research is still in the very early stages of development.","Pricope, Tidor-Vlad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00123v1.pdf,20
425889,Intranasal Vaccine Delivery Technology for Respiratory Tract Disease Application with a Special Emphasis on Pneumococcal Disease,2021,"Psychotherapists around the world are facing an unprecedented situation with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To combat the rapid spread of the virus, direct contact with others has to be avoided when possible. Therefore, remote psychotherapy provides a valuable option to continue mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study investigated the fear of psychotherapists to become infected with COVID-19 during psychotherapy in personal contact and assessed how the provision of psychotherapy changed due to the COVID-19 situation and whether there were differences with regard to country and gender. Psychotherapists from three European countries: Czech Republic (CZ, n = 112), Germany (DE, n = 130) and Slovakia (SK, n = 96), with on average 77.8% female participants, completed an online survey. Participants rated the fear of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face psychotherapy and reported the number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via internet) during the COVID-19 situation as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. Fear of COVID-19 infection was highest in SK and lowest in DE (p < 0.001) and was higher in female compared to male psychotherapists (p = 0.021). In all countries, the number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (p < 0.001) and remote psychotherapies increased (p < 0.001), with more patients being treated via internet than via telephone during the COVID-19 situation (p < 0.001). Furthermore, female psychotherapists treated less patients in personal contact (p = 0.036), while they treated more patients via telephone than their male colleagues (p = 0.015). Overall, the total number of patients treated did not differ during COVID-19 from the months before (p = 0.133) and psychotherapy in personal contact remained the most common treatment modality. Results imply that the supply of mental health care could be maintained during COVID-19 and that changes in the provision of psychotherapy vary among countries and gender.","Humer, Elke; Pieh, Christoph; Kuska, Martin; Barke, Antonia; Doering, Bettina K; Gossmann, Katharina; Trnka, Radek; Meier, Zdenek; Kascakova, Natalia; Tavel, Peter; Probst, Thomas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,20
426788,Poem: Waiting for the barbarian Corona viruses,2021,"We describe a method to estimate individual risks of hospitalization and death attributable to non-household and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using available public data on confirmed-case incidence data along with estimates of the clinical fraction, timing of transmission, isolation adherence, secondary infection risks, contact rates, and case-hospitalization and case-fatality ratios. Using the method, we estimate that risks for a 90-day period at the median daily summertime U.S. county confirmed COVID-19 case incidence of 10.8 per 100,000 and pre-pandemic contact rates range from 0.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 for the four deciles of age between 20 and 60 years. The corresponding 90-day period risk of hospitalization ranges from 13.7 to 69.2 per 100,000. Assuming a non-household secondary infection risk of 4% and pre-pandemic contact rates, the share of transmissions attributable to household settings ranges from 73% to 78%. These estimates are sensitive to the parameter assumptions; nevertheless, they are comparable to the COVID-19 hospitalization and fatality rates observed over the time period. We conclude that individual risk of hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection is calculable from publicly available data sources. Access to publicly reported infection incidence data by setting and other exposure characteristics along with setting specific estimates of secondary infection risk would allow for more precise individual risk estimation.","Bhatia, Rajiv; Klausner, Jeffrey",PLoS One,,20

The W2W program evolved to offer four primary components: clinician listening sessions geared to deep understanding of the person's story of their work and its challenges; an inventory of the person's current internal and external resources both in the present and in the past; help with removal of barriers to those resources; and development of a personal toolkit to handle stress. Additional services available to partners and their organizations included psycho-educational webinars, facilitated peer support groups, and organizational consultations to foster trauma-sensitive and resilience-hardy work environments. In March, after lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, W2W pivoted to focus on handouts and webinars addressing how to cope with distress and moral injury, maintaining resilience, coping with grief, and dealing with multiple losses caused by the pandemic. Disaster sparked collaboration and innovation. A train the trainer model was developed to reach more community health workers providing services to the Latinx community dealing with losses similar to those experienced by the clients they serve.

It explores the opinions of tunnellers and their managers about how fatigue influences or is influenced by tunnelling, and how this is managed. Fatigue and sleepiness were discussed in six focus groups with frontline workers (n = 42) and 10 manager interviews. Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all participants having experienced, or recognised in others, the feeling of sleepiness whilst at work. Fatigue and sleepiness are not commonly discussed between tunnelling workers and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue. The research shows that workers in the tunnelling construction sector are exposed to a wide range of occupational factors that potentially increase their vulnerability to fatigue, including the physical environment, repetitive and monotonous tasks, variable shift patterns and manual work. Additionally, personal factors such as social and family demands, long commute times and living away from home, can increase the risk of fatigue. The construction industry in general has gone some way to address fatigue and there is opportunity to further improve fatigue management. However, a major shift is needed before workers will feel able to openly discuss fatigue with their employer.","Maynard, Sally; Jones, Wendy; Filtness, Ashleigh; Gibb, Alistair; Haslam, Roger",Appl Ergon,,20

The manifestations of computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 had their own characteristics, which are different from other types of viral pneumonia, such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia. Therefore, clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a 3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.","Xu, Xiaowei; Jiang, Xiangao; Ma, Chunlian; Du, Peng; Li, Xukun; Lv, Shuangzhi; Yu, Liang; Chen, Yanfei; Su, Junwei; Lang, Guanjing; Li, Yongtao; Zhao, Hong; Xu, Kaijin; Ruan, Lingxiang; Wu, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09334v1.pdf,20

As a result of social distancing policies, the risk for loneliness and associated decline in quality of life has increased. The current study examined factors associated with loneliness and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic cross-sectionally (n = 797) and longitudinally (n = 395). Older age and larger social network size were associated with less loneliness, whereas having multiple physical or mental health diagnoses was associated with greater loneliness. Greater virtual social contact was also associated with increased loneliness. Greater loneliness was associated with all domains of quality of life both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Understanding factors associated with loneliness is critical to developing effective strategies at reducing loneliness and improving quality of life during the pandemic. Contrary to popular perceptions, older age was associated with less loneliness and more virtual social contact was associated with more loneliness. Thus, it may be prudent to deemphasize virtual social contact in public campaigns and to emphasize safe methods of interacting in person.","Rumas, Rachel; Shamblaw, Amanda L; Jagtap, Shreya; Best, Michael W",Psychiatry Res,,20

Furthermore, comparison to a conventional learning-method with special attention on orientation and recognition of physiological structures. METHODS: Prospective two-arm study with the participation of 226 clinical students. 108 students were given an extract from a textbook on fetal echocardiography (PDF-group, n = 108) for 30 min to study. 118 students were able to use the new ultrasound-simulator-app (Simulator-group, n = 118) to learn for 30 min. The knowledge of the students was examined both before and after the learning-period by having them identify sonographic structures in videos using single-choice selection. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age (p = 0.87), gender (p = 0.28), and the number of previously performed ultrasound-examinations (p = 0.45). In the Simulator-group, there was a significantly higher learning effect regarding the proportion of students with an increase of correct answers in the video test examination (p = 0.005). At the end of learning, the students in the Simulator-group needed significantly less time to display the structures in the app's simulation (median initially 10.9 s vs. 6.8 s at the end; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The novel ultrasound-simulation-app seems to be a useful addition and improvement to ultrasound training. Previous difficulties such as simultaneously having patients, ultrasound-machines, and professors at disposal can thus be avoided. This means that another important step towards remote learning can be taken, which has been proven increasingly essential lately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hartmann, Tim Johannes; Friebe-Hoffmann, Ulrike; de Gregorio, Nikolaus; de Gregorio, Amelie; Lato, Christiane; Hüner, Beate; Friedel, Thomas; Janni, Wolfgang; Lato, Krisztian",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,20

Sport's governing bodies should consider reviewing rules determining the eligibility of athletes in the female category as there may be lasting advantages of previously high testosterone concentrations for transwomen athletes and currently high testosterone concentrations in differences in sex development (DSD) athletes. The use of serum testosterone concentrations to regulate the inclusion of such athletes into the elite female category is currently the objective biomarker that is supported by most available scientific literature, but it has limitations due to the lack of sports performance data before, during or after testosterone suppression. Innovative research studies are needed to identify other biomarkers of testosterone sensitivity/responsiveness, including molecular tools to determine the functional status of androgen receptors. The scientific community also needs to conduct longitudinal studies with specific control groups to generate the biological and sports performance data for individual sports to inform the fair inclusion or exclusion of these athletes. Eligibility of each athlete to a sport-specific policy needs to be based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence made available to policymakers from all scientific communities. However, even the most evidence-based regulations are unlikely to eliminate all differences in performance between cisgender women with and without DSD and transwomen athletes. Any remaining advantage held by transwomen or DSD women could be considered as part of the athlete's unique makeup.","Hamilton, Blair R; Lima, Giscard; Barrett, James; Seal, Leighton; Kolliari-Turner, Alexander; Wang, Guan; Karanikolou, Antonia; Bigard, Xavier; Löllgen, Herbert; Zupet, Petra; Ionescu, Anca; Debruyne, Andre; Jones, Nigel; Vonbank, Karin; Fagnani, Federica; Fossati, Chiara; Casasco, Maurizio; Constantinou, Demitri; Wolfarth, Bernd; Niederseer, David; Bosch, Andrew; Muniz-Pardos, Borja; Casajus, José Antonio; Schneider, Christian; Loland, Sigmund; Verroken, Michele; Marqueta, Pedro Manonelles; Arroyo, Francisco; Pedrinelli, André; Natsis, Konstantinos; Verhagen, Evert; Roberts, William O; Lazzoli, José Kawazoe; Friedman, Rogerio; Erdogan, Ali; Cintron, Ana V; Yung, Shu-Hang Patrick; Janse van Rensburg, Dina C; Ramagole, Dimakatso A; Rozenstoka, Sandra; Drummond, Felix; Papadopoulou, Theodora; Kumi, Paulette Y O; Twycross-Lewis, Richard; Harper, Joanna; Skiadas, Vasileios; Shurlock, Jonathan; Tanisawa, Kumpei; Seto, Jane; North, Kathryn",Sports Med,,20
453680,Taming of Covid-19: potential and emerging application of mesenchymal stem cells,2021,"The trans-tibial socket is an essential component of the prosthesis that connects it to the residual limb. Socket misalignments and permanent deformations reduce the comfort of the amputee. In order to forestall such issues, sufficient information about the socket lifespan needs to be acquired, which is fairly difficult given the lack of calculation methods that estimate the fatigue life in the literature. In this paper a semi-analytical model is proposed based on experimental results. It highlights the effects of the amputee average daily walking time on the socket fatigue life. A proportionality relationship is demonstrated linking the Burgers model parameters at the structural scale to those at the macroscopic scale. Hence, it becomes possible to evaluate the permanent deformation that induces a misalignment in the socket. These results are useful for the designers to predict the fatigue life of the socket, and also for clinicians to monitor the mechanical degradation of the trans-tibial socket and schedule maintenance or replacement.","Mankai, Wahbi; Ben Smida, Brahim; Chafra, Moez; Ben Cheikh, Ridha",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,,20

This study aimed to explore the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids to which endoscopy medical staff are exposed. METHODS: The study was a single-center cross-sectional study. From June 1 to July 31, 2020, all patients who underwent GIE at Yokohama City University Hospital were registered. All patients provided 3 mL of saliva. For upper GIE, 10 mL of gastric fluid was collected through the endoscope. For lower GIE, 10 mL of intestinal fluid was collected through the endoscope. The primary outcome was the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids. We also analyzed serum-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and patients' background information. RESULTS: A total of 783 samples (560 upper GIE and 223 lower GIE samples) were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on saliva samples did not show any positive results in either upper or lower GIE samples. However, 2.0% (16/783) of gastrointestinal fluid samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No significant differences in age, sex, purpose of endoscopy, medication, or rate of antibody test positivity were found between PCR positive and PCR negative cases.

We observed a high 28-day mortality rate of patients that did not complete the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide, compared to the placebo arm.

Despite the inherent limitations of OT analysis, we aimed to respond to unanswered questions regarding the drug efficacy when the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide was complete, and secondarily understand the causality relationship between treatment interruption and mortality rate. MethodsThis is a post-hoc exploratory analysis of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicentric, two-arm RCT of 300mg-daily 14-day proxalutamide therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. OT population excluded patients that did not complete the full 14-day course of therapy or died from COVID-19 complications within 24 hours of randomization. The primary outcome was the 28-day COVID-19 mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included median hospital length, 14-day and 28-day alive hospital discharge rate and 28-day all-cause mortality rate of those who discontinued intervention. ResultsIn total, 580 patients completed the 14-day treatment or died during treatment, including 288 patients in the proxalutamide arm and 292 patients in the placebo arm, with similar baseline characteristics between groups. The 28-day COVID-19 mortality rate was 4.2% in the proxalutamide group and 49.0% in the placebo group. The mortality risk ratio (RR) was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05-0.15), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.2 to prevent death. The median hospital length stay after randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 3 to 7.2 days) in the proxalutamide group and 9 days (IQR = 6 to 15 days) in the placebo group (p <0.001). The 28-day all-cause mortality rate of patients that received proxalutamide but interrupted treatment before 14 days was 79.3%, while those that received placebo and interrupted before 14 days was 52.8% (p = 0.054 between groups). ConclusionThe reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality rate with 14-day proxalutamide treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was more significant while on treatment adhesion (92%), compared to the reduction when all patients enrolled in the proxalutamide arm were considered (77.7%). However, the magnitude of statistical significance of the reduction in all-cause mortality and the NNT were similar between the OT and ITT analysis. The apparent high mortality risk rate with early interruption of proxalutamide treatments suggests that strategies for treatment compliance should be reinforced for future RCTs with proxalutamide.

Using immunoinformatics, several scientists are trying to identify and characterize T cell and B cell epitopes as well as design peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. In this review article, we have tried to discuss the importance in adaptive immunity and its significance for designing the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Moreover, we have attempted to illustrate several significant key points for utilizing immunoinformatics for vaccine designing, such as the criteria for selection and identification of epitopes, T cell epitope, and B cell epitope prediction and different emerging tools/databases for immunoinformatics. In the current scenario, a few immunoinformatics studies have been performed for various infectious pathogens and related diseases. Thus, we have also summarized and included these current immunoinformatics studies in this review article. Finally, we have discussed about the probable T cell and B cell epitopes and their identification and characterization for vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2.","Chakraborty, Chiranjib; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Bhattacharya, Manojit; Sharma, Garima; Lee, Sang-Soo",Arch. med. res,,20

As this is a highly contagious virus, it is imperative to understand RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the key component in virus replication. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 80% sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV, their RdRps and nucleotidyl-transferases (NiRAN) share 98.1% and 93.2% identity, respectively. Sequence alignment of six coronaviruses demonstrated higher identity among their RdRps (60.9%-98.1%) and lower identity among their Spike proteins (27%-77%). Thus, a 3D structural model of RdRp, NiRAN, non-structural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 was generated by modeling starting from the SARS counterpart structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2. The network of interactions established by these drug molecules affirms their efficacy to inhibit viral RNA replication and provides an insight into their structure-based rational optimization for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.","Zhang, Wen-Fa; Stephen, Preyesh; Thériault, Jean-François; Wang, Ruixuan; Lin, Sheng-Xiang",J Phys Chem Lett,,20

We determined prevalence and predictors of empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Randomly sampled cohort of 1705 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 38 Michigan hospitals between 3/13/2020-6/18/2020. Data were collected on early (prescribed within 2 days of hospitalization) empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections (positive culture or diagnostic test within 3 days). Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to assess predictors of empiric antibacterial use. RESULTS: Of 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6% were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy; 3.5% (59/1705) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. Across hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied from 27%-84%. Patients were more likely to receive early empiric antibacterial therapy if they were older (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]: 1.04 [1.00-1.08] per 10 years), had a lower body mass index (ARR: 0.99 [0.99-1.00] per kg/m 2), had more severe illness (e.g., severe sepsis, ARR: 1.16 [1.07-1.27]), had a lobar infiltrate (ARR: 1.21 [1.04-1.42]), or were admitted to a for-profit hospital (ARR: 1.30 [1.15-1.47]). Over time, COVID-19 test turnaround time (returned &#8804;1 day in March [54.2%, 461/850] vs. in April [85.2%, 628/737], P<.001) and empiric antibacterial use (ARR: 0.71 [0.63-0.81] April vs. March) decreased. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of confirmed community-onset bacterial co-infections was low. Despite this, half of patients received early empiric antibacterial therapy. Antibacterial use varied widely by hospital. Reducing COVID-19 test turnaround time and supporting stewardship could improve antibacterial use.","Vaughn, Valerie M; Gandhi, Tejal; Petty, Lindsay A; Patel, Payal K; Prescott, Hallie C; Malani, Anurag N; Ratz, David; McLaughlin, Elizabeth; Chopra, Vineet; Flanders, Scott A",Clin. infect. dis,,20

Informatics pharmacists can combine their clinical and information technology skills to help provide essential patient safety services related to medication management, procurement and analytics. The objective of this study was to determine the key opportunities for a pharmacist informatician to improve patient care and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Fourteen expert informatics professionals involved in the provision of digital health in Queensland, Australia, were invited to participate in a brief semistructured interview. Transcripts were manually coded, through iterative readings of the text to identify participant responses related to opportunities for a pharmacist informatician to assist during COVID-19. Inductive thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke, was used to identify groups of text related to the provision of digital health, informatics and change of practice during a pandemic. The relevant codes were then grouped into themes to help answer the research question. KEY FINDINGS: Twelve experts agreed to participate, they included nine informatics pharmacists and three digital health experts from hospital and community. Two key themes and 13 codes related to enabling safer and more efficient workflow and use of data analytics to optimise care were identified. The first theme related to 'social distancing without compromising care' for example, by using the electronic capabilities of digital hospitals and telehealth services. The second theme related to the use of real-time data streaming to optimise patient flow and timely medication procurement and management. Examples of quotes from transcripts were used to provide context and answer the research question. CONCLUSIONS: The experts interviewed identified areas where informatics pharmacists have the potential to assist with maintaining high quality patient care during this pandemic, and in future disasters. Improving awareness, training, and the integration about informatics roles as a result of this global pandemic will likely assist with future patient management in the event of future disasters.","Falconer, Nazanin; Monaghan, Corey; Snoswell, Centaine L",Int J Pharm Pract,,20

As pet cats often live in very close contact with their owners, it is essential to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infections in cats in a One-Health context. This study reports the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cat in a COVID-19-affected household in Switzerland. The cat (Cat 1) demonstrated signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, including sneezing, inappetence, and apathy, while the cohabiting cat (Cat 2) remained asymptomatic. Nasal, oral, fecal, fur, and environmental swab samples were collected twice from both cats and analyzed by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Both nasal swabs from Cat 1 tested positive. In addition, the first oral swab from Cat 2 and fur and bedding swabs from both cats were RT-qPCR positive. The fecal swabs tested negative. The infection of Cat 1 was confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody testing and neutralizing activity in a surrogate assay. The viral genome sequence from Cat 1, obtained by next generation sequencing, showed the closest relation to a human sequence from the B.1.1.39 lineage, with one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference. This study demonstrates not only SARS-CoV-2 infection of a cat from a COVID-19-affected household but also contamination of the cats' fur and bed with viral RNA.

Rats performed the incremental exercise test and behavioural tests before and after training at day 1 (D1), D15, D29 and D57. Key cerebral markers were assessed by Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to provide information on brain function related to angiogenesis, aerobic metabolism and neurotrophin activity at D59. Muscular protein levels involved in angiogenesis and aerobic metabolism were measured in both triceps brachii and soleus muscles. HIIT induced superior improvement of aerobic fitness compared to MICT, as indicated by enhancement of speed associated with lactate threshold (SLT) and maximal speed (Smax). In the triceps brachii muscle, markers of angiogenesis and aerobic activity were upregulated as well as myokines involved in neuroplasticity. Moreover, levels of key brain plasticity markers increased in the hippocampus after 8 weeks of HIIT, without improving cognitive functions. These findings might contribute to define physical exercise guidelines for maintaining brain health by highlighting the promising role of HIIT when using SLT for distinguishing low running speed from high running speed. Further studies are required to confirm these brain effects by exploring synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis mechanisms when exercise intensity is standardized and individualized.","Constans, Annabelle; Pin-Barre, Caroline; Molinari, Florence; Temprado, Jean-Jacques; Brioche, Thomas; Pellegrino, Christophe; Laurin, Jérôme",Behav Brain Res,,20

Despite their significance, however, a gap remains in our understanding of the underlying characteristics of messages used to disseminate COVID-19 conspiracies. We used the construct of resonance as a framework to examine a sample of more than 1.8 million posts to Twitter about COVID-19 made between April and June 2020. Our analyses focused on the psycholinguistic properties that distinguish conspiracy theory tweets from other COVID-19 topics and predict their spread. COVID-19 conspiracy tweets were distinct and most likely to resonate when they provided explanations and expressed negative emotions. The results highlight the sensemaking functions served by conspiracy tweets in response to the profound upheaval caused by the pandemic.","Rains, Stephen A; Leroy, Gondy; Warner, Echo L; Harber, Philip",Health Commun,,20

489941,Is targeting Akt a viable option to treat advanced-stage COVID-19 patients?,2020,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to portray the prevalence and associated factors of psychological distress among frontline nurses during COVID-19 outbreak. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has posed great threat to public health worldwide. Nurses fighting against the epidemic on the frontline might be under great physical and psychological distress. This psychological distress was predominantly described as sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress, inability to make decisions and even somatic symptoms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Frontline nurses from designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients were invited to complete an online survey by convenience sampling, and the survey included six main sections: the General Health Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, socio-demographic, occupation and work history. Multiple logistic analysis was used to identify the potential risk factors of psychological distress. The study methods were compliant with the STROBE checklist. RESULTS: Of the 263 frontline nurses, 66 (25.1%) were identified as psychological distress. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that working in emergency department, concern for family, being treated differently, negative coping style and COVID-19-related stress symptom were positive related to psychological distress. Perceived more social support and effective precautionary measures were negatively associated with psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that COVID-19 had a significant psychological impact on frontline nurses. Early detection of psychological distress and supportive intervention should be taken according to the associated factors to prevent more serious psychological impact on frontline nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlighted that the frontline nurses were suffering from varying degrees of psychological distress, which needed early screening and supportive intervention for preventing more serious psychological impact on frontline nurses. Beside, more specific measurement should be combined with the GHQ-12 to assess the varying degrees of psychological distress in frontline nurses.","Nie, Anliu; Su, Xiangfen; Zhang, Shuzeng; Guan, Wenjie; Li, Jianfeng",J. clin. nurs,,20

The measurement tools used attitude, subjective norms, control, and mask use intention factors based on the TPB. Overall, 545 individuals participated, and the non-overlapping regions, sex, and age were considered through the stratified sampling method. The survey was conducted online owing to COVID-19, and collected data were derived through descriptive and multiple linear regression analyses. First, a difference in mask-wearing intention based on physical and non-physical leisure activities was identified; second, attitudes and perceived behaviors were considered in light of the dangers posed by COVID-19. It was found that control influences the tendency of intention to wear a mask depending on whether the group was engaged in physical or non-physical activity. Therefore, it can be stated that mask-wearing must be mandatory during physical and non-physical activities owing to respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. It is also important to simultaneously promote a positive attitude toward mask-wearing to enable people to believe that they can stay in full control of their own health.","Kim, Young-Jae; Cho, Jeong-Hyung; Kang, Seung-Woo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,20

Our understanding of its pathophysiology and potential management was initially extrapolated from previous epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic in more than 80% of patients and requires no additional management; however, the remaining patients progress to pneumonia and hypoxemia with ranging severity, including a smaller group that requires intensive care unit admission. To date, there are no approved treatments for SARS-CoV-2, and current management is focused on supplemental oxygen and supportive care. The antiviral medication remdesivir recently received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe disease. Multiple clinical trials evaluating different treatment modalities such as antivirals, immunomodulators, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies, among others, are still ongoing. We believe that patients present with clinical phenotypes that correlate with the spectrum of disease. Each phenotype may benefit from one or multiple interventions.

Technologies can also be catalysts of change. While digital technologies are playing a vital role in tackling the covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic also presents a significant opportunity for digital technologies. Some experts believe the pandemic may permanently normalise the comprehensive societal use of digital technologies. This article casts a critical eye over the potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information systems (IS) research and development. We introduce and outline selected principles of Zygmunt Bauman's theory of liquid modernity. We then apply the liquid-modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the covid-19 literature by focussing on three areas of established information systems interest: control, big data and information privacy. We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal order and control need to be reassessed; that big data alone cannot order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or circumvented by public and private actors. We conclude by making four recommendations for IS pandemic researchers and five practical recommendations in the context of the pandemic.","Doyle, Ronan; Conboy, Kieran",Int J Inf Manage,,20

496258,The Key Roles of Interferon Lambda in Human Molecular Defense against Respiratory Viral Infections,2020,"The tests currently used for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 include specimens taken from the upper and lower respiratory tract. Although recommendations from the World Health Organization prioritise the usage of a nasopharyngeal swab (NS), nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) are thought to be superior in identifying SARS-CoV-2 in children. To our knowledge, however, no paediatric study has been published on the subject. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of NS referred to NPA for SARS-CoV-2 in children. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the NS referred to the NPA of the whole sample and considered both age and collection period as covariates in different analyses. We collected 300 paired samples. The NS had a specificity of 97.7% and a sensitivity of 58.1%. We found similar results for the group of subjects &#8805; 6 years old, while for subjects < 6 years old, the sensitivity was 66.7% and the specificity 97.8%. Considering period as a covariate, the sensitivity and specificity for patients hospitalised in March (31 patients, 52 records) were 70.0% and 97.6%, while for patients involved in the follow-up (16 patients, 57 records), they were 57.2% and 89.7%. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to the NPA, whereas its specificity is high. Our results suggest that in children under 6 years of age, NSs should be preferred whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of the NS rises when performed before the NPA.","Di Pietro, Giada Maria; Capecchi, Ester; Luconi, Ester; Lunghi, Giovanna; Bosis, Samantha; Bertolozzi, Giuseppe; Cantoni, Barbara; Marano, Giuseppe; Boracchi, Patrizia; Biganzoli, Elia; Castaldi, Silvana; Marchisio, Paola",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,20

498667,In reply,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Recent reports suggest SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, may be transmittable from pregnant mother to placenta and fetus, albeit rarely. The efficacy of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 critically depends on the availability of its receptor, ACE2, in the placenta. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that placental ACE2 expression is oxygenation-dependent by studying the expression of ACE2 and associated cell entry regulators in the monochorionic twin anemia-polycythemia (TAPS) placenta, a model of discordant placental oxygenation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective comparative immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B expression in anemic and polycythemic territories of TAPS placentas (N = 14). RESULTS: ACE2 protein levels were significantly higher in the anemic twin territories than in the corresponding polycythemic territories, associated with upregulation of the key ACE2-related cell entry regulators, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B, immunolocalized to villous trophoblastic and stromal cells. Cellular colocalization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggestive of functionality of this cell entry axis, was demonstrated by double immunofluorescence studies. DISCUSSION: Placental hypoxia is associated with upregulation of ACE2 expression, concomitant with increased expression of its key cell entry proteases. ACE2-regulated placental functions, both infection- and non-infection related, may be highly oxygenation-dependent.","Mao, Quanfu; Chu, Sharon; Shapiro, Svetlana; Bliss, Joseph M; De Paepe, Monique E",Placenta,,20

It has also come to the world’s attention that spraying of disinfectants has been especially used on people who are migrating from one part of the country to another. In this letter, I have made an attempt to discuss some major impacts of NaOCl on human health as well as atmospheric chemistry. NaOCl once emitted into the air reacts easily with the water vapor to form HOCl that further gets photo-dissociated into various reactive species. These reactive species have significant potentials to participate in various tropospheric chemistry of chlorine radical, ozone, S (IV) oxidation, hydrocarbon oxidation, modification of chloride salts etc. I have also recommended some important steps to be taken if spraying of NaOCl is deemed essential.","Chatterjee, Abhijit",Aerosol Air Qual.

Esse parasito possui uma grande importância na medicina veterinária, pois está relacionado à doença neuromuscular em cães e ao abortamento em bovinos, gerando perdas afetivas e econômicas. A resposta imune de padrão Th1 é uma das principais responsáveis pelo controle da infecção, mediando a ativação de vias celulares culminando na produção de moléculas efetoras que reduzem a replicação do parasito. Esse trabalho teve como objetivo, avaliar o papel de alguns destes fatores na produção e função de anticorpos específicos contra os antígenos de N. caninum. Para avaliar a produção e função dos anticorpos produzidos, camundongos WT e geneticamente deficientes para TLR2, MyD88, IFN-, IL-12, MHCII e iNOS foram imunizados com antígeno solúvel do parasito (NLA). Amostras de soros foram obtidos em cinética durante a imunização e quantificados por ELISA indireto. O perfil de reconhecimento antigênico destas amostras foi avaliado por immunoblotting e as funções biológicas desses anticorpos, analisadas por meio de ensaios de lise mediada pelo complemento e opsonização dos parasitos. Os resultados obtidos mediante estas análises demonstraram que a ausência de alguns dos fatores cruciais para a indução de uma resposta Th1 (TLR2, IFN- e IL-12) não alteraram a produção de anticorpos IgM e IgG, camundongos MyD88-/-, MHCII-/- e iNOS-/- apresentaram uma redução significativa desses níveis de anticorpos e seu reconhecimento antigênico. Tal redução na produção desses anticorpos nestes animais geneticamente deficientes encontrou-se associado a redução de suas funções clássicas, como lise mediada pelo complemento e opsonização.

METHODS: A 43-question survey was sent to cardiac surgery Centres worldwide. The survey analysed the pre-pandemic organization of the Centre, the Centre's response to Covid-19 in terms of re-organization pathways, surveillance methods, personalprotective equipment (PPE), and allowed surgical practice with results. RESULTS: Sixty-one out of 64 Centres (95.3%) fulfilled the survey. One third of ICUs were transformed into COVID-19 dedicated-ICUs and one-third moved to another location inside the hospital. Negative-pressure rooms were available in 60.6% Centres. Informative measures from hospital administration were received after the first COVID-19 admitted case in 36.1% and during the spread of the infection inside the hospital in 19.6%. Inadequate supply of PPE was common, with no COVID-surveillance of the medical personnel in 4.9% of Centres. COVID-19 infected 7.4% of staff surgeons , 8.3% of residents and 9.5% of anaesthetists. Cardiac surgery caseload declined in 93.4% Centres. COVID-19 infection in patients receiving cardiac surgery resulted in 41-50% mortality in 9.5% Centres, and 91-100% mortality in 4.7% Centres. Successful weaning with survival from V-V ECMO and V-A ECMO was <50% in 79.2% and 80.0% Centres respectively. COVID-19 infection in transplanted patients was rare, with a reported mortality of 0.5% and 1% in one Centre each.

The paper used two methods;the first comprehensive sense and respond analysis investigated technology developers’ perceptions using the value propositions defined under the EU-funded H2020 RESOLVD project. The second method focused on customers and collected a survey which covered challenges, value propositions and preparedness to adopt new technology. The H2020 RESOLVD project has developed an intelligent low-voltage grid management system with storage. The results from the sense and respond analysis showed that most of the value propositions aligned with the responses from the broader survey which are needed within five years (e.g., improved power quality of grid, fault detection, reduced technical loss). However, the cybersecurity perception differed between developers and distribution system operators (DSOs). The customer survey highlighted that certain value propositions of technological solutions are needed more urgently than others, and therefore, technology developers should prioritize these in further developments. Regarding the use of flexibility to manage the LV grid, unclear regulations were expressed as a key barrier, thereby affecting business feasibility around battery storage.","Alemu Moges, Belay Puranik Sanket Díaz-González Francisco Tuiskula Heidi",Applied Sciences,,20

Therefore it was not clear either how the pandemic would impact the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. AIM: To develop a mathematical model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected persons, for early estimation of the epidemic's course, its Infection Fatality Rate and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. METHODS: The SEIRS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model including deaths outside hospitals and separate assessments of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (based on seroprevalence) with different immunological memories. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. RESULTS: The calculations and simulations made by the model were shown to fit with the observed development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. The antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population, the Infection Mortality Rate was only 0.4%. However, with no non-pharmacological restrictions the COVID-19 death toll was calculated to have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate â0 was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8-1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The large asymptomatic population made the termination of the epidemic difficult and micro-outbreaks occurred when the country re-opened. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1-20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model show, that COVID-19 has a low Infection Fatality Rate because the majority of infected persons are either asymptomatic or with few symptoms. A minority of the infected persons, therefore, requires hospitalization. That means that for a given infection pressure of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected there will be a lower pressure on the capacity of the health care system than previously predicted. Further the epidemic will be difficult to terminate since about 84% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic but still contagious. The model may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the autumn-winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. The simulation may also be useful to evaluate different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. The model can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which is illustrated with Spain and USA.","Rasmussen, Steen; Petersen, Michael Skytte; Høiby, Niels",PLoS One,,20

Res. 164 (2021) 105402]",2021,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to investigate how families prepared children for the death of a significant adult, and how health and social care professionals provided psychosocial support to families about a relative's death during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN/SETTING: A mixed methods design; an observational survey with health and social care professionals and relatives bereaved during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and in-depth interviews with bereaved relatives and professionals were conducted. Data were analysed thematically. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 623 participants completed the survey and interviews were conducted with 19 bereaved relatives and 16 professionals. RESULTS: Many children were not prepared for a death of an important adult during the pandemic. Obstacles to preparing children included families' lack of understanding about their relative's declining health; parental belief that not telling children was protecting them from becoming upset; and parents' uncertainty about how best to prepare their children for the death. Only 10.2% (n=11) of relatives reported professionals asked them about their deceased relative's relationships with children. This contrasts with 68.5% (n=72) of professionals who reported that the healthcare team asked about patient's relationships with children. Professionals did not provide families with psychosocial support to facilitate preparation, and resources were less available or inappropriate for families during the pandemic. Three themes were identified: (1) obstacles to telling children a significant adult is going to die, (2) professionals' role in helping families to prepare children for the death of a significant adult during the pandemic, and (3) how families prepare children for the death of a significant adult. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals need to: provide clear and honest communication about a poor prognosis; start a conversation with families about the dying patient's significant relationships with children; and reassure families that telling children someone close to them is dying is beneficial for their longer term psychological adjustment.","Rapa, Elizabeth; Hanna, Jeffrey R; Mayland, Catriona R; Mason, Stephen; Moltrecht, Bettina; Dalton, Louise J",BMJ Open,,20

516632,Implications of preexisting asthma on COVID-19 pathogenesis,2021,"Social media (e.g., Twitter) has been an extremely popular tool for public health surveillance. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first pandemic experienced by a world connected through the internet. We analyzed 105+ million tweets collected between March 1 and May 15, 2020, and Weibo messages compiled between January 20 and May 15, 2020, covering six languages (English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and Chinese) and represented an estimated 2.4 billion citizens worldwide. To examine fine-grained emotions during a pandemic, we built machine learning classification models based on deep learning language models to identify emotions in social media conversations about COVID-19, including positive expressions (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), negative expressions (pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, and denial), and a complicated expression, joking, which has not been explored before. Our analysis indicates a rapid increase and a slow decline in the volume of social media conversations regarding the pandemic in all six languages. The upsurge was triggered by a combination of economic collapse and confinement measures across the regions to which all the six languages belonged except for Chinese, where only the latter drove conversations. Tweets in all analyzed languages conveyed remarkably similar emotional states as the epidemic was elevated to pandemic status, including feelings dominated by a mixture of joking with anxious/pessimistic/annoyed as the volume of conversation surged and shifted to a general increase in positive states (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), the strongest being expressed in Arabic tweets, as the pandemic came under control.","Zhang, Xiangliang Yang Qiang Somayah Albaradei Lyu Xiaoting Alamro Hind Salhi Adil Ma Changsheng Alshehri Manal Jaber Inji Ibrahim Faroug Tifratene Wang Wei Gojobori Takashi Duarte Carlos M.; Gao, Xin",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,,20

518633,Antiphospholipid antibodies and risk of post-COVID-19 vaccination thrombophilia: The straw that breaks the camel's back?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Facing the global health crisis of COVID-19, health systems are increasingly supporting the use of telemedicine in ambulatory care settings. It is not clear whether the increased use of telemedicine will persist after the pandemic has resolved. The aims of this study were to assess the use of telemedicine by Israeli pediatricians before and during the first lockdown phase of the pandemic, and to elucidate how they foresee telemedicine as a medium of medical practice in the post-pandemic era. METHODS: A web-based survey was distributed among Israeli pediatricians in May 2020, soon after the end of first lockdown was announced. The survey assessed the frequency of telemedicine use as well as its influence on clinical decision making before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown, using two hypothetical clinical scenarios. The same scenarios were also used to assess how the pediatricians foresaw telemedicine in the post-pandemic period. In addition, administrative data from Maccabi on telemedicine use before, during and after the first lockdown were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-nine pediatricians responded to the survey (response rate = 40%). The percentage of respondents who reported daily use of text messages, pictures and videoconferencing increased from 24, 15 and 1% before COVID-19 to 40, 40 and 12% during the lockdown, respectively (p < 0.05). After the pandemic, projected use of text messages and pictures/videoclips was expected to decrease to 27 and 26% of respondents, respectively (p < 0.05), but pictures/videoclips were expected to increase from 15% of respondents before to 26% of respondents after (p < 0.05). The reported high likelihood of treating suspected pneumonia or prescribing antibiotics for suspected otitis media via telemedicine was expected to decrease from 20% of respondents during the COVID-19 lockdown to 6%% of respondents after (p < 0.05), and from 14% of respondents during the lockdown to 3% of respondents after, respectively. (p < 0.05). Maccabi administrative data indicated that during the lockdown, there was an increase in phone visits and a decrease in in-person visits compared to the pre-lockdown levels of use. One month after the end of the first lock-down there was a partial return to baseline levels of in-person visits and a sustained increase in phone visits. Phone visits accounted for 0% of pediatrician visits before the first lockdown, 17% of them during the lockdown, and 19% of them 1 month after the lockdown relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that use of telemedicine technologies by primary care pediatricians increased substantially during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The study also found that pediatricians expected that use levels will recede after the pandemic. As the pandemic continues and evolves, it will be important to continue to monitor the level of telemedicine use as well as expectations regarding post-pandemic use levels.","Grossman, Zachi; Chodick, Gabriel; Reingold, Stephen M; Chapnick, Gil; Ashkenazi, Shai",Isr J Health Policy Res,,20
520287,"Genetic variation in toll like receptors 2, 7, 9 and interleukin-6 is associated with cytomegalovirus infection in late pregnancy",2020,"Europe was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and Portugal was one of the most affected countries, having suffered three waves in the first twelve months. Approximately between Jan 19th and Feb 5th 2021 Portugal was the country in the world with the largest incidence rate, with 14-days incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants in excess of 1000. Despite its importance, accurate prediction of the geospatial evolution of COVID-19 remains a challenge, since existing analytical methods fail to capture the complex dynamics that result from both the contagion within a region and the spreading of the infection from infected neighboring regions. We use a previously developed methodology and official municipality level data from the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health (DGS), relative to the first twelve months of the pandemic, to compute an estimate of the incidence rate in each location of mainland Portugal. The resulting sequence of incidence rate maps was then used as a gold standard to test the effectiveness of different approaches in the prediction of the spatial-temporal evolution of the incidence rate. Four different methods were tested: a simple cell level autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, a cell level vector autoregressive (VAR) model, a municipality-by-municipality compartmental SIRD model followed by direct block sequential simulation and a convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural network model based on the STConvS2S architecture. We conclude that the convolutional sequence-to-sequence neural network is the best performing method, when predicting the medium-term future incidence rate, using the available information.","Cardoso, M'ario; Cavalheiro, Andr'e; Borges, Alexandre; Duarte, Ana F.; Soares, Am'ilcar; Pereira, Maria Joao; Nunes, Nuno J.; Azevedo, Leonardo; Oliveira, Arlindo L.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02752v1.pdf,20

Although the COVID-19 pandemic is primarily associated with respiratory tract system but measures like lockdown and restricted physical movements to control the spread of this infection will certainly have neurobehavioural implications. Additionally, some of the patients with pre-existing neurological manifestations like epilepsy, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease are more prone to infection and demands extra as well as improvisation in their treatment therapy. In this review we have focused on the neurovirological clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19 pandemic. Although the prevalence of neurovirological manifestations is rare but increasing reports cannot be ignored and needs to be discussed thoroughly with respect to risk analysis and considerations for developing management strategy.

Little is known about the subjective burden, views, and COVID-19 infection status of HCWs. The aim of this work was to evaluate the subjective burden, the perception of the information policies, and the agreement on structural measures in a large cohort of German HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. This country-wide anonymous online survey was carried out from April 15th until May 1st, 2020. 25 content-related questions regarding the subjective burden and other dimensions were evaluated. We evaluated different dimensions of subjective burden, stress, and perspectives using 5-point Likert-scale questions. Moreover, the individual COVID-19 infection status, the amount of people infected in circle of friends and acquaintances and the hours working overtime were assessed. A total of 3669 HCWs provided sufficient responses for analyses. 2.8% of HCWs reported to have been tested positive for COVID-19. Nurses reported in principle higher ratings on all questions of subjective burden and stress than doctors and other hospital staff. Doctors (3.6%) and nurses (3.1%) were more likely to be tested positive for COVID-19 than other hospital staff (0.6%, Chi(2)2 = 17.39, p < 0.0005). HCWs who worked in a COVID-19 environment reported higher levels of subjective burden and stress compared to all other participants. Working in a COVID-19 environment increased the likelihood to be tested positive for COVID-19 (4.8% vs. 2.3%, Chi(1)2 = 12.62, p < 0.0005) and the severity of the subjective burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses experience more stress than doctors. Overall, German HCWs showed high scores of agreement with the measures taken by the hospitals.","Kramer, Victoria; Papazova, Irina; Thoma, Andreas; Kunz, Miriam; Falkai, Peter; Schneider-Axmann, Thomas; Hierundar, Anke; Wagner, Elias; Hasan, Alkomiet",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,,20

Influenza viruses lacking NS1 (ΔNS1) are under clinical development as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines and induce potent influenza virus-specific humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Attenuation of ΔNS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a ΔNS1 virus results in an immediate antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that ΔNS1 influenza viruses could be used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on ΔNS1 live attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.","Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Salvatore, Mirella; Zheng, Hongyong; Jangra, Sonia; Kehrer, Thomas; Mena, Ignacio; Schotsaert, Michael; Muster, Thomas; Palese, Peter; García-Sastre, Adolfo",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948589/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.28.441797,20

The pandemic requires adaptation of the health care standards, including epidemiological surveillance, logistics of home supply and monitoring. Potential lack of medical professionals may worsen the standard of care. The aim of the analysis was to evaluate the medical staff resources in HPN units. RESULTS: The study was conducted by major Polish scientific societies in clinical nutrition. A questionnaire was distributed among all Polish adult HPN centers concerning statistics from the first three months of the pandemic (March-May 2020). Data on medical staff resources and organizational issues of the units were collected. Modifications of the home procedures, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of HPN patients and health care workers (HCW) were analyzed. Influence of the pandemic on the rates of new qualifications for HAN (home artificial nutrition) was estimated. 14 of 17 adult Polish HPN units took part in the study. The point prevalence of HPN in Poland was 30.75 per million citizens. 344 HCW are involved in patients’ care in Polish HPN units; 18.9% are physicians (49%-surgeons, 18.46%-internal medicine specialists, 15.38%-Anesthesiologists, 7.69%-Pediatricians, 1.54%- Palliative care specialists), 32.27% nurses, 5.23% dietitians, 9.01% pharmacists, 4.94% pharmacy technicians, 3.2% pharmacy assistants, 5.81% administrative workers, 3.49% physiotherapists. HAN Patient to HCW ratios for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians were respectively: 49.5; 29.15; 111.6; 181.6. Medium age of physicians and nurses was: 45.6 and 44.15. 53.8% of physicians and 31.53% of nurses work parallelly in hospital wards. 31 Pharmacists overall are working in all HPN units (2.21 per unit) and 18 dietitians (1.3 per unit). 9 patients had a confirmed COVID-19 infection (4- HPN, 5-HEN). All the units introduced telemedical solutions in the first months of the pandemic. The number of new qualifications for HPN and HEN in the units did not significantly decline in March-May in comparison with a similar period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: A shortage of HPN medical professionals requires attention when planning health care organization, especially during a pandemic. Severe restrictions in public health system may not reduce the number of new qualifications for the HPN procedure. There is a need for the continuation of data collection during the evolution of the pandemic as it may have a detrimental impact on HPN including serious issues with access to professional HCW.","Folwarski, Marcin; Kłęk, Stanisław; Matras, Przemysław; Bartoszewska, Lidia; Bednarz, Sławomir; Jakubczyk, Marlena; Kamocki, Zbigniew; Krasowski, Grzegorz; Kunecki, Marek; Kwella, Bogna; Matysiak-Luśnia, Katarzyna; Matysiak, Konrad; Pierzynowska, Gabriela; Szafrański, Waldemar; Szopiński, Jacek; Urbanowicz, Krystyna; Sobocki, Jacek",Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.111202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735654/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900721000642; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900721000642?v=s5,20

So far, few studies focused on very elderly patients (over 80 years old). In this study we examined the clinical presentation and the outcome of the disease in this group of patients, admitted to our Hospital in Rome. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study performed in the Sant’Andrea University Hospital of Rome. We included patients older than 65 years of age with a diagnosis of COVID-19, from March 2020 to May 2020, divided in two groups according to their age (Elderly: 65–80 years old; Very Elderly > 80 years old). Data extracted from the each patient record included age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms at onset, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) to the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) (P/F) on admission, laboratory tests, radiological findings on computer tomography (CT), length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality rate and the viral shedding. The differences between the two groups were analyzed by the Fisher’s exact test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. To assess significance among multiple groups of factors, we used the Bonferroni correction. The survival time was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and Log Rank Test. Univariate and Multivariate logistic regression were performed to estimate associations between age, comorbidities, provenance from long-stay residential care homes (LSRCH) s and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found that Very Elderly patients had an increased mortality rate, also due to the frequent occurrence of multiple comorbidities. Moreover, we found that patients coming from LSRCHs appeared to be highly susceptible and vulnerable to develop severe manifestations of the disease. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that there were considerable differences between Elderly and Very Elderly patients in terms of inflammatory activity, severity of disease, adverse clinical outcomes. To establish a correct risk stratification, comorbidities and information about provenience from LSRCHs should be considered.","D’ascanio, M.; Innammorato, M.; Pasquariello, L.; Pizzirusso, D.; Guerrieri, G.; Castelli, S.; Pezzuto, A.; De vitis, C.; Anibaldi, P.; Marcolongo, A.; Mancini, R.; Ricci, A.; Sciacchitano, S.",BMC Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451296/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02013-3,20

It seems that prevailing over the pandemic would be achieved only by mastering over the virus pathophysiology. We tried to categorize the massive amount of available information for useful interpretation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched databases with different keywords and search strategies that focus on virulence and pathophysiology of COVID-19. The present review has aimed to gather and categorize all implemented drugs based on the susceptible virulence mechanisms, and the pathophysiological events in the host cells, discussing and suggesting treatments. RESULTS: As a result, the COVID-19 lifecycle were categorized as following steps: “Host Cell Attachment” which is mainly conducted with ACE(2) receptors and TMPRSS2 from the host cell and Spike (S) protein, “Endocytosis Pathway” which is performed mainly by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and “Viral Replication” which contains translation and replication of RNA viral genome. The virus pathogenicity is continued by “Inflammatory Reactions” which mainly caused moderate to severe COVID-19 disease. Besides, the possible effective therapeutics’ mechanism and the pharmaceutical agents that had at least one experience as a preclinical or clinical study on COVID-19 were clearly defined. CONCLUSION: The treatment protocol would be occasional based on the stage of the infection and the patient situation. The cocktail of medicines, which could affect almost all mentioned stages of COVID-19 disease, might be vital for patients with severe phenomena.

592188,Combination of IMOD™ and Arbidol to increase their immunomodulatory effects as a novel medicine to prevent and cure influenza and some other infectious diseases,2014-07-31,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets lead to significant economic losses in livestock husbandry. A high morbidity has been reported for diarrhea (calves ≤ 35 %; piglets ≤ 50 %) and for respiratory diseases (calves ≤ 80 %; piglets ≤ 40 %). Despite a highly diverse etiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, treatment with antimicrobials is often the first-line therapy. Multi-antimicrobial resistance in pathogens results in international accordance to strengthen the research in novel treatment options. Medicinal plants bear a potential as alternative or additional treatment. Based on the versatile effects of their plant specific multi-component-compositions, medicinal plants can potentially act as ‘multi-target drugs’. Regarding the plurality of medicinal plants, the aim of this systematic review was to identify potential medicinal plant species for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases and for modulation of the immune system and inflammation in calves and piglets. RESULTS: Based on nine initial sources including standard textbooks and European ethnoveterinary studies, a total of 223 medicinal plant species related to the treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases was identified. A defined search strategy was established using the PRISMA statement to evaluate 30 medicinal plant species starting from 20’000 peer-reviewed articles published in the last 20 years (1994–2014). This strategy led to 418 references (257 in vitro, 84 in vivo and 77 clinical trials, thereof 48 clinical trials in veterinary medicine) to evaluate effects of medicinal plants and their efficacy in detail. The findings indicate that the most promising candidates for gastrointestinal diseases are Allium sativum L., Mentha x piperita L. and Salvia officinalis L.; for diseases of the respiratory tract Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Thymus vulgaris L. and Althea officinalis L. were found most promising, and Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Camellia sinensis (L.) KUNTZE, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Origanum vulgare L. were identified as best candidates for modulation of the immune system and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Several medicinal plants bear a potential for novel treatment strategies for young livestock. There is a need for further research focused on gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets, and the findings of this review provide a basis on plant selection for future studies.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of responsive design on usability. For this purpose, a questionnaire consisting of a five-point Likert was applied to university students. According to the results, it was seen that 99.2% of university students had smart phones and used smart phones to connect to internet with a rate of 91.3%. It was observed that the participants' attitudes towards responsive design did not differ according to gender, and students in the 24–26 age group had more desire to use responsive design. And, university students' attitudes towards responsive design did not differ according to the Internet access method. It was found that 38% of the participants had a daily internet usage rate of 4–5 h and they used social media the most. Ease of use has been identified as the most preferred feature (Avg = 3.67/5, 73.4%) of usability in responsive design by evaluating dimensions central tendency measures. With regression analysis, responsive design explains 74.7% of the change in effectiveness (R(2) = 0.747) among the usability dimensions. With regression analysis, 91.5% of usability can be explained with the responsive design (R(2) = 0.915). Usability and responsive design (r = 0.92, p < 0.01) were both found to be positively correlated. It can be said that the academic university websites developed with responsive design are preferred by university students in the pandemic and this has increased usability and effectiveness.","Parlakkiliç, Alaattin",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10650-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276238/,20

The management of chronic endocrine disorders during the pandemic period proved particularly challenging, as they require close physician-patient contact for proper long-term management. In addition, acute endocrinologic conditions that presented during the COVID-19 period required timely management in an unusual clinical setting, providing an ongoing challenge for clinicians. This article summarizes the most recent guidance on the management and therapy of frequent conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis and less common endocrine disorders (e.g., adrenal insufficiency) in this setting.","Martino, Marianna; Salvio, Gianmaria; Cutini, Melissa; Arnaldi, Giorgio; Balercia, Giancarlo",Minerva endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34309348/; https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-6507.21.03523-5,20
593181,Multiple sclerosis: Possible immunological mechanisms,1989-01-31,"This retrospective observational case series describes a single centre's preparations and experience of 53 emergency tracheal intubations in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. The findings of a contemporaneous online survey exploring technical and nontechnical aspects of airway management, completed by intubation team members, are also presented. Preparations included developing a COVID-19 intubation standard operating procedure and checklist, dedicated airway trolleys, a consultant-led mobile intubation team, and an airway education programme. Tracheal intubation was successful in all patients. Intubation first-pass success rate was 85%, first-line videolaryngoscopy use 79%, oxygen desaturation 49%, and hypotension 21%. Performance was consistent across all clinical areas. The main factor impeding first-pass success was larger diameter tracheal tubes. The majority of intubations was performed by consultant anaesthetists. Nonconsultant intubations demonstrated higher oxygen desaturation rates (75% vs. 45%, p=0.610) and lower first-pass success (0% vs. 92%, p < 0.001). Survey respondents (n = 29) reported increased anxiety at the start of the pandemic, with statistically significant reduction as the pandemic progressed (median: 4/5 very high vs. 2/5 low anxiety, p < 0.001). Reported procedural/environmental challenges included performing tasks in personal protective equipment (62%), remote-site working (48%), and modification of normal practices (41%)—specifically, the use of larger diameter tracheal tubes (21%). Hypoxaemia was identified by 90% of respondents as the most challenging patient-related factor during intubations. Our findings demonstrate that a consultant-led mobile intubation team can safely perform tracheal intubation in critically ill COVID-19 patients across all clinical areas, aided by thorough preparation and training, despite heightened anxiety levels.","Gandhi, Ajay; Sokhi, Jagdish; Lockie, Chris; Ward, Patrick A.",Anesthesiol Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8816729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376486/,20
594308,Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of Human Rhinovirus Infections in Patients with Hematologic Malignancy,2015-10-01,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared a public health emergency of international concern; this has caused excessive anxiety among health care workers. In addition, publication bias and low-quality publications have become widespread, which can result in the dissemination of unreliable findings. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a meta-analysis with the following two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and determine whether it has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) to investigate whether there has been an increase in publication bias. METHODS: All related studies that were published/released from 2015 to 2020 will be searched in electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsyArXiv, and medRxiv). The risk of bias in individual studies will be assessed using the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the I(2) statistic. The effect size (prevalence rates of anxiety) and a 95% CI for each paper will also be calculated. We will use a moderator analysis to test for the effect of COVID-19 on health care workers’ anxiety levels and detect publication bias in COVID-19 studies. We will also assess publication bias using the funnel plot and Egger regression. In case of publication bias, if studies have no homogeneity, the trim-and-fill procedure will be applied to adjust for missing studies. RESULTS: Database searches will commence in November 2020. The meta-analysis will be completed within 2 months of the start date. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis aims to provide comprehensive evidence about whether COVID-19 increases the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and whether there has been an increase in publication bias and a deterioration in the quality of publications due to the pandemic. The results of this meta-analysis can provide evidence to help health managers to make informed decisions related to anxiety prevention in health care workers.

Aim: Since apparent differences were noted in the disease transmission between the two South East Asian countries of India and Thailand, the study aims to draw comparative account of the progression of COVID 19 in near future between these two countries. Methods: The study used data of COVID 19 confirmed cases in India and Thailand from WHO COVID 19 situation reports during the time period between 25th March, 2020 and 14th May, 2020. After determination of stationarity in the data and differencing, observation of autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (2,2,1) model was used to forecast the COVID 19 confirmed cases in both these countries for two weeks (i.e. 28th May, 2020). IBM SPSS version 20.0 software was used for data analysis. Results: The study demonstrated a possible increasing trend in number of COVID 19 cases in India in the coming two weeks with an estimated point forecast of 1,28,772 (95% CI 115023 to 142520) by 28th May, 2020. A stationary phase was forecasted for Thailand with a difference of only 43 cases between 14th May (the last case of input data) and 28th May. Conclusion: The time series forecasting employed in the present study warrants thorough preparation on part of the Indian health care system and authorities and calls for caution with regard to decisions made on lifting the control measures. The difference in the time series forecasting between these two South East Asian countries also highlights the need for strengthening of public health systems.","Chandu, Viswa Chaitanya",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.16.20103895v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.20103895,20

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of a Stepped-Care approach (predictive analytics + tailored nurse-driven interventions) on healthcare utilization among 370 older adult patients enrolled in a homecare management program and using a Personal Emergency Response System. The Control group (CG) received care as usual, while the Intervention group (IG) received Stepped-Care during a 180-day intervention period. The primary outcome, decrease in emergency encounters, was not statistically significant (15%, p = 0.291). However, compared to the CG, the IG had significant reductions in total 90-day readmissions (68%, p = 0.007), patients with 90-day readmissions (76%, p = 0.011), total 180-day readmissions (53%, p = 0.020), and EMS encounters (49%, p = 0.006).

Cytokine profiling and bioinformatic analyses showed that Th17 cytokine production differentiates CD4(+) T cells from lean, normoglycemic older and younger subjects, and mimics a diabetes-associated Th17 profile. T cells from older compared to younger subjects also had defects in autophagy and mitochondrial bioenergetics that associate with redox imbalance. Metformin ameliorated the Th17 inflammaging profile by increasing autophagy and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics. By contrast, autophagy-targeting siRNA disrupted redox balance in T cells from young subjects and activated the Th17 profile by activating the Th17 master regulator, STAT3, which in turn bound IL-17A and F promoters. Mitophagy-targeting siRNA failed to activate the Th17 profile. We conclude that metformin improves autophagy and mitochondrial function largely in parallel to ameliorate a newly defined inflammaging profile that echoes inflammation in diabetes.","Bharath, Leena P.; Agrawal, Madhur; McCambridge, Grace; Nicholas, Dequina A.; Hasturk, Hatice; Liu, Jing; Jiang, Kai; Liu, Rui; Guo, Zhenheng; Deeney, Jude; Apovian, Caroline M.; Snyder-Cappione, Jennifer; Hawk, Gregory S.; Fleeman, Rebecca M.; Pihl, Riley M.F.; Thompson, Katherine; Belkina, Anna C.; Cui, Licong; Proctor, Elizabeth A.; Kern, Philip A.; Nikolajczyk, Barbara S.",Cell Metab,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120301972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402267/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550413120301972,20

To prevent the virus from spreading to more individuals, it is of great importance to identify and isolate infected individuals through testing. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide. However, performing RT-qPCR is limited to centralized laboratories because of the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment and skilled personnel. Further, it can sometimes give false negative or uncertain results. Recently, new methods have been developed for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis using CRISPR-Cas systems. These methods present rapid and cost-effective diagnostic platforms that provide high sensitivity and specificity without the need for complex instrumentation. Using the CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection methods, it is possible to increase the number of daily tests in existing laboratories, reduce false negative or uncertain result rates obtained with RT-qPCR, and perform testing in resource-limited settings or at points of need where performing RT-qPCR is not feasible. Here, we briefly describe the RT-qPCR method, and discuss its limitations in meeting the current diagnostic needs. We explain how the unique properties of various CRISPR-associated enzymes are utilized for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis. Then, we highlight the important features of CRISPR-based diagnostic methods developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Finally, we examine the advantages and limitations of these methods, and discuss how they can contribute to improving the efficiency of the current testing systems for combating SARS-CoV-2.","Palaz, Fahreddin; Kerem Kalkan, Ali; Tozluyurt, Abdullah; Ozsoz, Mehmet",Clin Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428900/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912021000011?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912021000011; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2020.12.011,20

This study empirically investigates the relationship between exposure to air pollutants that is, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter (SO(2), NO(2), and PM(10)) and COVID‐19 infection at the smallest administrative level (ward) of Mumbai City in India. The paper explores two hypotheses: COVID‐19 infection is associated with air pollution; the pollutants act as determinants of COVID‐19 deaths. Kriging is used to assess the spatial variations of air quality using pollution data, while information on COVID‐19 are retrieved from the database of Mumbai municipality. Annual average of PM(10) in Mumbai over the past 3 years is much higher than the WHO specified standard across all wards; further, suburbs are more exposed to SO(2), and NO(2) pollution. Bivariate local indicator of spatial autocorrelation finds significant positive relation between pollution and COVID‐19 infected cases in certain suburban wards. Spatial Auto Regressive models suggest that COVID‐19 death in Mumbai is distinctly associated with higher exposure to NO(2), population density and number of waste water drains. If specific pollutants along with other factors play considerable role in COVID‐19 infection, it has strong implications for any mitigation strategy development with an objective to curtail the spreading of the respiratory disease. These findings, first of its kind in India, could prove to be significant pointers toward disease alleviation and better urban living.","Chattopadhyay, Aparajita; Shaw, Subhojit",Geohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296050/; https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gh000383,20

Since a substantial proportion of the U.S. population report a non-English language as their primary language, it is critical that information is disseminated in multiple languages. OBJECTIVES: To examine the availability of language translations of visitation restrictions on adult National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers (CCCs) Web sites. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of visitation policies abstracted from public-facing Web sites of CCCs in June 2020. Using U.S. Census data, CCC's city and state proportions of self-identifying Hispanic/Latinx population were categorized into three cohorts: low (<10%), moderate (10%–20%), and high (>20%). RESULTS: As of June 2020, all 50 CCCs published a COVID-19 visitation policy on their Web site. Of these, 33 (66%) posted policies only in English, whereas 17 (34%) included one or more non-English translations. A minority of CCCs published Spanish language resources, which did not differ based on state or city demographics: for example, only 42% (8 of 19), 10% (1 of 10), and 38% (8 of 21) of CCCs published Spanish language resources in cities with low, moderate, and high Hispanic/Latinx populations, respectively. CONCLUSION: Most CCC's did not publish non-English language translations of their visitor policies. Even in cities and states with larger Hispanic/Latinx populations, most CCCs did not publish resources in Spanish.

The understanding that the sector is homogenous and thus could be regulated or managed through uniform intervention, whether legal or otherwise, has prevailed. This was even when existing studies have demonstrated the existence of segmented labour markets with varying employer, work and worker identities. The extension of the Minimum Wages Act to domestic workers, the draft National Policy on Domestic Work, and the Domestic Workers Sector Skill Council (DWSSC) set up under the National Skill Development Council of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship of Government of India, are examined in the paper in detail. The paper highlights how various state interventions have outlined the sector, the work, the workers and their everyday experiences and negotiations in terms of extending or framing these interventions. Examining the assumptions and objectives that have defined the formation of Domestic Workers Sector Skill Development council and its functioning, the paper argues that the attempt to corporatize the sector is a classic case of how the state tends to ignore the specificities that feature the sector leading to its poor impact.","Neetha, N.",Indian J Labour Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41027-021-00334-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393391/,20

We aimed to assess the association between the use of ACEi/ARB and the outcome of COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension in non-endemic areas. Methods: From January 17, 2020, to February 19, 2020, 286 patients with hypertension were enrolled in this retrospective study out of 1,437 COVID-19 patients from 47 centers in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Province. The composite endpoints consisted of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to assess the association between ACEi/ARB and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Results: In the main analysis, 103 patients receiving ACEi/ARB were compared with 173 patients receiving other regimens. Overall, 44 patients (15.94%) had an endpoint event. The risk probability of crude endpoints in the ACEi/ARB group (12.62%) was lower than that in the non-ACEi/ARB group (17.92%). After adjusting for confounding factors by inverse probability weighting, the results showed that the use of ACEi/ARB reduced the occurrence of end events by 47% [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34–0.83]. Similar results were obtained in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: In this retrospective study, among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, the use of ACEi/ARB is not associated with an increased risk of disease severity compared with patients without ACEi/ARB. The trends of beneficial effects of ACEi/ARB need to be further evaluated in randomized clinical trials.","Ma, Jing; Shi, Xiaowei; Yu, Jiong; Lv, Feifei; Wu, Jian; Sheng, Xinyu; Pan, Qiaoling; Yang, Jinfeng; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136537/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.577398,20

Health care workers were at highest risk of infection. The purpose of this study, which was based on Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB), was to determine the extent to which personal attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control influence nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. After the SARS outbreak, a total of 750 staff nurses (response rate 90%) at one hospital completed a questionnaire assessing their intention to provide care to SARS patients. Overall, 42.7% of nurses had a positive intention to provide care to SARS patients, and 25.4% of nurses would volunteer to care for SARS patients. Four factors explaining 35% of the variance in nurses' intention to care for SARS patients were self-efficacy (β = 0.39, p < 0.001), attitude (β = 0.25, p < 0.001), years of working in the study hospital (β = −0.15, p < 0.001), and receiving resources from the hospital (β = 0.13, p < 0.001). Two factors explaining 15% of the variance in nurses' volunteering to care for SARS patients were intention (β = 0.31, p < 0.001) and attitude (β = 0.15, p < 0.001).

The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for NLR and CRP in predicting progression to critical condition was 0.77 (95% CI 0.694-0.846, P < 0.001) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.780-0.905, P < 0.001), with a cut-off value of 2.79 and 25.95 mg/l, respectively. The AUC of NLR and CRP in predicting death was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.732-0.878, P < 0.001) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.825-0.946, P < 0.001), with a cut-off value of 3.19 and 33.4 mg/l, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of NLR and CRP at admission were associated with poor prognosis of moderate COVID-19 patients. NLR and CRP were good predictors of progression to critical condition and death.","Cheng, Biao; Hu, Jiahao; Zuo, Xiuran; Chen, Jian; Li, Xiaochao; Chen, Yuchen; Yang, Guoliang; Shi, Xiaowu; Deng, Aiping",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20303797?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.06.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20303797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622952/,20
604008,Potency of Mesenchymal Stem Cell and Its Secretome in Treating COVID-19,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND: China issued strict nationwide guidelines to combat the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020 and gradually loosened the restrictions on movement in early March. Little is known about how these disease control measures affected the 600 million people who live in rural China. The goal of this paper is to document the quarantine measures implemented in rural China outside the epicenter of Hubei Province and to assess the socioeconomic effect of the measures on rural communities over time. METHODS: We conducted three rounds of interviews with informants from 726 villages in seven provinces, accounting for over 25% of China’s overall rural population. The survey collected data on rural quarantine implementation; COVID-19 infections and deaths in the survey villages; and effects of the quarantine on employment, income, education, health care, and government policies to address any negative impacts. The empirical findings of the work established that strict quarantine measures were implemented in rural villages throughout China in February. RESULTS: There was little spread of COVID-19 in rural communities: an infection rate of 0.001% and zero deaths reported in our sample. However, there were negative social and economic outcomes, including high rates of unemployment, falling household income, rising prices, and disrupted student learning. Health care was generally accessible, but many delayed their non-COVID-19 health care due to the quarantine measures. Only 20% of villagers received any form of local government aid, and only 11% of villages received financial subsidies. There were no reports of national government aid programs that targeted rural villagers in the sample areas. CONCLUSIONS: By examining the economic and social effects of the COVID-19 restrictions in rural communities, this study will help to guide other middle- and low-income countries in their containment and restorative processes. Without consideration for economically vulnerable populations, economic hardships and poverty will likely continue to have a negative impact on the most susceptible communities.

This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of facemasks and respirators on reducing the spread of respiratory viruses. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using MeSH terms, and reported findings according to PRISMA. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science(WoS), and Google Scholar were searched for articles published between 2009 and 2020. Two independent reviewers determined whether the studies met inclusion criteria. The risk of bias of studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa (NOS) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). RESULTS: A total of 1505 articles were initially retrieved and 10 were finally included in our analysis (sample size: 3065). 96.8% of non-infected participants used facemask or respirator in contact with people infected with a respiratory virus, facemask and respirator have a significant effect on reducing the spread of respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: Evidence support that using a facemask or respirator can reduce the spread of all types of respiratory viruses; therefore, this result can be generalized to the present pandemic of a respiratory virus (SARS-COV-2) and it is recommended to use a facemask or respirator for reducing the spread of this respiratory virus.","Shaterian, Negin; Abdi, Fatemeh; Atarodi Kashani, Zahra; Shaterian, Negar; Darvishmotevalli, Mohammad",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580654/; https://doi.org/10.22037/aaem.v9i1.1286,20

Fourteen Iranian family caregivers of patients with COVID-19 who were isolated at home were included in the study using purposive sampling. In-depth unstructured interviews were conducted via WhatsApp. Sampling continued until data saturation. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using Van Manen's approach. Three primary themes and eight subthemes emerged. The primary themes included: ""captured in a whirlpool of time"", ""resilient care' and ""feeling helpless"". It seems that the families of patients with COVID-19 attempt to resist the pressures of this disease with religious practices and problem solving. However, due to the nature of the disease and its severity, they sometimes feel ashamed or lonely and are afraid of losing their loved ones. It is recommended that psychiatric nurses should develop programs in the form of comprehensive spiritual care packages or psychological support and utilize multiple media channels to deliver these.","Asgari, Parvaneh; Jackson, Alun C; Khanipour-Kencha, Ali; Bahramnezhad, Fatemeh",International quarterly of community health education,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272684x211033454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34304613/,20

Latin America is the hardest-hit region of the world, accumulating almost 20% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In Costa Rica, from the first detected case on March 6th to December 31st almost 170,000 cases have been reported. We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 185 sequences, 52 from the first months of the pandemic, and 133 from the current wave. Three GISAID clades (G, GH, and GR) and three PANGOLIN lineages (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.291) were predominant, suggesting multiple re-introductions from other regions. The whole-genome variant calling analysis identified a total of 283 distinct nucleotide variants, following a power-law distribution with 190 single nucleotide mutations in a single sequence, and only 16 mutations were found in >5% sequences. These mutations were distributed through the whole genome. The prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike (98.9% in Costa Rica), ORF8 L84S (1.1%) is similar to what is found elsewhere. Interestingly, the frequency of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica, reaching 29.2% detection in the full genome analyses in November 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences worldwide in 2020. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggests a potential effect on the viral oligomerization needed for cell infection, but no differences with other genomes on transmissibility, severity nor vaccine effectiveness are predicted. In conclusion, genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggest the introduction of lineages from other countries and the detection of mutations in line with other studies, but pointing out the local increase in the detection of Spike-T1117I variant. The genomic features of this virus need to be monitored and studied in further analyses as part of the surveillance program during the pandemic.","Molina-Mora, Jose Arturo; Cordero-Laurent, Estela; Godínez, Adriana; Calderón-Osorno, Melany; Brenes, Hebleen; Soto-Garita, Claudio; Pérez-Corrales, Cristian; Drexler, Jan Felix; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Corrales-Aguilar, Eugenia; Duarte-Martínez, Francisco",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905892/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821001696; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104872; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821001696?v=s5,20
605982,CXCL10/IP-10 in Infectious Diseases Pathogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Implications,2011-07-01,"BACKGROUND: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown and social distancing measures are applied to prevent the spread of the virus. It is well known that confinement and social isolation can have a negative impact on physical and mental health, including cognition. Physical activity and cognitive training can help enhance older adults’ cognitive and physical health and prevent the negative collateral impacts of social isolation and physical inactivity. The COVEPIC study aims to document the effects of 6 months of home-based physical exercise alone versus home-based physical exercise combined with cognitive training on cognitive and physical functions in adults 50 years and older. METHODS: One hundred twenty-two healthy older adults (> 50 years old) will be recruited from the community and randomized to one of the two arms for 6 months: (1) home-based physical exercises monitoring alone and (2) combined physical exercises monitoring with home-based cognitive training. The primary outcome is cognition, including general functioning (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score), as well as executive functions, processing speed, and episodic memory (composite Z-scores based on validated neuropsychological tests and computerized tasks). The secondary outcome is physical functions, including balance (one-leg stance test), gait and mobility performance (Timed Up and Go, 4-meter walk test), leg muscle strength (5-time sit-to-stand), and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (Matthews’ questionnaire). Exploratory outcomes include mood, anxiety, and health-related quality of life as assessed by self-reported questionnaires (i.e., Geriatric depression scale-30 items, Perceived stress scale, State-trait anxiety inventory-36 items, Perseverative thinking questionnaire, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10, and 12-item Short Form Survey). DISCUSSION: This trial will document the remote monitoring of home-based physical exercise alone and home-based physical combined with cognitive training to enhance cognitive and physical health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Remote interventions represent a promising strategy to help maintain or enhance health and cognition in seniors, and potentially an opportunity to reach older adults in remote areas, where access to such interventions is limited.

606243,Characterisation of nosocomial and community-acquired influenza in a large university hospital during two consecutive influenza seasons,2015-10-24,"One of the most impact issues in recent years refers to the COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of which thousands of deaths recorded worldwide, are still inferior understood. Its impacts on the environment and aquatic biota constitute a fertile field of investigation. Thus, to predict the impact of the indiscriminate use of azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in this pandemic context, we aim to assess their toxicological risks when isolated or in combination, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system. In summary, we observed that 72 h of exposure to AZT and HCQ (alone or in binary combination, both at 2.5 μg/L) induced the reduction of total protein levels, accompanied by increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species and nitrite, suggesting a REDOX imbalance and possible oxidative stress. Molecular docking analysis further supported this data by demonstrating a strong affinity of AZT and HCQ with their potential antioxidant targets (catalase and superoxide dismutase). In the protein-protein interaction network analysis, AZT showed a putative interaction with different cytochrome P450 molecules, while HCQ demonstrated interaction with caspase-3. The functional enrichment analysis also demonstrated diverse biological processes and molecular mechanisms related to the maintenance of REDOX homeostasis. Moreover, we also demonstrated an increase in the AChE activity followed by a reduction in the neuromasts of the head when zebrafish were exposed to the mixture AZT + HCQ. These data suggest a neurotoxic effect of the drugs. Altogether, our study demonstrated that short exposure to AZT, HCQ or their mixture induced physiological alterations in adult zebrafish. These effects can compromise the health of these animals, suggesting that the increase of AZT and HCQ due to COVID-19 pandemic can negatively impact freshwater ecosystems.","Mendonça-Gomes, Juliana Moreira; da Costa Araújo, Amanda Pereira; da Luz, Thiarlen Marinho; Charlie-Silva, Ives; Braz, Helyson Lucas Bezerra; Jorge, Roberta Jeane Bezerra; Ahmed, Mohamed Ahmed Ibrahim; Nóbrega, Rafael Henrique; Vogel, Christoph F.A.; Malafaia, Guilherme",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34380260/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721032009?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721032009,20

Applied to single‐cell data, such analyses provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across resources, and not linked to intracellular processes.

M127 is nearly absent in healthy individuals yet abundantly present in patients with infectious and inflammatory conditions such as COVID-19 and rheumatoid arthritis. Multiple genomic and functional approaches revealed unique gene signatures of M127 and unified anti-inflammatory properties imposed by the CD127-STAT5 axis. M127 expansion correlated with mild COVID-19 disease outcomes. Thereby, we phenotypically and molecularly characterized a human monocyte subset marked by CD127 that retained anti-inflammatory properties within the pro-inflammatory environments, uncovering remarkable functional diversity among monocytes and signifying M127 as a potential therapeutic target for human inflammatory disorders.","Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Yuan; Xiong, Lei; Li, Yuzhe; Zhang, Yunliang; Zhao, Jiuliang; Jiang, Hui; Li, Can; Liu, Yunqi; Liu, Xindong; Liu, Haofei; Ping, Yi-Fang; Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff; Zhang, Zheng; Bian, Xiu-Wu; Zhao, Yan; Hu, Xiaoyu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.10.376277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200127/,20

RESULTS: Two hundred eight practicing neuro-ophthalmologists (81.3% United States, 50.2% females, age range <35 to >65, mode 35–44 years) participated in the survey. Utilization of all telehealth modalities increased from pre-COVID to peri-COVID (video visit 3.9%–68.3%, P < 0.0005, remote interpretation of testing 26.7%–32.2%, P = 0.09, online second opinion 7.9%–15.3%, P = 0.001, and interprofessional e-consult 4.4%–18.7%, P < 0.0005, McNemar).

ATRX is known to maintain genomic stability in neuroprogenitor cells, but its function in differentiated neurons and memory processes remains largely unresolved. Here, we show that the deletion of neuronal Atrx in mice leads to distinct hippocampal structural defects, fewer presynaptic vesicles, and an enlarged postsynaptic area at CA1 apical dendrite-axon junctions. We identify male-specific impairments in long-term contextual memory and in synaptic gene expression, linked to altered miR-137 levels. We show that ATRX directly binds to the miR-137 locus and that the enrichment of the suppressive histone mark H3K27me3 is significantly reduced upon the loss of ATRX. We conclude that the ablation of ATRX in excitatory forebrain neurons leads to sexually dimorphic effects on miR-137 expression and on spatial memory, identifying a potential therapeutic target for neurological defects caused by ATRX dysfunction.","Tamming, Renee J.; Dumeaux, Vanessa; Jiang, Yan; Shafiq, Sarfraz; Langlois, Luana; Ellegood, Jacob; Qiu, Lily R.; Lerch, Jason P.; Bérubé, Nathalie G.",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610139/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107838; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720308196; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720308196,20

In Study 1, from semi‐structured interviews with Chinese employees working from home in the early days of the pandemic, we identified four key remote work challenges (work‐home interference, ineffective communication, procrastination, and loneliness), as well as four virtual work characteristics that affected the experience of these challenges (social support, job autonomy, monitoring, and workload) and one key individual difference factor (workers’ self‐discipline). In Study 2, using survey data from 522 employees working at home during the pandemic, we found that virtual work characteristics linked to worker's performance and well‐being via the experienced challenges. Specifically, social support was positively correlated with lower levels of all remote working challenges; job autonomy negatively related to loneliness; workload and monitoring both linked to higher work‐home interference; and workload additionally linked to lower procrastination. Self‐discipline was a significant moderator of several of these relationships.

This new condition has been called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. The objective of this review is to summarize the clinical characteristics and therapeutic options of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia based on available published case series. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of the diagnostic pathway and treatment recommendations provided by six major medical societies. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. STUDY SELECTION: We included case series and case reports on patients who developed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. We also included guidelines for the diagnosis and management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia from major medical societies. DATA EXTRACTION: We examined baseline risk factors, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory and imaging findings, and treatment in patients with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia reported in the case series. We also analyzed the diagnostic and treatment recommendations provided by major societal guidelines on the management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. DATA SYNTHESIS: Patients who developed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia were more likely to be young women (age 20–50) who were given the AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson/Janssen 4–28 days prior to presentation. Patients showed signs, symptoms, and imaging findings consistent with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and splanchnic thrombosis. Laboratory findings showed thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, and elevate d-dimer levels, while positive platelet factor 4 antibodies were always positive. Major societal guidelines recommend avoidance of heparin and platelets. Treatment with nonheparin anticoagulants and IV immunoglobulin is also recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a rare but highly morbid complication related to the administration of the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines. Clinicians should be prepared for the early identification of patients with suspicious symptoms and prompt treatment should be initiated to avoid catastrophic deterioration.

Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course. Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications. These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.","Nahshon, Chen; Bitterman, Arie; Haddad, Riad; Hazzan, David; Lavie, Ofer",World J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-020-05575-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418028/,20

Adjuvants are critical components of both subunit and certain inactivated vaccines because they induce specific immune responses that are more robust and long-lasting. A review of the history of coronavirus vaccine development demonstrates that only a few adjuvants, including aluminum salts, emulsions, and TLR agonists, have been formulated for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and currently the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in experimental and pre-clinical studies. However, there is still a lack of evidence regarding the effects of the adjuvants tested in coronavirus vaccines. This paper presents an overview of adjuvants that have been formulated in reported coronavirus vaccine studies, which should assist with the design and selection of adjuvants with optimal efficacy and safety profiles for COVID-19 vaccines.","Liang, Zhihui; Zhu, Haoru; Wang, Xin; Jing, Bo; Li, Zifan; Xia, Xinyu; Sun, Hongwu; Yang, Yun; Zhang, Weiting; Shi, Li; Zeng, Hao; Sun, Bingbing",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.589833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240278/,20
613065,Respiratory Tract,2012-01-13,"BACKGROUND: General practice (GP) trainees may seek supervisor assistance to complete their patient consultations. This in-consultation assistance plays a key role in the supervisory oversight of trainees and in trainee learning. It may be obtained face-to-face, or using phone or messaging systems, and either in front of patients or outside their hearing. Trainee concerns about decreased patient impressions of their competence, and discomfort presenting patients within their hearing, act as barriers to seeking help during consultations. Little is known about the frequency and associations of trainee concerns about these patient-related barriers, or the various trainee-supervisor-patient configurations used to obtain in-consultation assistance. METHODS: Australian GP trainees rated their frequency of use of five specific configurations for obtaining in-consultation assistance, perceived change in patient impressions of their competence after this assistance, and relative trainee comfort presenting patients outside, compared to within, patients’ hearing. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Responses were received from 778 Australian GP trainees (response rate 89%). Help-seeking configurations did not differ between trainees at different training stages, except for greater use of electronic messaging in later stages. In-consultation assistance was most commonly provided by phone between trainee and supervisor consulting rooms, or outside the trainee’s patient’s hearing. Supervisor assistance in the trainee’s room face-to-face with the patient was reported as either never or rarely obtained by 12% of respondents. More trainees (25%) perceived that patient impressions of their competence increased after help-seeking than perceived that these impressions decreased (19%). Most trainees (55%) preferred to present patients outside their hearing. Trainee age was the only variable associated with both patient-related barriers. CONCLUSION: Supervisors appear to have considerable influence over trainee help-seeking, including which configurations are used and trainee perceptions of patient-related barriers. In-consultation supervision may actually increase trainee perceptions of patient impressions of their competence. Many supervisors and trainees may benefit from additional educational and workplace interventions to facilitate comfortable and effective trainee help-seeking in front of patients. More work is required to understand the clinical and educational implications of different help-seeking configurations when trainees require ‘just in time’ supervisor assistance.","Sturman, Nancy J.; Tapley, Amanda; van Driel, Mieke L.; Holliday, Elizabeth G.; Ball, Jean I.; Davey, Andrew R.; Fielding, Alison; FitzGerald, Kristen; Spike, Neil A.; Magin, Parker J.",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33076893/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02291-2,20

These studies rely on the use of recombinant proteins from the viral genome in order to identify serum antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Here, we discuss the cross-reactivity potential of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the full spike proteins of four other Betacoronaviruses that cause disease in humans, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we detected the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 towards the four other coronaviruses, with the strongest cross-recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS /MERS-CoV antibodies, as expected based on sequence homology of their respective spike proteins.

614469,Historical Perspectives: Reflections on Infectious Diseases in 2020.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Health services globally are struggling to manage the impact of COVID-19. The existing global disease burden related to opioid use is significant. Particularly challenging groups include older drug users who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. Increasing access to safe and effective opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and other harm reduction services during this pandemic is critical to reduce risk. In response to COVID-19, healthcare is increasingly being delivered by telephone and video consultation, and this report describes the development of a national model of remote care to eliminate waiting lists and increase access to OAT in Ireland. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS: The purpose of this initiative is to provide easy access to OAT by developing a model of remote assessment and ongoing care and eliminate existing national waiting lists. The Irish College of General Practitioners in conjunction with the National Health Service Executive office for Social Inclusion agreed a set of protocols to enable a system of remote consultation but still delivering OAT locally to people who use drugs. This model was targeted at OAT services with existing waiting lists due to a shortage of specialist medical staff. The model involves an initial telephone assessment with COVID-risk triage, a single-patient visit to local services to provide a point of care drug screen and complete necessary documentation and remote video assessment and ongoing management by a GP addiction specialist. A secure national electronic health link system allows for the safe and timely delivery of scripts to a designated local community pharmacy. CONCLUSION: The development of a remote model of healthcare delivery allows for the reduction in transmission risks associated with COVID-19, increases access to OAT, reduces waiting times and minimises barriers to services. An evaluation of this model is ongoing and will be reported once completed. Fast adaptation of OAT delivery is critical to ensure access to and continuity of service delivery and minimise risk to our staff, patients and community. Innovative models of remote healthcare delivery adapted during the COVID-19 crisis may inform and have important benefits to our health system into the future.","Crowley, Des; Delargy, Ide",Harm Reduct J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680520/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00394-z,20

The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 °C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = −0.0100, 95% CI: −0.0125, −0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Shi, Peng; Dong, Yinqiao; Yan, Huanchang; Zhao, Chenkai; Li, Xiaoyang; Liu, Wei; He, Miao; Tang, Shixing; Xi, Shuhua",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324074?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339844/,20

Not only has it cost hundreds of thousands of lives but also severely impacted livelihoods and placed enormous strain on community healthcare and welfare services. In this review, we explore the events associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and host immunopathological reactivity due to the clinical manifestations of this coronavirus infection. We discuss that the metallopeptidase enzyme ADAM17, also known as tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, TACE, is responsible for shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-6 receptor. This leads to elevated pro-inflammatory responses that result in cytokine storm syndrome. We argue that cytokine balance may be restored by recovering an IL-6 trans-signaling neutralizing buffer system through the mediation of recombinant soluble glycoprotein 130 and recombinant ADAM17/TACE prodomain inhibitor. This cytokine restoration, possibly combined with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry as well as replication and coagulopathy, could be introduced as a novel approach to treat patients with severe COVID-19. In cases of co-morbidity, therapies related to the management of associated disease conditions could ameliorate those clinical manifestations.","Mahmud-Al-Rafat, Abdullah; Muzammal Haque Asim, Md.; Taylor-Robinson, Andrew W.; Majumder, Apurba; Muktadir, Abdul; Muktadir, Hasneen; Karim, Mahbubul; Khan, Imran; Mainul Ahasan, Mohammad; Morsaline Billah, Md.",Cytokine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32822911/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155228; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466620302441?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466620302441,20

It is rarely examined as an aspect of intimate partner violence. We describe the prevalence of exposure to threatening/obscene messaging from a current or ex-partner; characteristics of victims; and associations with other forms of violence and abuse, mental disorder, self-harm, and suicidality. METHODS: Cross-sectional probability-sample survey of the general population in England aged 16 + . Multivariable regression modelling tested associations between receipt of threatening/obscene messaging and current common mental disorder, past-year self-harm and suicidality. RESULTS: Threatening/obscene messages were received from a current/ex-partner by 6.6% (95%CI: 5.9–7.3) of adults who had been in a relationship; 1.7% received these in the past year. Victims were more likely to be female, under 35, single or divorced, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and to have experienced other forms of sexual and partner violence and abuse. Those who received threatening/obscene messages in the past year were more likely to experience common mental disorder (adjusted odds ratio 1.89; 1.01–3.55), self-harm (2.31; 1.00–5.33), and suicidal thoughts (2.00; 1.06–3.78). CONCLUSION: Threatening/obscene messaging commonly occurs in the context of intimate partner violence. While often occurring alongside sexual and physical violence, messaging has an additional association with mental disorder and suicidality. Routine enquiry in service settings concerning safety, including those working with people who have escaped domestic violence, should ask about ongoing contact from previous as well as current partners. This should include asking about messaging, as well as other forms of potentially technology-enabled abuse which may become increasingly common.

As a result, the development of safe and effective vaccines, in order to contain the infection quickly became a priority. The first vaccine approved by the Italian Agency for Drugs Authorization (AIFA) was the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, developed by BioNTech and Pfizer (Comirnaty). Comirnaty contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a nucleoside-modified RNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Even if data from phase I suggest that vaccine induced antibodies can persist for up to six months following the second shot of BNT vaccine, data regarding the real duration of immunological protection are lacking. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the duration of serological protection by detecting the presence of anti-S-RBD (receptor-binding domain) antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 among a large group of healthcare workers (HCWs) three months after vaccination. 99% of HCWs had a detectable titre of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 90 days after the second vaccine shot. Elderly operators showed significantly lower levels of protective antibodies when compared to the younger ones, thus they could become unprotected earlier than other operators.","Coppeta, Luca; Somma, Giuseppina; Ferrari, Cristiana; Mazza, Andrea; Rizza, Stefano; Trabucco Aurilio, Marco; Perrone, Stefano; Magrini, Andrea; Pietroiusti, Antonio",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579184/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090947,20

These two outbreaks were judged to be declared as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) during 2014. This is the first time ever to have such circumstance of two PHEICs at the same time. DISCUSSION: PHEIC, which has to be declared by WHO Director General after a recommendation of IHR Emergency Committee; is observed to start in countries with fragile health system and conflict areas. Then it rapidly spread to threaten the global public health. The year 2014 has uniquely witnessed declaration of two events as PHEIC according to IHR (2005); Polio and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Both outbreaks are caused by viruses such as H1N1 which was previously declared as PHEIC in 2009. SUMMARY: Public Health Emergencies of International Concern in 2014 occurred in countries with weak health systems and conflicts and threatening the whole globe. International collaborative work is required to contain the event and to mobilize resources/capacities between countries. Moreover, public health surveillance systems as core capacity for IHR (2005) should be strengthened in all countries with focus on those with limited capacity and ongoing conflicts. The ultimate aim is timely detection of potential PHEIC events in the future along with early preparedness and response plans.","Soghaier, Mohammed A.; Saeed, Khwaja M.I.; Zaman, Khushhal K.",AIMS Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2015.2.218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29546106/,20

This paper evaluated COVID-19’s impact on national and regional healthcare service utilisation and expenditure in China. METHODS: Using a big data approach, we collected data from 300 million bank card transactions to measure individual healthcare expenditure and utilisation in mainland China. Since the outbreak coincided with the 2020 Chinese Spring Festival holiday, a difference-in-difference (DID) method was employed to compare changes in healthcare utilisation before, during and after the Spring Festival in 2020 and 2019. We also tracked healthcare utilisation before, during and after the outbreak. RESULTS: Healthcare utilisation declined overall, especially during the post-festival period in 2020. Total healthcare expenditure and utilisation declined by 37.8% and 40.8%, respectively, while per capita expenditure increased by 3.3%. In a subgroup analysis, we found that the outbreak had a greater impact on healthcare utilisation in cities at higher risk of COVID-19, with stricter lockdown measures and those located in the western region. The DID results suggest that, compared with low-risk cities, the pandemic induced a 14.8%, 26.4% and 27.5% reduction in total healthcare expenditure in medium-risk and high-risk cities, and in cities located in Hubei province during the post-festival period in 2020 relative to 2019, an 8.6%, 15.9% and 24.4% reduction in utilisation services; and a 7.3% and 18.4% reduction in per capita expenditure in medium-risk and high-risk cities, respectively. By the last week of April 2020, as the outbreak came under control, healthcare utilisation gradually recovered, but only to 79.9%–89.3% of its pre-outbreak levels. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly negative effect on healthcare utilisation in China, evident by a dramatic decline in healthcare expenditure. While the utilisation level has gradually increased post-outbreak, it has yet to return to normal levels.","Zhang, Yi-Na; Chen, Yun; Wang, Ying; Li, Fan; Pender, Michelle; Wang, Na; Yan, Fei; Ying, Xiao-Hua; Tang, Sheng-Lan; Fu, Chao-Wei",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184065/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003421,20

In the early stages of the epidemic, healthcare professionals have been in the front-line to manage the infection. The current study aimed to analyse the impact of Covid-19 outbreak on healthcare professionals and to detect some risk and protective factors of their distress levels, with regard to socio-demographic variables, direct exposure to Covid-19 and the coping strategies used to deal with stress. The data were collected during the peak of the infection. A total of 595 healthcare professionals enrolled in the study and completed the measures of socio-demographical and professional data, perceived stress (PPS) and coping strategies (COPE-NIV-25). Overall, we found that a positive attitude towards the stressful situation was the main protective factor, while female gender, seeking social support, avoidance strategies and working with Covid-19 patients were risk factors. Economic status, problem solving ability and turning to religion were not associated with stress levels. This study, one of the first on this topic, highlighted the main coping strategies used by healthcare professionals in facing the highly stressful situation caused by the pandemic.","Babore, Alessandra; Lombardi, Lucia; Viceconti, Maria Luisa; Pignataro, Silvia; Marino, Valentina; Crudele, Monia; Candelori, Carla; Bramanti, Sonia Monique; Trumello, Carmen",Psychiatry Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113366; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120313755?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120313755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32798932/,20

The overlap between malaria and HBV infection can be clinically severe and present a diagnostic challenge as both diseases manifest similar symptoms. This case describes a fatal case of a 43-year-old man with chronic HBV infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria that presents as acute kidney injury (AKI) and jaundice following a trip to malaria-endemic region. Despite administering antimalarial and 6 courses of renal replacement therapy, the patient’s clinical condition did not improve, leading to septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and eventually, death. AKI and jaundice are commonly seen in severe P. falciparum malaria, as well as acute exacerbation of chronic HBV. This case emphasizes the importance to consider malarial screening when evaluating sick returning travelers, even in those with underlying chronic HBV. Given the severity of coinfection, prompt identification of this overlap can avert the rapid deterioration of severe malaria by early administration of intravenous artesunate and renal replacement therapy.","Jonny, Jonny; Violetta, Laurencia",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1177/23247096211043712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477014/,20
620052,Hospitalization and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral clades in COVID-19,2021-02-26,"The COVID-19 pandemic-related constraints on healthcare access have raised concerns about adverse outcomes from delayed treatment, including the risk of cancer progression and other complications. Further, concerns were raised about a potentially significant backlog of patients in need of cancer care due to the pandemic-related delays in healthcare, further exacerbating any potential adverse outcomes. Delayed access to surgery is particularly relevant to urologic oncology since one-third of new cancers in men (20% overall) arise from the genitourinary (GU) tract and surgery is often the primary treatment. Herein, we summarize the prepandemic literature on deferred surgery for GU cancers and risk of disease progression. The aforementioned data on delayed surgery were gathered in the context of systemic delays present in certain healthcare systems, or occasionally, due to planned deferral in suboptimal surgical candidates. These data provide indirect, but sufficient insight to develop triage schemas for prioritization of uro-oncological cases. Herein, we outline the extent to which the pandemic-related triage guidelines had influenced urologic practice in various regions. To study the adverse outcomes in the pandemic-era, a survey of urologic oncologists was conducted regarding modifications in their initial management of urologic cancers and any delay-related adverse outcomes. While the adverse effects directly from COVID-19 related delays will become apparent in the coming years, the results showing short-term outcomes are quite instructive. Since cancer care was assigned a higher priority at most centers, this strategy may have avoided significant delays in care and limited the anticipated negative impact of pandemic-related constraints.","Mian, Badar M.; Siddiqui, Sana; Ahmad, Ardalan E.",Urol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33129674/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078143920304841; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2020.10.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078143920304841,20

Despite progress in many areas, we still do not have an integrated understanding of the initiating factors, the key steps in the progression of ALI, and the central processes involved in repair.

The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Mahadev, Srihari; Schwartz, Robert E; Shah, Shawn; Sampath, Kartik; Schnoll-Sussman, Felice; Brown Jr, Robert S; Carr-Locke, David; Cohen, David E; Sharaiha, Reem Z",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327904/; https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i14.1546,20

The incorporation of cyclodextrin moieties into larger structures produces five types of new materials: crosslinked networks, functionalized chains, amphiphilic cyclodextrins, polyrotaxanes and nanocomposites. This review presents crosslinking and grafting to prepare covalently-attached cyclodextrins, and applications in the food and pharmaceutical sectors, from an historical point of view. In food science, applications include debittering of juices, retention of aromas and release of preservatives from packaging. In biomedical science, cyclodextrin polymers are applied classically to drug release, and more recently to gene delivery and regenerative medicine. The remarkable points are: 1) epichlorohydrin and diisocyanates have been extensively used as crosslinkers since the 1960s, but during the last two decades more complex cyclodextrin polymeric structures have been designed. 2) The evolution of cyclodextrin polymers matches that of macromolecular materials with regard to complexity, functionality and capabilities. 3) The use of cyclodextrin polymers as sorbents in the food sector came first, but smart packaging is now an active challenge.

The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids. In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p < 0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had a reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p < 0.001). Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders.

This disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2. In the past, other members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have made an impact in China and the Arabian peninsula respectively. Both SARS and COVID-19 share similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing that can become fatal in later stages. However, SARS and MERS infections were epidemic diseases constrained to limited regions. By March 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 had spread across the globe and on March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, many patients succumbed to pneumonia. Higher rates of deaths were seen in older patients who had co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dementia. In this review paper, we discuss the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's-like dementia, and diabetes mellitus.

Objective: This study aims to summarize the evidence on prevalence, incidence and mortality of delirium in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search on Pubmed and Embase from inception to December 1, 2020. Three independent reviewers evaluated study eligibility and data extraction, and assessed study quality. Outcomes were analyzed as proportions with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also compared mortality differences in COVID-19 patients using odds ratio. Results: In total, we identified 48 studies with 11,553 COVID-19 patients from 13 countries. Pooled prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 24.3% (95% CI: 19.4–29.6%), 32.4% (95% CI: 20.8–45.2%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 36.1–53.0%), respectively. For patients aged over 65 yrs, prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 28.2% (95% CI: 23.5–33.1%), 25.2% (95% CI: 16.0–35.6%) and 48.4% (95% CI: 40.6–56.1%), respectively. For patients under 65 yrs, prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 15.7% (95% CI: 9.2–23.6%), 71.4% (95% CI: 58.5–82.7%) and 21.2% (95% CI: 15.4–27.6%), respectively. Overall, COVID-19 patients with delirium suffered higher risk of mortality, compared to those without delirium (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 2.1–4.8). Conclusion: Delirium developed in almost 1 out of 3 COVID-19 patients, and was associated with 3-fold overall mortality.

There are limited data of its impact in Africa. This study aims to characterize COVID-19 response strategies and impact of COVID-19 on cancer care and explore misconceptions in Africa. METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey of oncology providers in Africa between June and August 2020. Descriptive statistics and comparative analysis by income groups were performed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two participants initiated the survey, of which 79 respondents from 18 African countries contributed data. Ninety-four percent (66 of 70) reported country mitigation and suppression strategies, similar across income groups. Unique strategies included courier service and drones for delivery of cancer medications (9 of 70 and 6 of 70, respectively). Most cancer centers remained open, but > 75% providers reported a decrease in patient volume. Not previously reported is the fear of infectivity leading to staff shortages and decrease in patient volumes. Approximately one third reported modifications of all cancer treatment modalities, resulting in treatment delays. A majority of participants reported ≤ 25 confirmed cases (44 of 68, 64%) and ≤ 5 deaths because of COVID-19 (26 of 45, 58%) among patients with cancer. Common misconceptions were that Africans were less susceptible to the virus (53 of 70, 75.7%) and decreased transmission of the virus in the African heat (44 of 70, 62.9%). CONCLUSION: Few COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported among patients with cancer. However, disruptions and delays in cancer care because of the pandemic were noted. The pandemic has inspired tailored innovative solutions in clinical care delivery for patients with cancer, which may serve as a blueprint for expanding care and preparing for future pandemics. Ongoing public education should address COVID-19 misconceptions.

The pandemic and the associated preventive 'lockdown' measures have also given rise to a parallel mental health crisis, with elevated levels of chronic stress observed in the general population. Stress levels are also likely to be higher among at-risk groups such as those who have become employed or are on furlough, those in essential services with higher risk of exposure, and those from underserved communities. Development of efficacious means to assist individuals in effectively managing their during the pandemic and beyond is an imperative. We outline how stress reappraisal interventions offer a potentially efficacious, cost effective strategy to manage pandemic-related stress and minimize deleterious health consequences. Specifically, we advocate two stress management strategies: stress reappraisal, which involves prompting individuals to appraise stress as challenging and to be approached rather than threatening and to be avoided, and stress mindsets, which involves highlighting the enhancing nature of stress. We outline how these strategies may be implemented during the pandemic as part of interventions aimed at promoting stress management and better mental health during the pandemic and as communities emerge from lockdown.

DESIGN: A nationally representative cross-sectional survey was used for this study. Descriptive analyses helped to compute vaccine hesitancy proportions and compare them across groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to compute the adjusted OR. SETTING: Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1134 participants from the general population, aged 18 years and above participated in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and predictors of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Of the total participants, 32.5% showed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Hesitancy was high among respondents who were men, over 60, unemployed, from low-income families, from central Bangladesh, including Dhaka, living in rented houses, tobacco users, politically affiliated, doubtful of the vaccine’s efficacy for Bangladeshis and those who did not have any physical illnesses in the past year. In the multiple logistic regression models, transgender respondents (adjusted OR, AOR=3.62), married individuals (AOR=1.49), tobacco users (AOR=1.33), those who had not experienced any physical illnesses in the past year (AOR=1.49), those with political affiliations with opposition parties (AOR=1.48), those who believed COVID-19 vaccines would not be effective for Bangladeshis (AOR=3.20), and those who were slightly concerned (AOR=2.87) or not concerned at all (AOR=7.45) about themselves or a family member getting infected with COVID-19 in the next year were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, in order to guarantee that COVID-19 vaccinations are widely distributed, the government and public health experts must be prepared to handle vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine awareness among potential recipients. To address these issues and support COVID-19 immunisation programs, evidence-based educational and policy-level initiatives must be undertaken especially for the poor, older and chronically diseased individuals.","Ali, Mohammad; Hossain, Ahmed",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429316/,20

It is more applied in studies on overlapping brand niches in marketing today, with relatively few researches on continuous customer value creation characterised by user adhesion and need matching. Based on the need matching and user adhesion that are features of the mobile Internet era, this article proposes a model for continuous customer value creation based on overlapping marketing. According to grounded theory, this article extracts three types of factors—demand effect, user effect, and overlapping marketing—that affect continuous customer value creation in the smart terminal business. From the perspective of service perception, this research explores how overlapping marketing affects product requirement matching and user adhesion based on a survey of 491 participants, and validates the theoretical model and hypotheses. It is found that overlapping marketing can effectively enhance need matching, improve user adhesion and increase customer value. This research not only addresses the confusion regarding need matching and user adhesion in the communications market, but also reveals how the smart terminal business affects continuous customer value creation in the era of the mobile Internet through overlapping marketing, combined with need matching and user adhesion.","Fan, Juan; Dong, Lingxin",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.628665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177689/,20

Using a new machine learning algorithm developed by us, we have reported a significantly higher number of predicted COVID-19 cases than the documented counts across the world. The sole reliance on confirmed symptomatic cases overlooking the symptomless COVID-19 infections and the dynamics of waning immunity may not provide ‘true’ spectrum of infection proportion, a key element for an effective planning and implementation of protection and prevention strategies. We and others have previously shown that strategic orthogonal testing and leveraging systematic data-driven modeling approach to account for asymptomatics and waning cases may situationally have a compelling role in informing efficient vaccination strategies beyond prevalence reporting. However, currently Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend serological testing either before or after vaccination to assess immune status. Given the 27% occurrence of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated (FV) group with many being asymptomatics and still a larger fraction of the general mass remaining unvaccinated, the relaxed mask mandate and distancing by CDC can drive resurgence. Thus, we believe it is a key time to focus on asymptomatics (no symptoms) and oligosymptomatics (so mild that the symptoms remain unrecognized) as they can be silent reservoirs to propagate the infection. This perspective thus highlights the need for proactive efforts to reevaluate the current variables/strategies in accounting for symptomless and waning fractions.","Narasimhan, Madhusudhanan; Mahimainathan, Lenin; Noh, Jungsik; Muthukumar, Alagarraju",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.730404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621274/,20

Increasing evidence suggests that respiratory droplets and aerosols are likely the most common route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Since the virus can be spread by presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, universal face masking has been recommended as a straightforward and low-cost strategy to mitigate virus transmission. Numerous governments and public health agencies around the world have advocated for or mandated the wearing of masks in public settings, especially in situations where social distancing is not possible. However, the efficacy of wearing a mask remains controversial. This interdisciplinary review summarizes the current, state-of-the-art understanding of mask usage against COVID-19. It covers three main aspects of mask usage amid the pandemic: quality standards for various face masks and their fundamental filtration mechanisms, empirical methods for quantitatively determining mask integrity and particle filtration efficiency, and decontamination methods that allow for the reuse of traditionally disposable N95 and surgical masks. The focus is given to the fundamental physicochemical and engineering sciences behind each aspect covered in this review, providing novel insights into the current understanding of mask usage to curb COVID-19 spread.","Ju, Jerry T.J.; Boisvert, Leah N.; Zuo, Yi Y.",Adv Colloid Interface Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2021.102435; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001868621000762?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001868621000762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971389/,20

Since an underlying inflammatory process exists in several ocular conditions, such as anterior uveitis, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), the aim of the present review was to summarize the pleiotropic effects exerted by this molecule, focusing in particular on its beneficial role in retinal diseases. The anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin has also been described in numerous systemic inflammatory pathologies and tumors. Specifically, the biological, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical properties of curcumin are associated with its ability to downregulate the expression of the following genes: IκBα, cyclooxygenase 2, prostaglandin E2, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α. According to this finding, curcumin may be useful in the treatment of some retinal disorders. In DR, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and AMD, beneficial effects have been observed following treatment with curcumin, including slowing down of the inflammatory process. Despite the aforementioned evidence, the main disadvantage of this substance is that it possesses a low solubility, as well as poor oral bioavailability due to its reduced absorption, rapid metabolism and rapid elimination.

625379,Research in brief,2021-08-31,"Respiratory tract infection with pneumoviruses (PVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) are increasingly associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). Ribavirin may be a treatment option but its effectiveness is unclear, especially with respect to infection severity. We retrospectively analyzed 10 years of PV/PMV infections in LTRs. The main end points were forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) at 3 and 6 months postinfection, expressed as a percentage of pre‐infection FEV(1) and incidence of new or progressed CLAD 6 months postinfection. A total of 139 infections were included: 88 severe infections (63%) (defined as >10% FEV(1) loss at infection) and 51 mild infections (37%) (≤10% FEV(1) loss). Overall postinfection CLAD incidence was 20%. Associations were estimated on postinfection FEV(1) for ribavirin vs no ribavirin (+13.2% [95% CI: 7.79; 18.67]) and severe vs mild infection (−11.1% [95% CI: −14.76; −7.37]). Factors associated with CLAD incidence at 6 months were ribavirin treatment (odds ratio (OR [95% CI]) 0.24 [0.10; 0.59]), severe infection (OR [95% CI] 4.63 [1.66; 12.88]), and mycophenolate mofetil use (OR [95% CI] 0.38 [0.14; 0.97]). These data provide valuable information about the outcomes of lung transplant recipients with these infections and suggests possible associations of ribavirin use and infection severity with long‐term outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of 9 infectious agents in gastrointestinal (GI)‐diseased and healthy foals with ages ranging from 1 to 20 weeks of age and to what degree coinfections are associated with clinical signs of GI disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective controlled observational study. METHODS: The population consisted of 88 Thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in Kentucky. Healthy (n = 37) and GI‐diseased (n = 51) foals were identified based on clinical presentation. Faecal samples were analysed for 9 infectious agents by real‐time PCR: equine rotavirus, equine coronavirus, Clostridium difficile toxins A & B, Neorickettsia risticii, Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin, Lawsonia intracellularis, Rhodococcus equi, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. Salmonella was also cultured from overnight selenite enrichment broth. RESULTS: The prevalence of infectious pathogens under study was between 0% (Lawsonia intracellularis) and 34.6% (equine rotavirus). The overall prevalence for any infectious agent was 63.2% in the GI‐diseased group and 43.2% in the healthy group. Coinfections were significantly more frequent in the sick group (15 monoinfections vs. 22 coinfections) than in the healthy group (12 vs. 4, respectively, P = 0.0002). Six of the 8 infectious agents were associated with the GI‐diseased group, the other 2 were not (equine coronavirus and R. equi). CONCLUSIONS: The use of panels rather than individual tests in combination with quantitative toxin gene analysis enables detection of coinfections significantly associated with risk of disease. Several infectious diseases previously not tested for or considered unimportant were found at high prevalence and require further investigation.","Slovis, N.

METHODS: A total of 91 patients were included in the study. A questionnaire was formed for the questioning of testicular pain or epididymo‐orchitis in patients with COVID‐19. Demophrahics and past medical history was also recorded. Patients’ neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratios (NLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP)levels and D‐dimer values were recorded. Patients with COVID‐19 were divided into two groups according to absence or presence of testicular pain or epididymo‐orchitis as group 1 and group 2. All results were compared for both groups. RESULTS: The median age of patients was similar in both groups. Testicular pain was occured in 10.98% of the patients. Clinical presentation of epididymo‐orchitis was diagnosed in only one patient. No statistically significant difference was reported in terms of patients’ age, levels of CRP and D‐Dimer or NLR and results of questionnaire form queries between the two groups (p>0.05).

As society returns to normal, understanding the spread and persistence of SARS CoV-2 on commonplace surfaces can help to mitigate future outbreaks of coronaviruses and other pathogens. We hypothesize that such an understanding can be aided by studying the binding and interaction of viral proteins with nonbiological surfaces. Here, we propose a methodology for investigating the adhesion of the SARS CoV-2 spike glycoprotein on common inorganic surfaces such as aluminum, copper, iron, silica, and ceria oxides as well as metallic gold. Quantitative adhesion was obtained from the analysis of measured forces at the nanoscale using an atomic force microscope operated under ambient conditions. Without imposing further constraints on the measurement conditions, our preliminary findings suggest that spike glycoproteins interact with similar adhesion forces across the majority of the metal oxides tested with the exception to gold, for which attraction forces ∼10 times stronger than all other materials studied were observed. Ferritin, which was used as a reference protein, was found to exhibit similar adhesion forces as SARS CoV-2 spike protein. This study results show that glycoprotein adhesion forces for similar ambient humidity, tip shape, and contact surface are nonspecific to the properties of metal oxide surfaces, which are expected to be covered by a thin water film. The findings suggest that under ambient conditions, glycoprotein adhesion to metal oxides is primarily controlled by the water capillary forces, and they depend on the surface tension of the liquid water. We discuss further strategies warranted to decipher the intricate nanoscale forces for improved quantification of the adhesion.","O’Callahan, Brian; Qafoku, Odeta; Balema, Viktor; Negrete, Oscar A.; Passian, Ali; Engelhard, Mark H.; Waters, Katrina M.",Langmuir,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609882/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c01910,20

A new therapeutic approach for acute lung injury treatment,2021,"Diseases of viral origin in humans are among the most serious threats to health and the global economy. As recent history has shown the virus has a high pandemic potential, among other reasons, due to its ability to spread by air, hence the identification, investigation, containment, and treatment of viral diseases should be considered of paramount importance. In this sense, the bioinformatics research has focused on finding fast and efficient algorithms that can identify highly toxic antiviral peptides and to serve as a first filter, so that trials in the laboratory are substantially reduced. The work presented here contributes to this effort through the use of an algorithm already published by this team, called polarity index method, which identifies with high efficiency antiviral peptides from the exhaustive analysis of the polar profile, using the linear sequence of the peptide. The test carried out included all peptides in APD2 Database and 60 antiviral peptides identified by Kumar and co-workers (Nucleic Acids Res 40:W199–204, 2012), to build its AVPpred algorithm.

Based on reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus chevrieri, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys cachinus, E. miletus, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. CoVs were particularly commonplace in Apodemus chevrieri, with a detection rate of 12.44% (24/193). Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and extend our knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.","Wang, Wen; Lin, Xian-Dan; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Wang, Miao-Ruo; Guan, Xiao-Qing; Holmes, Edward C; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318860/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa078,20
630923,The Immune Responses against Coronavirus Infections: Friend or Foe?,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent, debilitating, and costly psychiatric disorder. Evidenced-based psychotherapies, including Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), are effective in treating PTSD, although a fair proportion of individuals show limited benefit from such treatments. CPT requires cognitive demands such as encoding, recalling, and implementing new information, resulting in behavioral change that may improve PTSD symptoms. Individuals with PTSD show worse cognitive functioning than those without PTSD, particularly in acquisition of verbal memory. Therefore, memory dysfunction may limit treatment gains in CPT in some individuals with PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Here, we present a protocol describing the Cognition and PsychoTherapy in PTSD (CPTPTSD) study, a prospective, observational study examining how cognitive functioning affects treatment response in CPT for PTSD (NCT# 03641924). The study aims to recruit 105 outpatient veterans with PTSD between the ages of 18 and 70 years. Prior to beginning 12 sessions of CPT, Veteran participants will have standardized assessments of mood and functioning and complete a comprehensive neurocognitive battery assessing episodic learning, attention and speed of processing, language ability, executive control, and emotional functioning. This study aims to fill gaps in the current literature by: (1) examining the specificity of memory effects on treatment response; (2) exploring how baseline cognitive functioning impacts functional outcomes; and (3) examining potential mechanisms, such as memory for treatment content, that might explain the effects of baseline memory functioning on PTSD symptom trajectory. DISCUSSION: If successful, this research could identify clinically relevant neurocognitive mechanisms that may impact PTSD psychotherapy and guide the development of individualized treatments for PTSD.","Cenkner, David P.; Asnaani, Anu; DiChiara, Christina; Harb, Gerlinde C.; Lynch, Kevin G.; Greene, Jennifer; Scott, J.

635020,A critical evaluation of glucocorticoids in the treatment of severe COVID-19,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND: The initial focus of the US public health response to COVID-19 was the implementation of numerous social distancing policies. While COVID-19 was the impetus for imposing these policies, it is not the only respiratory disease affected by their implementation. This study aimed to assess the impact of social distancing policies on non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens typically circulating across multiple US states. METHODS: Linear mixed-effect models were implemented to explore the effects of five social distancing policies on non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens across nine states from January 1 through May 1, 2020. The observed 2020 pathogen detection rates were compared week-by-week to historical rates to determine when the detection rates were different. RESULTS: Model results indicate that several social distancing policies were associated with a reduction in total detection rate, by nearly 15%. Policies were associated with decreases in pathogen circulation of human rhinovirus/enterovirus and human metapneumovirus, as well as influenza A, which typically decrease after winter. Parainfluenza viruses failed to circulate at historical levels during the spring. Total detection rate in April 2020 was 35% less than historical average. Many of the pathogens driving this difference fell below historical detection rate ranges within two weeks of initial policy implementation. CONCLUSION: This analysis investigated the effect of multiple social distancing policies implemented to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. These findings suggest that social distancing policies may be used as an impactful public health tool to reduce communicable respiratory illness.","Nawrocki, Jeff; Olin, Katherine; Holdrege, Martin C; Hartsell, Joel; Meyers, Lindsay; Cox, Charles; Powell, Michaela; Cook, Camille V; Jones, Jay; Robbins, Tom; Hemmert, Andrew; Ginocchio, Christine C",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322558/,20

In these markets, bats and wild animals are frequently sold and stored in close contact. During several of the world's past pandemics, bats were essential to the spread of zoonotic diseases from bat to another animal or to humans directly. Live animal markets create the perfect conditions for novel viruses such as COVID‐19 to emerge.

There are three responsible for this disease; SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Whereas our goal is to test the affinity for a new class of compounds obtained from a hybridization of Chloroquine, Amodiaquine and Mefloquine with three targets SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in order to find new compounds as new inhibitors against Covid-19. In this work, we first used: the molecular docking/dynamics methods and ADME properties to study interaction and affinity between eight new compounds against three targets involved in the Covid-19. The results of the docking simulations and dynamics revealed that inhibitor of the malaria (Ligand 87) has an affinity to interact with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV targets and they can be good inhibitors for treatment of Covid-19. Moreover, they give best affinity compared to the Remdesivir and Chloroquine and other clinical tests. The Pharmacokinetics was justified by means of lipophilicity and high coefficient of skin permeability.

COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To potentially and further improve diagnosis capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training and transfer learning are utilized based on a new dataset constructed from an external dataset of X-ray images. This is in contrary to existing works on COVID-19 detection where pre-training is performed based on natural images.

Here we describe a saliva-based testing method that bypasses the need for RNA isolation/purification. In experiments with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into saliva, this method has a limit of detection of 500-1000 viral particles per mL, rivalling the standard NP swab method, and initial studies also show excellent performance with 100 clinical samples. This saliva-based process is operationally simple, utilizes readily available materials, and can be easily implemented by existing testing sites, thus allowing for high-throughput, rapid, and repeat testing of large populations.

641650,Poem: Waiting for the barbarian Corona viruses,2020-12-15,"The clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in various target organs has been extensively studied and described. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics of oral cavity involvement. This is surprising, considering that oral mucosal and salivary gland cells are known targets for the direct replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that the presence of the virus in saliva is a source of transmission of the infection. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence and prevalence of oral manifestations in COVID-19 survivors. We profiled the oral involvement in 122 COVID-19 survivors that were hospitalized and followed up at a single-referral university hospital in Milan, Italy, between July 23, 2020 and September 7, 2020, after a median (interquartile range) time from hospital discharge of 104 (95 to 132) d. We found that oral manifestations, specifically salivary gland ectasia, were unexpectedly common, with oral manifestations being detected in 83.9% while salivary gland ectasia in 43% of COVID-19 survivors. Salivary gland ectasia reflected the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the significant relationship with C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at hospital admission, and with the use of antibiotics during acute disease. Both LDH levels and antibiotic administration survived as independent predictors of salivary gland ectasia at multivariable analysis. Temporomandibular joint abnormalities, facial pain, and masticatory muscle weakness were also common. Overall, this retrospective and prospective cohort study of COVID-19 survivors revealed that residual damage of the oral cavity persists in the vast majority of patients far beyond clinical recovery, and suggests that the oral cavity represents a preferential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to clarify the connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and oral disorders.","Gherlone, E.F.; Polizzi, E.; Tetè, G.; De Lorenzo, R.; Magnaghi, C.; Rovere Querini, P.; Ciceri, F.",J Dent Res,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034521997112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655804/,20

This paper describes nested polymerase chain reaction assays for the detection of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E. The specificity and sensitivity of the assays have been determined and they have been applied to the detection of the viruses in nasal aspirates. These assays are more rapid and sensitive than cell culture and may replace the latter as the diagnostic method of choice.","Myint, S.; Johnston, S.; Sanderson, G.; Simpson, H.",Molecular and Cellular Probes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7877631/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850884710528; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850884710528,20

We conducted a systematic review of the available published literature on children with cancer affected by COVID‐19. The last date of the study search was October 20, 2020, and 33 studies comprising 226 children were included for the final analysis. Data were extracted in a predefined data collection form, and the variables were extracted and analyzed. Patients with hematological malignancies were more in number. Males and children on intensive treatment were more frequently affected. Fever was the commonest symptom. The disease was asymptomatic/mild in 48% and severe in 9.6%. Consolidation, peribronchial cuffing, and consolidation with ground glass opacities were the common imaging findings. Hydroxychloroquine was the most frequently used drug for COVID‐19. About 10% of children required intensive care, and about 32% had oxygen requirements. The percentage of children who died due to COVID‐19 was 4.9%. The severity, morbidity, and mortality of COVID‐19 in pediatric oncology were more compared to the general pediatric population.

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a widely studied model system for Coronavirus replication and pathogenesis. In this study, we created a MHV-A59 temperature sensitive (ts) mutant Wu”-ts18(cd) using the recombinant vaccinia reverse genetics system. Virus replication assay in 17C1-1 cells showed the plaque phenotype and replication characterization of constructed Wu”-ts18(cd) were indistinguishable from the reported ts mutant Wu”-ts18. Then we cultured the ts mutant Wu”-ts18(cd) at non-permissive temperature 39.5°C, which “forced” the ts recombinant virus to use second-site mutation to revert from a ts to a non-ts phenotype. Sequence analysis showed most of the revertants had the same single amino acid mutation at Nsp16 position 43. The single amino acid mutation at Nsp16 position 76 or position 130 could also revert the ts mutant Wu”-ts18 (cd) to non-ts phenotype, an additional independent mutation in Nsp13 position 115 played an important role on plaque size. The results provided us with genetic information on the functional determinants of Nsp16. This allowed us to build up a more reasonable model of CoVs replication-transcription complex.","Chang, Guo-hui; Luo, Bao-jun; Lu, Pin; Lin, Lei; Wu, Xiao-yan; Li, Jing; Hu, Yi; Zhu, Qing-yu",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21331887/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-011-3145-x,20

Surveying students on what messages they recall from the first day of STEM classes,2021-08-06,"Hospital infection prevalence surveys were performed in our 1400-bed University medical centre in Hong Kong from 1985 to 1988. We investigated the rates of four major hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) (pneumonia, symptomatic urinary tract infection, surgical site infection and laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection) in order to identify current distribution and any changes after 15 years. A one-day point prevalence study was performed on 7 September 2005. All inpatients were surveyed for HAIs, community-acquired infections (CAIs), risk factors, pathogenic isolates and antibiotics prescribed. Infections were diagnosed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. In total, 1021 patients were surveyed; of these, 41 had 42 HAIs (4% prevalence) and 389 (38%) were receiving antibiotics. The commonest HAI was pneumonia (1.4%) followed by bloodstream infection (0.9%) and symptomatic urinary tract infection (0.8%). The prevalence of postoperative surgical site infection was 5.6%. The nosocomial prevalence rate was highest in the Intensive Care Unit, followed by the Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Units, Children's Cancer Centre/Bone Marrow Transplant Unit and Orthopaedics with Traumatology. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the commonest pathogens.

A mechanical ventilator is playing a vital role in tackling this situation but the ventilation process is neither readily available nor affordable. The idea behind this work is to propose a simplified design of a mechanical ventilator to reduce the cost and automate the Mechanical ventilation process. The simplified design, it's working, and required components are elaborated in this paper. The simulation of the proposed design is made in MATLAB/Simulink platform which is also discussed below. Taking into account the work done in the area of cost reduction of the mechanical ventilation process, the mechanical ventilator with a simplified design comprising of compressed air and oxygen source is being considered. The parameters considered for mechanical ventilation are positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), pressure wave, respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume, etc. These parameters of oxygen and air mixture are to be controlled with the help of electronic devices which are pressure regulator, solenoid valve, flow sensor, proportional valve, microprocessor, etc depending upon the condition of patient and type of disease. Simulation results are promising and precise which allows the study on ventilator model without jeopardizing the life of human subjects as in clinical approach and hides the complexity of computational models from the user.

Of paramount concern are novel and reemerging pathogens that could trigger such events, including the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis. Y. pestis is responsible for more human deaths than any other known pathogen and exists globally in endemic regions of the world, including the four corners region and Northern California in the USA. Recent cases have been scattered throughout the world, including China and the USA, with serious outbreaks in Madagascar during 2008, 2013–2014, and, most recently, 2017–2018. This review will focus on recent advances in plague vaccine development, a seemingly necessary endeavor, as there is no Food and Drug Administration–licensed vaccine available for human distribution in western nations, and that antibiotic-resistant strains are recovered clinically or intentionally developed. Progress and recent development involving subunit, live-attenuated, and nucleic acid–based plague vaccine candidates will be discussed in this review. KEY POINTS: • Plague vaccine development remains elusive yet critical. • DNA, animal, and live-attenuated vaccine candidates gain traction.","Rosenzweig, Jason A.; Hendrix, Emily K.; Chopra, Ashok K.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11389-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142207/,20

SVT is attributed to hypercoagulability, a common complication of COVID-19, disregarding the severity of the infection. Hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is explained by direct activation of platelets, enhancing coagulation, by direct infection and indirect activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2, shifting endothelial cells from an anti-thrombotic to a pro-thrombotic state, by direct activation of complement pathways, promoting thrombin generation, or by immune thrombocytopenia, which also generates a thrombogenic state. Since SVT may occur even in anticoagulated COVID-19 patients and may have an unfavourable outcome, all efforts must be made to prevent this complication or to treat it accurately.","Zarrouk, Sinda; Finsterer, Josef",Egypt J Neurol Psychiatr Neurosurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602810/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41983-021-00387-0,20

During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19. We discuss how these findings should be applied, and recommendations for future research.","McAtamney, Katherine; Mantzios, Michail; Egan, Helen; Wallis, Deborah J.",Appetite,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195666321000283; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321000283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450300/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105120,20

METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 7,008 tele-consultations presenting between March 23(rd) and April 19(th) 2020. A three-level protocol was implemented to triage the calls. The data of patient queries were collected using a Google Form/Sheets and the tele-calls were returned using the patient information retrieved from the electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Overall, 7,008 tele-calls were addressed, of which 2,805 (40.02%) patients where a clinical-related query was answered were included for analysis. The most common queries were related to redness/pain/watering/blurring of vision (31.52%), closely followed by usage of medications (31.05%). The majority of the queries were directed to the department of cornea (34.15%), followed by retina (24.74%). Less than one-fifth of the patients were from the lower socio-economic class (16.08%) and one-fourth were new patients (23.96%). The most common advice given to the patient was related to management of medications (54.15%) followed by appointment related (17.79%). Emergency requests requiring further evaluation by an ophthalmologist accounted for a small percentage (16.36%) of patients.

However, there are insufficient data about the effect of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 prognosis in non-diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between random blood glucose levels measured at the time of diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in non-diabetic patients. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of non-diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. The patients were stratified into three groups according to blood glucose levels which were <100 mg/dL in group-1, in the range of 100–139 mg/dl in group-2, and the range of 140–199 mg/dl in group-3. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared among the groups. The primary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: A total of 12,817 non-diabetic patients (median age [IQR]: 44 [25] years, females: 50.9%) were included. Patients in group-2 (5%) and group-3 (14%) had higher mortality rates than patients in group-1 (2.1%). The rates of hospitalization, hospital stays longer than 8 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay more than 6 days, and mechanical ventilation were also significantly higher in group-3 patients. Likewise, glucose levels in the range of 140–199 mg/dL were an independent associate of mortality and composite of ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with poor prognosis in non-diabetic patients.

Amputations often happen in Sierra Leone due to serious infections, complex wounds, traffic accidents and delayed patient presentation to the hospital. However, purchasing a prosthesis is still beyond reach for most Sierra Leonean amputees. METHOD: We applied computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) to produce low-cost transtibial prosthetic sockets. In February and March 2020, eight participants received a 3D printed transtibial prosthesis in the village of Masanga in Tonkolili district, Sierra Leone. Research was performed using questionnaires to investigate the use, participants’ satisfaction, and possible complications related to the prostheses. Questionnaires were conducted prior to production of the prosthesis and five to six weeks after fitting the prosthesis. A personal short-term goal was set by the participants. FINDINGS: Competitively priced and fully functional prostheses were produced locally. After six weeks, all participants were still wearing the prosthesis and six of the eight participants reached their personal rehabilitation goals. Using their prostheses, all participants were no longer in need of their crutches. INTERPRETATION: We have come a step closer to the production of low-cost prostheses for low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). The goal of our project is to perform long-term follow-up and to refine our concept of 3D printed prostheses for LMICs to provide practical solutions for a global health need unmet to date.

The objective of this study was to examine how daily screen time levels affect the mental health of health care workers attempting to stay up to date on the ever-changing COVID-19-related information available to them.Methods: Health care workers at an academic teaching hospital were asked to participate in a 12-question online-based survey between the dates of May 30, 2020, and June 3, 2020. The questions included their sex, age range, occupation, department, daily screen time, changes in screen time in the last 4 weeks, and mental health outcomes such as sleep, mood, anxiety, and difficulty controlling worry.Results: No association was found between age, sex, occupation, and screen time. There was a statistically significant association between the type of department and daily screen time hours (P = .012). A positive trend was noted between screen time and sleep disruption (P = .09). An increase in hours in the last 4 weeks was associated with age (P = .03). A positive trend was also noted for an increase in screen hours and sleep disruption (P = .11) and anxiety (P = .10).Conclusions: A possible explanation for our finding of screen time not being associated with mental health outcomes could be that the knowledge that information was readily available through technology provided comfort to people as the pandemic evolved and brought changes to their daily lives.","Le, Christopher; Khalid, Zaira; Avramut, Carmen; Lam, Alan; Ragina, Neli; Zyzanski, Stephen",Prim. care companion CNS disord.

Early diagnosis and treatment of VTE is warranted. OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction model for VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 127 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the intensive care unit of two teaching hospitals were included. VTE was diagnosed with either ultrasound or computed tomography scan. Univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for Positive End Expiratory Pressure, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, platelet count, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time as well as levels of fibrinogen, antithrombin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate analysis was done using binary linear regression. RESULTS: Variables associated with VTE in both univariate and multivariate analysis were D-dimer and CRP with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64, P = 0.023 and 0.75, P = 0.045, respectively. Variables indicating hypoxemia were not predictive. The ROC curve of D-dimer and CRP combined had an AUC of 0.83, P < 0.05. Categorized values of D-dimer and CRP were used to compute a mean absolute risk for the combination of these variables with a high positive predictive value.

Before use, the manufacturer recommends performing a user seal check to ensure that the mask is fitted correctly. This study aimed to test the ability of the user seal check to detect poorly fitting masks. This study is a retrospective review of a mask-fitting programme carried out in the intensive care unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. In this programme, all staff were tested with two types of N95 mask and one type of N100 mask. The results of the documented user seal check were then compared with the formal fit-test results from a PortaCount. Using a PortaCount reading of 100 as the criterion for a correctly fitted mask, the user seal check wrongly indicated that the mask fitted on 18–31% of occasions, and wrongly indicated that it did not fit on 21–40% of occasions. These data indicate that the user seal check should not be used as a surrogate fit test. Its usefulness as a pre-use test must also be questioned.","Derrick, J.L.; Chan, Y.F.; Gomersall, C.D.; Lui, S.F.",J Hosp Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670104003780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15620450/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670104003780,20

Clinical examination of the herd showed that up to 30% of the pigs of this weight group suffered from severe respiratory signs including sneezing and coughing, with a mortality rate of up to 5%. Gross necropsy examination revealed severe interstitial pneumonia and generalized lymphadenopathy. On microscopical examination there was necrotizing inflammation of the lung, adrenal glands and lymph nodes, associated with lymphoid depletion, cytoplasmic basophilic botryoid inclusion bodies and protozoal microorganisms. Infection with Toxoplasma gondii was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Polymerase chain reaction analysis, in-situ hybridization and IHC confirmed systemic PCV-2 infection. These findings, associated with the respiratory signs and lesions in lymphoid tissues, are characteristic for post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).

Elective surgical interventions were cancelled or postponed avoiding disease transmission and excessive consumption of critical hospital resources. The main objective for composing this survey was to document the preventive attitude and its variations against Covid19 pandemic in a specific group: Shoulder and elbow surgeons; to evaluate their perception of emergency and to envisage the ‘new normal’ with the altered order of priority in the upcoming post-coronavirus era. METHODS: An anonymous survey composed of 25 questions was sent to all the members of the Turkish Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (TSSES) in April 22-29, while governmental preventive measures were maximale. A secure, web-based application (SurveyMonkey Inc, SanMateo, CA, USA) was used for the composition of the survey and the analysis of the responses. RESULTS: Eighty-eight responses collected from 129 members of TSSES (68%), with a mean 13.9 years of practice in shoulder and elbow surgery. More than 75% decrease in surgical and outpatient clinical activity was documented. Half of respondents used telemedicine and the rate of obtaining informed consent remained low. The preventive attitude showed significant variation. DISCUSSION: the perception of emergency and the protective measures showed a wide discrepancy among our respondents. Almost 80% of our respondents indicated the necessity of task forces for composing protocols to maintain subspecialty practice under adequate protective measures, and the subspecialty societies as the most eligible institutions to compose these criteria.

651700,Diseases with health disparities as drivers of COVID‐19 outcome,2020-08-20,"This study analyzes the reasons the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant of concern (VOC) spreads so rapidly. Novel topics such as universal conditions for the rapid spread of respiratory viruses, minimum viral loads for viral aerosol generation, effects of vaccination on viral aerosol generation, and viral aerosol clouds were studied. The analyses were based on experimental results and analytic model studies. Four universal conditions, namely asymptomatic host, high viral load, stability of viruses in air, and binding affinity of viruses to human cells, need to be satisfied for the rapid spread of respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 and its variants such as the Alpha VOC and Delta VOC satisfy the four fundamental conditions. In addition, there is an original principle of aerosol generation of respiratory viruses. Assuming that the aerosol–droplet cutoff particle diameter for distinguishing potential aerosols from earthbound respiratory particles is 100 μm, the minimum viral load required in respiratory fluids to generate viral aerosols is ~10(6) copies mL(−1), which is within the range of the reported viral loads in the Alpha VOC cases and the Delta VOC cases. The daily average viral loads of the Delta VOC in hosts have been reported to be between ~10(9) copies mL(−1) and ~10(10) copies mL(−1) during the four days after symptom onset in 1848 cases of the Delta VOC infection. Owing to the high viral load, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC has the potential to effectively spread through aerosols. COVID-19 vaccination can decrease aerosol transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha VOC by reducing the viral load. The viral load can explain the conundrum of viral aerosol spreading. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC aerosol clouds have been assumed to be formed in restricted environments, resulting in a massive numbers of infected people in a very short period with a high spreading speed. Strong control methods against bioaerosols should be considered in this SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC pandemic. Large-scale environmental monitoring campaigns of SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC aerosols in public places in many countries are necessary, and these activities could contribute to controlling the coronavirus disease pandemic.","Lee, Byung Uk",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574724/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189804,20

However, there are many studies reporting that the use of the Internet has benefits related to a person’s health status and social inclusion. It is not fully clear if Internet use and health-related outcomes share common antecedents or if using the Internet may have a favourable effect on the determinants responsible for good health. The main aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the use of the Internet and health-related outcomes in older adults and elderly people in Poland. METHODS: The effect of the use of the Internet was analysed with regression models after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. The data used for the analysis were obtained through a telephone-based survey on a representative sample of Polish adults at least 50 years of age. RESULTS: By categorising the frequency of Internet use by the respondents, it was found that some categories were significantly related to less favourable health behaviours. Rare Internet users were less likely to undertake physical activity than nonusers (odds ratio, OR, 95% confidence interval, 95%CI 0.48, 0.28–0.83). Those using the Internet every day less frequently consumed fruit and vegetables (OR, 95%CI 0.64, 0.42–0.99). Internet use was also associated with more frequent consumption of alcohol (OR, 95%CI 1.65, 1.09–2.50 comparing nonusers with those accessing the Internet several times a week). Persons rarely using the Internet, but not those who accessed it at least a few times a week, possessed a lower health literacy than nonusers (OR, 95%CI 0.71, 0.52–0.97). Internet users were also more likely to assess their health status as unsatisfactory (OR, 95%CI 0.59, 0.42–0.82 comparing nonusers with those using the Internet daily). Finally, the use of the Internet was consistently associated with a lower prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, as well as less frequent visits to health care facilities. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in contrast to earlier findings, Internet use is not associated with favourable patterns of lifestyle or higher self-rated health in older Polish adults. However, persons with chronic conditions or disabilities less frequently declare the use of the Internet. It was also revealed that older adults and the elderly who make use of the Internet are less likely to utilise health services.","Duplaga, Mariusz",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01500-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33957909/,20
652246,Persistent Airway Obstruction After Virus Infection Is Not Associated With Airway Inflammation,2016-01-13,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in panic among the general public, leading many people to seek out information related to COVID-19 through various sources, including social media and traditional media. Identifying public preferences for obtaining such information may help health authorities to effectively plan successful health preventive and educational intervention strategies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the types of sources used for obtaining COVID-19 information on the attitudes and practices of the general public in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic, and to identify the socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with the use of different sources of information. METHODS: This study used data from a cross-sectional online survey conducted on residents of Saudi Arabia from March 20 to 24, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Bivariate analysis of categorical variables was performed to determine the associations between information sources and socioeconomic and demographic factors. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to examine whether socioeconomic and demographic variables were associated with the source of information used to obtain information about COVID-19. Moreover, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine how sources of information influence attitudes and practices of adhering to preventive measures. RESULTS: In this analysis of cross-sectional survey data, 3358 participants were included. Most participants reported using social media, followed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as their primary source of information. Seeking information via social media was significantly associated with lower odds of having an optimistic attitude (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.845, 95% CI 0.733-0.974; P=.02) and adhering to preventive measures (aOR 0.725, 95% CI 0.630-0.835; P<.001) compared to other sources of information. Participants who obtained their COVID-19 information via the MOH had greater odds of having an optimistic attitude (aOR 1.437, 95% CI 1.234-1.673; P<.001) and adhering to preventive measures (aOR 1.393, 95% CI 1.201-1.615; P<.001) than those who obtained information via other sources.

Multiple small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were screened and three candidate siRNAs emerged that effectively inhibit virus by greater than 90% either alone or in combination with one another. We simultaneously developed and screened two novel lipid nanoparticle formulations for the delivery of these candidate siRNA therapeutics to the lungs, an organ that incurs immense damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encapsulation of siRNAs in these LNPs followed by in vivo injection demonstrated robust repression of virus in the lungs and a pronounced survival advantage to the treated mice. Our LNP-siRNA approaches are scalable and can be administered upon the first sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

654384,Innate defences against viraemia,2000-11-23,"PURPOSE: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection with COVID-19 can result in silent transmission to large numbers of individuals, resulting in expansion of the pandemic with a global increase in morbidity and mortality. New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies. HYPOTHESIS: A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID- 19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine alone, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including Vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and “cytokine storm syndrome” with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to “acute respiratory distress syndrome” (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappa B and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID 19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: a three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with hydroxychloroquine and/or ivermetin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NFKappaB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/ or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil. These three broad-based interventions urgently need to be subjected to randomized, controlled trials.","Horowitz, Richard I.; Freeman, Phyllis R.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720308276?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720308276; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32534175/,20

This study may shed light on whether a severe economic contraction following a natural disaster, such as that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will further contribute to that decline, using data on hurricanes followed by economic contraction or growth. For the analysis, U.S. counties hit by severe hurricanes between 2004 and 2012 are identified and differentiated according to whether there was substantial employment decline from the year prior to the year after the hurricane. Bank offices in these counties are tracked for seven years in terms of stayers, leavers, and new offices owned by community or large banks. The results reveal that areas with substantial employment decline are associated with higher rates of persistence and new openings among the community banks. Where hurricanes were followed by less severe contraction or economic growth, larger banks held an advantage in terms of both persistence and new offices. It is suggested that the value of soft information held by community banks is enhanced by severe adversity.","Kashian, Russ; Buchman, Tracy; Peralta, Kevin",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420920313480; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953436/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420920313480?v=s5,20

There is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients at this moment. Traditionally, people have been using spices like ginger, fenugreek and onion, etc. for the remedy of a common cold. This work identifies the potential inhibitors of the main protease (M(pro)) and spike (S) receptor of SARS-CoV-2 from 10 readily available spices. These two proteins, S and M(pro), play an important role during the virus entry into the host cell, and replication and transcription processes of the virus, respectively. To identify potential molecules an in-house databank containing 1040 compounds was built-up from the selected spices. Structure-based virtual screening of this databank was performed with two important SARS-CoV-2 proteins using Glide. Top hits resulted from virtual screening (VS) were subjected to molecular docking using AutoDock 4.2 and AutoDock Vina to eliminate false positives. The top six hits against M(pro) and top five hits against spike receptor subjected to 130 ns molecular dynamic simulation using GROMACS. Finally, the compound 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-M(pro) complexes, and compound 17-, 18-, 19-, 20- and 21- spike receptor complexes showed stability throughout the simulation time.

We assess the limitations of bioclimatic correlative models to explain the geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of medical geography. There is a broad consensus that the global distribution of COVID-19 is not random but conditioned by environmental drivers. However, as the COVID-19 distribution becomes global, including tropical climates, the evidence reveals that atmospheric conditions explain, at most, only a limited amount of the space-time dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The usefulness of approaches based on bioclimatic envelopes is in question since the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19 seems to be the anthroposphere's non-stationary environment. There is a need to clarify further the role of different transmission routes at multiple scales and outdoor and indoor environments beyond bioclimatic envelopes. At this time, the possible influence of the weather in COVID-19 spread is not sufficient to be taken into account in public health policies.

METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in HCP working in public hospitals in Hong Kong. The DCE was designed to examine the relative importance of vaccine characteristics (vaccine efficacy and safety), social normative influence reflected by the proportion of HCP colleagues intending to take SIV, and convenience in access to vaccine indicated by vaccination programme duration, vaccination location, vaccination arrangement procedure and service hours in determining influenza vaccination choice among HCP. Mixed logit regression modelling was conducted to examine the preference weight (β) of factors included in the DCE for determining vaccination choice. RESULTS: Vaccination probability increased with increase in vaccine efficacy (β = 0.02 for per 1% increase), vaccination location changing from “designated staff clinic” to “mobile station” (β = 0.37), vaccination arrangement procedure changing from “by appointment” to “by walk-in” (β = 0.99), but decreased with the increase in probability of mild reactions to vaccination (β = −0.05 for per 1% increase). CONCLUSION: Vaccine safety was judged to be more important than vaccine efficacy for determining vaccination choice. Arranging vaccination service by walk-in and implementing mobile vaccination station should be considered in future SIV programmes to compensate for the effect of perceived low vaccination efficacy and concerns about vaccine safety to promote SIV uptake among HCP.","Liao, Qiuyan; Ng, Tiffany W.Y.; Cowling, Benjamin J.",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20306307; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20306307; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414654/,20

To date, the cellular factors involved in PEDV replication have not been well defined. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that serves as a critical component of cellular signal transduction pathways to modulate a variety of cellular functions has been shown to regulate several viral infections. In the present study, we found that PEDV activates ERK1/2 early in infection independently of viral replication. The PEDV-induced ERK1/2 activation resulted in the phosphorylation of its downstream substrate Elk-1 in infected cells. Treatment with ERK inhibitors or ERK1/2 knockdown significantly suppressed viral progeny production. Inhibition of ERK activation also diminished viral protein expression and genomic and subgenomic RNA transcription. These findings indicate that the ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in the PEDV life cycle and beneficially contributes to viral infection.","Kim, Youngnam; Lee, Changhee",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.06.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215002846; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215002846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26115165/,20

We fully address the humoral and cellular immune changes induced by the virus, with particular emphasis on the role of the “cytokine storm” in the evolution of the disease. Moreover, we also propose some immune alterations (i.e., inflammatory parameters, cytokines, leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations) as prognostic markers of the disease. Furthermore, we discuss how immune modifying drugs, such as tocilizumab, chloroquine, glucocorticoids and immunoglobulins, and blood purification therapy, can constitute a fundamental moment in the therapy of the infection. Finally, we made a critical analysis of a number of substances, not yet utilized, but potentially useful in SARS-CoV-2 patients, such as IFN lambda, TNF blockers, ulinastatin, siponimod, tacrolimus, mesenchymal stem cells, inhibitors of mononuclear macrophage recruitment, IL-1 family antagonists, JAK-2 or STAT-3 inhibitors.","Allegra, Alessandro; Di Gioacchino, Mario; Tonacci, Alessandro; Musolino, Caterina; Gangemi, Sebastiano",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21134782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640747/,20

Using biolistic-mediated transformation, a plant-optimized synthetic DPT gene was successfully transferred to tobacco plastomes. Putative transplastomic T0 plants were identified by PCR, and Southern blot analysis confirmed homoplasmy in T1 progeny. ELISA assays demonstrated that the DPT protein retained antigenicity of the three components of the fusion protein. The highest level of expression in these transplastomic plants reached 0.8% of total soluble protein. To assess whether the functional recombinant protein expressed in tobacco plants would induce specific antibodies in test animals, a mice feeding experiment was conducted. For mice orally immunized with freeze-dried transplastomic leaves, production of IgG and IgA antibodies specific to each toxin were detected in serum and mucosal tissues.","Soria-Guerra, Ruth Elena; Alpuche-Solís, Angel G.; Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio; Moreno-Fierros, Leticia; Bendik, Elise M.; Martínez-González, Luzmila; Korban, Schuyler S.",Planta,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-0918-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19306020/,20

No disease-modifying treatments currently exist. The glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide has been associated in single-centre studies with reduced motor deterioration over 1 year. The aim of this multicentre UK trial is to confirm whether these previous positive results are maintained in a larger number of participants over 2 years and if effects accumulate with prolonged drug exposure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of exenatide at a dose of 2 mg weekly in 200 participants with mild to moderate PD. Treatment duration is 96 weeks. Randomisation is 1:1, drug to placebo. Assessments are performed at baseline, week 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 weeks. The primary outcome is the comparison of Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part 3 motor subscore in the practically defined OFF medication state at 96 weeks between participants according to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes will compare the change between groups among other motor, non-motor and cognitive scores. The primary outcome will be reported using descriptive statistics and comparisons between treatment groups using a mixed model, adjusting for baseline scores. Secondary outcomes will be summarised between treatment groups using summary statistics and appropriate statistical tests to assess for significant differences.

Furthermore, a comparison takes place with outcomes from earlier studies about traditional financial assets. Moreover, we empirically investigate herding behaviour of 240 cryptocurrencies during bull and bear markets. The present survey suggests that empirical findings about whether herding phenomena have made a significant appearance or not in cryptocurrency markets are split. The Cross-sectional absolute deviations (CSAD) and Cross-sectional standard deviations (CSSD) approaches for measuring herding tendencies are found to be the most popular. Different behaviour is detected in bull periods compared to bear markets. Nevertheless, evidence from primary studies indicates that herding is stronger during extreme situations rather than in normal conditions. However, our empirical estimations reveal that herding behaviour is evident only in bull markets. These findings cast light on and provide a roadmap for investment decisions with modern forms of liquidity.","Kyriazis, Nikolaos A.",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904208/,20

The impact of lung disease on PH outcomes and response to treatment remains a challenging area with limited progress. Imaging with computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in patients with suspected PH when assessing for parenchymal lung disease, however, current assessments are limited by their semi-qualitative nature. Quantitative chest-CT (QCT) allows numerical quantification of lung parenchymal disease beyond subjective visual assessment. This has facilitated advances in radiological assessment and clinical correlation of a range of lung diseases including emphysema, interstitial lung disease, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Artificial Intelligence approaches have the potential to facilitate rapid quantitative assessments. Benefits of cross-sectional imaging include ease and speed of scan acquisition, repeatability and the potential for novel insights beyond visual assessment alone. Potential clinical benefits include improved phenotyping and prediction of treatment response and survival. Artificial intelligence approaches also have the potential to aid more focused study of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies by identifying more homogeneous subgroups of patients with lung disease.

Many senior learning centers were closed during the pandemic, and many of them adopted the mode of online education. However, problems such as decreased motivation and a lack of peer interaction still exist. To solve these problems, this study used the easy-to-implement calligraphy AR approach and E-book approach to conduct a quasi-experiment on the elderly of a calligraphy course offered by a senior learning center. The results show a higher learning motivation among the elderly who use calligraphy AR. The learning effectiveness and technology acceptance of the elderly in the E-book learning group were higher than those in the calligraphy AR group. The elderly mentioned that the E-book learning approach is more user-friendly. In general, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the suspension of classes in senior centers, education through the development of technology has stimulated the growth of education in advanced learning centers. Through this kind of scientific and technological learning method, it will bring a whole new experience to the elderly. It can improve the stress relief methods, mental health, and quality of life of the elderly during the COVID-19 emergency shutdown, and provide a novel calligraphy technique learning experience for the elderly. Therefore, we believe that the calligraphy AR learning approach and the calligraphy E-book learning approach are practical and may promote quality of life and mental health of the elderly during the emergency closures due to COVID-19, providing elderly attendees with a novel calligraphy technology learning experience.","Lee, Chia-Jung; Hsu, Yen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201928/,20

Currently, only remdesivir and dexamethasone have demonstrated limited efficacy, only slightly reducing disease burden, thus novel approaches for clinical management of COVID-19 are needed. We identified a panel of human monoclonal antibody clones from a yeast display library with specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain that neutralized the virus in vitro.

To achieve this purpose, the big data of “cart search” demand information provided by small and medium freight enterprises on the freight information platform are analyzed. 343,690 pieces of freight demand big data on the freight information platform and Python, ArcGIS, UCINET, and Gephi software are used. The results show that: (1) The choke-point of unbalanced freight demand network is Wuhan, and the secondary choke-points are Hefei and Zhengzhou. (2) In southern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Wuhan, Hefei, and Nanchang as the centers. In northern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Zhengzhou and Taiyuan as the centers. (3) The freight demand of the six provinces in central China exhibits typical characteristics of long tail distribution with large span and unbalanced distribution. (4) The import and export of freight in different cities vary greatly, and the distribution is unbalanced. This study indicates the imbalance difference, chain reaction, keys and hidden troubles posed by the freight demand network. From the perspectives of freight transfer breakout, freight balance breakout, freight strength breakout, and breakout of freight periphery cities, we propose solutions to breakouts in the freight market in six provinces of central China in the post-epidemic era.","Huang, Yin; Liu, Runda; Huang, Shumin; Yang, Gege; Zhang, Xiaofan; Qin, Yin; Mao, Lisha; Sheng, Sishi; Huang, Biao",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886666/,20
666191,Elucidation and Clinical Role of Emerging Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Children,2012-12-11,"Abstract Virus-like particles (VLPs) are hollow nanoparticles composed of recombinant viral surface proteins without a virus genome. In the present study, we investigated the production of influenza VLPs using recombinant insect cells. DNA fragments encoding influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix protein 1 (M1) were cloned with the Drosophila BiP signal sequence in plasmid vectors containing a blasticidin and a neomycin resistance gene, respectively. After Trichoplusia ni BTI-TN-5B1-4 (High Five) cells were co-transfected with a pair of constructed plasmid vectors, stably transformed cells were established via incubation with blasticidin and G418. Western blot analyses showed that recombinant High Five cells secreted HA and M1 proteins into the culture supernatant. Immunoprecipitation of the culture supernatant with an anti-HA antibody and transmission electron microscopy suggested that secreted HA and M1 proteins were in a particulate structure with a morphology similar to that of an influenza virus. Hemagglutination assay indicated that expressed HA molecules retained hemagglutination activity. In a shake-flask culture, recombinant cells achieved a high HA yield (≈ 10 μg/ml) comparable to the yields obtained using the baculovirus–insect cell system. Recombinant insect cells may serve as excellent platforms for the efficient production of influenza VLPs for use as safe and effective vaccines and diagnostic antigens.","Matsuda, Takuya; Tanijima, Toshikazu; Hirose, Akito; Masumi-Koizumi, Kyoko; Katsuda, Tomohisa; Yamaji, Hideki",Biochemical Engineering Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.107757; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369703X20303119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834743/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369703X20303119?v=s5,20

We analyze clusters of the model's non-seasonal parameters $(p,d,q)$, distinguishing between county-level political affiliations and face covering orders, and also consider county-level population and poverty rate. Using data from March 4, 2020 to March 15, 2021, we find that 223 of the total 254 counties are clustered into 23 model parameters $(p,d,q)$, while the number of cases in the remaining 31 counties could not be successfully fitted to ARIMA models. We also find the impact of the county-level infection rate and the county-level poverty rate on clusters of counties with different political affiliations and face covering orders. Further, we find that the infection rate and the poverty rate had a significant high positive correlation, and Democrat-leaning counties, which tend to have large populations, had a higher correlation coefficient between infection rate and poverty rate. We also observe a significant high positive correlation between the infection rate and the number of cumulative cases in Republican counties that had not imposed a face covering order.","Jiang, H.; Pulins, B.; Thiele, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.02.21258221v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.02.21258221,20

Autonomous Communities such as Cantabria continue without supplying tetravalent vaccine. The aim of this study was to analyse epidemiological characteristics of influenza type B in Cantabria (2019-2020 season) as well as to establish the predominant lineage and its relation to the recommended vaccine. METHODS: Retrospective study whereby flu diagnosis and lineage analysis were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: All samples belonged to the Victoria lineage. Most prevalent viral co-infection was due to SARS-CoV-2. The population affected by influenza B was mainly paediatric and non-vaccinated patients more frequently required hospital admittance. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza type B has a higher incidence in the paediatric population and type A affects more the adult population. Only 28.8% of patients with Influenza B that presented with some underlying condition or risk factor were vaccinated. This shows the need to increase coverage with tetravalent vaccines in order to reduce the burden of disease associated with the Influenza B virus.,"Pablo-Marcos, Daniel; Rodríguez-Fernández, Ana; Gozalo, Mónica; Agüero, Jesús; Revillas, Francisco Arnaiz de Las; Calvo, Jorge",Rev Esp Quimioter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32957746/; https://doi.org/10.37201/req/077.2020,20

The rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enables prompt diagnosis and the implementation of proper precautionary and isolation measures for the patient. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the basic assay performance of an innovative PCR system, GeneSoC(®) (Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). A total of 1,445 clinical samples were submitted to the clinical laboratory, including confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, from February 13 to August 31. Specimen types included nasopharyngeal swabs. The sampling was performed several times for each patient every 2–7 days. Using this system, sequences specific for SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in a sample within 10–15 min using the microfluidic thermal cycling technology. Analytical sensitivity studies showed that GeneSoC(®) could detect the target sequence of the viral envelope and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes at 5 and 10 copies/μL, respectively. The precision of the GeneSoC(®) measurements using clinical isolates of the virus at a concentration of 10(3) copies/μL was favorable for both the genes; within-run repeatability and between-run reproducibility coefficient of variation values were less than 3% and 2%, respectively; and the reproducibility of inter-detection units was less than 5%. Method comparison by LightCycler(®) 480 showed the positive and negative agreement to be 100% [(174/174) and (1271/1271), respectively].

Bats are reservoirs for a high diversity of coronaviruses, and focused surveillance detected several strains genetically similar to MERS-coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus, and the human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. The bat fauna of central Asia, which link China to eastern Europe, are relatively less studied than other regions of the world. Kazakhstan is the world’s ninth largest country; however, little is understood about the prevalence and diversity of bat-borne viruses. In this study, bat guano was collected from bat caves in three different sites of southern Kazakhstan that tested positive for coronaviruses. Our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates these are novel bat coronaviruses that belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. In addition, two distinct lineages of Kazakhstan bat coronaviruses were detected. Both lineages are closely related to bat coronaviruses from China, France, Spain, and South Africa, suggesting that co-circulation of coronaviruses is common in multiple bat species with overlapping geographical distributions.

Execution of many such analyses can be accelerated by applying the cloud computing paradigm, which provides scalable resources for storing data of different types and parallelizing data analysis computations. Moreover, these resources can be reused for different multi-omics analysis scenarios. Traditionally, developers are required to manage a cloud platform’s underlying infrastructure, configuration, maintenance and capacity planning. The serverless computing paradigm simplifies these operations by automatically allocating and maintaining both servers and virtual machines, as required for analysis tasks. This paradigm offers highly parallel execution and high scalability without manual management of the underlying infrastructure, freeing developers to focus on operational logic. This paper reviews serverless solutions in bioinformatics and evaluates their usage in omics data analysis and integration. We start by reviewing the application of the cloud computing model to a multi-omics data analysis and exposing some shortcomings of the early approaches. We then introduce the serverless computing paradigm and show its applicability for performing an integrative analysis of multiple omics data sources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Grzesik, Piotr; Augustyn, Dariusz R; Wyciślik, Łukasz; Mrozek, Dariusz",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505137/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab349,20
669982,Respiratory infections of the human bocavirus,2016-08-05,"The chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used as frontline drugs for treatment and prophylaxis against all types of human malaria worldwide. Since late December 2019, humans have been under threat due to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV), since its first reported cases in Wuhan, China [1]. Consequently, the virus infection has been declared a pandemic. While the World is finding expedited approvals for the development of vaccine, which is time dependent, being preventative and not possibly a cure, physicians and countries’ leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that this age-old antimalarial drug, CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection. Based on accumulating scientific reports, we have highlighted in this review, the different possible modes of action of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine that could particularly justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of using the drugs and repurposing of old drugs in this instance, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, specifically, hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 could be the best choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, like alteration of acidic environment inside lysosome, late endosomes, restriction further with endocytosis, exsosome release, phagolysosomal fusion in systematically and subsequently inhibition of cytokine storm in host cell. One or sum of diverse mechanisms might work against the viral infections and help prevent more deaths. Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option. There is still a need to find other innovative drug candidates as other possible candidate to go into clinical evaluation and testing.","Tripathy, Satyajit; Dassarma, Barsha; Roy, Somenath; Chabalala, Hlupheka; Matsabisa, Motlalepula Gilbert",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32450198/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301916?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920301916,20

It is now generally accepted that local inflammatory stimulation around shoulder capsule causes proliferative fibrosis. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of recombinant TSG-6 protein inhibiting the growth of capsule fibroblasts in frozen shoulder via the TGF-β/Smad2 signal pathway. METHODS: Human frozen shoulder capsule tissue was taken for primary and passage culture, and the 3rd generation fibroblasts from pathological frozen shoulder capsule were treated with different concentrations of recombinant TSG-6 protein, or with TGF-β1 agonist SRI-011381. Immunoconfocal analysis was used to identify the isolated fibroblasts, and MTT assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry were used to detect the viability, proliferation, and apoptosis rate of fibroblast. The contents of fibrosis and inflammation indexes COL1A1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in the cell supernatant were detected using ELISA and then further examined by qRT-PCR. The expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and proteins related to TGF-β/Smad2 pathway were detected by Western Blot. RESULTS: Compared with the blank control group, fibroblasts intervened with TSG-6 (2 μg and 5 μg) showed significantly decreased viability and proliferation ability and enhanced cell apoptosis, concurrent with the reductions in Bcl-2 expression; COL1A1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β levels; and the expression of TGF-β1 and phosphorylated Smad22, and an increase in Bax expression, while SRI-011381 treatment would reverse the effect of recombinant TSG-6 protein.

Neutrophil infiltration was also noted on the pathological findings from autopsies. It is urgent to clarify the pathogenesis of neutrophils leading to severe pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 55 COVID-19 patients classified as mild (n = 22), moderate (n = 25), and severe (n = 8) according to the Guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China. Trends relating leukocyte counts and lungs examined by chest CT scan were quantified by Bayesian inference.

Results: Neutrophilia occurred in 6 of 8 severe patients at 7–19 days after symptom onset, coinciding with lesion progression. Increasing neutrophil counts paralleled lesion CT values (slope: 0.8 and 0.3–1.2), reflecting neutrophilia-induced lung injury in severe patients. Transcriptome analysis revealed that neutrophil activation was correlated with 17 neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-associated genes in COVID-19 patients, which was related to innate immunity and interacted with T/NK/B cells, as supported by a protein–protein interaction network analysis.

The objective of this study was to identify factors impacting rheumatology residents’ postgraduate practice decisions to inform Canadian Rheumatology Association workforce recommendations. METHODS: An online survey was developed, and invitations were sent to all current Canadian rheumatology residents in 2019 (n = 67). Differences between subgroups of respondents were examined using the Pearson χ(2) test. RESULTS: A total of 34 of 67 residents completed the survey. Seventy-three percent of residents planned to practice in the same province as their rheumatology training. The majority of residents (80%) ranked proximity to friends and family as the most important factor in planning. Half of participants had exposure to alternative modes of care delivery (e.g. telehealth) during their rheumatology training with fifteen completing a community rheumatology elective (44%).

672663,Incidence of respiratory viral infection in infants with respiratory symptoms evaluated for late-onset sepsis,2017-05-18,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%.

672688,The protective and pathogenic roles of CXCL17 in human health and disease: Potential in respiratory medicine,2020-04-23,"Over the last three decades it has become increasingly clear that monocytes, originally thought to have fixed, stereotypic responses to foreign stimuli, mediate exquisitely balanced protective and pathogenic roles in disease and immunity. This balance is crucial in core functional organs, such as the central nervous system (CNS), where minor changes in neuronal microenvironments and the production of immune factors can result in significant disease with fatal consequences or permanent neurological sequelae. Viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis are examples of important human diseases in which the pathogenic contribution of monocytes recruited from the bone marrow plays a critical role in the clinical expression of disease, as they differentiate into macrophage or dendritic cells in the CNS to carry out effector functions. While antigen-specific lymphocyte populations are central to the adaptive immune response in both cases, in viral encephalitis a prominent macrophage infiltration may mediate immunopathological damage, seizure induction, and death. However, the autoimmune response to non-replicating, non-infectious, but abundant, self antigen has a different disease progression, associated with differentiation of significant numbers of infiltrating monocytes into dendritic cells in the CNS. Whilst a predominant presence of macrophages or dendritic cells in the inflamed CNS in viral encephalitis or multiple sclerosis is well described, the way in which the inflamed CNS mobilizes monocytes in the bone marrow to migrate to the CNS and the key drivers that lead to these specific differentiation pathways in vivo are not well understood. Here we review the current understanding of factors facilitating inflammatory monocyte generation, migration and entry into the brain, as well as their differentiation towards macrophages or dendritic cells in viral and autoimmune disease in relation to their respective disease outcomes.","Ashhurst, Thomas Myles; Vreden, Caryn van; Niewold, Paula; King, Nicholas Jonathan Cole",Cell Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086710/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008874914001117; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008874914001117; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2014.07.002,20

That is the question we explore in this study, drawing upon unique data from 456 SMEs in the midst of an unfolding crisis. Our findings demonstrate how SMEs acted immediately by deferring investments, reducing labor costs, reducing expenses, and negotiating contracts and terms. Moreover, the data highlight how SMEs in an unfolding crisis are reluctant to commit to any action that will increase their debt-to-equity ratio. The findings suggest new questions to be explored in relation to actions during an unfolding crisis, post-crisis businesses, entrepreneurial failure, and entrepreneur/entrepreneurial team characteristics.

METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional, observational study, patients recovered from COVID-19 were included in this study. All included subjects exhibited a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) - confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Spectral domain macular OCTA was performed at least 2 weeks after recovery from systemic COVID-19. Vessel density (VD) of the superficial (SCP) and deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) and the area of the FAZ were measured in COVID-19 recovered patients versus age-matched normal controls. RESULTS: Thirty-one recovered COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy normal controls were studied. Mean quality scan index was 7.64±0.66 in the COVID cases and 8.34±0.71 in the normal controls (p=0.001). Mean SCP VD and DCP VD of the COVID cohort was significantly lower than the SCP VD and DCP VD of the control group in the foveal and parafoveal regions. FAZ area was greater in the COVID cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, in the COVID cohort, VD of the SCP and DCP were lower in patients with a history of COVID-19 hospitalization versus those without such a history but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Patients recovered from COVID-19 displayed alterations in the retinal microvasculature including a significantly lower VD in the SCP and DCP. Patients with coronavirus infection may be at risk of retinal vascular complications.","Abrishami, Mojtaba; Emamverdian, Zahra; Shoeibi, Naser; Omidtabrizi, Arash; Daneshvar, Ramin; Rezvani, Talieh Saeidi; Saeedian, Neda; Eslami, Saeid; Mazloumi, Mehdi; Sadda, SriniVas; Sarraf, David",Can J Ophthalmol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008418220308139; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjo.2020.11.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008418220308139?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249111/,20

Its therapeutic effect during infections has been a matter of debate, with conflicting results in studies of respiratory infections and in critically ill patients. This comprehensive review aimed to summarize the current evidence regarding the use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of patients with SARS-CoV2 infection, based on available publications between January 2020 and February 2021. Overall, 21 publications were included in this review, consisting of case-reports and case-series, observational studies, and some clinical trials. In many of the publications, data were incomplete, and in most clinical trials the results are still pending. No studies regarding prevention of COVID-19 with vitamin C supplementation were found. Although some clinical observations reported improved medical condition of patients with COVID-19 treated with vitamin C, available data from controlled studies are scarce and inconclusive. Based on the theoretical background presented in this article, and some preliminary encouraging studies, the role of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be further investigated.","Milani, Gregorio Paolo; Macchi, Marina; Guz-Mark, Anat",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13041172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916257/,20

When the grief process lasts longer than 6 months, the person is in risk of developing Complicated Grief Disorder (CGD). The CGD is related to serious health consequences. To reduce the probability of developing CGD a preventive intervention could be applied. In developing countries like Mexico, the psychological services are scarce, self-applied interventions could provide support to solve this problem and reduce the health impact even after the pandemic has already finished. Aims: To design and implement a self-applied intervention composed of 12 modules focused on the decrease of the risk of developing CGD, and increasing the life quality, and as a secondary objective to reduce the symptomatology of anxiety, depression, and increase of sleep quality. The Intervention Duelo COVID (Grief COVID) follows the principles of User Experience (UX) and is designed according to the needs and desires of a sample of the objective participants, to increase the adherence to the self-applied intervention, considered one of the main weaknesses of online interventions. Methods: A Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted from the 22nd of December of 2020 to the first of June 2021. The participants will be assigned to an intervention with elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness and Positive Psychology. The control group will be a wait-list condition, that will receive the intervention 1.5–2 months after the pre-measurement were taken.

Infections are rising among younger populations, but relatively little is known about youth social distancing behavior. Our qualitative study aims to examine youth engagement with social distancing and elucidate the reasons why guidelines are followed and broken. Members of the national MyVoice Text Message Cohort (aged 14–24) were surveyed from April 24 to April 30, 2020, through an open-ended text message poll. Responses were inductively coded and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Of the 944 youth who responded (response rate = 81.2%), 95% self-reported social distancing. However, 62% recalled instances of themselves or others breaking the guidelines and 19% expressed misconceptions about the rules. Notably, 14% of youth said they would encourage their friends to social distance by telling them it will accelerate a return to normal life. Feelings of social isolation were the most frequently cited (55%) negative impact of social distancing. Overall, responses from youth indicate significant variation in the interpretation of social distancing guidelines. Public health communications may need to address several critical misconceptions which impact the social distancing behaviors of youth. Further, safe methods for youth to interact with peers during periods of social distancing are necessary to prevent mental health impacts and to ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines.","Dunn, Matthew R.; DeJonckheere, Melissa; Schuiteman, Sam; Strome, Arianna; Herbert, Kelsey; Waselewski, Marika; Chang, Tammy",Prev Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842200/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211335521000462; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101355; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335521000462,20

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) use and in-hospital mortality in geriatric patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Design This observational retrospective study was conducted in a French geriatric department. Patients were included between March 17 and April 18, 2020. Setting and Participants: All consecutive 201 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (confirmed by RT-PCR methods) were included. All non-deceased patients had 30 days of follow-up and no patient was lost to follow-up. Methods Demographic, clinical, biological data and medications were collected. In-hospital mortality of patients treated or not by ACEI/ARB was analyzed using multivariate Cox models. Results Mean age of the population was 86.3 (8.0) years old, 62.7% of patients were institutionalized, 88.6% had dementia and 53.5% had severe disability (ADL score < 2). Sixty-three patients were treated with ACEI/ARB and 138 were not. Mean follow-up was 23.4 (10.0) days, 66 (33.8%) patients died after an average of 10.0 days (6.0). Lower mortality rate was observed in patients treated with ACEI/ARB compared with patients not treated with ARB nor ACEI (22.2% (14) vs. 37.7% (52), HR = 0.54 (95% CI = 0.30-0.97), p=0.03). In a multivariate Cox regression model including age, sex, ADL score, Charlson index, renal function, dyspnea, CRP and white blood cells count, use of ACEI/ARB was significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality (HR = 0.52 (0.27−0.99), p=0.048). Conclusion and Implications In very old subjects hospitalized in geriatric settings for COVID-19, mortality was significantly lower in subjects treated with ARB or ACEI prior to the onset of infection. The continuation of ACEI/ARB therapy should be encouraged during periods of coronavirus outbreak in older subjects.","Genet, Bastien; Vidal, Jean-Sébastien; Cohen, Adrien; Boully, Clémence; Beunardeau, Maelle; Harlé, Louise; Goncalves, Anna; Boudali, Yasmina; Hernandorena, Intza; Bailly, Henri; Lenoir, Hermine; Piccoli, Matthieu; Chahwakilian, Anne; Kermanach, Léna; de Jong, Laura; Duron, Emmanuelle; Girerd, Xavier; Hanon, Olivier",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861020307878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138935/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861020307878?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.004,20

OBJECTIVE: This study examines public engagement in crisis communication about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage and the practical strategy of social mobilization to mitigate the infodemic. METHODS: We retrieved the unbiased values of the top-ranked search phrases between December 30, 2019, and July 15, 2020, which normalized the anonymized, categorized, and aggregated samples from Google Search data. This study illustrates the most-searched terms, including the official COVID-19 terms, the stigmatized terms, and other controls, to measure the collective behavioral propensities to stigmatized terms and to explore the global reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic in the real world. We calculated the ratio of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases to the regional population as the cumulative rate (R) of a specific country or territory and calculated the Gini coefficient (G) to measure the collective heterogeneity of crowd behavior. RESULTS: People around the world are using stigmatizing terms on Google Search, and these terms were used earlier than the official names. Many stigmatized monikers against China (eg, “Wuhan pneumonia,” G=0.73; “Wuhan coronavirus,” G=0.60; “China pneumonia,” G=0.59; “China coronavirus,” G=0.52; “Chinese coronavirus,” G=0.50) had high collective heterogeneity of crowd behavior between December 30, 2019, and July 15, 2020, while the official terms “COVID-19” (G=0.44) and “SARS-CoV-2” (G=0.42) have not become de facto standard usages. Moreover, the pattern of high consistent usage was observed in 13 territories with low cumulative rates (R) between January 16 and July 15, 2020, out of 58 countries and territories that have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the scientific literature, multifarious naming practices may have provoked unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing Chinese people. The World Health Organization; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and the media initiated campaigns for fighting back against the COVID-19 infodemic with the same mission but in diverse voices. CONCLUSIONS: Infodemiological analysis can articulate the collective propensities to stigmatized monikers across search behaviors, which may reflect the collective sentiment of backlash against China and Chinese people in the real world. The full-fledged official terms are expected to fight back against the resilience of negative perceptual bias amid the COVID-19 epidemic. Such official naming efforts against the infodemic should be met with a fair share of identification in scientific conventions and sociocultural paradigms. As an integral component of preparedness, appropriate nomenclatures should be duly assigned to the newly identified coronavirus, and social mobilization in a uniform voice is a priority for combating the next infodemic.","Hu, Zhiwen; Yang, Zhongliang; Li, Qi; Zhang, An",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156807/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22639,20

The most frequent types of cancers in children and adolescents are leukemias, followed by brain and central nervous system tumors and lymphomas. The recovery rate of cancer in children is around 80% in developed countries and up to 30% in developing countries. Some of the main causes of complications in children and adolescents with cancer are respiratory viral infections, mainly in bone marrow-transplanted patients. Respiratory viruses have been detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage or nasal wash specimens from cancer patients with or without respiratory illness symptoms. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is within the ten most common viruses that are encountered in samples from pediatric patients with underlying oncology conditions. In most of cases, HMPV is found as the only viral agent, but co-infection with other viruses or with bacterial agents has also been reported. The discrepancies between the most prevalent viral agents may be due to the different populations studied or the range of viral agents tested. Some of the cases of infection with HMPV in cancer patients have been fatal, especially in those who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Post-immunization boosting may be required, perhaps on an annual basis if the virus becomes an endemic pathogen. Seasonal influenza virus vaccines are already developed every year, an undertaking made possible by a robust global vaccine production and distribution infrastructure. To create a seasonal combination vaccine targeting influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 that is also amenable to frequent reformulation, we have developed a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) genetic platform that “reprograms” the virus to package an immunogenic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein onto IAV particles. Vaccination with this combination vaccine elicits neutralizing antibodies and provides protection from lethal challenge with both pathogens. This technology may allow for leveraging of established influenza vaccine infrastructure to generate a cost-effective and scalable seasonal vaccine solution for both influenza and coronaviruses.","Chaparian, Ryan R.; Harding, Alfred T.; Riebe, Kristina; Karlsson, Amelia; Sempowski, Gregory D.; Heaton, Nicholas S.; Heaton, Brook E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.30.441968,20

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is a key component of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which drives gene expression in response to IFN-I. Using electron microscopy, we found that, in naive cells, U-STAT2, lacking the activating tyrosine phosphorylation, forms a heterodimer with U-STAT1 in an inactive, anti-parallel conformation. A novel phosphorylation of STAT2 on T404 promotes IFN-I signaling by disrupting the U-STAT1-U-STAT2 dimer, facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 2 and enhancing the DNA-binding ability of ISGF3. IKK-ε, activated by virus infection, phosphorylates T404 directly. Mice with a T-A mutation at the corresponding residue (T403) are highly susceptible to virus infections. We conclude that T404 phosphorylation drives a critical conformational switch that, by boosting the response to IFN-I in infected cells, enables a swift and efficient antiviral defense.","Wang, Yuxin; Song, Qiaoling; Huang, Wei; Lin, Yuxi; Wang, Xin; Wang, Chenyao; Willard, Belinda; Zhao, Chenyang; Nan, Jing; Holvey-Bates, Elise; Wang, Zhuoya; Taylor, Derek; Yang, Jinbo; Stark, George R.",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759968/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-020-0386-6,20

Our current top-down approach will not provide these countries with adequate supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. Consequently, they will have to use a bottom-up approach based on inexpensive generic agents that either modify the host response to influenza virus or act as antiviral agents. Several of these agents have shown promise, and many are currently produced in developing countries. Investigators must primarily identify agents for managing infection in populations and not simply seek explanations for how they work. They must determine in which countries these agents are produced and define patterns of distribution and costs. Because prepandemic research cannot establish whether these agents will be effective in a pandemic, randomized controlled trials must begin immediately after a new pandemic virus has emerged. Without this research, industrialized and developing countries could face an unprecedented health crisis.","Fedson, David S.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1503.080857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19239746/,20

A retrospective review was conducted on the basis of data on facial trauma presented at the ED of XXX Hospital from 24 January 2020 to 23 March 2020 and the same period in the previous two years. Multivariate linear regression model was employed to explore potential determinants associated with daily number of facial trauma. Significant reduction was observed in the amount of facial trauma during the COVID-19 level I emergency response. The trauma volume evenly distributed over the week. The declined most significantly by age group, 20-29 years, and by time range of visit, 00:00-08:00. Multivariate regression analyses revealed positive relationship between daily minimum temperature and facial trauma volume. The number of facial injuries decreased significantly during the COVID-19 Level 1 emergency response, with the least reduction in total daytime facial trauma and in infant and child facial trauma. And a higher minimum temperature may lead to increased number of facial trauma presentations.","Zhang, Yi; Liu, Ying; Wang, Tingliang; Dong, Jiasheng; Xu, Hua",International journal of injury control and safety promotion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404323/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17457300.2021.1909624,20
682838,Alterations in Nerve-Evoked Bladder Contractions in a Coronavirus-Induced Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis,2014-10-13,"Lifestyle changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had mostly negative consequences for individual, relationship, and sexual functioning. However, some individuals have reported increases in sexual desire and made new additions to their sex lives. Given that stress-provoking situations can sometimes make mortality more salient and heighten sexual desire, it is possible that lifestyle changes and fear of COVID-19 infection may have benefited some relationships. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 303 romantically involved adults (58.1% men) and found that lifestyle changes were associated with negative changes in one's sex life, unrelated to wanting to spend time with one's partner, and positively associated with relationship quality. Lifestyle changes were also positively associated with sexual desire, but only for participants with high (vs. low) fear of COVID-19 infection. For these participants, sexual desire was associated with positive changes in one's sex life and wanting to spend time with one's partner, but not with overall relationship quality. Results were consistent after controlling for pandemic-related anxiety and demographic variables. This study advances literature focused on the importance of romantic relationships in stress-provoking situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic by shedding light on the association between sexual desire and personal and relational well-being.","Rodrigues, David L; Lehmiller, Justin J",J Sex Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431724/; https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2021.1966359,20

METHODS: Timeloss claims data were collected for 1992–2002 from the Association of Workers’ Compensation Boards of Canada. Labour Force data from Statistics Canada were used to calculate injury rates. The Occupational Health and Safety Agency for Healthcare in British Columbia coordinated with provincial occupational health and safety agencies in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia to analyze injury data and collate prevention measures in their regions. RESULTS: The national timeloss injury rate declined from 4.3 to 3.7 injuries per 100 personyears since 1998. Musculoskeletal injuries consistently comprised the majority of timeloss claims. Needlestick injuries, infectious diseases and stress-related claims infrequently resulted in timeloss claims although they are known to cause great concern in the workplace. Prevention measures taken in the various provinces related to safer equipment (lifts and electric beds), return-to-work programs, and violence prevention initiatives. Different eligibility criteria as well as adjudication policies confounded the comparison of injury rates across provinces. DISCUSSION: Since 2000, all provinces experienced healthcare restructuring and increased workload in an aging workforce. Despite these increased risks, injury rates have decreased. Attribution for these trends is complex, but there is reason to believe that focus on prevention can further decrease injuries. While occupational health is a provincial jurisdiction, harmonizing data in addition to sharing data on successful prevention measures and best practices may improve workplace conditions and thereby further reduce injury rates for higher risk healthcare sector occupations.","Yassi, Annalee; Gilbert, Mark; Cvitkovich, Yuri",Canadian Journal of Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16238148/,20

The physical, social, and organizational infrastructure of healthcare systems across the world is being stressed. This pandemic has highlighted that the healthcare of the country is as strong as its weakest link and that no aspect of life, be it social or economic, is spared from this pandemic. The authors would like to highlight some of the lessons learned from Singapores management of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the Singaporean Covid-19 pandemic, public health policy planning was all encompassing in its coverage, involving various stakeholders in government and society. The important role of individuals, governments, industry, and primary healthcare practitioners when tackling COVID-19 are highlighted. Singapores management of the Covid-19 pandemic involved an approach that involved the whole of society, with a particular focus on supporting the vulnerable foreign worker population, which formed the majority of Covid-19 cases in the country. Hopefully amidst the trying times, valuable lessons are learnt that will be etched into medical history and collective memory. We hope to highlight these lessons for future generations, both for members of the public and fellow healthcare practitioners.","Wang, Samuel S. Y.; Teo, Winnie Z.

According blame to three different social and political entities—Tablighi Jamaat (a Muslim group), the Modi government, and migrant workers (a heterogeneous group)—are the dependent variables in three OLS regression models testing the effect of the no‐blame treatment, controlling for Facebook use, social identity (religion), vote in the 2019 national election, and other demographics. Results show respondents in the treatment group were more likely to allay blame, affective polarization (dislike for outgroup members) was social identity based, not partisan based, and Facebook/Instagram use was not significant. Congress and United Progressive Alliance voters in 2019 were less likely to blame the Modi government for the initial spread. Unlike extant research in western contexts, affective and political polarization appear to be distinct concepts in India where social identity complexity is important. This study of the first wave informs perceptions of blame in future waves, which are discussed in conclusion along with questions for future research.","Arabaghatta Basavaraj, Kiran; Saikia, Pahi; Varughese, Anil; Semetko, Holli A.; Kumar, Anup",Polit Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.12774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548718/,20
689900,Back to basics in COVID‐19: Antigens and antibodies—Completing the puzzle,2021-03-18,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many changes in the way research is conducted. Some specific groups (e.g. women) and activities (e.g. teaching) may have been disproportionally affected. Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animal behaviour and welfare researchers’ work experience and productivity, focussing on gender, care role, career stage and teaching load. An online survey asked researchers about childcare, research and teaching load and associated changes due to the pandemic, among others, and included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviours (ISSB). From June-July 2020, 117 completed responses were received from 28 countries. Time available for writing papers and grants either increased (36%), decreased (31%) or these tasks were halted completely (12%). Perceived productivity was significantly lower for caregivers (P < 0.001) and for men as compared to women (P < 0.001); and low productivity was associated with more stress (higher PSS: P < 0.001). Respondents’ experience of the pandemic related to the PSS (b = -0.03 ± 0.02; P = 0.03) and to self-assessed personality traits (P = 0.01). The average PSS of 21 ± 6.5 was greater than the reference value of 15, and was higher when respondents had low job security (P < 0.001) and when they more strongly characterised themselves as perfectionists, hard-working, empathetic and worried (P = 0.02). Respondents who had an intense care role received most social support (P = 0.04). Teaching load increased for 25% of the respondents but did not significantly relate to any of the response variables. Overall, caregivers and early career researchers faced the most difficulties, and personality traits had a major impact on the ability to cope with the changes caused by the pandemic.","Camerlink, Irene; Nielsen, Birte L.; Windschnurer, Ines; Vigors, Belinda",Appl Anim Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583984/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105255; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121000423?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168159121000423,20

The Network adopted a strategy to optimize its inventory and improve the quality of its banked units based on a quality improvement process using outcome data regularly provided by Eurocord. This study aimed to describe the results, over 10 years, of UCBT facilitated by a national network that used the same criteria of UCB collection and banking and to assess how modifications of banking criteria and unit selection might influence transplant outcomes. Nine hundred and ninety-nine units (593 single-unit and 203 double-unit grafts) were released by the Network to transplant 796 patients with malignant (83%) and non-malignant (17%) diseases. Median cell dose exceeded 3.5 × 10(7) TNC/kg in 86%. There was a trend to select units more recently collected and with higher cell dose. Neutrophil engraftment was 88.2% (85.7–90.7) and 79.3% (72.6–86.5) respectively for malignant and non-malignant diseases with a trend to faster recovery with higher cell doses. The respective 3-year transplant-related mortality were 31.1% (27.5–35.1) and 34.3% (27.0–43.5). OS was 49% ± 4 in malignant and 62% ± 4 in non-malignant disorders. In multivariate analysis, cell dose was the only unit-related factor associated with outcomes. Our results reflect the benefit on clinical outcomes of the strategy adopted by the Network to bank units with higher cell counts.","Rafii, Hanadi; Garnier, Federico; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Ionescu, Irina; Ballot, Caroline; Bensoussan, Danièle; Chabannon, Christian; Dazey, Bernard; De Vos, John; Gautier, Eric; Giraud, Christine; Larghero, Jérome; Cras, Audrey; Mialou, Valérie; Persoons, Virginie; Pouthier, Fabienne; Thibert, Jean-Baptiste; Dalle, Jean-Hugues; Michel, Gerard; Kenzey, Chantal; Volt, Fernanda; Rocha, Vanderson; Bay, Jacques-Olivier; Rubio, Marie-Thérèse; Faucher, Catherine; Marry, Evelyne; Gluckman, Eliane",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-021-01313-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990703/,20
690640,Pathogenetic determinants in Kawasaki disease: the haematological point of view,2017-01-07,"Exposure of piglets less than 2 weeks of age to virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) gives rise to mortality as high as 100%, and adult pigs recovering from its infection often become TGEV carriers. These facts suggest an evasion of the immune system by virulent TGEV. In this study, we showed that a virulent TGEV SHXB strain could infect porcine immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), and down-regulate cell surface markers (SLA-II-DR, CD1a and CD80/86). Moreover, SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs showed low expression of IL-12 and IFN-γ, and also lost the ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. Finally, SHXB inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in these cells. Instead, UV-inactivated SHXB (UV-SHXB) had the opposite effects in immature Mo-DCs. In conclusion, the virulent SHXB could severely impair immature Mo-DCs, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of virulent TGEV in vivo.","Zhao, Shanshan; Gao, Qi; Lin, Jian; Yan, Mengfei; Yu, Qinghua; Yang, Qian",Res Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25307113/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528814002458; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.09.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528814002458,20
690700,2019-nCoV - Towards a 4th generation vaccine,2020-02-12,"The critical immune effectors, including T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages participate in regulating immune responses during pregnancy. Among these immune cells, decidual NK (dNK) cells are involved in key placental development processes at the maternal–fetal interface, such as uterine spiral artery remodeling, trophoblast invasion, and decidualization. Mechanistically, dNK cells significantly influence pregnancy outcome by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic mediators and by their interactions with trophoblasts and other decidual cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that participate in the initiation and progression of human diseases. Although the functions of circulating miRNAs in pathological mechanism has been extensively studied, the regulatory roles of miRNAs in NK cells, especially in dNK cells, have been rarely reported. In this review, we analyze the effects of miRNA regulations of dNK cell functions on the immune system during gestation. We discuss aberrant expressions of certain miRNAs in dNK cells that may lead to pathological consequences, such as recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Interestingly, miRNA expression patterns are also different between dNK cells and peripheral NK (pNK) cells, and pNK cells in the first- and third‐trimester of gestation. The dysregulation of miRNA plays a pivotal regulatory role in driving immune functions of dNK and pNK cells. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of miRNAs in dNK cells may provide new insights into the development of therapeutics to prevent pregnancy failure.","Li, Liman; Feng, Ting; Zhou, Weijie; Liu, Yuan; Li, Hong",Reprod Biol Endocrinol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12958-021-00812-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600537/,20
