64,Model-Based Design of Growth-Attenuated Viruses,2006-09-01,"Live-virus vaccines activate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, require only a single boosting, and generally provide longer immune protection than killed or subunit vaccines. However, growth of live-virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serial-transfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes has the potential to attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein. Such models will facilitate the engineering of new live-virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene-expression and growth.","Lim, Kwang-il; Lang, Tobias; Lam, Vy; Yin, John",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1557587/,49
367,The Impact of Contact Tracing in Clustered Populations,2010-03-26,"The tracing of potentially infectious contacts has become an important part of the control strategy for many infectious diseases, from early cases of novel infections to endemic sexually transmitted infections. Here, we make use of mathematical models to consider the case of partner notification for sexually transmitted infection, however these models are sufficiently simple to allow more general conclusions to be drawn. We show that, when contact network structure is considered in addition to contact tracing, standard “mass action” models are generally inadequate. To consider the impact of mutual contacts (specifically clustering) we develop an improvement to existing pairwise network models, which we use to demonstrate that ceteris paribus, clustering improves the efficacy of contact tracing for a large region of parameter space. This result is sometimes reversed, however, for the case of highly effective contact tracing. We also develop stochastic simulations for comparison, using simple re-wiring methods that allow the generation of appropriate comparator networks. In this way we contribute to the general theory of network-based interventions against infectious disease.","House, Thomas; Keeling, Matt J.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845652/,49
374,Dynamics and Control of Diseases in Networks with Community Structure,2010-04-08,"The dynamics of infectious diseases spread via direct person-to-person transmission (such as influenza, smallpox, HIV/AIDS, etc.) depends on the underlying host contact network. Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics. These results have implications for the design of control strategies.","Salathé, Marcel; Jones, James H.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851561/,49
967,"SEED Servers: High-Performance Access to the SEED Genomes, Annotations, and Metabolic Models",2012-10-24,"The remarkable advance in sequencing technology and the rising interest in medical and environmental microbiology, biotechnology, and synthetic biology resulted in a deluge of published microbial genomes. Yet, genome annotation, comparison, and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge, hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains >5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users.","Aziz, Ramy K.; Devoid, Scott; Disz, Terrence; Edwards, Robert A.; Henry, Christopher S.; Olsen, Gary J.; Olson, Robert; Overbeek, Ross; Parrello, Bruce; Pusch, Gordon D.; Stevens, Rick L.; Vonstein, Veronika; Xia, Fangfang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480482/,49
1533,ICoVax 2013: The 3(rd )ISV Pre-conference Computational Vaccinology Workshop,2014-03-19,"Following last year's computational vaccinology workshop in Shanghai, China, the third ISV Pre-conference Computational Vaccinology Workshop (ICoVax 2013) was held in Barcelona, Spain. ICoVax 2013 provided an international platform for the attendees to showcase their research and discuss problems and solutions in the development and application of computational vaccinology and vaccine informatics tools. The first of the three full-length papers presented at ICoVax discussed the discovery of viral ""camouflage"" through cross-conservation of T-cell epitopes using a tool called JanusMatrix. This important paper reports that viruses may camouflage their presence in the human body by incorporating sequences in their proteins that are highly cross-conserved at the T-cell receptor surface with human genome proteins, a discovery that has wide ranging implications for the development of vaccines against viruses that use the camouflage method. The other papers described a database for storing experimentally verified data on DNA vaccines and compared therapeutic targets of western drugs to Chinese herbal medicines for cardiovascular diseases. The short poster presentations covered various uses of informatics tools for processing the DNA and microRNA of pathogens to improve vaccine coverage, efficacy and development. A live (on-line) demonstration of the vaccine design toolkit, iVax, presented by Frances Terry of EpiVax, illustrated how computational vaccinology could be used in the design of next generation vaccines.","De Groot, Anne S; De Groot, Phoebe; He, Yongqun",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4094997/,49
1637,A model-based information sharing protocol for profile Hidden Markov Models used for HIV-1 recombination detection,2014-06-19,"BACKGROUND: In many applications, a family of nucleotide or protein sequences classified into several subfamilies has to be modeled. Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are widely used for this task, modeling each subfamily separately by one pHMM. However, a major drawback of this approach is the difficulty of dealing with subfamilies composed of very few sequences. One of the most crucial bioinformatical tasks affected by the problem of small-size subfamilies is the subtyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences, i.e., HIV-1 subtypes for which only a small number of sequences is known. RESULTS: To deal with small samples for particular subfamilies of HIV-1, we introduce a novel model-based information sharing protocol. It estimates the emission probabilities of the pHMM modeling a particular subfamily not only based on the nucleotide frequencies of the respective subfamily but also incorporating the nucleotide frequencies of all available subfamilies. To this end, the underlying probabilistic model mimics the pattern of commonality and variation between the subtypes with regards to the biological characteristics of HI viruses. In order to implement the proposed protocol, we make use of an existing HMM architecture and its associated inference engine. CONCLUSIONS: We apply the modified algorithm to classify HIV-1 sequence data in the form of partial HIV-1 sequences and semi-artificial recombinants. Thereby, we demonstrate that the performance of pHMMs can be significantly improved by the proposed technique. Moreover, we show that our algorithm performs significantly better than Simplot and Bootscanning.","Bulla, Ingo; Schultz, Anne-Kathrin; Chesneau, Christophe; Mark, Tanya; Serea, Florin",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4230192/,49
1966,Disparities in Spatial Prevalence of Feline Retroviruses due to Data Aggregation: A Case of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem,2014-02-19,"The knowledge of the spatial distribution feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus infections, which are untreatable, can inform on their risk factors and high-risk areas to enhance control. However, when spatial analysis involves aggregated spatial data, results may be influenced by the spatial scale of aggregation, an effect known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). In this study, area level risk factors for both infections in 28,914 cats tested with ELISA were investigated by multivariable spatial Poisson regression models along with MAUP effect on spatial clustering and cluster detection (for postal codes, counties, and states) by Moran's I test and spatial scan test, respectively. The study results indicate that the significance and magnitude of the association of risk factors with both infections varied with aggregation scale. Further more, Moran's I test only identified spatial clustering at postal code and county levels of aggregation. Similarly, the spatial scan test indicated that the number, size, and location of clusters varied over aggregation scales. In conclusion, the association between infection and area was influenced by the choice of spatial scale and indicates the importance of study design and data analysis with respect to specific research questions.","Chhetri, Bimal K.; Berke, Olaf; Pearl, David L.; Bienzle, Dorothee",J Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590838/,49
2543,Functional community structure of African monodominant Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forest influenced by local environmental filtering,2016-12-20,"Monodominant patches of forest dominated by Gilbertiodendron dewevrei are commonly found in central African tropical forests, alongside forests with high species diversity. Although these forests are generally found sparsely distributed along rivers, their occurrence is not thought to be (clearly) driven by edaphic conditions but rather by trait combinations of G. dewevrei that aid in achieving monodominance. Functional community structure between these monodominant and mixed forests has, however, not yet been compared. Additionally, little is known about nondominant species in the monodominant forest community. These two topics are addressed in this study. We investigate the functional community structure of 10 one‐hectare plots of monodominant and mixed forests in a central region of the Congo basin, in DR Congo. Thirteen leaf and wood traits are measured, covering 95% (basal area weighted) of all species present in the plots, including leaf nutrient contents, leaf isotopic compositions, specific leaf area, wood density, and vessel anatomy. The trait‐based assessment of G. dewevrei shows an ensemble of traits related to water use and transport that could be favorable for its location near forest rivers. Moreover, indications have been found for N and P limitations in the monodominant forest, possibly related to ectomycorrhizal associations formed with G. dewevrei. Reduced leaf N and P contents are found at the community level for the monodominant forest and for different nondominant groups, as compared to those in the mixed forest. In summary, this work shows that environmental filtering does prevail in the monodominant G. dewevrei forest, leading to lower functional diversity in this forest type, with the dominant species showing beneficial traits related to its common riverine locations and with reduced soil N and P availability found in this environment, both coregulating the tree community assembly.","Kearsley, Elizabeth; Verbeeck, Hans; Hufkens, Koen; Van de Perre, Frederik; Doetterl, Sebastian; Baert, Geert; Beeckman, Hans; Boeckx, Pascal; Huygens, Dries",Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5216677/,49
2552,A Likelihood Approach for Real-Time Calibration of Stochastic Compartmental Epidemic Models,2017-01-17,"Stochastic transmission dynamic models are especially useful for studying the early emergence of novel pathogens given the importance of chance events when the number of infectious individuals is small. However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction for these types of stochastic models remain limited. In this manuscript, we describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations, and uses each new surveillance observation to update the belief about the true epidemic state. Using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, we evaluate the accuracy of MSS for real-time parameter estimation and prediction during epidemics. We assume that weekly counts for the number of new diagnosed cases are available and serve as an imperfect proxy of incidence. We show that MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters (i.e. mean duration of infectiousness, R(0), and R(eff)) and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compare the performance of MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods: 1) a likelihood approximation with an assumption of independent Poisson observations; 2) a particle filtering method; and 3) an ensemble Kalman filter method. We find that MSS significantly outperforms each of these three benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. In summary, MSS is a promising method that may improve on current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics.","Zimmer, Christoph; Yaesoubi, Reza; Cohen, Ted",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240920/,49
2922,A mechanistic spatio-temporal framework for modelling individual-to-individual transmission—With an application to the 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak,2017-10-30,"In recent years there has been growing availability of individual-level spatio-temporal disease data, particularly due to the use of modern communicating devices with GPS tracking functionality. These detailed data have been proven useful for inferring disease transmission to a more refined level than previously. However, there remains a lack of statistically sound frameworks to model the underlying transmission dynamic in a mechanistic manner. Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging.","Lau, Max S.

3346,Accounting for non-stationarity in epidemiology by embedding time-varying parameters in stochastic models,2018-08-15,"The spread of disease through human populations is complex. The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that time-varying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.","Cazelles, Bernard; Champagne, Clara; Dureau, Joseph",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110518/,49

5782,Tale of two serines,1989,"OBJECTIVES: To develop evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for children (including infants, school-aged children, and adolescents) with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. DESIGN: A panel of 49 international experts, representing 12 international organizations, as well as three methodologists and three public members was convened. Panel members assembled at key international meetings (for those panel members attending the conference), and a stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in November 2018. A formal conflict-of-interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among the chairs, co-chairs, methodologists, and group heads, as well as within subgroups, served as an integral part of the guideline development process. METHODS: The panel consisted of six subgroups: recognition and management of infection, hemodynamics and resuscitation, ventilation, endocrine and metabolic therapies, adjunctive therapies, and research priorities. We conducted a systematic review for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or as a best practice statement. In addition, “in our practice” statements were included when evidence was inconclusive to issue a recommendation, but the panel felt that some guidance based on practice patterns may be appropriate. RESULTS: The panel provided 77 statements on the management and resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Overall, six were strong recommendations, 49 were weak recommendations, and nine were best-practice statements. For 13 questions, no recommendations could be made; but, for 10 of these, “in our practice” statements were provided. In addition, 52 research priorities were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A large cohort of international experts was able to achieve consensus regarding many recommendations for the best care of children with sepsis, acknowledging that most aspects of care had relatively low quality of evidence resulting in the frequent issuance of weak recommendations. Despite this challenge, these recommendations regarding the management of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction provide a foundation for consistent care to improve outcomes and inform future research.","Weiss, Scott L.; Peters, Mark J.; Alhazzani, Waleed; Agus, Michael S.

6143,Abstracts of the 49th Annual Meeting of the EASD,2013-08-16,"Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is used to treat various cardiopulmonary disorders associated with pulmonary hypertension. The rationale is based on the fact that NO, given by inhalation, only dilates those pulmonary vessels that perfuse well-ventilated lung units. As a result, pulmonary gas exchange is improved while pulmonary vascular resistance is reduced and pulmonary blood flow is increased. Inhaled NO has been succesfully applied to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, reducing the need for extracorporeal life support. Although pulmonary hypertension and altered vasoreactivity contribute to profound hypoxaemia in adult and paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the benefit of inhaled NO still remains to be established in patients with ARDS. ARDS is a complex response of the lung to direct or indirect insults, leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and various inflammatory responses. Recent randomized trials suggest that inhaled NO only causes a transient improvement in oxygenation. Whether this effect is important in the long-term management of ARDS remains to be established. NO, measured in the exhaled breath, is an elegant and non-invasive means to monitor inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the normal upper airways, the bulk of exhaled NO originates from the paranasal sinuses. Exhaled NO is increased in nasal allergy and decreased in cystic fibrosis, nasal polyposis and chronic sinusitis. That NO production is increased in asthmatic airways is also well established. However, several questions still need to be addressed, in particular evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of the measurement techniques, and assessment of the bronchodilator action of endogenous NO.","Thébaud, B.; Arnal, J.-F.; Mercier, J.

6247,Chinese vaccine developers gain WHO imprimatur,2011-06-07,"Annual outbreaks of influenza A infection are an ongoing public health threat and novel influenza strains can periodically emerge to which humans have little immunity, resulting in devastating pandemics. The 1918 pandemic killed at least 40 million people worldwide and pandemics in 1957 and 1968 caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. The influenza A virus is capable of enormous genetic variation, both by continuous, gradual mutation and by reassortment of genome segments between viruses. Both the 1957 and 1968 pandemic strains are thought to have originated as reassortants in which one or both human-adapted viral surface proteins were replaced by proteins from avian influenza strains. Analyses of the genes of the 1918 pandemic virus, however, indicate that this strain might have had a different origin. The haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genome segments in particular are unlikely to have come directly from an avian source that is similar to those that are currently being sequenced. Determining whether a pandemic influenza virus can emerge by different mechanisms will affect the scope and focus of surveillance and prevention efforts.","Reid, Ann H.; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.; Fanning, Thomas G.",Nat Rev Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097663/,49

6263,Patent protection and access to genetic resources,2008,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine the governance and policy-making challenges in the context of “wicked problems” based on the case of pandemic influenza. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The case study research is based on an analysis of official documentation and interviews with policy elites at multiple levels of UK governance. FINDINGS: Results of this study show that policy actors regard risk communication, the dynamics of international public policy and UK territorial governance as the main governance challenges in the management of influenza at a macro-level. The paper also serves to identify that although contingencies management for epidemiological issues require technical and scientific considerations to feature in governance arrangements, equally there are key “wicked problems” in the context public policy that pervade the health security sector. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study indicates the need to build in resources at a national level to plan for policy coordination challenges in areas that might at first be seen as devoid of political machinations (such as technical areas of public policy that might be underpinned by epidemiological processes). The identification of the major governance challenges that emerge from the pandemic influenza case study is a springboard for a research agenda in relation to the analysis of the parallels and paradoxes of governance challenges for health security across EU member states. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper provides a novel interrogation of the pandemic influenza case study in the context of UK governance and public policy by providing a strategic policy lens from perspective of elites.","Connolly, John",Disaster Prev Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098008/,49

The field of VCA has entered its second decade with an increasing experience in both the impressive good outcomes, as well as defining challenges, risks, and experienced poor results. The limited and selective publishing of negative outcomes in this relatively new field makes it difficult to conclusively evaluate outcomes of graft and patient survival and morbidities. Therefore, published data, conference proceedings, and communications were summarized in an attempt to provide a current outline of complications. These data on the medical complications of VCA should allow for precautions to avoid poor outcomes, data to better provide informed consent to potential recipients, and result in improvements in graft and patient outcomes as VCA finds a place as a therapeutic option for selected patients.","Uluer, Mehmet C.; Brazio, Philip S.; Woodall, Jhade D.; Nam, Arthur J.; Bartlett, Stephen T.; Barth, Rolf N.",Curr Transplant Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101879/,49

The composition of the target bilayer exerts a complex influence on both fusion efficiency and time. Here, an in vitro, single-particle approach is used to study this effect. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a microfluidic flow cell, the hemifusion of single virions is visualized. Hemifusion efficiency and kinetics are studied while altering target bilayer cholesterol content and sialic-acid donor. Cholesterol ratios tested were 0%, 10%, 20%, and 40%. Sialic-acid donors GD1a and GYPA were used. Both cholesterol ratio and sialic-acid donors proved to have a significant effect on hemifusion efficiency. Furthermore, comparison between GD1a and GYPA conditions shows that the cholesterol dependence of the hemifusion time is severely affected by the sialic-acid donor. Only GD1a shows a clear increasing trend in hemifusion efficiency and time with increasing cholesterol concentration of the target bilayer with maximum rates for GD1A and 40% cholesterol. Overall our results show that sialic acid donor and target bilayer composition should be carefully chosen, depending on the desired hemifusion time and efficiency in the experiment.","van der Borg, Guus; Braddock, Scarlett; Blijleven, Jelle S; van Oijen, Antoine M; Roos, Wouter H",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104739/,49

As a result, no effective disease-modifying therapies are currently available, and no method exists to allow detection at early disease stages, and as a result diagnoses are only made decades after disease pathogenesis, by which time the majority of physical damage has already occurred. Since the sequencing of the human genome, we have come to appreciate that the transcriptional output of the human genome is extremely rich in non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This heterogeneous class of transcripts is widely expressed in the nervous system, and is likely to play many crucial roles in the development and functioning of this organ. Most exciting, evidence has recently been presented that ncRNAs play central, but hitherto unappreciated roles in neurodegenerative processes. Here, we review the diverse available evidence demonstrating involvement of ncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss their possible implications in the development of therapies and biomarkers for these conditions.","Johnson, Rory; Noble, Wendy; Tartaglia, Gian Gaetano; Buckley, Noel J.",Prog Neurobiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7116994/,49

EFSA provides scientific advice to the risk manager, at both European and Member State level, for the identification of risks present in the food chain. In the area of currently unrecognised but potentially significant risks for public health, EFSA has set up a dedicated unit on emerging risks (EMRISK). Through the identification of drivers of emerging risks, EFSA also intends to anticipate future risks derived from changes in current food/feed production practices or factors impinging on food/feed production or changes in human exposure through food consumption. EFSA aims to establish a data monitoring capacity, data filtering methodology and networking structures to identify emerging risks and drivers of emerging risks in a timely fashion and to communicate these to the risk manager. To date, the first step of this process (data monitoring) is in place. The following steps, that is, filtering and communication, are being rapidly established. Whilst the current data sources monitored are limited, they have been sufficient to enable the elaboration of the procedures for the next steps in the emerging risks identification process. As more data sources become accessible, the process will become more effective. All processes should be in place by mid −2010 and reported on in EFSA's first annual report on emerging risks in 2011.

The correct attribution of individuals to species by the discriminant functions ranged from 97% to 100%. The analysis of discriminant loadings shows which characters contribute more to the discrimination of species. Although many species could be identified with some confidence by a sequential monothetic key based on meristic and qualitative characters, the discriminant analysis improves the effectiveness of identification of all species.","BELFIORE, C.",Syst Entomol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169543/,49

A growth curve, based on cytopathic effect (CPE), immunofluorescence (IF), hemadsorption (Hads) and hemagglutination (HA), showed that SPTh and PPK cells were most susceptible for cultivation and quantitation of the virus. For the detection of replication in tubes inoculated with small amounts of virus, CPE, Hads and HA appeared to be useful and sensitive criteria. Repeated virus quantitation trials revealed a high variation in titration end‐points, even in the most susceptible cell types. The optimal procedure for the isolation of HEV from clinical specimens is preferably to inoculate the material on SPTh or PPK cells and to make a blind passage if the HA test at 7 days post inoculation is negative.

12534,Perspectives on ENCODE,2020-07-29,"Many proteins regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific regions encoded in the genome(1). Here we introduce a new data set of RNA elements in the human genome that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project phase III. This class of regulatory elements functions only when transcribed into RNA, as they serve as the binding sites for RBPs that control post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, and the editing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs. We describe the mapping and characterization of RNA elements recognized by a large collection of human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify RBP binding sites on RNA and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of RBPs, the function of RBP binding sites and the subcellular localization of RBPs, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 RBPs. We describe the spectrum of RBP binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, splicing regulation and RNA localization. These data expand the catalogue of functional elements encoded in the human genome by the addition of a large set of elements that function at the RNA level by interacting with RBPs.","Van Nostrand, Eric L.; Freese, Peter; Pratt, Gabriel A.; Wang, Xiaofeng; Wei, Xintao; Xiao, Rui; Blue, Steven M.; Chen, Jia-Yu; Cody, Neal A.

12594,Branching out,2005-08-31,"Hazara nairovirus (HAZV) is an enveloped trisegmented negative-strand RNA virus classified within the Nairoviridae family of the Bunyavirales order and a member of the same subtype as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, responsible for fatal human disease. Nairoviral subversion of cellular trafficking pathways to permit viral entry, gene expression, assembly, and egress is poorly understood. Here, we generated a recombinant HAZV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein and used live-cell fluorescent imaging to screen an siRNA library targeting genes involved in cellular trafficking networks, the first such screen for a nairovirus. The screen revealed prominent roles for subunits of the coat protein 1 (COPI)-vesicle coatomer, which regulates retrograde trafficking of cargo between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as intra-Golgi transport. We show the requirement of COPI-coatomer subunits impacted at least two stages of the HAZV replication cycle: an early stage prior to and including gene expression and also a later stage during assembly and egress of infectious virus, with COPI-knockdown reducing titers by approximately 1,000-fold. Treatment of HAZV-infected cells with brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of Arf1 activation required for COPI coatomer formation, revealed that this late COPI-dependent stage was Arf1 dependent, consistent with the established role of Arf1 in COPI vesicle formation. In contrast, the early COPI-dependent stage was Arf1 independent, with neither BFA treatment nor siRNA-mediated ARF1 knockdown affecting HAZV gene expression. HAZV exploitation of COPI components in a noncanonical Arf1-independent process suggests that COPI coatomer components may perform roles unrelated to vesicle formation, adding further complexity to our understanding of cargo-mediated transport. IMPORTANCE Nairoviruses are tick-borne enveloped RNA viruses that include several pathogens responsible for fatal disease in humans and animals. Here, we analyzed host genes involved in trafficking networks to examine their involvement in nairovirus replication. We revealed important roles for genes that express multiple components of the COPI complex, which regulates transport of Golgi apparatus-resident cargos. COPI components influenced at least two stages of the nairovirus replication cycle: an early stage prior to and including gene expression and also a later stage during assembly of infectious virus, with COPI knockdown reducing titers by approximately 1,000-fold. Importantly, while the late stage was Arf1 dependent, as expected for canonical COPI vesicle formation, the early stage was found to be Arf1 independent, suggestive of a previously unreported function of COPI unrelated to vesicle formation. Collectively, these data improve our understanding of nairovirus host-pathogen interactions and suggest a new Arf1-independent role for components of the COPI coatomer complex.","Fuller, J.; Álvarez-Rodríguez, B.; Todd, E.

The study was conducted in 12 ICUs of four hospitals. The total cost for the prevention of MDROs and the secondary attack rate (SAR) of MDROs for each strategy were collected retrospectively from 2046 subjects from January to December 2017. The average cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were calculated. Hand hygiene (HH) had the lowest total cost (2149.6 RMB) and SAR of MDROs (8.8%) while single-room isolation showed the highest cost (33 700.2 RMB) and contact isolation had the highest SAR of MDROs (31.8%). The average cost per unit infection prevention was 24 427.8 RMB, with the HH strategy followed by the environment disinfection strategy (CER = 21 314.67). HH had the highest iterative cost effect under willingness to pay less than 2000 RMB. Due to the low cost for repeatability and obvious effectiveness, we conclude that HH is the optimal strategy for MDROs infections in ICUs in developing countries. The cost-effectiveness of the four prevention strategies provides some reference for developing countries but multiple strategies remain to be examined.","Wang, Ying; Yuan, Yufeng; Lin, Likai; Tan, Xiaodong; Tan, Yibin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439291/,49

This designation was given on the basis of the postoperative appearance of intramedullary hypertense areas in T2-MRI, resulting in devastating neurological damage. To our knowledge, only three cases of WCS have been published; we hereby present the fourth case, but the first one with late-onset presentation of this syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old male patient with Nurick grade 3 CSM was referred to our institution. He had already had a double-level C4–C6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) 2 years ago in another institution. The patient underwent posterior decompression from C3 to C6 plus C2–C7 lateral mass screw fusion. Within the first 24 h following surgery, he gradually developed C6 incomplete paraplegia (ASIA B). Cervical MRI disclosed a hypertensive signal in T2-weighted sequences at C6–C7 levels and the diagnosis of WCS was suspected. Revision surgery was made 30 h following our first surgery, with wider posterior decompression accompanied by intravenous methylprednisolone. The patient’s neurologic status was improved, but the final neurologic outcome was worse (Nurick 4) than the preoperative status and subsequently did not change at all. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a late-onset WCS and the fourth case of WCS per se. Spine surgeons should be aware of this rare but serious complication. We highlight possible risk factors and review the literature on the hypotheses about the pathophysiology of WCS.","Papaioannou, Ioannis; Repantis, Thomas; Baikousis, Andreas; Korovessis, Panagiotis",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6461846/,49

Discovery often corresponds with the onset of neurologic symptoms and no consensus exists regarding the importance of complete resection or anticipated postoperative outcome. We aim to elucidate treatment methodologies that exist in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a unique case of a 57-year-old male with a known history of esophageal adenocarcinoma, including brain and visceral metastases, who presented with cauda equina syndrome. An IDEM metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma lesion was identified on advanced imaging and biopsy. This was treated operatively without return of neurologic function. DISCUSSION: We reviewed and summarized the existing literature. Trends are highlighted to further guide surgeons treating this unusual metastatic phenomenon. CONCLUSION: Intradural metastasis is a harbinger of advanced disease with a poor prognosis regardless of the etiology of the primary lesion. There are a number of proposed mechanisms for metastatic spread with little available literature for surgeon guidance.

Upon the identification of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and other inflammatory mediators, investigations and developments of targeted agents have thrived. Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the circulating IgE, which in turn impedes and reduces subsequent releases of the proinflammatory mediators. In the past decade, omalizumab has been proven to be efficacious and well-tolerated in the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma in both trials and real-life studies, most notably in reducing exacerbation rates and corticosteroid use. While growing evidence has demonstrated that omalizumab may be potentially beneficial in treating other allergic diseases, its indication remains confined to treating severe allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Future efforts may be bestowed on determining the optimal length of omalizumab treatment, seeking biomarkers that could better predict treatment response and as well as extending its indications.","Cheng, Shih-Lung",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7825545/,49

We evaluated the effect of airway P. aeruginosa density on the clinical course of mechanically ventilated patients and the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of mechanically ventilated ICU patients with P. aeruginosa isolated from endotracheal aspirates. Patients were divided into three groups according to the peak P. aeruginosa density during ICU stay: low (≤ 10(4) cfu/mL), moderate (10(5)‒10(6) cfu/mL), and high (≥ 10(7) cfu/mL) peak density groups. The relationship between peak P. aeruginosa density and weaning from mechanical ventilation, risk factors for isolation of high peak density of P. aeruginosa, and antibiotic efficacy were investigated using multivariate and propensity score-matched analyses. RESULTS: Four-hundred-and-sixty-one patients were enrolled. Patients with high peak density of P. aeruginosa had higher inflammation and developed more severe respiratory infections. High peak density of P. aeruginosa was independently associated with few ventilator-free days on day 28 (P < 0.01) and increased ICU mortality (P = 0.047). Risk factors for high peak density of P. aeruginosa were prolonged mechanical ventilation (odd ratio [OR] 3.07 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35‒6.97), non-antipseudomonal cephalosporins (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.35‒3.49), hyperglycemia (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.26‒3.22) during ICU stay, and respiratory diseases (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.12‒3.23). Isolation of commensal colonizer was associated with lower risks of high peak density of P. aeruginosa (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26‒0.73). Propensity score-matched analysis revealed that antibiotic therapy for patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis improved weaning from mechanical ventilation only in the high peak P. aeruginosa group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high peak density of P. aeruginosa had worse ventilator outcome and ICU mortality. In patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis, antibiotic therapy was associated with favorable ventilator weaning only in the high peak P. aeruginosa density group, and bacterial density could be a good therapeutic indicator for ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis due to P. aeruginosa.

The use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to guide hypertension therapy has not been adequately evaluated. Participants free of cardiovascular disease were pooled from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults, and Jackson Heart Study. The risk for incident cardiovascular events (heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease), by CAC status (CAC-0 or CAC>0) and BP treatment group was assessed using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression. The 10-year number needed to treat to prevent a single cardiovascular event was also estimated. This study included 6461 participants (median age 53 years; 53.3% women; 32.3% Black participants). Over a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 347 incident cardiovascular events occurred. Compared with those with normal BP, the risk of incident cardiovascular event was higher among those with elevated BP/low-risk stage I hypertension and CAC>0 (hazard ratio, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7–3.4]) and high-risk stage I/stage II hypertension (BP, 140–160/80–100 mm Hg) with CAC>0 (hazard ratio, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.1–4.0]). A similar pattern was evident across racial subgroups and for individual study outcomes. Among those with CAC-0, the 10-year number needed to treat was 160 for elevated BP/low-risk stage I hypertension and 44 for high-risk stage I or stage II hypertension (BP, 140–160/80–100 mm Hg). Among those with CAC>0, the 10-year number needed to treat was 36 and 22, respectively. Utilization of the CAC score may guide the initiation of hypertension therapy and preventive approaches to personalize cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals where the current guidelines do not recommend treatment.","Parcha, Vibhu; Malla, Gargya; Kalra, Rajat; Li, Peng; Pandey, Ambarish; Nasir, Khurram; Arora, Garima; Arora, Pankaj",Hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7946744/,49

Despite global recognition of the significance of adolescent mental health, it remains a neglected area in research and health policy in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety among school going adolescents in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 563 students aged 13–18 years at selected schools (secondary and higher secondary) in Dhaka City. After providing written informed consent, participants completed a survey examining socio-demographic variables, along with the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between variables under examination. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of moderate to severe levels of depression and anxiety were 26.5% and 18.1%, respectively. Based on multivariable analyses, unsatisfactory sleep (AOR = 3.17; 95% CI = 1.81–5.53, p < .001), cigarette smoking (AOR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.01–3.97, p = .048), and anxiety (AOR = 10.47; 95% CI = 6.11–17.95, p < .001) were associated with depression. Anxiety was associated with being 15–16 years (AOR = 2.66; 95% CI = 1.18–6.00, p = .018), not having good perceived relationships with friends (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.24–3.56, p = .006) and depression (AOR = 10.22; 95% CI = 6.01–17.38, p < .001).

16843,"NMNI editorial report, 2020",2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has become an international public health problem, and antibiotic-based triple or quadruple therapy is currently the mainstay of treatment. However, the effectiveness of these therapies decreases due to resistance to multiple commonly used antibiotics. Sanguisorba officinalis L. (S. officinalis), a traditional Chinese medicine clinically used for hemostasis and treatment of diarrhea, has various pharmacological activities. In this study, in vitro antimicrobial activity was used for the preliminary evaluation of S. officinalis against H. pylori. And a pharmacology analysis approach was also utilized to elucidate its underlying mechanisms against H. pylori infection. METHODS: Micro-broth dilution method, agar dilution method, checkerboard assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for the assessment of anti-bacterial activity. Active ingredients screening, GO analysis, KEGG analysis, construction of PPI network, molecular docking, and RT-qPCR were used to elucidate the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of S. officinalis against H. pylori infection. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of S. officinalis against multiple H. pylori strains including clinically isolated multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains were ranging from 160 to 320 µg/ml. These results showed that S. officinalis had additive interaction with four commonly used antibiotics and could exert antibacterial effect by changing the morphology of bacteria without developing drug resistance. Through network pharmacology analysis, 8 active ingredients in S. officinalis were screened out for subsequent studies. Among 222 putative targets of S. officinalis, 49 targets were identified as potential targets for treatment of H. pylori infection. And these 49 targets were significantly enriched in GO processes such as protein kinase B signaling, protein kinase activity, protein kinase binding, and KEGG pathways such as Pathways in cancer, MicroRNAs in cancer, and TNF signaling pathway. Protein-protein interaction analysis yielded 5 core targets (AKT1, VEGFA, EGFR, SRC, CCND1), which were validated by molecular docking and RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study confirmed the in vitro inhibitory activity of S. officinalis against H. pylori and explored the possible pharmacological mechanisms, laying the foundation for further research and clinical application.

They produce a complex array of secretions containing bioactive constituents that support gamete function and promote reproductive success, with emerging evidence suggesting these secretions are influenced by our environment. Despite their significance, the biology of seminal vesicles remains poorly defined. Here, we complete the first proteomic assessment of mouse seminal vesicles and assess the impact of the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Mice were administered acrylamide (25 mg/kg bw/day) or control daily for five consecutive days prior to collecting seminal vesicle tissue. A total of 5013 proteins were identified in the seminal vesicle proteome with bioinformatic analyses identifying cell proliferation, protein synthesis, cellular death, and survival pathways as prominent biological processes. Secreted proteins were among the most abundant, and several proteins are linked with seminal vesicle phenotypes. Analysis of the effect of acrylamide on the seminal vesicle proteome revealed 311 differentially regulated (FC ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05, 205 up-regulated, 106 downregulated) proteins, orthogonally validated via immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Pathways that initiate protein synthesis to promote cellular survival were prominent among the dysregulated pathways, and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR, p = 6.69E-07) was a top-ranked upstream driver. Oxidative stress was implicated as contributing to protein changes, with acrylamide causing an increase in 8-OHdG in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (fivefold increase, p = 0.016) and the surrounding smooth muscle layer (twofold increase, p = 0.043). Additionally, acrylamide treatment caused a reduction in seminal vesicle secretion weight (36% reduction, p = 0.009) and total protein content (25% reduction, p = 0.017). Together these findings support the interpretation that toxicant exposure influences male accessory gland physiology and highlights the need to consider the response of all male reproductive tract tissues when interpreting the impact of environmental stressors on male reproductive function.","Skerrett-Byrne, David A.; Trigg, Natalie A.; Bromfield, Elizabeth G.; Dun, Matthew D.; Bernstein, Ilana R.; Anderson, Amanda L.; Stanger, Simone J.; MacDougall, Lily A.; Lord, Tessa; Aitken, R.

We identify a member of the acyltransferase superfamily 3 (atf3), enriched within the ST258 clade, that provides a major competitive advantage for the proliferation of these organisms in vivo. Comparison of a wild-type ST258 strain (KP35) and a Δatf3 isogenic mutant generated by CRISPR-Cas9 targeting reveals greater NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase transcription and ATP generation, fueled by increased glycolysis. The acquisition of atf3 induces changes in the bacterial acetylome, promoting lysine acetylation of multiple proteins involved in central metabolism, specifically Zwf (glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase). The atf3-mediated metabolic boost leads to greater consumption of glucose in the host airway and increased bacterial burden in the lung, independent of cytokine levels and immune cell recruitment.

Most studies focus on identifying factors associated with the attendance behaviors. In contrast, there have been few theoretical approaches to explain the individual decision-making process for or against working while ill. Moreover, their empirical verification is still pending. In the present study, we refer to expectancy theory to theoretically explain how the decision is made. To empirically test the model predictions we applied experimental vignette methodology in an online survey with working adults. The hypotheses were confirmed in that the calculated and predicted decisions significantly matched the intentionally chosen decisions. The results contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the decision-making process and provide starting points for interventions to manage attendance behavior in organizations.","Lohaus, Daniela; Habermann, Wolfgang",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8329342/,49

Evidence indicates that primary and tertiary prevention and improved treatment of somatic conditions in patients with SMI could reduce this excess mortality. This paper reports a protocol designed to evaluate the feasibility of a coordinated co-produced care program (SOFIA model, a Danish acronym for Severe Mental Illness and Physical Health in General Practice) in the general practice setting to reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with severe mental illness. METHODS: The SOFIA pilot trial is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial targeting general practices in two regions in Denmark. We aim to include 12 practices, each of which is instructed to recruit up to 15 community-dwelling patients aged 18 and older with SMI. Practices will be randomized by a computer in a ratio of 2:1 to deliver a coordinated care program or usual care during a 6-month study period. A randomized algorithm is used to perform randomization. The coordinated care program includes educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff, which covers clinical and diagnostic management and focus on patient-centered care of this patient group, after which general practitioners will provide a prolonged consultation focusing on individual needs and preferences of the patient with SMI and a follow-up plan if indicated. The outcomes will be parameters of the feasibility of the intervention and trial methods and will be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Assessments of the outcome parameters will be administered at baseline, throughout, and at end of the study period. DISCUSSION: If necessary the intervention will be revised based on results from this study. If delivery of the intervention, either in its current form or after revision, is considered feasible, a future, definitive trial to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing mortality and improving quality of life in patients with SMI can take place. Successful implementation of the intervention would imply preliminary promise for addressing health inequities in patients with SMI.

20776,Reply,2021-08-17,"One driving factor for developing preeclampsia—a pregnancy disorder, often associated with poor spiral artery (SpA)-remodeling and fetal growth restriction—is the anti-angiogenic sFLT1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1), which is found to be highly upregulated in preeclampsia patients. The sFLT1-mediated endothelial dysfunction is a common theory for the manifestation of maternal preeclampsia symptoms. However, the influence of sFLT1 on SpA-remodeling and the link between placental and maternal preeclampsia symptoms is less understood. To dissect the hsFLT1 (human sFLT1) effects on maternal and/or fetoplacental physiology in preeclampsia, sFLT1-transgenic mice with systemic hsFLT1 overexpression from midgestation onwards were used. SpA-remodeling was analyzed on histological and molecular level in placental/mesometrial triangle tissues. Maternal kidney and aorta morphology was investigated, combined with blood pressure measurements via telemetry. hsFLT1 overexpression resulted in maternal hypertension, aortic wall thickening, and elastin breakdown. Furthermore, maternal kidneys showed glomerular endotheliosis, podocyte damage, and proteinuria. preeclampsia symptoms were combined with fetal growth restriction already at the end of the second trimester and SpA-remodeling was strongly impaired as shown by persisted vascular smooth muscle cells. This phenotype was associated with shallow trophoblast invasion, delayed presence of uterine natural killer cells, and altered lymphatic angiogenesis. Overall, this study showed that circulating maternal hsFLT1 is sufficient to induce typical maternal preeclampsia-like symptoms in mice and impair the SpA-remodeling independent from the fetoplacental compartment, revealing new insights into the interaction between the placental and maternal contribution of preeclampsia.","Vogtmann, Rebekka; Heupel, Jacqueline; Herse, Florian; Matin, Mahsa; Hagmann, Henning; Bendix, Ivo; Kräker, Kristin; Dechend, Ralf; Winterhager, Elke; Kimmig, Rainer; Köninger, Angela; Gellhaus, Alexandra",Hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415521/,49

DTMUV is a public health concern because the infection spreads rapidly among birds. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)serves as an innate immune sensor and plays a key role in host antiviral defenses. Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is pivotal for RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. In addition, TRIM25 acts as an interferon-stimulated gene and mediates the antiviral activity. However, the effect of duck TRIM25 on DTMUV has not been assessed. Herein, we reportthe antiviral function of TRIM25 against DTMUV. First, we constructed the pcDNA3.1-c-myc-duTRIM25 plasmid. TRIM25 has a 2052 bp open reading frame that encodes a predicted 684 amino acid protein consisting of a RING finger domain, a B-box domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a PRY/SPRY domain. The protein sequence identity with chicken, mouse, and human TRIM25 is 69.7, 47.8, and 48.3%, respectively. TRIM25 was upregulated in BHK-21 cells, duck embryo fibroblasts, and 293T cellsupon DTMUV infection. The expression of viral RNA and proteins was significantly lower in cells over expressing TRIM25 than in control cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of TRIM25 increased the production of viral progeny. These results help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to DTMUV infection and suggest potential control measures for DTMUV outbreaks.","Kaikai, Han; Zhao, Dongmin; Liu, Yuzhuo; Liu, Qingtao; Huang, Xinmei; Yang, Jing; Zhang, Lijiao; Li, Yin",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8476877/,49

Especially in children, chronic cough (>4 weeks) is a significant burden on the child and family. While in the past, the lower airways were considered sterile, the concept of a physiologic microbiome of the lower respiratory tract has increasingly emerged. Of the differential diagnoses of chronic cough, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is more common in otherwise (pulmonary) healthy children under 6 years of age. Tracheomalacia may primarily exist or be the result of mechanically straining coughing, whereas apart from a reduced alveolar phagocytosis, there is usually no systemic or local immune weakness. Instead, an activated innate immunity with increased gene expression of the interleukin-1β signaling pathway can be immunologically detected. Here too, it is difficult to differentiate between cause and effect of chronic inflammatory events. Today, PBB and non-CF bronchiectasis, i.e., bronchiectasis not caused by cystic fibrosis (CF), are two sides of a disease spectrum of suppurative lung diseases, thus, making consequent therapy and long-term pediatric pneumological support of children with chronic productive cough necessary.","Rose, M.

The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) was investigated in piglets. IgY was found effective to increase piglets survival rate significantly after challenge exposures in prophylactic efficacy analysis. The therapeutic effects test revealed that the mortality was dramatically reduced by orally administered IgY. All these results in our study indicated that IgY specific to TGEV could be an alternative prophylactic method like colostral antibodies against TGEV in piglets.","Zuo, Yuzhu; Fan, Jinghui; Fan, Huixia; Li, Tanqing; Zhang, Xiaobo",Front Agric China,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088736/,49

22874,Spotlight on Wuhan,2015-05-13,"In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the application of plant biotechnology for the production of a variety of commercially valuable simple and complex biological molecules (biologics) for use in human and animal healthcare. Transgenic whole plants and plant cell culture systems have been developed that have the capacity to economically produce large-scale quantities of antibodies and antibody fragments, antigens and/or vaccine epitopes, metabolic enzymes, hormones, (neuro)peptides and a variety of biologically active complexes and secondary metabolites for direct use as therapeutic agents or diagnostic tools in the medical healthcare industry. As the products of genetically modified plants make their way from concept to commercialization the associated risks and acceptance by the public has been become a focal point. In this paper, we summarize the recent advances made in the use of transgenic plants and plant cell cultures as biological factories for the production of human therapeutics and biopharmaceuticals and discuss the long-term potential of `molecular farming' as a low-cost, efficient method for the production of biological materials with demonstrated utility to the pharmaceutical industry or medical community.","Teli, Nilesh P.; Timko, Michael P.",Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089434/,49

Flying foxes have been demonstrated to be the natural reservoir for Hendra and Nipah viruses. Evidence supporting the possibility of bats as potential reservoirs for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola virus has also been reported. The recent discovery of these viruses and other viruses occurring naturally in the bat population provides a unique insight into a diverse pool of potentially emergent and pathogenic viruses. The factors which influence the ability of zoonotic viruses to effectively cross the species barrier from bats to other animal populations are poorly understood. A brief review is provided here on the recently emerged bat viruses and on current and future strategies for research in this area.","Wang, Lin-Fa",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091070/,49

The nucleotide sequences encoding the entire S, sM, M and N genes open reading frame (ORF) of DX were 4 152, 231, 681 and 1 326 bases long respectively. There were transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) upstream of the initiator ATG of the S, N and M genes. The amino acids sequences of S, M and N contained 30, 3 and 7 potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites. Homologous analysis and phylogenetic trees showed that DX had the closest relationship with strains LJB/06, JS-2004-2Z and CH/HLJH/06 that were also isolated from China and indicated the prevalence of some PEDV isolates in China were widespread since the JS-2004-2Z strain originated from the south of the China, and LJB/06 and CH/HLJH/06 were isolated from northeast China. The N gene was cloned using two primers which contained Nco I and BamH I restriction enzyme sites and subcloned into expression vector pET30a. The recombinant plasmid was then transformed into E.coli Rossta. SDS-PAGE showed there was a protein of about 55kDa as expected and Western blot indicated the N protein had biological activity.","Li, Jian-qiang; Liu, Ji-xing; Lan, Xi; Cheng, Jie; Wu, Run; Lou, Zhong-Zi; Yin, Xiang-ping; Li, Xue-rui; Li, Bao-yu; Yang, Bin; Li, Zhi-yong",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091100/,49
22914,Living with the Neanderthals,2003,"BACKGROUND: In patients with hematological malignancies, febrile neutropenia (FEN) is the most frequent complication and the most important cause of mortality. Various risk factors have been identified for severe infection in neutropenic patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is not defined whether there is a change in the risk of febrile neutropenia according to seasons. The first aim of study was to determine the difference in frequency of febrile neutropenic episodes (FNEs) according to months and seasons. The second aim was to document isolated pathogens, as well as demographical and clinical characteristics of patients. METHODS: In the study, 194 FNEs of 105 patients who have been followed with hematological malignancies between June 2013 and May 2014 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Although the number of FNEs increased in autumn, there was no significant difference in frequency of FNEs between months (p = 0.564) and seasons (p = 0.345). There was no isolated pathogen in 54.6% of FNEs. In 45.4% of 194 FNEs, pathogens were isolated. Of all pathogens, 50.4% were gram negative bacteria, 29.2% were gram positive bacteria, 13.3% were viruses, 5.3% were fungi, and 1.8% were parasites. CONCLUSİONS: The frequency of FEN does not change according to months or seasons. Also, the relative proportions of different pathogens in the cause of FEN do not vary according to seasons.","Özdemir, Seray Karagöz; Iltar, Utku; Salim, Ozan; Yücel, Orhan Kemal; Erdem, Ramazan; Turhan, Özge; Undar, Levent",Memo,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091104/,49

Impressively, all the animals developed interstitial pneumonia with extensive hyaline membranes formation within alveoli, and presence of micro-vascular thrombosis in the pulmonary vessels. MHV-3 nucleocapsid gene transcripts were identified in multiple organs including lungs, spleen etc. As a representative proinflammatory gene, mfgl2 prothrombinase expression was evident in terminal and respiratory bronchioles, alveolar epithelia and infiltrated cells in the lungs associated with fibrin deposition and micro-vascular thrombosis. In summary, the established murine SARS model could mimic the pathologic characteristics of lungs in patients with SARS. Besides the physical damages due to virus replication in organs, the up-regulation of novel gene mfgl2 in lungs may play a vital role in the development of SARS associated lung damage.","Wei-ming, Yan; Jia-quan, Huang; Xiao-ping, Luo; Qin, Ning",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091223/,49

23199,Scientific Abstracts,2016-12-30,"Apelin is a bioactive peptide known as the ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Diverse active apelin peptides exist under the form of 13, 17 or 36 amino acids, originated from a common 77-amino-acid precursor. Both apelin and APJ mRNA are widely expressed in several rodent and human tissues and have functional effects in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Apelin has been shown to be involved in the regulation of cardiovascular functions, fluid homeostasis, vessel formation and cell proliferation. More recently, apelin has been described as an adipocyte-secreted factor (adipokine), up-regulated in obesity. By acting as circulating hormone or paracrine factor, adipokines are involved in physiological regulations (fat depot development, energy storage, metabolism or eating behavior) or in the promotion of obesity-associated disorders (type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dysfunctions). In this regard, expression of apelin gene in adipose tissue is increased by insulin and TNFα. This review will consider the main roles of apelin in physiopathology with particular attention on its role in energy balance regulation and in obesity-associated disorders.","Carpéné, C.; Dray, C.; Attané, C.; Valet, P.; Portillo, M.

23894,Green Biotechnology: A Brief Update on Plastid Genome Engineering,2019-06-20,"IPF is thought to be a consequence of repetitive micro-injury to ageing alveolar epithelium by factors including tobacco smoke, environmental exposures, microbial colonisation/infection, microaspiration, endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress, with resultant aberrant wound healing. Though partially effective antifibrotic therapies have focused attention away from older inflammation-based hypotheses for IPF pathogenesis, innate and adaptive immune cells and processes may play roles potentially in initiation and/or disease progression in IPF and/or in IPF acute exacerbations, based on multiple lines of evidence. Members of the Toll-like family of innate immune receptors have been implicated in IPF pathogenesis, including a potential modulatory role for the lung microbiome. A variety of chemokines are associated with the presence of IPF, and an imbalance of angiogenic chemokines has been linked to vascular remodelling in the disease. Subsets of circulating monocytes, including fibrocytes and segregated-nucleus-containing atypical monocytes (SatM), have been identified that may facilitate progression of fibrosis, and apoptosis-resistant pulmonary macrophages have been shown to demonstrate pro-fibrotic potential. Inflammatory cells that have been somewhat dismissed as irrelevant to IPF pathogenesis are being re-evaluated in light of new mechanistic data, such as activated neutrophils which release their chromatin in a process termed NETosis, which appears to mediate age-related murine lung fibrosis. A greater understanding is needed of the role of lymphoid aggregates, a histologic feature of IPF lungs found in close proximity to fibroblastic foci and highly suggestive of the presence of chronic immune responses in IPF, as are well-characterised activated circulating T lymphocytes and distinct autoantibodies that have been observed in IPF. There is a pressing need to discern whether or not the indisputably present immune dysregulation of IPF constitutes cause or effect in the ongoing search for more effective therapeutic strategies.","Butler, Marcus W.; Keane, Michael P.",Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120022/,49

24338,Die Zelle als gengesteuertes System,2016-08-09,"Any infectious diseases have been reported in sub-Saharan countries over the past decade due to the inefficiency of health structures to anticipate outbreaks. In a poorly-infrastructure country such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with inadequate health staff and laboratories, it is difficult to respond rapidly to an epidemic, especially in rural areas. As the DRC’s health system has three levels (peripheral, regional and national), from the production of health data at the peripheral level to the national level that makes the decision, meantime the disease can spread to many people. Lack of communication between health centres of the same health zone and Health zones of the same Health Provincial Division does not contribute to the regional response. This article, an extended version of [1], proposes a well elaborated solution track to deal with this problem by using an agent-centric approach to study by simulation how to improve the process. A new experiment is described by arranging twenty-eight health zones of Kinshasa to show how their collaboration can provide unique health data source for all stakeholders and help reducing disease propagation. It concerns also 47 health centres, 1 medical laboratory, 1 Provincial Health Division and 4 Rapid Riposte Teams. The simulation data, provided by Provincial Health Division of Kinshasa, concerned cholera outbreak from January to December 2017. The interaction between these agents demonstrated that Health Zone Agent can automatically alert his neighbours whenever he encountered a confirmed case of an outbreak. This action can reduce disease propagation as population will be provided with prevention measures. These interactions between agents have provided models to propose to the current system in order to find out the best that can help reducing decision time.","Tshilenge Mfumu, Jean-Claude; Mercier, Annabelle; Occello, Michel; Verdier, Christine",Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120616/,49
24348,Pneumonie unter allogener Stammzelltransplantation,2017-09-27,"Vaccines continue to offer the key line of protection against a range of infectious diseases; however, the range of vaccines currently available is limited. One key consideration in the development of a vaccine is risk-versus-benefit, and in an environment of perceived low risk, the benefit of vaccination may not be recognised. To address this, there has been a move towards the use of subunit-based vaccines, which offer low side-effect profiles but are generally weakly immunogenic. This can be compensated for by the development of effective adjuvants. Nanotechnology offers key attributes in this field through the ability of nanoparticulates to incorporate and protect antigens from rapid degradation, combined with their potential to effectively deliver the antigens to appropriate cells within the immune system. These characteristics can be exploited in the development of new adjuvants. This chapter will outline the applications of nanosystems in vaccine formulations and consider the mechanisms of action behind a range of formulations.","Perrie, Yvonne; Kaur, Randip; Henriksen-Lacey, Malou",Fundamentals of Pharmaceutical Nanoscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120629/,49

26693,Krisenmanagement,2019-05-24,"Because of their involvement in a variety of different biological processes and their occurrence onto pathogens and malignant cell surface, carbohydrates have been identified as ideal candidates for vaccine formulation. However, as free oligosaccharides are poorly immunogenic and do not induce immunological memory in the most at risk population (infants and young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients), glycoconjugate vaccines containing the same carbohydrate antigen covalently linked to an immunogenic carrier protein have gained a prominent role. Accordingly, a number of glycoconjugate vaccines mostly directed against infections caused by bacterial pathogens have been licensed and are currently available on the market. However, also glycoconjugate vaccines suffer from significant drawbacks. The challenging procedures required for the isolation and purification of the carbohydrate antigen from its natural source often lead to poor homogeneity and presence of biological contaminants, resulting in batch-to-batch variability. Moreover, in some cases, the overwhelming immunogenicity of the carrier protein may induce the carbohydrate epitope suppression, causing hyporesponsiveness. The development of synthetic oligosaccharide-based vaccine candidates, characterized by the presence of pure and well-defined synthetic oligosaccharide structures, is expected to meet the requirement of homogeneous and highly reproducible preparations. In the present chapter, we report on the major advances in the development of synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccines. First of all, we describe different strategies developed during the last years to circumvent the inherent difficulties of classical oligosaccharide synthesis, such as the one-pot glycosylation and the solid-phase synthesis, and their application to the preparation of carbohydrate antigens apt to conjugation with protein carriers. Next, we discuss the most representative methodologies employed for the chemical ligation of oligosaccharide structures to proteins. Finally, in the last section, we report significant examples of fully synthetic vaccines exploiting the multivalency effect. These constructs are based on the concept that the conjugation of multiple copies of synthetic oligosaccharide antigens to multivalent scaffolds, such as dendrimers, (cyclo)peptides, gold nanoparticles, and calixarenes, raises cooperative interactions between carbohydrates and immune receptors, leading to strong enhancement of the saccharide antigen immunogenicity.","Cancogni, Damiano; Fusari, Matteo; Poggi, Niccolò; Lay, Luigi",Polysaccharides,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123674/,49
26724,Gesundheitsberichterstattung,2014-12-01,"It was acknowledged long ago that viruses may cause cancer in animals. In 1911, Peyton Rous described viruses as causing sarcomas in poultry. The tumour-inducing virus responsible was later named after him, Rous sarcoma virus. In the following decades, a large number of viruses were discovered that can cause various cancers in poultry and rodents, such as lymphomas, sarcomas and carcinomas. Many of them belong to the family Retroviridae, and were classified into the genera Alpharetrovirus, Betaretrovirus and Gammaretrovirus. Most of these pathogens were isolated from inbred strains of the respective species or from cell cultures; under natural conditions, these strains are likely irrelevant as a cause of cancer in the corresponding species. An exception is feline leukaemia virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). The tumorigenic potential of oncogenic retroviruses is based on transformationally active proteins. They are similar to cellular products which are ordinarily involved in the regulation of cell division. In contrast to the cellular products, viral oncogene proteins are altered by mutations in such a way that they are not subject to regulatory control, and are thus constitutively active. In fact, the discovery of viral oncogenes was pioneering and has paved the way for deciphering cellular oncogenes, and thus for understanding the molecular basis of carcinogenesis. Evidence for the existence of retroviruses that cause cancer in humans was found only in 1982 when Robert Gallo discovered human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18).","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123711/,49

Meanwhile corporate interest in serious gaming in business has rapidly grown internationally. However the level of awareness and adoption of serious gaming among South African corporates in business is still unclear. This interpretive study explores South African corporate awareness of serious gaming in business and the barriers to its adoption. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from managers in Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies. Eight participants were interviewed across four different industries. Data analysis was guided by the general inductive approach. The absence of serious gaming adopters among the participants, and the general lack of awareness of serious gaming in business were identified as the most salient features. The analysis suggests that corporates currently use technologies related to serious games (e-learning, collaborative tools, and simulation tools), and that there is a demand for the greater promotion and use of serious gaming. While the findings provide new insights into the level of serious gaming awareness, caution should be exercised when attempting to generalize these findings due to the small sample and the scarcity of prior research.","Amod, Shiraz; Roodt, Sumarie","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134228/,49

30680,Danish Chydorid Cladocera: Modern Ecology and Core Studies,1970-01-01,"In this chapter, we shall put the Onto-Agents Methodology into practice and use it step by step to develop a Generic Human Disease Ontology (GHDO) and to design a multi-agent system that can use the designed GHDO for intelligent information retrieval. In Section 2, we discuss the domain of human diseases, the purpose of the ontology, the community of users and agents for which this ontology is being developed, and applications based on the designed ontology. The aligning and merging of existing medical ontologies against the defined ontology structure is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 describes how to design the ontology base, while Section 5 explains the design of the ontology commitment layer. In Section 6, we discuss the evaluation of the GHDO. In Section 7, we identify and describe different groups of agents according to their functions and responsibilities within the system. In Section 8, we describe a mechanism by which GHDO ontology is used in this system during the processes of problem solving, task and result sharing, and assembling of results. In Section 9, we focus on the structural organization of the agents within the system and define agents’ collaborations. Individual agent structure and agents’ components are described in Section 10. In Section 11, we discuss security issues within the multi-agent system. Examples of the use of the designed systems are given in Section 12.","Hadzic, Maja; Wongthongtham, Pornpit; Dillon, Tharam; Chang, Elizabeth",Ontology-Based Multi-Agent Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161374/,49
30941,VEGETATION AND SOIL FACTORS ON A HEAVY METAL MINE SPOIL HEAP,2006-05-02,"The Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus is declining throughout its range because of loss of habitat, a declining prey base and competition with livestock interests. Throughout Africa there are less than 15 000 animals remaining. The largest wild population of Cheetahs is in Namibia, although in the last 12 years numbers have been reduced by half to c. 2500 animals. Significant declines have continued as farmers capture and remove Cheetahs as ‘pests’. Established in 1990, the Cheetah Conservation Fund aims to secure habitats for the long‐term survival of the species and its ecosystems. The primary focus of the Fund is working outside of the protected reserves with the local livestock farming communities to develop ways to reduce conflict between humans and Cheetahs. The Fund also conducts independent and collaborative research, disseminates information and recommends management techniques to farmers.","MARKER‐KRAUS, LAURIE; KRAUS, DANIEL",Int Zoo Yearb,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165671/,49
30952,Emerging UK infections: identifying new threats early,2019-03-25,"SUMMARY: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus grown in suckling mouse brain was shown to multiply in the brains of one day‐old laboratory rats and hamsters using the direct immunofluorescence test on smear preparations. In suckling rats retardation in growth was consistently observed from the third day post infection, which could be inhibited by a feline anti‐FIP virus immune serum. Specificity was assessed by repeated passages in the rat and hamster, by indirect immunofluorescence and by successful passage back into suckling mice. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Virus der felinen infektiósen Peritonitis (FIP) IV.

Vom dritten Tage post infectionem an wurde bei den Sáuglingsratten eine Verzógerung im Wachstum beobachtet, die sich mit Hilfe eines anti FIP‐Virus Immunserums der Katze hemmen ließ. Zum Spezifiztátsnachweis wurden die Ratten‐ und Hamsterpassagen wiederholt, indirekte Immunofluoreszenztests durchgefúhrt und eine Rúckpassage in Sáuglingsmáusen mit Erfolg durchgefúhrt. RÉSUMÉ: Le virus de la péritonite infectieuse du chat (FIP) IV. Multiplication dans le cerveau du rat et du hamster nouveau‐né La multiplication du virus de la péritonite infectieuse féline (FIP) adapté au cerveau de la souris nouveau‐née est montrée dans les cerveaux de rats et de hamsters d'un jour, utilisant le test d'immunofluorescence sur des préparations empreintes. Retardation de croissance est observée chez des rats à partir du troisième jour après l'infection; cette retardation pouvait être empêchée par un sérum félin dirigé contre le virus FIP. La spécificité êtait montrée dans des passages répétés chez des rats et des hamsters par l'immunofluorescence indirecte et par nouvels passages de ce virus dans des souris nouveau‐nés. RESUMEN: Virus de la peritonitis infecciosa felina (FIP) IV. Multiplicación viral en el cerebro de ratas y de hámsters recién‐nacidos Mediante la técnica de inmunofluorescencia se comprobó la multiplicación del virus FIP (previamente adaptado en cerebro de ratones recién‐nacidos), en preparados cerebrales de presión en portaobjetos, en el cerebro de ratas de laboratorio y el cerebro de hámsters de un día de edad. Tras el transcurso de 3 días p. i. fué notable un retraso de crecimiento en las ratas infectadas. Este proceso de retardo de crecimiento podía ser contrarrestado mediante el uso de un suero felino, inmuno anti‐FIP. Repetición de pasajes intracerebrales en ratas y hámsters con el virus FIP y su detección mediante la inmunofluorescencia indirecta, como también un retropasaje eficaz del virus FIP en ratones mamones, sirvieron para la verificación de la especificidad.","Osterhaus, Albert D.

Hence, we sought to determine the existence of any chronic endocrine sequelae in SARS survivors. Design, patients, measurements Sixty‐one survivors of SARS prospectively recruited were analysed for hormonal derangements 3 months following recovery. Patients with pre‐existing endocrine disorders were excluded. Any endocrine abnormalities diagnosed were investigated and treated where indicated up to a year. Serial evaluation facilitated characterization of trends and prognostication of any endocrinological aberrations. Results Twenty‐four (39·3%) patients had evidence of hypocortisolism. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction of the majority resolved within a year. Two (3·3%) of the hypocortisolic cohort had transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Four (6·7%) were biochemically hypothyroid, being comprised of three with central hypothyroidism and one with primary hypothyroidism. Two of the three with central hypothyroidism had concomitant central hypocortisolism. Eight had subnormal DHEAS levels. Conclusions These preliminary findings highlight a possible aetiologic role of SARS‐associated coronavirus in causing a reversible hypophysitis or direct hypothalamic effect, with the HPA axis affected more frequently than the HPT axis.","Leow, Melvin Khee‐Shing; Kwek, Daniel Seow‐Khee; Ng, Alan Wei‐Keong; Ong, Kian‐Chung; Kaw, Gregory Jon‐Leng; Lee, Lawrence Soon‐U",Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188349/,49
32432,Building the Pyramids,2020-05-12,"Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and challenging problem for analyzing medical images due to the approximate pixel values of adjacent tissues in boundary and the non-linear feature between pixels. Although fully convolutional neural networks such as U-Net has demonstrated impressive performance on medical image segmentation, distinguishing subtle features between different categories after pooling layers is still a difficult task, which affects the segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Mini-Inception-Residual-Dense (MIRD) network named MIRD-Net to deal with this problem. The key point of our proposed MIRD-Net is MIRD Block. It takes advantage of Inception, Residual Block (RB) and Dense Block (DB), aiming to make the network obtain more features to help improve the segmentation accuracy. There is no pooling layer in MIRD-Net. Such a design avoids loss of information during forward propagation. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms U-Net in six different image segmentation tasks and its parameters are only about 1/50 of U-Net.","Huang, Yongfeng; Li, Xueyang; Yan, Cairong; Liu, Lihao; Dai, Hao",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206284/,49

Since there are problems with liver transplantation including lack of donors, use of immunosuppressive drugs, and high costs of this process, new therapeutic approaches alongside current treatments are needed. The placenta is a tissue that is normally discarded after childbirth. On the other hand, human placenta is a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which is easily available, without moral problems, and its derived cells are less affected by age and environmental factors. Therefore, placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PD-MSCs) can be considered as an allogeneic source for liver disease. Considering the studies on MSCs and their effects on various diseases, it can be stated that MSCs are among the most important agents to be used for novel future therapies of liver diseases. In this paper, we will investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cells through migration and immigration to the site of injury, cell-to-cell contact, immunomodulatory effects, and secretory factors in ALF.","Saleh, Mahshid; Taher, Mohammad; Sohrabpour, Amir Ali; Vaezi, Amir Abbas; Nasiri Toosi, Mohsen; Kavianpour, Maria; Ghazvinian, Zeinab; Abdolahi, Shahrokh; Verdi, Javad",Cell Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245988/,49

More precisely, we consider the optimisation of a mix of material pieces of different types in different containers. Information about those pieces is modelled by a mass function provided by a cautious classifier.

The first oncolytic virus, Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), based on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2015. The field of oncolytic virotherapy is still in its beginnings, since many promising viruses remain only superficially explored. Influenza A virus causes a highly immunogenic acute infection but never leads to a chronic disease. While oncolytic influenza A viruses are in preclinical development, they have not made the transition into clinical practice yet. Recent insights into different types of cell death caused by influenza A virus infection illuminate novel possibilities of enhancing its therapeutic effect. Genetic engineering and experience in influenza A virus vaccine development allow safe application of the virus in patients. In this review we give a summary of efforts undertaken to develop oncolytic influenza A viruses. We discuss strategies for targeting viral replication to cancerous lesions and arming them with immunogenic transgenes. We furthermore describe which modes of cell death are induced by influenza A virus infection and how these insights may be utilized to optimize influenza A virus-based oncolytic virus design.","Kabiljo, Julijan; Laengle, Johannes; Bergmann, Michael",Cell Death Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7288254/,49

Such materials offer a lot of advantages, but they also require application of advanced numerical models of exploitation condition, which are of high importance for designers, architects and engineers. However, computational cost is one of the most important problems in this approach, being very high and sometimes unacceptable. In this paper we propose approach based on Statistically Similar Representative Volume Element (SSRVE), which is generated by combination of isogeometric analysis and optimization methods. The proposed solution significantly decreases computational cost of complex multiscale simulations and simultaneously maintains high reliability of solvers. At first, the motivation of the work is described in introduction, which is followed by general idea of the SSRVE as a modelling technique. Afterwards, examples of generated SSRVEs based on two different cases are given and passed further to numerical simulations of exploitation conditions. The results obtained from these calculations are used in the model predicting gradients of material properties, which are crucial results for discussion on uniqueness of the proposed solution.

Data assimilation is the discipline that studies the combination of mathematical models and observations. It can improve the accuracy of mathematical models by incorporating data, but also brings challenges by increasing complexity and computational cost. In this paper, we study the application of data assimilation methods to the coupled dual porosity Stokes model. We give a brief introduction to the coupled model and examine the performance of different data assimilation methods on a finite element implementation of the coupled dual porosity Stokes system.

The thermodynamically consistent model consists of two Cahn–Hilliard–type equations and incompressible Navier–Stokes equation. We use two scalar auxiliary variables to transform nonlinear parts in the free energy functional into quadratic forms, and then they can be treated efficiently and semi-implicitly. A splitting method based on pressure stabilization is used to solve the Navier–Stokes equation. By some subtle explicit-implicit treatments to nonlinear convection and stress terms, we construct a first-order energy stable scheme for the two-phase system with soluble surfactants. The developed scheme is efficient and easy-to-implement. At each time step, computations of phase-field variables, the velocity and pressure are decoupled. We rigorously prove that the proposed scheme is unconditionally energy stable.

But it is widely known that the performance of algorithms for data mining and analysis heavily relies on the quality of input data. The main aim of this paper is helping LBSN researchers to perform a preliminary step of data preprocessing and thus increase the efficiency of their algorithms. To do that we propose a spatiotemporal data processing pipeline that is general enough to fit most of the problems related to working with LBSNs. The proposed pipeline includes four main stages: an identification of suspicious profiles, a background extraction, a spatial context extraction, and a fake transitions detection. Efficiency of the pipeline is demonstrated on three practical applications using different LBSN: touristic itinerary generation using Facebook locations, sentiment analysis of an area with the help of Twitter and VK.com, and multiscale events detection from Instagram posts.","Mukhina, Ksenia; Visheratin, Alexander; Nasonov, Denis",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304753/,49

35222,On the Complexity of Conversion Between Classic Real Number Representations,2020-06-24,"We propose stable and locally conservative hybrid mixed finite element methods to approximate the Darcy system and convection-diffusion problem, presented in a mixed form, to solve miscible displacements considering convective flows with adverse mobility ratio. The stability of the proposed formulations is achieved due to the choice of non-conforming Raviart-Thomas spaces combined to upwind scheme for the convection-dominated regimes, where the continuity conditions, between the elements, are weakly enforced by the introduction of Lagrange multipliers. Thus, the primal variables of both systems can be condensed in the element level leading a positive-definite global problem involving only the degrees of freedom associated with the multipliers. This approach, compared to the classical conforming Raviart-Thomas, present a reduction of the computational cost because, in both problems, the Lagrange multiplier is associated with a scalar field. In this context, a staggered algorithm is employed to decouple the Darcy problem from the convection-diffusion mixed system. However, both formulations are solved at the same time step, and the time discretization adopted for the convection-diffusion problem is the implicit backward Euler method. Numerical results show optimal convergence rates for all variables and the capacity to capture the formation and the propagation of the viscous fingering, as can be seen in the comparisons of the simulations of the Hele-Shaw cell with experimental results of the literature.","Igreja, Iury; de Miranda, Gabriel",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304755/,49
35225,Functions of Baire Class One over a Bishop Topology,2020-06-24,"Helicopters and tiltrotor aircrafts are known to fall into an unstable state called vortex ring state when they descend rapidly. This paper presents a six degrees of freedom descending flight simulation of a tiltrotor aircraft represented by the V-22 Osprey, considering the interaction between fluid and a rigid body. That is, an aircraft affects the surrounding flow field by rotating the rotors, and flies with the generated force as thrust. Similarly, an orientation of the airframe is controlled by aerodynamic force which is generated by manipulating the shape. This numerical analysis is a complicated moving boundary problem involving motion of an air-frame or rotation of rotors. As a numerical approach, the Moving Computational Domain (MCD) method in combination with the multi-axis sliding mesh approach is adopted. In the MCD method, the whole computational domain moves with objects in the domain. At this time, fluid flow around the objects is generated by the movement of the boundaries. In addition, this method removes computational space restrictions, allowing an aircraft to move freely within the computational space regardless of a size of a computational grid. The multi-axis sliding mesh approach allows rotating bodies to be placed in a computational grid. Using the above approach, the flight simulation at two different descent rates is performed to reveal a behavior of a tiltrotor aircraft and a state of the surrounding flow field.","Takii, Ayato; Yamakawa, Masashi; Asao, Shinichi",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304758/,49

GC simulations in HPC environments give rise to a number of technical challenges related to coupling. Being intended to reflect current and upcoming situation for policy-making, GC simulations extensively use recent streaming data coming from external data sources, which requires changing traditional HPC systems operation. Another common challenge stems from the necessity to couple simulations and exchange data across data centers in GC scenarios.

Two separate scales are considered in this study, a Macro-scale, which models whole blood as a continuous fluid and tracks the transport of hematocrit profiles through an advection diffusion solver. And a Micro-scale, which computes directly local diffusion coefficients and viscosities using cell resolved simulations. The coupling between these two scales also includes the use of a surrogate model, which saved local viscosity and diffusion coefficients from previously simulated local hematocrit and shear rate combinations. As the HMM model progresses fewer micro models will be spawned. This is accomplished through the surrogate by interpolating from previously computed viscosities and diffusion coefficients. The benefit of using the HMM method for blood flow is that it, along with resolving the rheology of whole blood, can be extended with other types computational models to model physiological processes like thrombus formation.","Czaja, Benjamin; Závodszky, Gábor; Hoekstra, Alfons",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304768/,49
35240,Reply,2020-06-23,"Greening of Data Centers could be achieved through energy savings in two significant areas, namely: compute systems and cooling systems. A reliable cooling system is necessary to produce a persistent flow of cold air to cool the servers due to increasing computational load demand. Servers’ dissipated heat effects a strain on the cooling systems. Consequently, it is necessary to identify hotspots that frequently occur in the server zones. This is facilitated through the application of data mining techniques to an available big dataset for thermal characteristics of High-Performance Computing ENEA Data Center, namely Cresco 6. This work presents an algorithm that clusters hotspots with the goal of reducing a data centre’s large thermal-gradient due to uneven distribution of server dissipated waste heat followed by increasing cooling effectiveness.","De Chiara, Davide; Chinnici, Marta; Kor, Ah-Lian",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304773/,49

In early March 2020, we were presented with the challenge of achieving safe delivery of care in clinical practice for a group of patients that are already at higher risk of morbidity from COVID-19 with only limited guidance. PURPOSE: This article outlines the adjustments made at The Christie at Oldham satellite centre in order to promote optimal care to our patients receiving radiotherapy, and to mitigate infection risk at the department for both patients and staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We share insight into some of the evolving processes that our team have developed since March 2020 in promoting optimal care to patients receiving radiotherapy at The Christie at Oldham satellite centre. These include changes to the department floor, paper flow, supportive care and staffing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As we continue to progress through this pandemic, we accept that there will be an ongoing journey of learning with adjustments to practice and evolving ‘new norm’, thereby ensuring we keep our patients and team safe and well. We also hoped that our experience would support radiotherapy-related practices in surges of the pandemic in other parts of the world or in case of the second wave.","Mason, Tracy; Bennett, Rachael; White, Alison; Rembielak, Agata",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338435/,49

In this mini review, we focus on the ambiguous role of growth factors in regeneration, discuss their evolutionary importance, and highlight them as the “cure and the cause” for successful or failed attempts to drive human body regeneration. We draw the reader's attention to evolutionary changes that occurred in growth factors and their receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and how they established and shaped response to injury in metazoans. Discussing the well-known pleiotropy of growth factors, we propose an evolutionary rationale for their functioning in this specific way and focus on growth factors and RTKs as an amazing system that defines the multicellular nature of animals and highlight their participation in regeneration. We pinpoint potential bottlenecks in their application for human tissue regeneration and show their role in fibrosis/regeneration balance. This communication invites the reader to re-evaluate the functions of growth factors as keepers of natively existing communications between elements of tissue, which makes them a fundamental component of a successful regenerative strategy. Finally, we draw attention to the epigenetic landscape that may facilitate or block regeneration and give a brief insight into how it may define the outcome of injury.","Kulebyakin, Konstantin Yu.; Nimiritsky, Peter P.; Makarevich, Pavel I.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358447/,49
37494,Correction to: High Performance Computing,2020-06-15,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) was of importance in the pathogenesis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). To determine whether knockdown of TGF-β1 gene expression could facilitate the control of PRRSV infection, specific sequences for expressing shRNA targeted to porcine TGF-β1 gene were synthesized and cloned into pSilencer 3.1-H1 neovector. Then they were used to transfect peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Tibetan pig (Tp-PBMCs) followed by PRRSV inoculation. The positive recombinant plasmids were screened for inhibition of TGF-β1 gene expression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Conversely, the mRNA level of PRRSV in shRNA treated Tp-PBMCs dramatically decreased, and there were significant increases of the transcription of immune genes, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), Myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88), and interleukin-27p28 (IL-27p28). However, the expressions of IL-8 and IL-10 genes significantly reduced in comparison to the control infected cells. In addition, transfection with the shRNA plasmids significantly elevated the viability of immune cells. Therefore the knockdown of TGF-β1 gene expression by shRNA not only inhibits the replication of PRRSV but also improves immune responsiveness following viral infection, suggesting a novel way to facilitate the control of PRRSV infection in pigs.","Wang, Ye; Chen, Yihui; Liang, Ge; Zeng, Kai; Chen, Xiao-hui; Ying, San-cheng; Wang, Zezhou; Lv, Xue-Bin; Gao, Rong",Vet Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386707/,49
37542,World Economic Prospects Monthly,2020-07-15,"Resilience has in recent decades been introduced as a term describing a new perspective within the domains of disaster management and safety management. Several theoretical interpretations and definitions of the essence of resilience have been proposed, but less work has described how to operationalise resilience and implement the concept within organisations. This case study describes the implementation of a set of general resilience management guidelines for critical infrastructure within a Swedish Regional Medical Command and Control Team. The case study demonstrates how domain-independent guidelines can be contextualised and introduced at an operational level, through a comprehensive capability development programme. It also demonstrates how a set of conceptual and reflective tools consisting of educational, training and exercise sessions of increasing complexity and realism can be used to move from high-level guidelines to practice. The experience from the case study demonstrates the value of combining (1) developmental learning of practitioners’ cognitive skills through resilience-oriented reflection and interaction with dynamic complex open-ended problems; (2) contextualisation of generic guidelines as a basis for operational methodological support in the operational environment; and (3) the use of simulation-based training as part of a capability development programme with increasing complexity and realism across mixed educational, training and exercise sessions. As an actual example of a resilience implementation effort in a disaster medicine management organisation, the study contributes to the body of knowledge regarding how to implement the concept of resilience in operational practice.","Hermelin, Jonas; Bengtsson, Kristofer; Woltjer, Rogier; Trnka, Jiri; Thorstensson, Mirko; Pettersson, Jenny; Prytz, Erik; Jonson, Carl-Oscar",Cogn Technol Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7391043/,49

The evaluation of RF radiation health risks from 5G technology is ignored in a report by a government expert group in Switzerland and a recent publication from The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. Conflicts of interest and ties to the industry seem to have contributed to the biased reports. The lack of proper unbiased risk evaluation of the 5G technology places populations at risk.

Scrub typhus is transmitted through bites of contaminated chiggers (larval stage). Diagnosis of scrub typhus is challenging as its symptoms mimic with other acute febrile illnesses. Several methods are effectual for diagnosis of scrub typhus that includes enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), immunochromatographic test (ICT), Weil–Felix, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Weil–Felix test was initially used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in underdeveloped countries but not preferred due to a lack of both specificity and sensitivity. Other immuno-based methods like IFA and ELISA are most outrank for detection of scrub typhus due to their higher sensitivity and specificity, but not vigorous to lay bare the infection at early stages and need the convalescent sampling for verification of positive samples. On another deed, PCR based methods becoming acceptable over era due to its dexterity of early-stage diagnosis with higher specificity and sensitivity but lack its applicability in circumstances of scrub typhus due to the variegated genetic makeup of Orientia tsutsugamushi among its serotypes.

This study aimed to determine the impact of critical illness on the most important muscles of the respiratory muscle pump, especially on the expiratory muscles in children during mechanical ventilation. In addition, the correlation between changes in thickness of the expiratory muscles and the diaphragm was assessed. METHODS: This longitudinal observational cohort study performed at a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit included 34 mechanical ventilated children (> 1 month– < 18 years). Thickness of the diaphragm and expiratory muscles (obliquus interna, obliquus externa, transversus abdominis and rectus abdominis) was assessed daily using ultrasound. Contractile activity was estimated from muscle thickening fraction during the respiratory cycle. RESULTS: Over the first 4 days, both diaphragm and expiratory muscles thickness decreased (> 10%) in 44% of the children. Diaphragm and expiratory muscle thickness increased (> 10%) in 26% and 20% of the children, respectively. No correlation was found between contractile activity of the muscles and the development of atrophy. Furthermore, no correlation was found between changes in thickness of the diaphragm and the expiratory muscles (P = 0.537). Decrease in expiratory muscle thickness was significantly higher in patients failing extubation compared to successful extubation (− 34% vs − 4%, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in diaphragm and expiratory muscles thickness develop rapidly after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Changes in thickness of the diaphragm and expiratory muscles were not significantly correlated. These data provide a unique insight in the effects of critical illness on the respiratory muscle pump in children.","IJland, Marloes M.; Lemson, Joris; van der Hoeven, Johannes G.; Heunks, Leo M.

In response to the rapid global dissemination of the virus, on the 11th of Mars, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic. Considering this situation, this paper intends to analyze and improve the current SEIR models to better represent the behavior of the COVID-19 and accurately predict the outcome of the pandemic in each social, economic, and political scenario. METHODOLOGY: We present a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model and test it using a global optimization algorithm with data collected from the WHO. RESULTS: The main results were: (a) Our model was able to accurately fit the either deaths or active cases data of all tested countries using optimized coefficient values in agreement with recent reports; (b) when trying to fit both sets of data at the same time, fit was good for most countries, but not all. (c) Using our model, large ranges for each input, and optimization we predict death values for 15, 30, 45, and 60 days ahead with errors in the order of 5, 10, 20, and 80%, respectively; (d) sudden changes in the number of active cases cannot be predicted by the model unless data from outside sources are used. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the presented model may be used to predict 15 days ahead values of total deaths with errors in the order of 5%. These errors may be minimized if social distance data are inputted into the model.","Pinto Neto, Osmar; Reis, José Clark; Brizzi, Ana Carolina Brisola; Zambrano, Gustavo José; de Souza, Joabe Marcos; Pedroso, Wellington; de Mello Pedreiro, Rodrigo Cunha; de Matos Brizzi, Bruno; Abinader, Ellysson Oliveira; Zângaro, Renato Amaro",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456444/,49

In this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of Rosa laevigata (RL), which has been previously investigated medicinally in Korea and China for the discovery of plant-derived anti-inflammatory agents with low side effects, using a PM10-induced lung inflammatory disease model. Using MTT assay, we confirmed that in A549 cells pretreated with RL, cytotoxicity induced by PM10 (100 μg/mL) exposure was attenuated. In addition, western blotting revealed that RL suppressed the expression level of MAPK/NF-κB pathways and its downstream signal, COX-2 in PM10-induced A549 cells. Moreover, real-time PCR demonstrated that RL downregulated the mRNA expression level of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-17) in PM10-induced A549 cells. Based on the results of this study, RL has been shown to relieve inflammation in the lungs due to PM10 exposure.

The Self-care Ability Scale for Elderly (SASE) is one of the common instruments used for assessing self-care ability. The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SASE among Iranian elderly population. METHODS: This cross-cultural adaptation study was carried out at Shahid Chamran and Shadpour Health Complex in Tabriz, Iran. The forward-backward procedure was applied to translate the SASE from English into Persian. Then, it was completed to 220 elderly people. A systematic random sampling method was used for sampling. Content validity was calculated through modified Kappa coefficient (modified CVI) based on clarity and relevance criteria. Reliability was measured by internal consistency and test-retest analysis. The construct validity also was assessed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21 statistical software package. RESULTS: The mean of self-care ability was 61.14 ± 21.08. The CVI and modified kappa were 0.91 and 0.92 for relevance and clarity, respectively. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.73 and Intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.97. The results of EFA revealed a three-factor solution (‘ability to take care of personal responsibility’, ‘ability to take care for the goals’, and ‘ability to take care of the health’) that jointly explained for 64.61% of the total variance.

The ongoing epidemic has exposed the health care system to a severe stress. San Raffaele Hospital (OSR) in Milan, Italy - a leader in the emergency management, may provide a benchmarking experience useful for other countries. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: OSR has established a task force including the health care director, the Infections Prevention and Control Committee (IPCC) and the head of ward and outpatients' facilities management area in order to assess the situation and to define a multi-step strategy. The management process has been divided in two steps. Firstly, a preventive phase was devised, in a preparedness perspective, to avoid the spread of the infection to the Healthcare Professionals (HCP). Secondly, a reorganizational phase was implemented to guarantee assistance to infected patients, especially the critical ones. RESULTS: Before the outbreak, the IPCC updated OSR's procedures, based on the WHO's, national and regional guidance, planned a lectures series and an online survey to train healthcare professionals and proposed to stack Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to face the expected shortage. The Head of the facilities management area defined separate pathways in the Emergency Department in order to isolate patients with respiratory symptoms, set up a new ward, with 26 beds and dedicated personnel, as well as two Intensive Care Units, with 13 beds, Some wards were merged and more healthcare workers were moved to the COVID-19 units. LESSONS: The coordination between task force members has been crucial for translating the multi-step strategy in a quick reorganization of the whole hospital. Despite early preparations, we could not anticipate the evolution of the outbreak and its logistic impact, especially on the PPE procurement. KEY MESSAGES: A major Hospital was proved to be capable to respond to the changing healthcare requests. Organizational flexibility is crucial for proper emergency management.","Bellini, L; Bossi, E; Bucci, D; Capraro, M; Chiappa, F; Ambrosio, A",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543431/,49

Our study examines racial and ethnic disparities in confirmed COVID-19 cases across six diverse cities—Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New York City, San Diego, and St. Louis—at the ZIP code level (covering 436 “neighborhoods” with a population of 17.7 million). Our analysis links these outcomes to six separate data sources to control for demographics; housing; socioeconomic status; occupation; transportation modes; health care access; long-run opportunity, as measured by income mobility and incarceration rates; human mobility; and underlying population health. We find that the proportions of Black and Hispanic residents in a ZIP code are both positively and statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 cases per capita. The magnitudes are sizeable for both Black and Hispanic, but even larger for Hispanic. Although some of these disparities can be explained by differences in long-run opportunity, human mobility, and demographics, most of the disparities remain unexplained even after including an extensive list of covariates related to possible mechanisms. For two cities—Chicago and New York—we also examine COVID-19 fatalities, finding that differences in confirmed COVID-19 cases explain the majority of the observed disparities in fatalities. In other words, the higher death toll of COVID-19 in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities mostly reflects higher case rates, rather than higher fatality rates for confirmed cases.","Benitez, Joseph; Courtemanche, Charles; Yelowitz, Aaron",J Econ Race Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7584480/,49

In this work, we developed a colorimetric microfluidic paper-based analytical device (µPAD) for simultaneous determination of protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) and metal ions [Fe(III) and Ni(II)]. The µPAD consisted of one central zone, ten reaction zones and ten detection zones in one device, in which reaction solutions were effectively optimized for different types of chromogenic reactions. Fe(III), Ni(II) and BSA can be easily identified by the colored products, and their concentrations are in good accordance with color depth based on the established standard curves. The detection limits are 0.1 mM for Fe(III), 0.5 mM for Ni(II) and 1µM for BSA, respectively. Best of all, we demonstrated the efficiency of the µPAD with accurate detection of Fe(III), Ni (II) and BSA from river water samples within 15 minutes. The µPAD detection is efficient, instrument-free, and easy-to-use, holding great potential for simultaneous detection of cross type analytes in numerous diagnostic fields.","Xiong, Xiaolu; Zhang, Junlin; Wang, Zhou; Liu, Chenchen; Xiao, Wende; Han, Junfeng; Shi, Qingfan",Biochip J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594977/,49

The frayed edges of this edifice are made visible, however, by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (and other historical circumstances of severe resource limitation in the healthcare system). We interrogate ethical considerations involved in the state of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, as demonstrated by reconsiderations of cancer care, in which the pillar of justice is exposed as internally divided. Specifically, we identify both patient-oriented and system-oriented principles of justice constituting a broader collective, unique among the classical four principles. This leads us to suggest a formal recognition of justice as a divided category, and a reclassification of the term into two subcategories which serve fundamentally different interests. The result is a more cohesive four principle approach in which all principles favour the deontological relationships fostered between patients and providers, which exists in constant balance with the utilitarian interests of the broader medical system.","Brenna, Connor; Das, Sunit",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650487/,49

Technologies have become interwoven into the daily lives for many older adults. The Technology Use in Later Life (TILL) study investigated how the perceptions and use of technology both can foster new and leverage existing intergenerational relationships. Through a mixed methods study engaging older adults aged 70 years of age and greater across rural and urban sites in Canada and the UK (N=37), participants described how the interconnection between technology and intergenerational relationships was an integral component to social connectedness with others. Through a qualitative descriptive approach, it was noted that older adults leveraged intergenerational relationships with family and friends to adjust to new technologies and to remain connected to adult children and grandchildren especially when there is high geographic separation between them. Especially during times of COVID-19, younger family members can play an important role to introduce and teach older adults how to use, technologies such as digital devices, computers, and social networking sites. Participants emphasized the benefits of intergenerational connections to adopt and use technology in later life noting flexibility and willingness to overcome barriers to technology adoption and remain connected across the generations. The adoption and uptake of technologies may continue as viable options during times of social distancing to support older persons to remain independent, age in place, in both age-friendly cities and across rural geographies during and post COVID-19.","Freeman, Shannon; Marston, Hannah R; Musselwhite, Charles; Olynick, Janna; Genoe, Rebecca; Kulczycki, Cory; Xiong, Beibei",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740935/,49

At first, the performance of PFA is evaluated by solving the optimal allocation of distribution generation problem in IEEE 33- and 69-bus systems for loss minimization. The obtained results show that the performance of proposed PFA is superior to PSO, TLBO, CSA, and GOA and other approaches cited in literature. The comparison of different performance measures of 50 independent trail runs predominantly shows the effectiveness of PFA and its efficiency for global optima. Subsequently, PFA is implemented for determining the optimal I-PV configuration considering the resilience without compromising the various operational and radiality constraints. Different case studies are simulated and the impact of the I-PV system is analyzed in terms of voltage profile and voltage stability. The proposed optimal I-PV configuration resulted in loss reduction of 77.87% and 98.33% in IEEE 33- and 69-bus systems, respectively. Further, the reduced average voltage deviation index and increased voltage stability index result in an improved voltage profile and enhanced voltage stability margin in radial distribution systems and its suitability for practical applications.","Janamala, Varaprasad",SN Appl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801878/,49
44953,Effect of Powder Particle Size and Spray Parameters on the Ni/Al Reaction During Plasma Spraying of Ni-Al Composite Powders,2021-01-25,"Thermally sprayed cermet coatings are adequate solutions to improve cavitation and wear resistance of hydraulic turbines made of stainless steel (SS), especially in rivers with a high sediment load, such as the Madeira River in Brazil. However, some cermets are easily dissolved in river water, leading to premature failure of the coating and costly maintenance. Moreover, galvanic corrosion induced by coupling the cermet to a SS can accelerate the coating dissolution. Therefore, the corrosion resistance of six cermets (WC-12Co, WC-10Ni, WC-10Co-4Cr, Cr(3)C(2)-25NiCr, Cr(3)C(2)-10NiCr and Cr(3)C(2)-10Ni) and the galvanic corrosion resistance of these materials coupled to CA6NM SS were evaluated in a solution that simulated Madeira River water. WC-12Co and WC-10Ni cermets exhibited the highest corrosion rates, 0.077 and 0.068 mm/year, respectively, whereas the Cr content in the WC-10Co-4Cr (0.017 mm/year) and Cr(3)C(2)-based coatings (0.005 to 0.007 mm/year) led them to corrode at slower rates. Moreover, the WC-10Co-4Cr and Cr(3)C(2)-based cermets exhibited negligible galvanic corrosion current when coupled to the CA6NM SS, making them good options to coat hydraulic turbines. In contrast, WC-12Co and WC-10Ni coatings underwent a more severe galvanic corrosion process, which would drastically reduce the lifespan of these materials as hydraulic turbine coatings.","Luiz, Leonardo Augusto; de Andrade, Juliano; Pesqueira, Camila Melo; Siqueira, Irene Bida de Araújo Fernandes; Sucharski, Gustavo Bavaresco; de Sousa, Milton Jakson",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819149/,49

45641,Öffentliche Mobilität gestalten – Die Mobilitätsberichterstattung,2020-10-24,"Innate and adaptive immune responses lead to wound healing by regulating a complex series of events promoting cellular cross-talk. An inflammatory response is presented with its characteristic clinical symptoms: heat, pain, redness, and swelling. Some smart thermo-responsive polymers like chitosan, polyvinylpyrrolidone, alginate, and poly(ε-caprolactone) can be used to create biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds. These processed thermo-responsive biomaterials possess 3D architectures similar to human structures, providing physical support for cell growth and tissue regeneration. Furthermore, these structures are used as novel drug delivery systems. Locally heated tumors above the polymer lower the critical solution temperature and can induce its conversion into a hydrophobic form by an entropy-driven process, enhancing drug release. When the thermal stimulus is gone, drug release is reduced due to the swelling of the material. As a result, these systems can contribute to the wound healing process in accelerating tissue healing, avoiding large scar tissue, regulating the inflammatory response, and protecting from bacterial infections. This paper integrates the relevant reported contributions of bioengineered scaffolds composed of smart thermo-responsive polymers for drug delivery applications in wound healing. Therefore, we present a comprehensive review that aims to demonstrate these systems’ capacity to provide spatially and temporally controlled release strategies for one or more drugs used in wound healing. In this sense, the novel manufacturing techniques of 3D printing and electrospinning are explored for the tuning of their physicochemical properties to adjust therapies according to patient convenience and reduce drug toxicity and side effects.","Castillo-Henríquez, Luis; Castro-Alpízar, Jose; Lopretti-Correa, Mary; Vega-Baudrit, José",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7866792/,49

This article considers whether the digital images can be used to prove guilt or innocence, and if so, whether they need to meet more strict requirements than those for depositions. First, the article discusses the legal grounds pertaining to the application of a conventional hearsay exception to the digital images. Second, it explains how the use of the digital images, which could be concerning, can meet the legal demands of the adversary system underlying the Hearsay Rule.

The first step toward reaching this goal involves reaching an agreement on the need for theory, and the preeminent role of theory as the most distinctive product of human intellectual activity. Following Aristotle’s approach to addressing the “Why?” question by answering the “What?” question, this chapter reviews major discussions surrounding the definition of theory from multiple disciplines and proposes a novel, more inclusive view of theory that encompasses the views of these disciplines while, at the same time, highlights the unique goals that each theory category addresses. These unique communicative goals: theory as proposition, model, paradigm, worldview, grand theory, methodology, explanation, significant description, prescription, and metatheory offers researchers a wider space within which exciting and original theorizing can take place.","Hassan, Nik Rushdi; Willcocks, Leslie P.",Advancing Information Systems Theories,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982084/,49

In doing so, we pay special attention to the individual resources of the parents as well as to their family situation and their working life. In particular, we examine the subjective perception of stress of single parents. For our analyses we use data from the SOEP-CoV study, a special survey of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) on the topic of Corona. Overall, we found moderate levels of stress from the demands of schooling their children at home among all parents surveyed (N = 1508, of which N = 243 were single parents). However, parents with a low level of education and single parents felt particularly burdened, especially if they were employed at the time of the school closures.

As a result, changes have been made to healthcare provision. In the UK, the focus was changed to urgent and emergency treatment only, and therefore a shift from face-to-face consultations to video and telephone consultations was implemented. Our aim was to look at the telephone consultations in our oral and maxillofacial (OMF) department to identify their effectiveness. METHOD: A search was carried out using the electronic patient record for patients booked for consultations in the OMF clinics from the 23(rd) of March to the 1(st) of May 2020. Trauma clinics and ad-hoc clinics were excluded. RESULTS: 21 clinic codes were found as suitable for inclusion. 185 consultations were booked during the 6-week period. Of these, 165 were via telephone and 20 face-to-face. A total of 75 consultations resulted in discharge and 110 required further follow up or further investigation. Of the 75 patients discharged, 73 of these were via telephone. The main reason for discharge was delivery of benign biopsy results. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 will have long term impacts on healthcare provision. If implemented correctly, virtual consultations carry the potential in making healthcare more accessible.","Chaudhry, H; Abiola, J",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136072/,49

The ongoing real-world study ‘PROPER’ is designed to provide insights into outcomes of the transition from reference to SB5 outside the controlled, randomised, clinical trial setting, and under an umbrella design has enrolled 1,000 patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease, treated at centres in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. The objective of this interim analysis is to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with Crohn’s disease transitioned from reference to biosimilar adalimumab SB5. METHODS: Eligible patients had been transitioned to SB5 as part of routine treatment following a minimum of 16 weeks’ treatment with reference adalimumab. Data are captured from patient charts retrospectively for 24 weeks prior to and prospectively and/or retrospectively for 48 weeks after SB5 initiation. This first interim analysis of the Crohn’s disease cohort reports outcome measures including baseline clinical characteristics, disease activity, persistence on SB5, clinical management and safety for patients enrolled at 32 specialist sites and followed up to the data extract date of February 5(th), 2021. RESULTS: Of the 459 patients included in this interim analysis, at time of data extract 108 had completed 48 weeks on SB5, 45 patients had discontinued SB5, and 10 had withdrawn from study. A disease flare was reported for 29 (6.3%) of patients, of whom 22 had no subsequent change in biologic treatment; 7 had a change, of whom 5 switched to a different biologic; 2 had secondary loss of response (physician reported). Twelve patients reported 13 serious adverse events, of which 4 (anal fistula, 2 perianal abscesses and subileus) were considered by study physician to be related to SB5 administration.

54413,Correction,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, several patients contacted members of the IBD team with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related questions. Some patients intended to cancel scheduled IBD clinic outpatient visits or endoscopic examinations and/or stop or postpone their medication. We surveyed the need for information by IBD patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the role of the IBD team in this regard. METHODS: We performed an anonymous survey at the IBD department of our tertiary referral center. The questionnaire contained 15 closed questions, including on basic demographic data, medication use, testing for COVID-19, information sources, and intention to stop or postpone medication or follow-up. The questionnaire was available to all adult patients attending the IBD outpatient clinic and infusion unit from July 1(st) until October 30(th) 2020. All questionnaires were collected before the second COVID-19 wave. Patients on subcutaneous medication that did not attend the IBD clinic during these months were contacted via e-mail. RESULTS: We collected 965 questionnaires. The majority of patients (44.3%) was 18–40 years old. There were more patients with Crohn’s disease (66%) than ulcerative colitis (32%) and IBD unclassified (2%). Demographics and medication use are presented in table 1. A third of the patients (31.7%) was tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 8.3% tested positive. Twenty-six percent of patients considered they had higher need for information about COVID-19 than the general population. News websites were a source of information about COVID-19 for 52.5% of patients, followed by hospital websites (43.8%), direct contact with the IBD physician (24.6%), direct contact with the IBD nurse (23.1%), and state sponsored websites (20.9%). In fact, 35.9% of patients contacted the IBD nurse since the start of the pandemic. The majority of patients reported they were satisfied by the information (80.5%) and/or reassured (85%) by the IBD nurse. Ten percent of patients had considered to stop IBD medication due to the pandemic, and 80% of these refrained to do so following the advice of the IBD nurses. Finally, 12.5% of the patients expressed true fear of hospital visits due to the pandemic, which was associated with female gender and higher need for information. CONCLUSION: Treatment cessation and anxiety could be avoided by direct interaction with the IBD nurses and in particular with the IBD nurse as first point of contact for the patient. Patients with IBD may profit from an optimized information platform with scientifically correct information addressing the concerns of this specific population.

Course format shifted from mostly face‐to‐face delivery to synchronous and asynchronous online delivery following the COVID‐19 shutdown. Students perceived decreased instructor effort and increased student effort. Nearly all students had access to devices. However, access to fast, reliable internet was a common issue. A small percentage of students were more likely to take online courses after the pandemic, yet a majority were now more comfortable taking online classes and using virtual meeting software. Student concern for COVID‐19 was low. However, most reported wearing masks in buildings and on campus. Students reported increases and decreases in hours worked, with both changes resulting in perceived positive and negative academic impacts.

55439,Geographic modeling and simulation systems for geographic research in the new era: Some thoughts on their development and construction,2021-06-29,"New York City taxi rides form the core of the traffic in the city of New York. The many rides taken every day by New Yorkers in the busy city can give us a great idea of traffic times, road blockages, and so on. Predicting the duration of a taxi trip is very important since a user would always like to know precisely how much time it would require of him to travel from one place to another. Given the rising popularity of app-based taxi usage through common vendors like Ola and Uber, competitive pricing has to be offered to ensure users choose them. Prediction of duration and price of trips can help users to plan their trips properly, thus keeping potential margins for traffic congestions. It can also help drivers to determine the correct route which in-turn will take lesser time as accordingly. Moreover, the transparency about pricing and trip duration will help to attract users at times when popular taxi app-based vendor services apply surge fares. Thus in this research study, we used real-time data which customers would provide at the start of a ride, or while booking a ride to predict the duration and fare. This data includes pickup and drop-off point coordinates, the distance of the trip, start time, number of passengers, and a rate code belonging to the different classes of cabs available such that the rate applied is based on a regular or airport basis. Hereafter, we applied XGBoost and Multi-Layer Perceptron models to find out which one of them provides better accuracy and relationships between real-time variables. At last, a comparison of the two mentioned algorithms facilitates us to decide that XGBoost is more fitter and efficient than Multi-Layer Perceptron for taxi trip duration-based predictions.","Poongodi, M; Malviya, Mohit; Kumar, Chahat; Hamdi, Mounir; Vijayakumar, V; Nebhen, Jamel; Alyamani, Hasan",Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248292/,49
55534,Soziologie in Israel,2021-07-06,"This paper explores the causal relationship between irresponsible behavior and corruption in Tunisia in the time of COVID‐19. In our modeling approach, the abuse of power is used as a proxy for corruption, while lockdown breaches are used as a proxy for irresponsible behavior. Based on the vector error‐correction model, the Granger causality test is performed to identify the direction of the causal relationship. An empirical study involving the use of real data from the National Anticorruption Authority is conducted. The results reveal the existence of a unidirectional Granger causal relationship running from lockdown breaches to the abuse of power. These findings imply that the irresponsible behavior of Tunisians may constitute in itself a factor that can exacerbate their exposure to corruption in periods of crisis, especially in the absence of well‐established corporate social responsibility. The implications of our findings for public policy are also discussed.","Gani, Walid",Afr Dev Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8251111/,49

56079,Ground Tire Rubber Filled Flexible Polyurethane Foam—Effect of Waste Rubber Treatment on Composite Performance,2021-07-07,"Germinal Centres (GCs) are transient structures in secondary lymphoid organs, where affinity maturation of B cells takes place following an infection. While GCs are responsible for protective antibody responses, dysregulated GC reactions are associated with autoimmune disease and B cell lymphoma. Typically, ‘normal’ GCs persist for a limited period of time and eventually undergo shutdown. In this review, we focus on an important but unanswered question – what causes the natural termination of the GC reaction? In murine experiments, lack of antigen, absence or constitutive T cell help leads to premature termination of the GC reaction. Consequently, our present understanding is limited to the idea that GCs are terminated due to a decrease in antigen access or changes in the nature of T cell help. However, there is no direct evidence on which biological signals are primarily responsible for natural termination of GCs and a mechanistic understanding is clearly lacking. We discuss the present understanding of the GC shutdown, from factors impacting GC dynamics to changes in cellular interactions/dynamics during the GC lifetime. We also address potential missing links and remaining questions in GC biology, to facilitate further studies to promote a better understanding of GC shutdown in infection and immune dysregulation.","Arulraj, Theinmozhi; Binder, Sebastian C.; Robert, Philippe A.; Meyer-Hermann, Michael",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293096/,49

However, the results were inconsistent. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to quantitatively evaluate the association between marine n-3 PUFA, fish and CVD mortality risk with prospective cohort studies. A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and MEDLINE databases from the establishment of the database to May 2021. A total of 25 cohort studies were included with 2,027,512 participants and 103,734 CVD deaths. The results indicated that the fish consumption was inversely associated with the CVD mortality risk [relevant risk (RR) = 0.91; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.85−0.98]. The higher marine n-3 PUFA intake was associated with the reduced risk of CVD mortality (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.85–0.89). Dose-response analysis suggested that the risk of CVD mortality was decreased by 4% with an increase of 20 g of fish intake (RR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94–0.99) or 80 milligrams of marine n-3 PUFA intake (RR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94–0.98) per day. The current work provides evidence that the intake of fish and marine n-3 PUFA are inversely associated with the risk of CVD mortality.","Jiang, Lan; Wang, Jinyu; Xiong, Ke; Xu, Lei; Zhang, Bo; Ma, Aiguo",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8308510/,49
56381,Civic universities and bottom-up approaches to boost local development of rural areas: the case of the University of Macerata,2021-08-03,"The expanding amount of remaining drug substances in wastewater adversely affects both the climate and human well-being. In the current investigation, we developed new cellulose acetic acid derivation/zeolite fiber as an effective technique to eliminate erythromycin (ERY) from wastewater. The number of interchangeable sites in the adsorbent structures and the ratio of ERY to the three adsorbents were identified as the main reasons for the reduction in adsorption as the initial ERY concentrations increased. Additionally, for all adsorbents, the pseudo–second-order modeling showed better fitting for the adsorption than the pseudo–first-order modeling. However, the findings obtained in the pseudo–first-order model were still enough for explaining the sorption kinetics of ERY, showing that the surface displayed all chemisorption and physi-sorption adsorption processes by both adsorbents. The R (2) for the second order was very close to 1 for the three adsorbents in the case of pseudo–second-order. The adsorption capacity reached 17.76 mg/g. The three adsorbents showed negative values of ΔH, and these values were −6,200, −8,500, and −9600 kJ/mol for zeolite, CA, and ZCA, respectively, and this shows that the adsorption is exothermic. The desorption analysis shows no substantial loss of adsorption site after three trials, indicating higher stability and resilience of the three adsorbents, indicating a strong repeatability of their possible use in adsorption without contaminating the environment. In addition, the chemical attitude and possible donor–acceptor interactions of ERY were assessed by the quantum chemical parameters (QCPs) and NBO analysis performed, at the HF/6-311G** calculations.","Jodeh, Shehdeh; Erman, Israa; Hamed, Othman; Massad, Younes; Hanbali, Ghadir; Samhan, Subhi; Dagdag, Omar; Kaya, Savaş; Serdaroğlu, Goncagül",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8316859/,49

This exploratory study uses data from 28 countries to examine how the strength of the pandemic (e.g. infection rates and death rates) and governmental restrictions are related to these changes. The analyses of the data suggest the way in which police organizations responded to the pandemic was complicated. Infection rates are generally not as strongly related to changes as are death rates. Governmental restrictiveness is strongly related to some changes. Additional research is needed to tease out additional factors that potentially explain these changes as well as multivariate effects of these factors.,"Maskály, Jon; Ivković, Sanja Kutnjak; Neyroud, Peter",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385965/,49

Some argue that these regimes deliberately tolerate somewhat critical online comments as a way to monitor mass sentiments. To counterbalance critics’ influences, they often mobilize and amplify pro-regime voices. We empirically examine whether such pro-regime voices succeed in changing public opinions in favor of the authorities. Based on two online surveys and an embedded survey experiment that we implemented in China, we find that when given a choice, our Chinese respondents self-select to expose themselves to comments that deviate from the official discourses. In addition, exposure to diverse comments undermines individuals’ policy support. The findings call into question the effectiveness of the “soft propaganda” that authoritarian regimes orchestrate in cyberspace.

Despite their potential, the effectiveness of DHIs are thought to be dependent, in part, on user engagement. However, the relationship between engagement and the effectiveness of dietary DHIs is not well understood. The aim of this review is to describe the association between DHI engagement and dietary intake. A systematic search of four electronic databases and grey literature for records published before December 2019 was conducted. Studies were eligible if they examined a quantitative association between objective measures of engagement with a DHI (subjective experience or usage) and measures of dietary intake in adults (aged ≥18 years). From 10,653 citations, seven studies were included. Five studies included usage measures of engagement and two examined subjective experiences. Narrative synthesis, using vote counting, found mixed evidence of an association with usage measures (5 of 12 associations indicated a positive relationship, 7 were inconclusive) and no evidence regarding an association with subjective experience (both studies were inconclusive). The findings provide early evidence supporting an association between measures of usage and dietary intake; however, this was inconsistent. Further research examining the association between DHI engagement and dietary intake is warranted.","Delaney, Tessa; Mclaughlin, Matthew; Hall, Alix; Yoong, Sze Lin; Brown, Alison; O'Brien, Kate; Dray, Julia; Barnes, Courtney; Hollis, Jenna; Wyse, Rebecca; Wiggers, John; Sutherland, Rachel; Wolfenden, Luke",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13093281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579158/,49

All patients with SCA42ND show cerebellar atrophy and/or hypoplasia on neuroimaging and share common features such as dysmorphic features, global developmental delay, and axial hypotonia, all manifesting within the first year of life. To date, only 10 patients with SCA42ND have been reported with functionally confirmed gain-of-function variants, bearing either of two recurrent pathogenic variants.

Several studies have shown the feasibility and safety of both transperitoneal and posterior retroperitoneal approaches for single incision laparoscopic adrenalectomy, but none have compared the outcomes according to the left- or right-sided location of the adrenal glands. Materials and Methods. From 2009 to 2013, 89 patients who received LAMP (laparoscopic adrenalectomy through mono port) were analyzed. The surgical outcomes attained using the transperitoneal approach (TPA) and posterior retroperitoneal approach (PRA) were analyzed and compared. Results and Discussion. On the right side, no significant differences were found between the LAMP-TPA and LAMP-PRA groups in terms of patient characteristics and clinicopathological data. However, outcomes differed in which LAMP-PRA group had a statistically significant shorter mean operative time (84.13 ± 41.47 min versus 116.84 ± 33.17 min; P = 0.038), time of first oral intake (1.00 ± 0.00 days versus 1.21 ± 0.42 days; P = 0.042), and length of hospitalization (2.17 ± 0.389 days versus 3.68 ± 1.38 days; P ≤ 0.001), whereas in left-sided adrenalectomies LAMP-TPA had a statistically significant shorter mean operative time (83.85 ± 27.72 min versus 110.95 ± 29.31 min; P = 0.002). Conclusions. We report that LAMP-PRA is more appropriate for right-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomies due to anatomical characteristics and better surgical outcomes. For left-sided laparoscopic adrenalectomies, however, we propose LAMP-TPA as a more suitable method.","Byon, Wooseok; Hyun, Keehoon; Yun, Ji-Sup; Park, Yong Lai; Park, Chan Heun",International journal of endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/747361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371676/,49
61634,Second-quarter biotech job picture.,2017,"BACKGROUND Protective perioperative ventilation has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of ventilation with low tidal volume (VT) either alone or in a combination with moderate permissive hypercapnia in major pancreatoduodenal interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty adult patients scheduled for elective pancreatoduodenal surgery with duration >2 h were enrolled into a prospective single-center study. All patients were randomized to three groups receiving high VT [10 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW), the HVT group, n = 20], low VT (6 mL/kg PBW, the LVT group, n = 20), and low VT combined with a moderate hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis (6 mL/kg PBW, PaCO2 45-60 mm Hg, the LVT + HC group, n = 20). Cardiopulmonary parameters and the incidence of complications were registered during surgery and postoperatively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The values of VT were 610 (563-712), 370 (321-400), and 340 (312-430) mL/kg for the HVT, the LVT, and the LVT + HC groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Compared to the HVT group, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was increased in the LVT group by 15%: 333 (301-381) vs. 382 (349-423) mm Hg at 24 h postoperatively (p < 0.05). The HVT group had significantly higher incidence of atelectases (n = 6), despite lower incidence of smoking compared with the LVT (n = 1) group (p = 0.017) and demonstrated longer length of hospital stay. The patients of the LVT + HC group had lower arterial lactate and bicarbonate excess values by the end of surgery. CONCLUSION In major pancreatoduodenal interventions, preventively protective VT improves postoperative oxygenation, reduces the incidence of atelectases, and shortens length of hospital stay. The combination of low VT and permissive hypercapnia results in hypercapnic acidosis decreasing the lactate concentration but adding no additional benefits and warrants further investigations.","Kuzkov, Vsevolod V; Rodionova, Ludmila N; Ilyina, Yana Y; Ushakov, Aleksey A; Sokolova, Maria M; Fot, Eugenia V; Duberman, Boris L; Kirov, Mikhail Y",Frontiers in medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2016.00066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27999775/,49
61769,Understanding mass spectrometry images: complexity to clarity with machine learning.,2020-09-16,"KEY POINTS Regionalization of the stretch reflex, i.e. the notion that the activation of 1a afferents from a muscle region influences only the activation of motor units in the same region, has been demonstrated previously in animals but not in humans. Mechanical stretches applied to regions of vastus medialis as close as 10 mm apart resulted in recruitment of motor units localized topographically with respect to the location of the mechanical stretch. Stretch reflexes are regionalized in the human vastus medialis. The human spinal cord has the neuromuscular circuitry to preferentially activate motoneurones innervating muscle fibres located in different regions of the vastus medialis. ABSTRACT The localization of motor unit territories provides an anatomical basis to suggest that the CNS may have more independence in motor unit recruitment and control strategies than what was previously thought. In this study, we investigated whether the human spinal cord has the neuromuscular circuitry to independently activate motor units located in different regions of the vastus medialis. Mechanical taps were applied to multiple locations in the vastus medialis (VM) in nine healthy individuals. Regional responses within the muscle were observed using a grid of 5 × 13 surface EMG electrodes. The EMG amplitude was quantified for each channel, and a cluster of channels showing the largest activation was identified. The spatial location of the EMG response was quantified as the position of the channels in the cluster. In a subset of three participants, intramuscular recordings were performed simultaneously with the surface EMG recordings. Mechanical taps resulted in localized, discrete responses for each participant. The spatial location of the elicited responses was dependent on the location of the tap (P < 0.001). Recordings with intramuscular electrodes confirmed the regional activation of the VM for different tap locations. Selective stimulation of 1a afferents localized in a region of the VM results in reflex recruitment of motor units in the same region. These findings suggest that the human spinal cord has the neuromuscular circuitry to modulate spatially the motoneuronal output to vastus medialis regions, which is a neuroanatomical prerequisite for regional activation.","Gallina, Alessio; Blouin, Jean-Sébastien; Ivanova, Tanya D; Garland, S Jayne",The Journal of physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp274458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28485493/,49
61830,Chronic impedance spectroscopy of an endovascular stent-electrode array.,2016,"There is an increasing need to use online instrumentation for continuous monitoring of water quality. However, industrial applications using online instruments, such as submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers, may require the use of alternative techniques to remove particle effect rather than performing a physical filtration step. Some submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers have built-in generic particle compensation algorithms to remove the filtration step. This work studied the influence of suspended particles on the measurements of a submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer as well as the performance of the built-in particle compensation technique under laboratory-controlled conditions. Simulated water samples were used in the combinations of standard particles from laboratory chemical and natural particles extracted from water systems with ultrapure water and treated water from a drinking water treatment plant. Particle contributions to the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) measurements of water samples varied differently when particle types or concentrations changed. The compensated UV254, measured by the submersible instrument using the built-in generic particle compensation algorithms, was compared with laboratory UV254, analysed by the bench-top instrument with the physical filtration method. The results indicated that the built-in generic compensation algorithms of the submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer may generate undercompensated UV254 or overcompensated UV254 for various surface waters. These findings provide in-depth knowledge about the impact of suspended particles on the measurements of submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometers; source water dependence; and why site-specific calibration is often needed to get accurate measurements.","Shi, Zhining; Chow, Christopher W K; Fabris, Rolando; Zheng, Tianlong; Liu, Jixue; Jin, Bo",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11178-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079347/,49

RESULTS In comparison to healthy newborns, CoA infants' PPG waveforms demonstrated prolonged f-hTD (mean±s.d. of 73.2±26.6 versus 35.2±8.3 ms, P<0.001) and lower F/H (0.57±0.26 versus 0.99±0.58, P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS F-hTD and F/H are quantifiable from hand- and foot-derived PPG waveforms and are significantly different in CoA versus healthy newborns. Larger studies are needed to validate PPG for improved critical congenital heart disease screening.","Palmeri, L; Gradwohl, G; Nitzan, M; Hoffman, E; Adar, Y; Shapir, Y; Koppel, R",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/jp.2016.162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27684424/,49
62893,Virus variants: GISAID policies incentivize surveillance in global south.,2021-05-01,"Introduction/Objectives: The incidence of hepatitis C (HCV) infection is rising among people who inject drugs (PWID). Even in the context of known HCV prevention and treatment strategies, some PWID remain unengaged in HCV care. This study aimed to identify and characterize experiences and perceptions of PWID regarding the acceptability and effectiveness of HCV testing and treatment at a local syringe service program (SSP). Methods: A total of 36 PWID participated in semi-structured interviews at an SSP in New York City. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by three coders, following a constructivist grounded theory approach. Relevant themes were identified as they emerged from the data. Results: Interviews with PWID revealed three themes related to the impact of SSPs on HCV care: (1) non-stigmatizing SSP environments, (2) the role of SSPs in improving HCV knowledge, and (3) acceptability of SSPs as sites for HCV care among PWID. Discussion: This paper contributes to the ongoing understanding that SSPs provide a well-accepted source of HCV services for PWID. Participants believed that SSPs are accessible and effective sites for HCV care, and suggested that stigma among PWID continues to affect receipt of HCV care in traditional settings. Conclusions: Understanding attitudes and beliefs of PWID regarding the effectiveness of SSPs as sites for HCV care is crucial for the development of focused strategies to reduce HCV transmission, and to ultimately achieve HCV elimination. Given this, further research is warranted investigating how best to improve HCV care at harm reduction sites such as SSPs.","Muncan, Brandon; Jordan, Ashly E; Perlman, David C; Frank, David; Ompad, Danielle C; Walters, Suzan M",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1892142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682610/,49

These molecules were designed by connecting the TADF moiety 4,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phthalonitrile (2CzPN) to different positions of a central benzene ring scaffold. Three highly soluble emitters all exhibited near-quantitative photoluminescence quantum yields (ΦPL) in toluene. High ΦPLs were also achieved in doped films, 59 and 70% for p-di2CzPN and m-di2CzPN in 10 wt % DPEPO doped film, respectively, and 54% for 1,3,5-tri2CzPN in 20 wt % doped CBP films. The rate constant of reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC) for p-di2CzPN and m-di2CzPN in DPEPO films reached 1.1 × 105 and 0.7 × 105 s-1, respectively, and kRISC for 1,3,5-tri2CzPN in the CBP film reached 1.7 × 105 s-1.

64776,New technologies in ambulatory thyroid surgery.,2008,"OBJECTIVE To assess the safety and tolerability profile of the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist frovatriptan (Frova(R), Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., Chadds Ford, PA, USA) when used as a 6-day regimen for the short-term prevention of menstrual migraine scheduled over multiple perimenstrual periods. BACKGROUND Two randomized controlled trials have established the efficacy of a 6-day regimen of frovatriptan for reducing the incidence and severity of menstrual migraine over 1 to 3 perimenstrual periods; long-term data are needed to further assess the safety and tolerability profile of this regimen. METHODS Two multinational trials were included in the analysis: Study 1 was a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind parallel trial (3 perimenstrual periods treated) with an open-label extension (3 additional perimenstrual periods treated), and Study 2 was a long-term (12 perimenstrual periods treated over 12-15 months) open-label study. Enrolled women experienced menstrual migraine defined as predictable migraine attacks that started -2 days to +3 (Study 1) or +4 (Study 2) days relative to the first day of menses and that occurred in at least 2 out of 3 menstrual cycles. Frovatriptan or placebo was given 2 days before anticipated menstrual migraine and continued for 6 days. Adverse events, serious adverse events, vital signs, cardiovascular events, electrocardiograms, and laboratory parameters were assessed and recorded periodically and summarized using descriptive statistics. Adverse event data from Study 1 and Study 2 were compared using event rates. RESULTS The demographic characteristics of the 2 study populations were similar: the mean age was approximately 38 years, > or =94% of participants were white, and 85% reported menstrual migraine began on days -2 to +1 of the menstrual cycle. The mean reported history of menstrual migraine was approximately 11 years. A large percentage of the respective safety populations completed each study or study period: 87% (362/416) and 88% (273/309) completed the double-blind period and open-label periods of Study 1, respectively, and 59% (308/525) completed treatment of 12 perimenstrual periods in Study 2. Major reasons for discontinuation in Study 1 included adverse events (5%, double-blind period) and ""other"" (10% double-blind period and 5% open-label period). In Study 2, major reasons for discontinuation included patient request (17.3%) and adverse event (10.2%). The most common treatment emergent adverse events in the double-blind period of Study 1 (placebo vs frovatriptan twice daily) were upper respiratory infection (9% vs 9%), nausea (6% vs 8%), dizziness (7% vs 7%), fatigue (4% vs 7%), dysmenorrhea (3% vs 7%), influenza (3% vs 6%), neck pain (4% vs 6%), and migraine (4% vs 4%). With the exception of migraine (which was reported using a different method in each study), prevalence rates for Studies 1 and 2 were numerically similar. The most frequently reported cardiovascular adverse events during double-blind treatment (placebo vs frovatriptan twice daily) were chest discomfort (2% and 3%), chest pain (2% and 2%), and hypertension (0 and 2%). The corresponding adverse event rates in Study 2 were 2% (chest pain), 3% (chest discomfort), and 3% (hypertension). In both studies, most adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity and their incidence numerically declined with each perimenstrual period/cycle, as did the incidence of menstrual migraine. The observed rate of intercurrent migraine in Study 2 over 12 perimenstrual periods was 1.5 per month, compared with 1.7 at baseline. There was no observable increase in the first occurrence of migraine in the 5 days following the perimenstrual period, indicating a lack of rebound headache. CONCLUSIONS During treatment of up to 12 perimenstrual periods over a 12- to 15-month period, the safety and tolerability of frovatriptan for short-term prevention of menstrual migraine was similar to that observed with acute use of triptans. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity, there was no evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events relative to acute treatment, and rebound headache was not evident. A short-term regimen with frovatriptan presents a safe and viable treatment option for preventing predictable migraine such as menstrual migraine.","MacGregor, E Anne; Brandes, Jan L; Silberstein, Stephen; Jeka, Slawomir; Czapinski, Piotr; Shaw, Bob; Pawsey, Stephen",Headache,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01513.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19788471/,49

We will describe some of the factors that appear to be highly associated and important components in the pathophysiology of NEC. We will discuss the intestinal microbial environment of the fetus as well as the preterm infant and how interaction of dysbiosis with an immature gastrointestinal tract combined with dietary factors play a role in the pathogenesis of NEC.

The development of transportation systems, such as air travel, has increased the risk of a global pandemic caused by emerging viruses. Agents causing novel infections are often zoonotic, crossing from the natural host into the human population. Hence, comprehensive surveillance of virus-infected animals as well as humans is required. However, the number of virus particles in clinical and environmental samples is usually very low. Thus, a method to concentrate the virus is sometimes required in order to enable detection. We recently reported that magnetic beads coated with an anionic polymer, poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride) can be used to facilitate the rapid and sensitive detection of viruses.

Some historical perspective is necessary in order to highlight the nature of the controversy concerning its causation. Throughout history, a pattern tends to repeat itself when natural phenomena require explanation. Dogma usually arrives first, then it is eventually replaced by scientific understanding. The same pattern is unfolding in relation to ME/CFS, but supporters of the psychological dogma surrounding its causation remain stubbornly resistant, even in the face of compelling scientific evidence to the contrary. Acceptance of the latter is not just an academic issue; the route to proper understanding and treatment of ME/CFS is through further scientific research rather than psychological theorisation.

65753,Watch your back.,2009,"The purpose of this study was to assess clinical protection in pigs vaccinated with a commercially available attenuated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccine (Porcilis) PRRS) and then naturally exposed under field conditions to a heterologous (Italian cluster) strain of virulent PRRSV. A total of 30, 4-week-old pigs seronegative for PRRSV were allocated to 1 of 3 groups (IM, ID, and C groups). At 5 weeks of age, pigs of groups IM (n=10 pigs) and ID (n=10 pigs) were vaccinated intramuscularly and intradermally, respectively, with modified live PRRSV-1 vaccine (Porcilis) PRRS). Pigs of group C (n=10 pigs) were kept as non-vaccinated controls. At post-vaccination (PV) days 0, 7, 14, 28, and 45, blood samples were collected for detection of vaccine virus (PCR) and antibody response (ELISA), identification of changes in lymphocyte subpopulations by cytometry, and IFN-gamma PRRSV-specific secreting cells (SC) by ELISpot. At PV day 45, pigs of A, B, and C groups were moved to a site 3 conventional finishing herd with a history of respiratory disease caused by PRRSV and the most common bacteria to be exposed to a natural challenge. The PRRSV field strain, belonging to the Italian cluster of the PRRSV-1, demonstrated a 84% identity with the vaccine virus (DV strain) at ORF5 sequencing. At 0 (exposure day=45 days PV), 4, 7, 11, 14, 19, 21, 28, and 34 days post-exposure (PE) blood samples were collected for detection and titration of PRRSV and antibody, as well as for lymphocyte and IFN-gamma measurement as described above. Throughout the post-exposure period, all pigs were observed daily for clinical signs. The overall clinical signs were reduced by 68 and 72%, respectively in the intramuscularly and intradermally vaccinated pigs compared to controls. Respiratory signs were reduced by 72 and 80%, respectively in the IM and ID groups. Clinical protection was associated with marked activation of cell-mediated immune response. The highest levels of specific IFN-gamma production at 21-34 days PE were concomitant and associated to changes in natural killer (NK) cells, gamma/delta T, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the blood. In our field study, evidences of EU attenuated vaccine-induced clinical protection against natural exposure to a genetically diverse (84% homology) PRRSV-1 isolate (Italian cluster) was demonstrated by the statistically significant reduction in clinical signs in terms of incidence, duration and severity and by a more efficient cell-mediated immune response in the vaccinated pigs as compared to the unvaccinated controls.","Martelli, Paolo; Gozio, Stefano; Ferrari, Luca; Rosina, Stefano; De Angelis, Elena; Quintavalla, Cecilia; Bottarelli, Ezio; Borghetti, Paolo",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.03.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19442420/,49
65961,Coronapod: Waiving vaccine patents and coronavirus genome data disputes.,2021-05-07,"BACKGROUND Limited comprehension of the concept of palliative care and misconceptions about it are barriers to meaningful utilisation of palliative care programs. As caregivers play an integral role for patients with terminal illness, it is necessary to assess their perceptions and attitudes towards the palliative care approach. METHOD A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Data was collected from the Aga Khan Hospital in-patient and out-patient departments and home-based palliative care services. All adult caregivers who met the inclusion criteria and consented, completed a questionnaire till the sample size was reached. Univariate and multivariate multivariable analysis was done and results were reported as crude prevalence's, crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals using Cox-proportional hazard algorithm. Mean difference of knowledge and attitude scores by caregiver variables were assessed using one-way ANOVA. SPSS version 18 was used and a p-value of less than 5% was treated as significant. RESULTS Out of 250 caregivers more than 60% were 40 years or less, majority were males and at least graduates. Approximately 70% of the respondents agreed with the statement that the person suffering from cancer should be informed about the diagnosis and disease progression. About 45% (95% C.I.: 39.03, 51.37%) of the study respondents had enhanced understanding about palliative care. Individuals under 40 years old, those with an education level of at least grade 10, children or relatives were found to have significantly more enhanced knowledge about palliative care. The majority believed that the patient should be informed about the diagnosis and should be facilitated to carry out routine activities and fulfill their wishes. CONCLUSION Nearly half of the caregivers had enhanced understanding of the palliative care approach. They showed consistent understanding of two foundational aspects indicating correct knowledge across age groups, gender, education level, and relationship with the patient. Firstly, that palliative care should be offered to everyone suffering from a terminal illness and, secondly, that this approach encompasses not just physical, but also psychological and social needs of the patient and the family. These findings will help inform the establishment of a palliative care program that fills the gaps in comprehension and knowledge of caregivers.","Shah, Sameena; Qaisar, Faizan; Azam, Iqbal; Mansoor, Khairunnisa",BMC palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-020-00688-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243212/,49

A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was rated according validated scales. The level of evidence (LE) was reported as described by the Oxford criteria. Preoperative demographic parameters and perioperative outcomes between the two surgical techniques were assessed. A meta-analysis of the included studies was performed. A total of 5 studies were elected for the analysis, including 164 cases, 70 (42.6%) of them being LESS and 94 (57.4%) being CLP. Four studies were observational retrospective comparative studies (LE: 3a-4); one was a prospective randomized controlled trial (LE: 2b). There was no significant difference in age, body mass index, gender, side and presence of the crossing vessel, between the groups. There was no significant difference regarding the operative time (weight mean difference [WMD]: -7.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -71.82-57.79; P = 0.83) and length of hospital stay (WMD: 0.04; 95% CI: -0.11-0.20; P = 0.58), whereas the estimated blood loss was statistically lower for LESS (WMD: -16.83; 95% CI: -31.79--1.87; P = 0.03). The postoperative use of analgesic favored the LESS group but without reaching statistical significance (WMD: -7.52; 95% CI: -17.56-2.53; P = 0.14). In conclusion, LESS pyeloplasty offers comparable surgical and functional outcomes to CLP while providing the potential advantages of less blood loss and lower analgesic requirement. Thus, despite being more technically challenging, LESS pyeloplasty can be regarded as a minimally invasive approach for patients seeking fewer incisional scars.","Brandao, Luis Felipe; Laydner, Humberto; Zargar, Homayoun; Torricelli, Fabio; Andreoni, Cassio; Kaouk, Jihad; Autorino, Riccardo",Urology annals,https://doi.org/10.4103/0974-7796.156145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229312/,49

68316,Spontaneous hemorrhage of a facial neurofibroma: endovascular embolization before surgical intervention.,2013,"Dengue is a major public health problem globally. It is caused by four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4), and although serotype-specific and strongly neutralizing cross-reactive immune responses against the four DENV serotypes are thought to be protective, subneutralizing Abs can contribute to increased disease severity upon secondary infection with a different DENV serotype. Understanding the breadth of the immune response in natural DENV infections and in vaccinees is crucial for determining the correlates of protection or disease severity. Transformation of B cell populations to generate mAbs and ELISPOT assays have been used to determine B cell and Ab specificity to DENV; however, both methods have technical limitations. We therefore modified the conventional ELISPOT to develop a Quad-Color FluoroSpot to provide a means of examining B cell/Ab serotype specificity and cross-reactivity on a single-cell basis. Abs secreted by B cells are captured by an Fc-specific Ab on a filter plate. Subsequently, standardized concentrations of all four DENV serotypes are added to allow equal stoichiometry for Ag binding. After washing, the spots, representing individual B cells, are visualized using four fluorescently labeled DENV serotype-specific detection mAbs. This method can be used to better understand the breadth and magnitude of B cell responses following primary and secondary DENV infection or vaccination and their role as immune correlates of protection from subsequent DENV infections. Furthermore, the Quad-Color FluoroSpot assay can be applied to other diseases caused by multiple pathogen serotypes in which determining the serotype or subtype-specific B cell response is important.","Hadjilaou, Alexandros; Green, Angela M; Coloma, Josefina; Harris, Eva",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1500918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26320246/,49
69246,How junior scientists can land a seat at the leadership table.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a recent development of minimally invasive surgery for colorectal disease. The literature comparing it against conventional laparoscopic colectomy remains limited. METHODS A retrospective case-cohort study compared the benefits and outcomes of SILS right hemicolectomy (SRH) with those of conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (LRH). The medical records of consecutive patients from a prospectively collected database were reviewed. Demographic data, operative details, recovery parameters, and details of resected specimens were obtained and analyzed in an intention-to-treat manner. RESULTS From January 2006 to March 2011, 104 elective LRHs (72 %) and 40 elective SRHs (28 %) were performed. The demographics for these two groups were comparable in terms of gender, age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiology score. As the records showed, 62 % of the LRHs and 57 % of the SRHs were performed for malignancies (p = 0.536). Seven of the LRH cases (7 %) were converted to open procedure, whereas two of the SILS cases (5 %) were converted. Three SILS cases (7 %) were completed with additional laparoscopic ports. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of wound length, mean operative time, lymph node clearance, or margins of resected specimen. The recovery parameters (pain score, hospital length of stay, and complications rate) also were equivalent between the two groups. CONCLUSION As a feasible and safe procedure with early postoperative outcomes equivalent to those for LRH, SRH is a suitable alternative. The possible advantages of SILS over conventional laparoscopic surgery may be validated only with randomized controlled trials in the future.","Chew, Min-Hoe; Chang, Mei-Huan; Tan, Wah-Siew; Wong, Mark Te-Ching; Tang, Choong-Leong",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2460-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806522/,49

This retrospective observational study aimed to develop an algorithm capable of detecting acute COPD exacerbations (AECOPD) in healthcare claims and estimate costs associated with AECOPD over a 12-month period. Commercial and Medicare Advantage healthcare plan members (≥40 years old) with evidence of COPD were identified from US healthcare-claims database. To refine the algorithm detecting AECOPD in claims data, sensitivity and positive-predictive value calculations were performed to compare AECOPD identification in healthcare claims versus medical charts. Analyses were also performed to examine total exacerbation-related costs for events identified with the new claims algorithm plus events missed. The final algorithm had a sensitivity of 84.9%, with a positive-predictive value of 67.5%. Medical records were abstracted for 402 patients. In the overall sample of healthcare claims (n = 243,998), the algorithm detected ≥1 AECOPD event in 61.3% of patients. The mean cost per patient during an AECOPD episode, identified by the final algorithm, was USD 6,760 (n = 301), with an incremental average cost of USD 607 (n = 122) to 'unobserved' episodes (not reported in claims data) among the chart sample. After multivariate modeling, predicted yearly exacerbation costs translated to USD 1.12 billion per 100,000 patients (USD 12,000 per patient), with 35.76 million associated with unobserved exacerbations. While the final algorithm warrants further validation and study, these findings highlight unobserved AECOPD and their economic burden.","Stanford, Richard H; Engel-Nitz, Nicole M; Bancroft, Timothy; Essoi, Breanna",COPD,https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2020.1817357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962447/,49

METHODS Paraffin-embedded sections of the temporal cortex, motor cortex, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and midbrain tectum from 1020 PSP and 199 CBD cases were assessed by phospho-tau immunohistochemistry. The severity of tau lesions (i.e., neurofibrillary tangle, coiled body, tufted astrocyte or astrocytic plaque, and tau threads) was semi-quantitatively scored in each region. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using tau pathology scores. A decision tree classifier was made by tau pathology scores using 914 cases. Cross-validation was done using 305 cases. An additional ten cases were used for a validation study. RESULTS Cluster analysis displayed two distinct clusters; the first cluster included only CBD, and the other cluster included all PSP and six CBD cases. We built a decision tree, which used only seven decision nodes. The scores of tau threads in the caudate nucleus were the most decisive factor for predicting CBD. In a cross-validation, 302 out of 305 cases were correctly diagnosed. In the pilot validation study, three investigators made a correct diagnosis in all cases using the decision tree. CONCLUSION Regardless of the morphology of astrocytic tau lesions, semi-quantitative tau pathology scores in select brain regions are sufficient to distinguish PSP and CBD.

70416,Hopes rise on coronavirus drug remdesivir.,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND Approximately 50% of Danish stroke patients did not arrive within the 4.5-hour revascularization window in 2018, and only 20% received acute revascularization therapy. Delay in seeking help was a major factor for missing the time window. This study explored patient-reported factors influencing the timing of a decision to seek help. METHODS We performed a qualitative interview study to explore prehospital help-seeking behavior. Inclusion was guided by a purposive sampling of stroke and transient ischemic attack patients and, if necessary, bystanders. Semistructured explorative interviews with 8 patients and 2 bystanders were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed via thematic analysis. RESULTS Analysis yielded 3 main themes: (1) symptom interpretation, (2) barriers and enablers to response, and (3) participant suggested optimization of acute stroke response and awareness. DISCUSSION Factors associated with prompt action to seek help were either a perception that the symptom indicated a serious illness or a strong emotional response. Patients with recurrent stroke failed to associate symptoms with a new stroke. Having a stroke in unfamiliar surroundings prompted delay in seeking help. Suggestions for optimization included targeted stroke campaigns. CONCLUSION Response to stroke onset may be driven by perceptions of symptom severity and emotional response rather than the ability to correctly identify symptoms. Stroke education should include the information that new stroke symptoms may be different from the old ones because different parts of the brain may be affected.","Amtoft, André C; Danielsen, Anne K; Hornnes, Nete; Kruuse, Christina",The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/jnn.0000000000000557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323718/,49

Their large-scale manufacturing has been mainly carried out using traditional chemical processes. Some of the chemical species involved in their production are considered hazardous and some industrial processes employing them categorised as ""having potential negative impact on the environment"". Biological surfactants have therefore been generally accepted worldwide as suitable sustainable greener alternatives. Biosurfactants exhibit the same functionalities of synthetic analogues while having the ability to synergize with other molecules improving performances; this strengthens the possibility of reaching different markets via innovative formulations. Recently, their use was suggested to help combat Covid-19. In this review, an analysis of recent bibliography is presented with descriptions, statistics, classifications, applications, advantages, and challenges; evincing the reasons why biosurfactants can be considered as the chemical specialities of the future.

72044,The burden of stigma.,2020-09-18,"The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out during the peak season of influenza in China. We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of influenza among Chinese adults during this special season. A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was performed by recruiting 4822 participants. There were 76.09% of the participants reporting that they learned more knowledge of influenza during the COVID-19 epidemic. The mean knowledge score of participants was 5.51 ± 1.55 (78.7% correct rate), and participants who received influenza vaccination in the past year scored the highest (6.06 ± 1.30, p< .001). Nearly half of the participants (49.63%) agreed the threat to the functioning of society by influenza was far less than the COVID-19. 73.04% of the participants knew influenza vaccination was the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, while 54.18% did not know the vaccination location. The proportion of participants who were willing to get vaccinated would increase from 62.53% to 85.82% if clinicians recommended the vaccination. For influenza-like illness, merely 36.11% of participants would seek medical care from the hospital, and 60.53% agreed or showed a neutral attitude toward antibiotic use for influenza treatment. Regression analyses showed that the medical profession and history of influenza vaccination were both associated with higher knowledge or attitude score and participants' use of face masks in previous seasons and their willingness to receive influenza vaccination. In conclusion, the awareness of influenza vaccination among adults in China should be reinforced and educational campaigns were warranted to increase the coverage of influenza vaccination.","Jiang, Minghuan; Feng, Liuxin; Wang, Weihua; Gong, Yilin; Ming, Wai-Kit; Hayat, Khezar; Li, Pengchao; Gillani, Ali Hassan; Yao, Xuelin; Fang, Yu",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1812312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222609/,49

We report the results of a national consensus conference process, promoted by the Italian College of Liver Transplant Surgeons (for the Italian Society for Organ Transplantation) and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver, to review the best indicators for orienting organ allocation policies based on principles of urgency, utility, and transplant benefit in the light of current scientific evidence. MELD exceptions and hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed to construct a transplantation priority algorithm, given the inequity of a purely MELD-based system for governing organ allocation. Working groups of transplant surgeons and hepatologists prepared a list of statements for each topic, scoring their quality of evidence and strength of recommendation using the Centers for Disease Control grading system. A jury of Italian transplant surgeons, hepatologists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists, representatives of patients' associations and organ-sharing organizations, transplant coordinators, and ethicists voted on and validated the proposed statements.

The objective of this study is to determine the annual number of influenza infections acquired by HCP as a result of occupational exposures to influenza patients in hospitals and emergency departments (EDs) in the United States. A risk analysis approach was taken. A compartmental model was used to estimate the influenza dose received in a single exposure, and a dose-response function applied to calculate the probability of infection. A three-step algorithm tabulated the total number of influenza infections based on: the total number of occupational exposures (tabulated in previous work), the total number of HCP with occupational exposures, and the probability of infection in an occupational exposure. Estimated influenza infections were highly dependent upon the dose-response function. Given current compliance with infection control precautions, we estimated 151,300 and 34,150 influenza infections annually with two dose-response functions (annual incidence proportions of 9.3% and 2.1%, respectively). Greater reductions in infectious were achieved by full compliance with vaccination and IC precautions than with patient isolation. The burden of occupationally-acquired influenza among HCP in hospitals and EDs in the United States is not trivial, and can be reduced through improved compliance with vaccination and preventive measures, including engineering and administrative controls.","Jones, Rachael M; Xia, Yulin",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697286/,49

STUDY DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. SETTING Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS Thirty volunteers were randomized in three groups [running (RG; n = 10), cycling (CG; n = 10) and control (CON; n = 10)] and were evaluated at baseline, post 24, 48 and 72 h of knee extensors' muscle damage protocol. CON performed passive recovery, while RG and CG performed active recovery immediately after the protocol, as well as 24 h and 48 h afterwards. MAIN OUTCOMES (i) maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC); (ii) delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS); (iii) plasma creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. RESULTS No group-by-time interaction was found in any outcome evaluated (p > 0.05). All groups presented decreases in MVIC and increases in DOMS (p < 0.001), without differences in CK and LDH. Compared with CON, exercise groups presented likely beneficial effects for LDH, while only CG had a likely beneficial effect for DOMS. Lastly, CG presented likely/very likely beneficial effects for MVIC and DOMS compared to RG. CONCLUSION Although the null hypothesis analysis did not find differences, the magnitude-based inference analysis suggested that moderate intensity cycling have likely beneficial effects on knee extensor muscle recovery after eccentric exercise protocol.","de Azevedo Franke, Rodrigo; Rodrigues, Rodrigo; Geremia, Jeam Marcel; Teixeira, Bruno Costa; Boeno, Francesco; Rabello, Rodrigo; Baroni, Bruno Manfredini; Lima, Cláudia Silveira",Physical therapy in sport : official journal of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ptsp.2021.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932873/,49

All patients submitted to gastric bypass either laparotomic or laparoscopic were included in a prospective protocol. In all radiological evaluation at 4(th) day after surgery was performed. The presence of a leak was evaluated according to the day of appearance, its location and its severity. Results of medical or surgical treatment were analyzed. From 1764 patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 60 had a postoperative leak (3.4%). This leak appeared early after surgery (before 4 days) in 20%. It was a localized subclinical leak in 20% and clinical - septic in 80%. There were 7 possible anatomic location of a leak, being the gastrojejunal anastomosis the most frequent location (53%) followed by gastric pouch. The highest mortality was associated to the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. Conservative treatment was employed in near 65% of the patients: The mean time of closure of a leak was 34 days. The appearance of a postoperative leak is a major and serious complication. It can be classified according to the day of appearance, its severity and its location.

75778,Design and biocompatibility of endovascular aneurysm filling devices.,2015,"This review article provides a comprehensive overview and classification of minimally invasive surgical instruments with an accessory channel incorporating fibreoptics or another auxiliary device for various purposes. More specifically, this review was performed with the focus on the newly emerging field of optical biopsy, its objective being to discuss primarily the instruments capable of carrying out the optical biopsy and subsequent tissue resection. Instruments housing the fibreoptics for other uses, as well as instruments with an accessory channel capable of housing the fibreoptics instead of their original auxiliary device after relevant design modifications, supplement the review. The entire Espacenet and Scopus databases were searched, yielding numerous patents and articles on conceptual and existing instruments satisfying the criteria. The instruments were categorised based on the function the fibreoptics or the auxiliary device serves. On the basis of their geometrical placement with respect to the tissue resector or manipulator, the subcategories were further defined. This subdivision was used to identify the feasibility of performing the optical biopsy and the tissue resection in an accurate and successive fashion. In general, the existing concepts or instruments are regarded as limited with regard to such a functionality, either due to the placement of their accessory channel with or without the fibreoptics or due to the operational restrictions of their tissue manipulators. A novel opto-mechanical biopsy harvester, currently under development at Delft University of Technology, is suggested as a promising alternative, ensuring a fast and accurate succession of the optical and the mechanical biopsies of a flat superficial tissue.","Jelínek, Filip; Arkenbout, Ewout A; Sakes, Aimée; Breedveld, Paul","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

75880,Safety and feasibility of radiofrequency ablation for treatment of Bosniak IV renal cysts.,2016,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study is to investigate whether two types of laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (Lap-SPDP) techniques are being implemented safely. The study compares the clinical outcomes from laparoscopic Warshaw operation (Lap-W) with those from laparoscopic splenic vessels preserving SPDP (Lap-SPDP-VP) and considers the role of those operations. METHODS On August 2013, the Warshaw technique was introduced to our institution and 17 patients with a lesion in the distal pancreas who underwent Lap-SPDP by December 2015 were enrolled. Six patients who underwent a Lap-W and 11 patients who underwent a Lap-SPDP-VP were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS In the Lap-W and Lap-SPDP-VP patients, the sizes of the tumors were 46.5±31.2 and 25.7±14.9 mm [Probability (P) value =0.0913)]; the operative times were 287 min (range, 225-369 min) and 280 min (range, 200-496 min); the blood loss was 95 mL (range, 50-200 mL) and 60 mL (range, 0-650 mL); the length of the postoperative hospital stay was 12 days (range, 8-43 days) and 11 days (range, 7-28 days); median follow-up was 19 months (range, 13-28 months) and 23 months (range, 6-28 months), respectively. There was no case of symptomatic spleen infarction in either group. However, partial infarctions of the spleen without symptoms were observed by computed tomography in three out of six cases (50%) in the Lap-W. No patient required reoperation and the postoperative mortality was zero in both groups. All patients were alive and recurrence-free at the end of the follow-up period. Collateral veins around the spleen developed in 83.3% (five out of six patients) in the Lap-W and developed in 12.5% (one out of eight patients) in the Lap-SPDP-VP. A significant difference was observed between groups (P=0.0256). Gastric varices developed in 33.3% (two out of six patients) in the Lap-W. However, no case of rupture of varices, or other late phase complications was observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS Both the Lap-W and Lap-SPDP-VP were found to be safe and effective, and in cases in which the detachment work of the splenic vessels from the tumor or the pancreatic parenchyma is difficult, performing Lap-W, rather than Lap-SPDP-VP, is considered appropriate. While Lap-SPDP is recommended for patients with benign or low grade malignant diseases, long-term follow-up to monitor hemodynamic changes in splenogastric circulation is considered needed.","Nakamura, Yoshiharu; Matsushita, Akira; Mizuguchi, Yoshiaki; Katsuno, Akira; Uchida, Eiji",Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.21037/tgh.2016.03.24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28138594/,49

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Outpatient clinic of a Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and research institute in an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Individuals with chronic (≥ 1 year from injury) SCI and uninjured individuals. OUTCOME MEASURES Serum antibody titers were determined by commercial multiplex ELISA. RESULTS Blood samples were collected from individuals with chronic SCI (N = 29, 83% males) and uninjured individuals (N = 25, 64% males). Among participants with SCI, the distribution of American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades was: A (n = 15), B (n = 2), C (n = 4), D (n = 8). Neurological levels of injury were: cervical (n = 17), thoracic (n = 10), and lumbar (n = 2). IgA levels were significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 1.98 vs. 1.21 mg/ml, P < 0.0001), with levels most elevated in individuals with motor complete injuries compared to uninjured participants (P < 0.0003). IgG2 antibodies were also significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 5.98 vs. 4.37 mg/ml, P < 0.018). CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of elevated IgA, the antibody type most prevalent at respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, common sites of infections in individuals with SCI. IgG2 levels were also elevated in individuals with SCI. These data support further investigations of IgA and other antibody types in individuals with chronic SCI, which may be increasingly important in the context of emerging novel infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.","Shnawa, Aya; Lee, Samuel; Papatheodorou, Angelos; Gibbs, Katie; Stein, Adam; Morrison, Debra; Bloom, Ona",The journal of spinal cord medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/10790268.2020.1854550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443466/,49

As COVID-19, takes thousands of lives all around the world, it seems that the medicinal resources would not be enough to supply billions of peoples, currently living on the planet earth. Thus, this pandemic and its subsequent impacts on the natural order of our life, would be one of the most important threats against the entire human race. Aims & Objective: Due to this, in this project, we have made attempts to find an operative approach for synthesizing this compound as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which showed it could be effective in inhibiting the newly emerged coronavirus. RESULTS The designed scheme uses relatively cheap precursors, and contains one pot stages, instead of seven time consuming, and more costly, linear steps. Also, it is tried to use safe and cheap solvents like water, and ethanol, instead of toxic ones like methanol, and pyridine which could cause rejection of the API in the organic volatile impurities (OVI) test of pharmacopeia analysis, as well as increasing the concern of inflammability, explosive, and carcinogenic properties of those common solvents. CONCLUSION The most important pharmaceutical analytical methods containing OVI test (mainly ethanol (about 171 ppm) much lower than the limits, by gas chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) instrument), Assay content (about 99.6% by potentiometric titration), and related purity analysis (by High performance liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet Detector (HPLC-UV)) (about 99.8%) were performed and described to give a more clear industrial scheme.","Dadras, Akbar; Rezvanfar, Mohammad Amin; Beheshti, Abolghasem; Naeimi, Sedigheh Sadat; Siadati, Seyyed Amir",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207324666210203175631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538665/,49

Previous studies demonstrated that race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) are not independently correlated with COVID-19 mortality. The purpose of our study is to determine the effect of race/ethnicity and SES on COVID-19 30-day mortality in a diverse, Philadelphian population. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study in a single center tertiary care hospital in Philadelphia, PA. The study includes adult patients hospitalized with polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed COVID-19 between March 1st , 2020 and June 6th , 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of COVID-19 death or hospice discharge within 30 days of discharge. The secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS The study included 426 patients. 16.7% died, 3.3% were discharged to hospice, and 20.0% were admitted to the ICU. Using multivariable analysis, race/ethnicity was not associated with the primary nor secondary outcome. In Model 4, age greater than 75 (Odds Ratio [OR], 11.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.96 to 61.97) and renal disease (OR 2.78; 95% CI, 1.31 to 5.90) were associated with higher odds of the composite primary outcome.

Effective management of these lesions remains unclear. In this report, a case with progressive edematous lesions in the subacute phase after neuroendovascular therapy was described, and the clinical features and therapeutic strategies were discussed. Case Description A 54-year-old female with a large, right cavernous internal carotid artery aneurysm was treated with a flow diverter. Left hemiparesis developed 15 days after the procedure, and multiple edematous lesions in areas of prior catheter procedures were revealed on radiological findings. Steroid pulse therapy was employed, and the lesions were gradually reduced without any additional neurological deficits. No recurrence was recognized in the follow-up study. Conclusion In some reports, pathological findings indicate that these lesions result from the presence of foreign bodies, and emboli could be caused by cotton fibers or hydrophilic polymers used as surface coatings on endovascular catheters. In this case, the edematous lesions were most likely caused by hydrophilic polymer emboli. Steroid pulse therapy had a beneficial effect on the lesions. It is important to effectively manage prescribed periods after the procedure to avoid such a rare complication.","Kuribara, Tomoyoshi; Haraguchi, Koichi; Ohtaki, Shunya; Shimizu, Tadakazu; Matsuura, Nobuki; Ogane, Kazumi; Maruo, Yasunori; Yokoyama, Noriyuki; Mikami, Takeshi; Itou, Takeo; Mikuni, Nobuhiro",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/sni.sni_152_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30210906/,49

Meningitis was excluded via lumbar puncture. Thoracic CT and abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of infection. Echocardiography showed reduced LVEF (50 %). A SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive. THERAPY AND COURSE #1: Antibiotic therapy as well as oral prednisolone didn't improve the clinical course. High-dose vasopressor therapy was necessary. The clinical condition improved only after adding hydrocortisone therapy. #2 Despite antibiotic therapy the clinical condition deteriorated. Because of insufficient effect of hydrocortisone, high-dose immunoglobulins were administered. Consequently, symptoms improved and LVEF normalized. CONCLUSIONS Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome presents as a chameleon of symptoms. In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rising numbers of cases in adults can be expected. In patients with fever, increased inflammation parameters and lack of other explanations, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome must be considered. Due to the potential severity of clinical courses and possible cardiac involvement, a therapy with hydrocortisone, ASS and immunoglobulins should be considered early.","Rieper, Karl; Sturm, Andreas",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1404-6763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706390/,49
79015,The tale of a mouse-lab mastermind.,2020-10-01,"This study examined the effects of pre-cooling duration on performance and neuromuscular function for self-paced intermittent-sprint shuttle running in the heat. Eight male, team-sport athletes completed two 35-min bouts of intermittent-sprint shuttle running separated by a 15-min recovery on three separate occasions (33°C, 34% relative humidity). Mixed-method pre-cooling was completed for 20 min (COOL20), 10-min (COOL10) or no cooling (CONT) and reapplied for 5-min mid-exercise. Performance was assessed via sprint times, percentage decline and shuttle-running distance covered. Maximal voluntary contractions (MVC), voluntary activation (VA) and evoked twitch properties were recorded pre- and post-intervention and mid- and post-exercise. Core temperature (T (c)), skin temperature, heart rate, capillary blood metabolites, sweat losses, perceptual exertion and thermal stress were monitored throughout. Venous blood draws pre- and post-exercise were analyzed for muscle damage and inflammation markers. Shuttle-running distances covered were increased 5.2 ± 3.3% following COOL20 (P < 0.05), with no differences observed between COOL10 and CONT (P > 0.05). COOL20 aided in the maintenance of mid- and post-exercise MVC (P < 0.05; d > 0.80), despite no conditional differences in VA (P > 0.05). Pre-exercise T (c) was reduced by 0.15 ± 0.13°C with COOL20 (P < 0.05; d > 1.10), and remained lower throughout both COOL20 and COOL10 compared to CONT (P < 0.05; d > 0.80). Pre-cooling reduced sweat losses by 0.4 ± 0.3 kg (P < 0.02; d > 1.15), with COOL20 0.2 ± 0.4 kg less than COOL10 (P = 0.19; d = 1.01). Increased pre-cooling duration lowered physiological demands during exercise heat stress and facilitated the maintenance of self-paced intermittent-sprint performance in the heat. Importantly, the dose-response interaction of pre-cooling and sustained neuromuscular responses may explain the improved exercise performance in hot conditions.","Minett, Geoffrey M; Duffield, Rob; Marino, Frank E; Portus, Marc",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-012-2348-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22350357/,49

79558,Central Pancreatectomy with Double Pancreaticojejunostomy.,2015,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Hemodialyzed patients (HD) demonstrate elevated oxidative stress (OXS) levels. Exercise effects on OXS response and antioxidant status of HD was investigated in the present study. METHODS Twelve HD and 12 healthy controls (HC) performed a graded exercise protocol. Blood samples, collected prior to and following exercise, were analyzed for lactate, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls (PC), reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. RESULTS HC demonstrated higher time-to-exhaustion (41%), lactate (41%) and VO2 peak (55%) levels. At rest, HD exhibited higher TBARS, PC, and catalase activity values and lower GSH, GSH/GSSG, TAC, and GPX levels. Although exercise elicited a marked change of OXS markers in both groups, these changes were more pronounced (p < 0.05) in HD patients. After adjusting for VO2 peak, differences between groups disappeared. VO2 peak was highly correlated with GSH/GSSG, TBARS, TAC and PC at rest and after exercise. CONCLUSIONS These results imply that HD demonstrate higher OXS levels and a lower antioxidant status than HC at rest and following exercise. Acute exercise appears to exacerbate OXS response in hemodialyzed patients probably due to diminished antioxidant defense. However, aerobic capacity level seems to be related to OXS responses in this population.","Fatouros, Ioannis G; Pasadakis, Ploumis; Sovatzidis, Apostolos; Chatzinikolaou, Athanasios; Panagoutsos, Stylianos; Sivridis, Dimitrios; Michailidis, Ioannis; Douroudos, Ioannis; Taxildaris, Kiriakos; Vargemezis, Vasilios",Nephron.

79805,Side effect worry grows for AstraZeneca vaccine.,2021-04-02,"This Position Paper from the Academy of Nutrition Sciences is the first in a series which describe the nature of the scientific evidence and frameworks that underpin nutrition recommendations for health. This first paper focuses on evidence which underpins dietary recommendations for prevention of non-communicable diseases. It considers methodological advances made in nutritional epidemiology and frameworks used by expert groups to support objective, rigorous and transparent translation of the evidence into dietary recommendations. The flexibility of these processes allows updating of recommendations as new evidence becomes available. For CVD and some cancers, the paper has highlighted the long-term consistency of a number of recommendations. The innate challenges in this complex area of science include those relating to dietary assessment, misreporting and the confounding of dietary associations due to changes in exposures over time. A large body of experimental data is available that has the potential to support epidemiological findings, but many of the studies have not been designed to allow their extrapolation to dietary recommendations for humans. Systematic criteria that would allow objective selection of these data based on rigour and relevance to human nutrition would significantly add to the translational value of this area of nutrition science. The Academy makes three recommendations: (i) the development of methodologies and criteria for selection of relevant experimental data, (ii) further development of innovative approaches for measuring human dietary intake and reducing confounding in long-term cohort studies and (iii) retention of national nutrition surveillance programmes needed for extrapolating global research findings to UK populations.","Williams, Christine M; Ashwell, Margaret; Prentice, Ann; Hickson, Mary; Stanner, Sara",The British journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114520005000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34515022/,49

DATA SOURCES Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and EuropePMC) were searched on January 6, 2021. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION A systematic review was conducted, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. The quality of individual trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool 2, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. DATA SYNTHESIS The collective search retrieved 3818 citations. Eight trials relating to 9 pharmacological interventions were identified. No evidence for nonpharmacological interventions was identified. Low certainty evidence of effectiveness in preventing severe disease was found for fluvoxamine (absolute difference: -8.7%; 95% CI: -1.8% to -16.4%) and bamlanivimab plus etesevimab (absolute difference: -4.9%; 95% CI: -0.8% to -8.9%). Both trials were limited by small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up. In addition, very low certainty evidence of effect was found for ivermectin plus doxycycline and sulodexide. Based on published data, insufficient evidence of effect was found for bamlanivimab (monotherapy), casirivimab plus imdevimab, ivermectin (monotherapy), nitazoxanide, and peginterferon lambda. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE This review assessed all ambulatory treatments for COVID-19 that may improve patient outcomes and reduce hospitalizations. CONCLUSION Recent trials have shown promising results for a number of pharmacological agents to treat COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting. However, larger, more robust trials are needed to support the routine use of these agents outside of monitored clinical trials.","O Murchu, Eamon; Spillane, Susan; Byrne, Paula; O'Neill, Michelle; Harrington, Patricia; Ryan, Máirín",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280211028242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157890/,49
80975,Carbon footprint of dermatologic surgery.,2020-12-05,"The proportion of the global population aged 65 and older is rapidly increasing. Infections in this age group, most recently with SARS-CoV-2, cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Major improvements have been made in vaccines for older people, either through the addition of novel adjuvants-as in the new recombinant zoster vaccine and an adjuvanted influenza vaccine-or by increasing antigen concentration, as in influenza vaccines. In this article we review improvements in immunization for the three most important vaccine preventable diseases of aging. The recombinant zoster vaccine has an efficacy of 90% that is minimally affected by the age of the person being vaccinated and persists for more than four years. Increasing antigen dose or inclusion of adjuvant has improved the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in older adults, although the relative effectiveness of the enhanced influenza vaccines and the durability of the immune response are the focus of ongoing clinical trials. Conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines have similar efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by vaccine serotypes in older adults. Their relative value varies by setting, depending on the prevalence of vaccine serotypes, largely related to conjugate vaccine coverage in children. Improved efficacy will increase public confidence and uptake of these vaccines. Co-administration of these vaccines is feasible and important for maximal uptake in older people. Development of new vaccine platforms has accelerated following the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, and will likely result in new vaccines against other pathogens in the future.","Cunningham, Anthony L; McIntyre, Peter; Subbarao, Kanta; Booy, Robert; Levin, Myron J",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619170/,49
81135,On-demand spin-state manipulation of single-photon emission from quantum dot integrated with metasurface.,2020-07-01,"Relatively little progress has been made in reducing anemia prevalence among women of reproductive age (WRA anemia). Interventions, policies and programs aimed at reducing WRA anemia have the potential to improve overall not only women's, but also children's health and nutrition outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first review that aimed to compile evidence on the determinants and drivers of WRA anemia reduction in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We synthesized the available evidence on the determinants and drivers, including government policies and programs, of WRA anemia and their mitigation strategies across a wide range of countries and geographies, thus contributing to the complex and multifactorial etiology of anemia. We carried out a systematic review of published peer-reviewed and grey literature assessing national or subnational decline in WRA anemia prevalence and the associated drivers in LMICs. Among the 21 studies meeting our inclusion criteria, proximal determinants of healthcare utilization, especially during pregnancy and with the use of contraceptives, were strong drivers of WRA anemia reduction. Changes in other maternal characteristics, such as an increase in age at first pregnancy, BMI, birth spacing, and reduction in parity, were associated with modest improvements in anemia prevalence. Access to fortified foods, especially iron-fortified flour, was also a predictor of a decrease in WRA anemia. Of the intermediate determinants, an increase in household wealth, educational attainment and access to improved sanitation contributed significantly to WRA anemia reduction. Although several common determinants emerged at the proximal and intermediate levels, the set of anemia determinants and the strength of the association between each driver and WRA anemia reduction were unique in each setting included in this review. Further research is needed to provide targeted recommendations for each country and region where WRA anemia prevalence remains high.","Owais, Aatekah; Merritt, Catherine; Lee, Christopher; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13082745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444903/,49

The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7% and 57.9%, respectively, and 59.7% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes.

82698,Academic paediatric surgery and work-life balance: Insights from Mexico.,2021-02-01,"Bio-substitute natural gas (or BioSNG) produced from gasification of waste fuels and subsequent methanation of the product gas could play a crucial role in the decarbonisation of heating and transportation, and could be a vital part of the energy mix in the coming decades. The BioSNG demonstration plant described in this paper seeks to prove the technical feasibility of the thermal gasification of waste to renewable gas, through a preliminary experimental programme to take an existing stream of syngas, methanate it and show that it can be upgraded to gas grid quality requirements. The syngas used in the project is a waste-derived syngas from a two-stage fluidised bed - plasma pilot facility, which is then converted and upgraded in a new, dedicated conversion and clean up plant. Extensive trials were undertaken on methanation and gas upgrading units for over 60 h of continuous operation. The fundamentals of a once-through methanation process train have been established on the demonstration facility and a model built to extend the analysis over different operational parameters. Over the trials, methane outputs of greater than 50 kWth output were routinely produced from three methanation reactors in series, with a total CO conversion exceeding 90% at pressures as low as atmospheric, in line with kinetic model predictions. Retention of CO2 as well as adequate partial pressure of H2O in the process stream was important for process control. The plant provided demonstration of the efficacy of a PSA system for separation of CO2 (99% removal efficiency) as well as the potential to remove a proportion of residual H2, N2 and CO, although this was associated with appreciable CH4 slip. The process can be optimized primarily by reducing inlet temperature to methanation reactors, controlling syngas composition and using adequate steam to carbon ratio, depending on the type of waste. This information can be used to inform the design and economics of subsequent planned commercial plants that could significantly increase the potential of renewable gas in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, providing a low cost route to low carbon heat and transport.","Materazzi, M; Taylor, R; Cozens, P; Manson-Whitton, C",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343808/,49

OBJECTIVES To investigate the timing of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) onset secondary to spinal cord injury without anticoagulant therapies. SETTING Spinal Cord Injury Center in Hokkaido, Japan. METHODS Between November 2012 and June 2013, patients with spinal cord injury who were admitted to our hospital within 1 day after the injury and treated surgically within 24 h underwent a neurological examination, leg vein ultrasonography and D-dimer test 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after surgery. All patients received treatment with intermittent pneumatic compression and elastic stockings, but without any anticoagulant. RESULTS DVT developed in 12 patients (11 men and 1 women), with a mean age of 62.2 years (range, 41-80 years; mean age of total sample, 63.2 years (range, 25-78 years)), all distal to the popliteal vein. DVT occurred more often with a more severe paralysis (66.3%, AIS A and B). The median (± standard error) length of time from the operation to DVT detection was 7.5±2.2 days. The mean D-dimer level upon DVT detection was 14.6±11.8 μg ml(-1), with no significant differences between those who developed DVT and those who did not at any of the time points. CONCLUSION These results suggest that DVT can develop at the very-acute stage of spinal cord injury and the incidence increases with a more severe paralysis. DVT detection was more reliable with ultrasonography, which should be used with DVT-preventive measures, beginning immediately after the injury, for the management of patients with spinal cord injury.","Matsumoto, S; Suda, K; Iimoto, S; Yasui, K; Komatsu, M; Ushiku, C; Takahata, M; Kobayashi, Y; Tojo, Y; Fujita, K; Minami, A",Spinal cord,https://doi.org/10.1038/sc.2015.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25644389/,49

METHODS Using a prospective database, we identified all patients who underwent robotic surgery performed by the Gynecologic Oncology service at 1 institution between December 2006 and March 2010. Records of patients with confirmed malignancy were reviewed for clinicopathological data and information about port-site metastasis. RESULTS One hundred eighty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 55.4 years (range, 19-82 years), and the median body mass index was 29.6 kg/m² (range, 17.9-70.7 kg/m²). Port-site metastases were detected in 2 patients (1.1%) at 3 weeks (patient 1) and 11 months (patient 2) after surgery. Patient 1 underwent surgery for an adnexal mass, and pathological examination revealed gallbladder adenocarcinoma metastatic to the ovary. She had a recurrence in the right lateral abdominal wall robotic trocar site with concurrent metastases in the gallbladder fossa and liver. Patient 2 was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of unclear (cervical vs endometrial) origin. Imaging showed metastases in pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. She underwent laparoscopy and was found intraoperatively to have gross disease on the right ovary. The patient underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy and chemoradiation. She had residual disease in the cervix and subsequently underwent robotic hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathological examination revealed endometrial cancer. She had a recurrence at the transumbilical trocar site concurrent with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and carcinomatosis. There were no cases of isolated port-site metastasis.

Thus, the last 59 laparoscopic resections were compared with the first 42 robotic resections. Results The duration of the procedure was longer in the robotic group, but the conversion rate was the same in both groups. There was no difference between groups in rates of overall and severe postoperative complications, reoperation, hospital length of stay, and readmission. Number of harvested lymph nodes and oncological quality of resection defined by the pathologist were the same. Conclusions This study suggests that the transition from the right laparoscopic colectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis to the robot-assisted right colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis when performed by a surgeon with experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery may not entail any increase on the morbidity rate or reduce the oncologic quality of the resection.","Gerbaud, Florent; Valverde, Alain; Danoussou, Divya; Goasguen, Nicolas; Oberlin, Olivier; Lupinacci, Renato Micelli",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2019.00044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31787837/,49

Extensive research focused on performing a safe anastomosis is conducted with rats being the most used model when examining colorectal anastomoses. In daily clinical practice resorbable sutures are used when hand-sewn anastomoses are performed. However, in the experimental studies examining colorectal anastomoses, non-resorbable sutures have predominantly been used. The aim of this study was to compare a rapidly resorbable suture with a non-resorbable suture in experimental colorectal anastomoses. METHODS This was an experimental, prospective, case-control study using forty male Wistar rats. A colonic anastomosis was performed in a standardized fashion with either rapidly resorbable or non-resorbable suture. On the seventh postoperative day, the animals were sacrificed and the breaking strength of the anastomoses was measured. RESULTS No suffering or poor wellbeing of the animals was registered. No animals died or were prematurely sacrificed. At tissue harvesting, no anastomotic leaks or signs of peritonitis were registered. The breaking strengths of the anastomoses were comparable in the two groups (median 2.175 (range 1.479-2.880) Newton vs. 2.267 (1.290-4.042) Newton (P = 0.256) for resorbable and non-resorbable sutures, respectively). We found no significant correlations between pre- to postoperative weight-loss and anastomotic strength. CONCLUSION Non-resorbable suture was comparable with rapidly resorbable suture with regards to breaking strength of an experimental colonic anastomosis. Thus, absorbable suture can be used in experimental studies which then more easily can be compared to clinical practice.","Klein, Mads; Pommergaard, Hans-Christian; Gögenur, Ismail; Rosenberg, Jacob",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2011.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338721/,49

Prone positioning improves mortality in severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, including COVID-19. While this is effective for intubated patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, it has also been shown to be beneficial for non-intubated patients. Critical care transport (CCT) has become an essential component of combating COVID-19, frequently transporting patients to receive advanced respiratory therapies and distribute patients in concert with available resources. With increasing awake proning, CCT teams may encounter patients supported in the prone position. Historically, transporting in the prone position has not been embraced due to substantial risks of desaturation during transport. In this case report, we describe the first known report of transporting a non-intubated, critically ill COVID-19 patient in the prone position.","Boomhower, James; Noland, Heidi E; Frakes, Michael A; Seethala, Raghu R; Cohen, Jason E; Wilcox, Susan R",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2020.1819492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886569/,49
86795,"Coronavirus can infect cats - dogs, not so much.",2020-04-01,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease associated with high mortality, and traditional Chinese medicine decoctions (TCMDs) have been widely used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in China; however, the impact of these decoctions on severe and critical COVID-19-related mortality has not been evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to address this gap. In this retrospective cohort study, we included inpatients diagnosed with severe/critical COVID-19 at the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University and grouped them depending on the recipience of TCMDs (TCMD and non-TCMD groups). We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis to adjust the imbalanced variables and treatments and used logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Among 282 patients with COVID-19 who were discharged or died, 186 patients (66.0%) received TCMD treatment (TCMD cohort) and 96 (34.0%) did not (non-TCMD cohort). After propensity score matching at a 1:1 ratio, 94 TCMD users were matched to 94 non-users, and there were no significant differences in baseline clinical variables between the two groups of patients. The all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the TCMD group than in the non-TCMD group, and this trend remained valid even after matching (21.3% [20/94] vs. 39.4% [37/94]). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that disease severity (odds ratio: 0.010; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.037; [Formula: see text] < 0.001) was associated with increased odds of death and that TCMD treatment significantly decreased the odds of in-hospital death (odds ratio: 0.115; 95% CI: 0.035, 0.383; [Formula: see text] < 0.001), which was related to the duration of TCMD treatment.

METHODS On the basis of those preventive instructions, questionnaires were drawn up to verify their implementation on site. The occupational risk prevention technicians of the Occupational Health Service (OHS) of the Institute of Public and Work Health of Navarre and those of the External Prevention Services (EPS), under the executive coordination of the OHS, visited the enterprises to advise, verify and require, if necessary, compliance with the instructions dictated. RESULTS The compliance of the preventive instructions is higher in the industrial sector than in the construction sector. Cleaning practices, hygienic resources and the provision of respiratory protection equipment are widespread. The application of necessary measures in common places (restrooms, dining rooms) are less frequent. There is a lack of informative posters and written corroboration of the preventive instructions. The difference of several results between the OHS and the EPS technicians is remarkable. CONCLUSIONS Weaknesses have been identified in achieving safe workplaces in the construction and industrial sectors during the de-escalation phase in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The role of Public Health in the enterprises and the integration of the prevention services in public policies against occupational risks must be reconsidered.","Moreno-Sueskun, Iñaki; Díaz-González, Jorge Alberto; Acuña Juanbeltz, Asier; Pérez-Murillo, Aingeru; Garasa Jiménez, Ana; García-Osés, Virginia; Extramiana Cameno, Estrella",Archivos de prevencion de riesgos laborales,https://doi.org/10.12961/aprl.2020.23.04.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33202120/,49

However, in 10-20% of patients, there are additional occlusions or stenotic lesions of the ipsilateral cervical internal carotid artery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of emergency carotid artery stent placement in combination with intracranial thrombectomy and the clinical outcome of the treated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed clinical and angiographic data of patients who underwent emergency cervical ICA stent placement and intracranial thrombectomy with stent-retriever devices in our institution between November 2009 and July 2012. Recanalization was assessed according to the Thrombolysis in Cerebral-Infarction score. Clinical outcome was evaluated at discharge (NIHSS) and after 3 months (mRS). RESULTS Overall, 24 patients were treated. The mean age was 67.2 years; mean occlusion time, 230.2 minutes. On admission, the median NIHSS score was 18. In all patients, the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score was zero before the procedure. Stent implantation was feasible in all cases. In 15 patients (62.5%), a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score ≥ 2b could be achieved. Six patients (25%) improved ≥10 NIHSS points between admission and discharge. After 90 days, the median mRS score was 3.0. Seven patients (29.2%) had a good clinical outcome (mRS 0-2), and 4 patients (16.6%) died, 1 due to fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Overall, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 4 patients (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS Emergency ICA stent implantation was technically feasible in all patients, and the intracranial recanalization Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of ≥2b was reached in a high number of patients. Clinical outcome and mortality seem to be acceptable for a cohort with severe stroke. However, a high rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in our study.","Stampfl, S; Ringleb, P A; Möhlenbruch, M; Hametner, C; Herweh, C; Pham, M; Bösel, J; Haehnel, S; Bendszus, M; Rohde, S",AJNR.

Although live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been used in livestock, and on a limited scale in humans, there is a need for improved anti-RVFV vaccines. Towards this goal, Sindbis virus replicon vectors expressing the RVFV Gn and Gc glycoproteins, as well as the non-structural nsM protein, were constructed and evaluated for their ability to induce protective immune responses against RVFV. These replicon vectors were shown to produce the RVFV glycoproteins to high levels in vitro and to induce systemic anti-RVFV antibody responses in immunized mice, as determined by RVFV-specific ELISA, fluorescent antibody tests, and demonstration of a neutralizing antibody response. Replicon vaccination also provided 100% protection against lethal RVFV challenge by either the intraperitoneal or intranasal route. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that the replicon vectors elicit RVFV-specific neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated sheep. These results suggest that alphavirus-based replicon vectors can induce protective immunity against RVFV, and that this approach merits further investigation into its potential utility as a RVFV vaccine.","Heise, M T; Whitmore, A; Thompson, J; Parsons, M; Grobbelaar, A A; Kemp, A; Paweska, J T; Madric, K; White, L J; Swanepoel, R; Burt, F J",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268808001696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19171081/,49

Past epidemiological experiences already showed the deep albeit heterogeneous psychological repercussions of pandemics. Nevertheless, little is known about COVID-19 outbreak and the possible strategies for boosting resilience in patients with chronic diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Therefore, we designed a study aiming to assess the changes in mental distress during COVID-19 outbreak in patients with MS and to identifyfactors contributing to resilience's development.We enrolled 106 patients (69 relapsing-remitting, 20 secondary-progressive, and 17 primary-progressive) whose neuropsychological assessment before the COVID-19 pandemic (1 January 2019-1 March 2020) was available. It consisted of Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and patient-reported MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ-P). All patients were re-tested during Italian lockdown through an online survey, comprehensive of sociodemographic information, HADS self-rating Scale, MSNQ-P Questionnaire and finally Connor-Davidson Resilience self-rating Scale (CD-RISC 25), in order to evaluate resilience.No significant changes in HADS and MSNQ-P scores were detected during COVID-19 pandemic in our population.

89016,Efficacy of series double continuous hemodiafiltration using two polymethyl methacrylate membrane hemofilters for patients with hypercytokinemia.,2014,"UNLABELLED Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging pathogen that causes severe disease in human. MERS-CoV is closely related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. Evasion of the innate antiviral response might contribute significantly to MERS-CoV pathogenesis, but the mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV 4a protein as a novel immunosuppressive factor that antagonizes type I interferon production. MERS-CoV 4a protein contains a double-stranded RNA-binding domain capable of interacting with poly(I · C). Expression of MERS-CoV 4a protein suppressed the interferon production induced by poly(I · C) or Sendai virus. RNA binding of MERS-CoV 4a protein was required for IFN antagonism, a property shared by 4a protein of bat coronavirus HKU5 but not by the counterpart in bat coronavirus HKU4. MERS-CoV 4a protein interacted with PACT in an RNA-dependent manner but not with RIG-I or MDA5. It inhibited PACT-induced activation of RIG-I and MDA5 but did not affect the activity of downstream effectors such as RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3. Taken together, our findings suggest a new mechanism through which MERS-CoV employs a viral double-stranded RNA-binding protein to circumvent the innate antiviral response by perturbing the function of cellular double-stranded RNA-binding protein PACT. PACT targeting might be a common strategy used by different viruses, including Ebola virus and herpes simplex virus 1, to counteract innate immunity. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging and highly lethal human pathogen. Why MERS-CoV causes severe disease in human is unclear, and one possibility is that MERS-CoV is particularly efficient in counteracting host immunity, including the sensing of virus invasion. It will therefore be critical to clarify how MERS-CoV cripples the host proteins that sense viruses and to compare MERS-CoV with its ancestral viruses in bats in the counteraction of virus sensing. This work not only provides a new understanding of the abilities of MERS-CoV and closely related bat viruses to subvert virus sensing but also might prove useful in revealing new strategies for the development of vaccines and antivirals.","Siu, Kam-Leung; Yeung, Man Lung; Kok, Kin-Hang; Yuen, Kit-San; Kew, Chun; Lui, Pak-Yin; Chan, Chi-Ping; Tse, Herman; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Jin, Dong-Yan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03649-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522921/,49

Cyano-acrylic glue Glubran®2 glue is commercially available and is generally used as embolizing agent and for the prevention of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. CASE DESCRIPTION A 25-year-old woman underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. After tumor resection, sellar floor reconstruction was performed by mucosal graft and Glubran®2 glue. The early post-operative period was uneventful. However, 2 months after surgery, the patient complained of headache, facial pain and greenish foul-smelling nasal discharge with solid particles dripping from the nose. Medical treatment was unsuccessful. Brain MRI showed inflammation and thickening of the sphenoidal and para-sphenoidal mucosa. The patient underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery and a solid glass-like mass surrounded by inflamed infected mucosa was seen in the inferior and lateral aspects of the sphenoid sinus. Efforts were made to erupt and de-crust the solid mass until total resection was achieved. Early post-operative period was uneventful, and a course of antibiotics was continued until total disappearance of the discharge. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting of acrylic glue (Glubran®2)-related sinusitis. Surgeon should be aware about similar side effects for the glue material that would complicate the surgery.","Bani-Ata, Majid; Alzoubi, Firas; Abuzayed, Bashar; Alhowary, Ala A A; Aleshawi, Abdelwahab J",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-020-00866-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938449/,49

We examined the association of acid-base blood values (pH) with patient outcomes and calculated the pH test performance to predict prognosis. METHODS This was a post-hoc analysis of data from the Continuous Chest Compression Trial, which enrolled non-traumatic adult emergency medical system-treated OHCA in Canada and the United States. We examined cases who survived a minimum of 24 hours post hospital arrival. The independent variables of interest were initial pH, final pH, and the change in pH (δpH). The primary outcome was neurological status at hospital discharge, with favorable status defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 3. We reported adjusted odds ratios for favorable neurological outcome using multivariable logistic regression models. We calculated the test performance of increasing pH thresholds in 0.1 increments to predict unfavorable neurological status (defined as mRS >3) at hospital discharge. RESULTS We included 4189 patients. 32% survived to hospital discharge with favorable neurological status. In the adjusted analysis, higher initial pH (OR 6.82; 95% CI 3.71-12.52) and higher final pH (OR 7.99; 95% CI 3.26-19.62) were associated with higher odds of favorable neurological status. pH thresholds with highest positive predictive values were initial pH < 6.8 (92.5%; 95% CI 86.2%-98.8%) and final pH < 7.0 (100%; 95% CI 95.2%-100%). CONCLUSION In patients with OHCA, pH values were associated with patients' subsequent neurological status at hospital discharge. Final pH may be clinically useful to predict unfavorable neurological status at hospital discharge.","Al Assil, Rahaf; Singer, Joel; Heidet, Matthieu; Fordyce, Christopher B; Scheuermeyer, Frank; Diepen, Sean van; Sekhon, Mypinder; Leung, K H Benjamin; Stenstrom, Rob; Christenson, Jim; Grunau, Brian",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.12.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385471/,49

This study investigated the clinical and pathologic findings in 22 cats with FNV. In affected cats, ophthalmoscopy of the fundus (when visible) revealed avascular peripheral retinae and epiretinal vascular membranes. Frequent nonspecific clinical findings were buphthalmos ( n = 21), medically uncontrollable glaucoma ( n = 22), and lenticular abnormalities ( n = 13). Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) was detected clinically in affected cats ( n = 6). The fellow eye was affected in 11 of 18 cats to a variable degree or appeared clinically normal in 7 of 18 cats. The globes were examined histologically and using immunohistochemistry for vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synaptophysin, neurofilament, laminin, factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RA), and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Histologically, diagnostic features included laminin-positive epiretinal vascular membranes affecting the central retina, with an avascular peripheral retina and gliosis. Enucleated globes exhibited multiple additional abnormalities, including corneal disease ( n = 15), anterior segment dysgenesis ( n = 21), lymphoplasmacytic anterior uveitis ( n = 19), peripheral anterior synechiae ( n = 20), retinal degeneration ( n = 22), and retinal detachment ( n = 19). Gliotic retinae labeled strongly for GFAP and vimentin with reduced expression of synaptophysin and neurofilament, consistent with degeneration or lack of differentiation. While an avascular peripheral retina and epiretinal fibrovascular membranes are also salient features of retinopathy of prematurity, there is no evidence to support hyperoxic damage in cats with FNV.

90471,"Development of a minimally invasive, injectable, shape memory suture and delivery system.",2012,"BACKGROUND The primary goal of fluid therapy is to maintain fluid homeostasis. Commonly used isotonic crystalloids are only marginally effective and contribute to fluid excess syndrome. In patients with decreased cardiovascular reserve, fluid therapy alone is not sufficient to maintain end-organ perfusion. Therefore, inotropes or vasoactive drugs are used to supplement fluid infusion. Recent animal data suggest that coinfusion of adrenergic agents modulate the distribution of fluid between the vascular and extravascular/interstitial compartments after a fluid bolus. We sought to determine if this effect would translate in humans by coadministering a β-adrenergic agonist with fluid. METHODS Nine healthy volunteers (aged 21-50 years) were randomly paired and received either a continuous isoproterenol infusion (ISO: 0.05 μg/kg per minute) or 0.9% saline (control [CON]) 30min prior to a 25 mL/kg 0.9% NaCl fluid bolus. Hemodynamics, ventricular volume and function, and microcirculatory determinants (capillary filtration coefficient and oncotic pressure) were measured. Vascular and extravascular volume and fluid balance were determined. RESULTS Compared with CON, ISO significantly increased heart rate (CON: 64.2 ± 4.1 beats/min vs. ISO: 97.4 ± 5.7 beats/min) and cardiac output (CON: 4.4 ± 0.7 L/min vs. ISO: 10.2 ± 0.9) before fluid bolus. Isoproterenol significantly increased urinary output (ISO: 10.86 ± 1.95 vs. control: 6.53 ± 1.45 mL/kg) and reduced extravascular volume (7.98 ± 2.0 vs. 14.15 ± 1.1mL/kg). Isoproterenol prevented an increase in capillary filtration coefficient (1.74 ± 0.4 vs. 3.21 ± 0.4 mL/min per mmHg · 10). CONCLUSIONS Isoproterenol, a nonselective β-adrenergic agonist, augments vascular volume expansion and eliminates extravascular volume via enhanced diuresis, which may in part be due to enhanced endothelial barrier function.","Asmussen, Sven; Salter, Michael; Prough, Donald S; Kramer, George C; Svensen, Christer; Sheffield-Moore, Melinda; Kinsky, Michael P",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000000233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046539/,49

The models are denoted SIR-[Formula: see text] and SEIR-[Formula: see text], and we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive the expressions for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the expected degree of the infectious nodes [Formula: see text] using two different approximation approaches. The first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic simulations of SIR-[Formula: see text] and SEIR-[Formula: see text] epidemics on Poisson and scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches predict the same epidemic threshold and the same [Formula: see text] for both types of epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold, pairwise models overestimate the value of [Formula: see text] computed from simulations, which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with [Formula: see text] (perhaps unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement with simulations.","Britton, Tom; Juher, David; Saldaña, Joan",Bulletin of mathematical biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-016-0227-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27800576/,49
90715,Current pharmacotherapy of overactive bladder.,2021-05-10,"INTRODUCTION There is a paucity of medical literature regarding the efficacy of lock solutions in preventing catheter thrombosis. Traditionally, heparin has been used as the anticoagulant of choice for catheter locking, but it has many adverse effects associated with its use. Sodium citrate 4% is an attractive alternative to heparin. METHODS Our plasmapheresis unit converted to locking all central venous catheters with sodium citrate 4% in place of heparin 100 units/mL in May 2010. We conducted a 2-year period retrospective observational cohort study comparing the outcomes of using heparin versus citrate locks. Outcomes examined were catheter patency, catheter exchanges, alteplase usage, and catheter infections. RESULTS During the study period, 84 patients who underwent a total of 554 plasmapheresis treatments were identified. Flow problems among the citrate treatments were more frequent than those among the heparin group (6.5% vs. 3.2%, P = 0.11, n = 554) but this did not reach statistical significance. The frequency of more severe flow problems requiring catheter exchange or alteplase infusion was higher among the citrate group than the heparin group (3.2% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.11, n = 554). Subgroup analysis, stratified by diagnosis, demonstrated that there was a statistically significant difference in flow problems when comparing myasthenia gravis (MG) patients to non-MG patients.

METHODS We conducted a descriptive and a case-control study. Medical records of neonates with modified Bell stage ≥ IB NEC and matched controls were reviewed, in addition to microbiological and environmental investigation. Study variables included maternal/delivery and neonatal factors, medications, procedures and feeding practices. Univariable/multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for all and for stage ≥ II cases. RESULTS Out of 1841 late preterm and term neonates, 10 stage IB and 10 stage ≥ II [mean(SD) birthweight 2529.3 (493.04) g, gestational age 36.96 (1.48) weeks] presented with NEC symptomatology at mean 4.6 (range 2-8) days. Nearly all (19/20) resulted from high-risk pregnancies and received postpartum intermediate care. All were exclusively or partly formula fed. Most (14/20) were born by cesarean delivery. Eight underwent surgery, with no fatality. Intermediate care (p = 0.006), transient tachypnea (p = 0.049), not receiving breast milk (p = 0.019) and in addition intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (p = 0.017) for stage ≥ II cases were independently associated with NEC. CONCLUSIONS Late preterm and term neonates in need of intermediate care, with IUGR and transient tachypnea were susceptible to NEC; feeding with breast milk was an important protective factor.","Sdona, Emmanouela; Papamichail, Dimitrios; Panagiotopoulos, Takis; Lagiou, Pagona; Malamitsi-Puchner, Ariadne","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2015.1125461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26607266/,49

91413,Five science stars making their mark in China.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Recent health care policy making has highlighted the necessity for understanding factors that influence readmission. To elucidate the rate, reason, and predictors of readmissions in neurosurgical patients, we analyzed unscheduled readmissions to our neurosurgical department after treatment for cranial or cerebral lesions. METHODS From 2015 to 2017, all adult patients who had been discharged from our Department of Neurosurgery and were readmitted within 30 days were included into the study cohort. The patients were divided into a surgical and a non-surgical group. The main outcome measure was unplanned inpatient admission within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS During the observation period, 183 (7.4%) of 2486 patients had to be readmitted unexpectedly within 30 days after discharge. The main readmission causes were surgical site infection (34.4 %) and seizure (16.4%) in the surgical group, compared to natural progression of the original diagnosis (38.2%) in the non-surgical group. Most important predictors for an unplanned readmission were younger age, presence of malignoma (OR: 2.44), and presence of cardiovascular side diagnoses in the surgical group. In the non-surgical group, predictors were length of stay (OR: 1.07) and the need for intensive care (OR: 5.79). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that reasons for readmission vary between operated and non-operated patients and are preventable in large numbers. In addition, we identified treatment-related partly modifiable factors as predictors of unplanned readmission in the non-surgical group, while unmodifiable patient-related factors predominated in the surgical group. Further patient-related risk adjustment models are needed to establish an individualized preventive strategy in order to reduce unplanned readmissions.","Sander, Caroline; Oppermann, Henry; Nestler, Ulf; Sander, Katharina; von Dercks, Nikolaus; Meixensberger, Jürgen",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04521-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803369/,49

91685,Learning gene regulatory networks using gaussian process emulator and graphical LASSO.,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND The relationship between the increases in pulse pressure (PP) and arterial stiffness determined by aging or systemic hypertension has been widely reported. These findings are supported by large-cohort analysis conducted in well-known populations, such as the Framingham Study. However, there is evidence that an age-PP curvilinear relationship may exist in hypertensive subjects. This study aimed to evaluate the age-related change in pulse pressure and arterial stiffness in a population-based study. METHODS Carotid femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (cfPWV) were obtained in 2075 subjects. RESULTS Age-related changes of PP showed a curvilinear relationship (R=0.39, p<0.0001) in normotensive subjects, with a nadir at around 50 years of age. On the other hand, the age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.72, p<0.0001). PP also showed a curvilinear relationship with age (R=0.36, p<0.0001) in hypertensive subjects, with a nadir around 50 years of age. The age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.55, p<0.0001). Similar results were observed in the adult population (age≥16 years). Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, cfPWV, and mean arterial pressure are determinants of PP values in the entire population; however, this result is not uniform when the different subgroups are analyse. CONCLUSION In conclusion, age-related changes in PP showed a curvilinear relationship and no parallelism with the age-cfPWV relationship for both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The determinants of PP impact it differently depending on age and the pathological condition of the subject.","Díaz, Alejandro; Pascaner, Ariel; Wray, Sandra; Fischer, Edmundo Cabrera",Current hypertension reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573402116999201210195123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305707/,49

DESIGN/METHODS Daily data were collected from 134 participants with 71 having 14 consecutive days' data. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and General Linear Model (GLM) were used to examine the primary tests. RESULTS Overall, positive and negative emotions declined significantly during the surveyed period. Meanwhile, differences were observed in the level of positive, depressed, and negative emotions and/or patterns of change among different population categories. The personal response of worrying about work and life was positively related to depressed and negative emotions at baseline, but was negatively related to the development of both depressed and negative emotions over time. Among life activities, family stressor was a significant predictor for both depressed and negative emotions while social support predicted positive emotions. Moreover, health & hygiene activity was positively related to positive emotions at baseline. CONCLUSIONS The results provide scientific evidence for public health policymakers on quarantine policies and inform the general public about quarantine life. They highlight the importance of addressing the needs of vulnerable groups (parents with young children, divorcees, clinicians) during the pandemic, and demonstrate the benefits of promoting healthcare and hygiene activity, having a sense of worry and access to social support.","Ma, Shaozhuang; Zeng, Weilong; Borges, Andreia; Xu, Yiqing; Zhang, Jinrui",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1934470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121542/,49
92669,Foramen epiploicum mesh closure (FEMC) through a ventral midline laparotomy.,2018,"Fusion of the influenza A H1N1 virus envelope with the endosomal membrane at low pH allows the intracellular delivery of the viral genome and plays an essential role in the infection process. Low pH induces an irreversible modification of the virus envelope, which has so far resisted 3D structural analysis, partly due to the virus pleiomorphy. This study showed that atomic force microscopy (AFM) in physiological buffer could be used to image the structural details of the virus envelope, both at neutral pH and after a low-pH treatment. At low and intermediate magnification, AFM of control virions confirmed both the pleiomorphy and the existence of zones devoid of glycoprotein spikes at the virus surface, as established by electron microscopy (EM). At higher magnification, the unique vertical resolution of the AFM in 3D topography demonstrated the lateral heterogeneity in spike distribution and strongly suggested that, at least locally, the spikes can be organized in an irregular honeycomb pattern. The surface honeycomb pattern was more easily detected due to an increase in spike height following low-pH treatment at low temperature, which probably prevented disruption of the organization. This enhanced contrast associated with low-pH treatment emphasized differences in the glycoprotein distribution between virions. It was concluded that, together with EM approaches, AFM may help to establish a correlation between surface structure and influenza virus infectivity/pathogenicity.","Giocondi, Marie-Cécile; Ronzon, Fréderic; Nicolai, Marie Claire; Dosset, Patrice; Milhiet, Pierre-Emmanuel; Chevalier, Michel; Le Grimellec, Christian",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.015156-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828755/,49

In terms of clinical manifestations, although it starts as an acute respiratory disorder, it could eventually lead to death by causing damage to many organs such as: lung, liver, kidney and heart. It has been shown that COVID-19 pathology is mediated by an excessive inflammation, oxidation and an aggravated immune response. Vitamin D is a an immunomodulator hormone and has receptors in many tissues and organs. In many studies, vitamin D was shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, since COVID-19 infection causes a cytokine storm, vitamin D can have a protective effect on many tissues and organs by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D has a high safety profile, and thus could be beneficial against multiple organ damage in COVID-19 patients.

The VP2 gene from WU virus (WUV)-positive samples was sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS Of the 459 hospitalized RTI patients, 18 (3.9%) patients were positive for WUV infection. WUV infection was common among children aged ≤11 years (9 patients, 50%). Among the 18 WUV-infected hospitalized patients, viral co-infection was detected in 9 patients (50%). The most common viruses associated with mixed infection were respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus (2 patients, 11.1% each). Of the 18 WUV-infected patients, 4 were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The circulating strains belong to type Ia and IIIb.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Three young male patients (mean age 15.6 years) complaining with PWS were treated by MGB with the aim to improve morbid obesity associated with the syndrome. Preoperative body mass index was 51 ± 4.13 kg/m(2). Two patients suffered from both hypertension and frequent sleep apnea crises. The mean preoperative level of fasting plasma acyl ghrelin was 1417.26 ± 289.37 pg/ml. All patients underwent a laparoscopic MGB. RESULTS The postoperative period was uneventful and all patients were discharged on the fifth postoperative day. The patients suffering from both hypertension and respiratory crises are now free from receiving any therapeutic support. When measured, the postoperative level of fasting plasma acyl ghrelin decreased to 675.5, 524.6, and 353.1 pg/ml, respectively. An excess weight loss of 79% has been recorded at two years so far. To date, no nutritional impairment, weight regain, or need for revision surgery has been recorded. CONCLUSION MGB appears to provide an effective weight reduction in patients suffering from PWS without determining significant nutritional impairment or weight regain.

However, there are concerns around the use of this technology, including social/ethical implications, low rate of utilisation and its cost-effectiveness. The same societal trends have also resulted in an increased demand and unmet need for donor oocytes, with many women choosing to travel overseas for treatment. This has its own inherent social, medical, financial and psychological sequelae. We propose a possible pathway to address these dual realities. The donation of oocytes originally stored in the context of AGE banking, with appropriate compensatory mechanisms, would ameliorate AGE banking concerns, while simultaneously improving the supply of donor oocytes. This proposed arrangement will result in tangible benefits for prospective donors, recipients and society at large.","Polyakov, Alex; Rozen, Genia",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402431/,49

Superspreading can arise through variation in contacts, infectiousness or infectious periods. The latter has received little attention, yet it drives the dynamics of many diseases of critical public health, livestock health and conservation concern. Here, we present rare evidence of variation in infectious periods underlying a superspreading phenomenon in a free-ranging wildlife system. We detected persistent infections of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, the primary causative agent of pneumonia in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), in a small number of older individuals that were homozygous at an immunologically relevant genetic locus. Interactions among age-structure, genetic composition and infectious periods may drive feedbacks in disease dynamics that determine the magnitude of population response to infection. Accordingly, variation in initial conditions may explain divergent population responses to infection that range from recovery to catastrophic decline and extirpation.","Plowright, Raina K; Manlove, Kezia R; Besser, Thomas E; Páez, David J; Andrews, Kimberly R; Matthews, Patrick E; Waits, Lisette P; Hudson, Peter J; Cassirer, E Frances",Ecology letters,https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871636/,49

Preliminary data suggest that the efficacy of rTMS is reduced in patients taking benzodiazepines (BZD). Here, we use real-world data from a large sample to investigate the influence of lorazepam on the effectiveness of rTMS. METHODS From a retrospective cohort of clinically depressed patients that were treated with rTMS, we compared 176 patients not taking any BZD with 73 patients taking lorazepam with respect to changes in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS). RESULTS Both groups improved during rTMS according to HRDS scores, but the amelioration of symptoms was significantly less pronounced in patients taking lorazepam (18% vs. 38% responders in the non-lorazepam group). We could not see any association of intake regimen of lorazepam with response in rTMS. CONCLUSION Our observational study suggests that intake of lorazepam impedes the response to rTMS. The impact of lorazepam and other BZD on rTMS should receive more attention and be further investigated in prospective, hypothesis-based treatment studies to determine causal relationships between medication treatments and outcome. This could lead to specific recommendations for pharmacological treatment for depressed patients undergoing rTMS.","Deppe, M; Abdelnaim, M; Hebel, T; Kreuzer, P M; Poeppl, T B; Langguth, B; Schecklmann, M",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01160-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648109/,49

We discuss a widely generalizable and in-depth protocol intended to safely allow the restart of elective procedures in 2 dedicated ophthalmic ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) using monitored anesthesia care. METHODS A single-center review of protocols and practices designed to limit COVID-19 transmission. RESULTS All patients were tested within 72 hours prior to the procedure with a COVID-19 nasal swab to assess for active disease. A distance of 6 ft between each stretcher and the staff within the ASC was maintained when possible. Preoperative anesthetizing and dilating eye drops were administered from multiuse bottles without contact with surfaces. Surgical cases were restarted at a reduced capacity of a maximum of 7 per day to distance patient arrivals. Removal of waiting room chairs and the creation of new break areas allowed for social distancing.

Its collateral fallout on head injury care has not been studied in detail, especially from low- and middle-income countries, possibly overwhelmed more than developed nations. Here, we analyze the effects of COVID19 restrictions on head injury patients in a high-volume Indian referral trauma center. METHODS From the prospective trauma registry, clinico-epidemiological and radiological parameters of patients managed during 190 days before and 190 days during COVID19 phases were studied. As an indicator of care, the inpatient mortality of patients with severe HI was also compared with appropriate statistical analyses. RESULTS Of the total 3372 patients, there were 83 head injury admissions per week before COVID19 restrictions, which decreased to 33 every week (60% drop) during the lock phases and stabilized at 46 per week during the unlock phases. COVID19 restrictions caused a significant increase in the proportion of patients arriving directly without resuscitation at peripheral centers and later than 6 h of injury. Though the most common mechanism was vehicular, a relative increase in the proportion of assaults was noted during COVID19. There was no change in the distribution of mild, moderate, and severe injuries. Despite a decrease in the percentage of patients with systemic illnesses, severe head injury mortality was significantly more during the lock phases than before COVID19 (59% vs. 47%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS COVID19 restrictions have amplified the already delayed admission among patients of head injury from north-west India. The severe head injury mortality was significantly greater during lock phases than before COVID19, highlighting the collateral fallout of lockdown.

The prevalence and burden of severe COPD exacerbations remain high, despite recognition of the importance of exacerbation prevention and the availability of new treatment options. Severe COPD exacerbations are associated with high mortality, have negative impact on quality of life, are linked to cardiovascular complications, and are a significant burden on the health-care system. This review identified risk factors that contribute to the development of severe exacerbations, treatment options (bronchodilators, antibiotics, corticosteroids [CSs], oxygen therapy, and ventilator support) to manage severe exacerbations, and strategies to prevent readmission to hospital. Risk factors that are amenable to change have been highlighted. A number of bronchodilators have demonstrated successful reduction in risk of severe exacerbations, including long-acting muscarinic antagonist or long-acting β2-agonist mono- or combination therapies, in addition to vaccination, mucolytic and antibiotic therapy, and nonpharmacological interventions, such as pulmonary rehabilitation. Recognition of the importance of severe exacerbations is an essential step in improving outcomes for patients with COPD. Evidence-based approaches to prevent and manage severe exacerbations should be implemented as part of targeted strategies for disease management.","Halpin, David Mg; Miravitlles, Marc; Metzdorf, Norbert; Celli, Bartolomé",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s139470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29062228/,49

METHODS Fifteen participants were recruited from COVID-19 testing tents in the Capital Region of Denmark in March and April 2020. A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach inspired by Ricoeur's theory of interpretation was used. RESULTS The analysis revealed five themes. (1) The participants' experiences of awaiting a COVID-19 test result illuminated concerns related to infecting others rather than their own health. Experiences of guilt for not taking all possible precautions to avoid the spread of COVID-19 were described and thoughts of potentially having exposed others bothered the participants. (2) The test result would guide their precautions and therefore regulate behaviour at home and in society. (3) Even though the participants did not take all possible precautions they made some changes in their everyday lives. (4) Leaving the individual with the responsibility for taking precautions based on their subjective experiences created feelings of insecurity and uncertainty. (5) Being met by health professionals was an experience that meant for the particpants that behaviour towards limiting the infection became very clear. The seriousness experienced around the test situation facilitated this attitude and behaviour in the participants. Conclusion: This study illuminated how testing for COVID-19 regulates behavior in the general population. The testing was both important for the individual's cautious behavior towards other people, work and in getting around in society but also a way to regulate behavior from a societal perspective to quicken suppression and avoid transmission of COVID-19.","Christensen, Signe Westh; Dagyaran, Ilkay; Bernild, Camilla; Missel, Malene; Berg, Selina Kikkenborg",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494821993717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722145/,49

99691,Fast-spreading COVID variant can elude immune responses.,2021-01-21,"Background Currently, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). Despite the seriousness of this problem, limited evidence is available on the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, there were no updated studies that estimate the national prevalence of DPN. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis provided a national prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. Methods This study was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in March 2020 and accepted with the registration number CRD42020173831. Different database searching engines were searched online to retrieve related articles, including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, African Journals Online, World Health Organization (WHO) Afro Library, and Cochrane Review. The reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline in the reviewing process. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all published and unpublished articles were analyzed. The reviewers used the random effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes mellitus patients. The reviewers conducted the statistical analysis using the R version 3.5.3 and RStudio version 1.2.5033 software for Windows. The reviewers evaluated the heterogeneity across the included studies by the inconsistency index (I 2). The reviewers examined the publication bias by the funnel plot. Results The search of the databases produced 245 papers. After checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 38 articles with 14029 total patients with diabetes mellitus were found suitable for the review. Except for three (retrospective cohort study), all studies were cross-sectional. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 22% (95% CI 18% to 26%). The subgroup analysis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes in the different regions was 23% (95% CI 17% to 29%) in Addis Ababa, 27% (95% CI 16% to 38%) in Oromia, 16% (95% CI 14% to 18%) in South nation and nationalities, and 15% (95% CI 6% to 24%) in Amhara. Conclusions More than one-fifth of patients with diabetes have diabetic peripheral neuropathy. According to this study, the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Ethiopia is considerably high. This evidence suggests that attention should be given to patients with diabetes in monitoring patients' blood glucose.","Tadesse, Degena Bahrey; Gebrewahd, Gebremeskel Tukue; Hailay, Abrha; Aberhe, Woldu; Mebrahtom, Guesh; Zereabruk, Kidane; Gebreayezgi, Guesh; Mariye, Teklewoini; Haile, Teklehaimanot Gereziher; Gebremeskel, Gebreamlak Gebremedhn; Demoz, Gebre Teklemariam",Journal of diabetes research,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5304124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33628833/,49
99926,Nucleolar maturation of the human small subunit processome.,2021-09-10,"The replication/transcription complex of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is composed of at least 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) encoded by the ORF-1a/1b. This complex includes replication enzymes commonly found in positive-strand RNA viruses, but also a set of RNA-processing activities unique to some nidoviruses. The nsp14 protein carries both exoribonuclease (ExoN) and (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. The nsp14 ExoN activity ensures a yet-uncharacterized function in the virus life cycle and must be regulated to avoid nonspecific RNA degradation. In this work, we show that the association of nsp10 with nsp14 stimulates >35-fold the ExoN activity of the latter while playing no effect on N7-MTase activity. Nsp10 mutants unable to interact with nsp14 are not proficient for ExoN activation. The nsp10/nsp14 complex hydrolyzes double-stranded RNA in a 3' to 5' direction as well as a single mismatched nucleotide at the 3'-end mimicking an erroneous replication product. In contrast, di-, tri-, and longer unpaired ribonucleotide stretches, as well as 3'-modified RNAs, resist nsp10/nsp14-mediated excision. In addition to the activation of nsp16-mediated 2'-O-MTase activity, nsp10 also activates nsp14 in an RNA processing function potentially connected to a replicative mismatch repair mechanism.","Bouvet, Mickaël; Imbert, Isabelle; Subissi, Lorenzo; Gluais, Laure; Canard, Bruno; Decroly, Etienne",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1201130109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22635272/,49

Using descriptive statistics, logistic regression models, and graphic displays, the correlates of self-reporting an impairment and patterns of help-seeking strategies are examined. Nearly 13% (n = 117) of those who had ever tried to conceive reported experiencing a fertility impairment. Age was positively associated with reporting an impairment, while there was a negative association with education and with parity. Of women who reported an impairment, 85.5% sought help. Visiting a hospital or clinic was the most common response, followed closely by going to a traditional healer. Around one-quarter employed multiple help-seeking strategies, highlighting the need for various help-seeking behaviours to be viewed in tandem rather than in isolation.","Fledderjohann, Jasmine",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1965179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376104/,49

Advanced support included hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, or mechanical ventilation, for children aged 0-17 years hospitalised in Maryland's 50 acute-care hospitals over 12 influenza seasons. Weekly numbers of positive influenza tests in the Maryland area defined IOP for each season as the fewest consecutive weeks, including the peak week containing at least 85% of positive tests with a 2-week buffer on either side of the IOP. Peak IOP (PIOP) was defined as four consecutive weeks containing the peak week with the most number of positive influenza tests. Off-PIOP was defined as the 'shoulder' weeks during each IOP. Non-influenza season (NIS) was the remaining weeks of that study season. Rate ratios of mean daily MAARI-related admissions resulting in advanced medical support outcomes during PIOP or Off-PIOP were compared with the NIS and were significantly elevated for all 12 study seasons combined. The results suggest that influenza outbreaks are associated with increased advanced medical support utilisation by children with MAARI. We feel that this data may help preparedness for severe influenza epidemics or pandemic.","Guyther, Jennifer; Lichenstein, Richard; Gao, Yonghong; Zhou, James A; Ajao, Adebola; Bajaj, Priti K; Combs, Veronica A; King, James C",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268818001383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29843825/,49

METHODS Patients scheduled to undergo segmentectomy or lobectomy were prospectively randomized before surgery to group D or T. A stratification randomization was performed according to the following air leak risk factors: age, sex, smoking status, and presence of emphysema and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary end point was the duration of chest tube placement. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were found between groups D (n = 135) and T (n = 164) with regard to the duration of chest tube placement (median, 2.0 vs 3.0 days; P = .149), duration of hospitalization (median, 6.0 vs 7.0 days; P = .548), or frequency of postoperative adverse events (25.1% vs 20.7%; P = .361). In subgroup analyses of the 64 patients with postoperative air leak (20 in group D and 44 in group T), the duration of chest tube placement (median, 4.5 vs 4.0 days; P = .225) and duration of postoperative air leak (median, 3.0 vs 3.0 days; P = .226) were not significantly different between subgroups. CONCLUSIONS The use of a digital thoracic drainage system did not shorten the duration of chest tube placement in comparison to a traditional thoracic drainage system after anatomic lung resection.","Takamochi, Kazuya; Nojiri, Shuko; Oh, Shiaki; Matsunaga, Takeshi; Imashimizu, Kota; Fukui, Mariko; Suzuki, Kenji",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.09.145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29221735/,49

There were 6 cases in Dhaka district excluding metropolitan areas and rest of 43 (20%) cases in the 19 other regions. Local government-enforced completely shut down the hotspots areas on April 8 2020. However, peoples from hotspots travelled openly to the other districts. We aimed to understand the risk of open movement from hotspots. We studied 40 individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus later at their destination. We developed a route map and density maps using Geographic Information System (GIS). Among the studied people, the average distance was 140.1 (75.1) kilometers (Km), and the range of distance was from 20.3 to 321.7 kilometers. Among them, 42.5% traveled <100 Km, 40.0% traveled between 100 and 200 Km and 17.5% traveled above 200 Km. Case numbers were increased 13.5 times more on April 20 than the cases as of April 8, 2020.

103391,COVID-19 and the ANZ J Surgery.,2020-04-10,"CONTEXT The safe and effective application of psychomotor skills in the clinical environment is a central pillar of the health professions. The current global coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted health professions education (HPE) and has been of particular consequence for routine face-to-face (F2F) skill education for health professionals and clinical students worldwide. What is being experienced on an unprecedented scale parallels a problem familiar to regional, rural and remote health professionals and students: the learners are willing, and the educational expertise exists, but the two are separated by the tyranny of distance. This article considers how the problem of physical distance might be overcome, so that quality skill education might continue. ISSUES Psychomotor skills are undeniably easier to teach and learn F2F, and training schedules in tertiary, in-service and accredited professional courses reflect this. This aspect of HPE is therefore at significant risk in the context of social distancing and physical isolation. Psychomotor skills are much more complex than the physical motor outputs alone might suggest, and an F2F skill session is only one way to build the complementary aspects of new skill performance. This article argues that educators and course designers can progress with psychomotor skill education from a physical distance. LESSONS LEARNED Videos can be used to either passively present content to learners or actively engage them. It is the design of the educational activity, rather than the resource medium itself, that enables active engagement. Furthermore, while many training schedules have been adapted to accommodate intensive F2F skill training once it is safe to do so, distributed practice and the need for reflection during the acquisition and development of new skills may challenge the pedagogical effectiveness of this approach. Skill development can be fostered in the absence of F2F teaching, and in the absence of a shared physical space. Embracing the creative licence to do so will improve equitable access to regional, rural and remote clinicians and students well beyond the resolution of the current pandemic.","Seymour-Walsh, Amy E; Weber, Anthony; Bell, Andy; Smith, Tony",Rural and remote health,https://doi.org/10.22605/rrh6132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160300/,49

While allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant from a matched related donor is curative, the vast majority of patients do not have a compatible sibling. Accordingly, platforms using haploidentical donors have been developed, which provide near universal availability. Areas covered: This review focuses on the two commonly used approaches for haploidentical hematopoietic transplants, namely T-cell deplete and T-cell replete, each of which is associated with unique benefits and drawbacks. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate individualized decision making for patients and providers by reviewing the pros- and cons of these differing approaches. Expert opinion: Individuals with sickle cell disease eligible for a hematopoietic cell transplant can be considered based on recent results.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether CPB rewarming rate is associated with cerebral ischemia assessed by the release of the brain injury biomarker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). METHODS Blood samples were collected from 152 patients after anesthesia induction and after CPB for the measurement of plasma GFAP levels. Nasal temperatures were recorded every 15 min. A multivariate estimation model for postoperative plasma GFAP level was determined that included the baseline GFAP levels, rewarming rate, CPB duration, and patient age. RESULTS The mean rewarming rate during CPB was 0.21° ± 0.11°C/min; the maximal temperature was 36.5° ± 1.0°C (range, 33.1°C to 38.0°C). Plasma GFAP levels increased after compared with before CPB (median, 0.022 ng/mL versus 0.035 ng/mL; p < 0.001). Rewarming rate (p = 0.001), but not maximal temperature (p = 0.77), was associated with higher plasma GFAP levels after CPB. In the adjusted estimation model, rewarming rate was positively associated with postoperative plasma log GFAP levels (coefficient, 0.261; 95% confidence intervals, 0.132 to 0.390; p < 0.001). Six patients (3.9%) experienced a postoperative stroke. Rewarming rate was higher (0.3° ± 0.09°C/min versus 0.2° ± 0.11°C/min; p = 0.049) in the patients with stroke compared with those without a stroke. CONCLUSIONS Rewarming rate during CPB was correlated with evidence of brain cellular injury documented with plasma GFAP levels.

BACKGROUND Lombardy was the Italian region with the highest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) prevalence, at the end of March 2020 accounting for 20% of all worldwide deaths. Joint Gastro-Intestinal societies released recommendations for Endoscopy Units to reduce the risk of the contagion. However, there are few data from high-prevalence areas on adherence to these recommendations and on their efficacy. METHODS A survey was designed by the Lombardy section of SIED to analyze (a) changes in activity and organization, (b) adherence to recommendations, (c) rate of health care professionals' (HCP) infection during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS In total, 35/61 invited centers (57.4%) participated; most modified activities were according to recommendations and had filtering face piece 2/filtering face piece 3 and water-repellent gowns available, but few had negative-pressure rooms or provided telephonic follow-up; 15% of HCPs called in sick and 6% had confirmed COVID-19. There was a trend (P=0.07) toward different confirmed COVID-19 rates among endoscopists (7.9%), nurses (6.6%), intermediate-care technicians (3.4%), and administrative personnel (2.2%). There was no correlation between the rate of sick HCPs and COVID-19 incidence in the provinces and personal protective equipment availability and use, whereas an inverse correlation with hospital volume was found. CONCLUSIONS Adherence to recommendations was rather good, though a minority were able to follow all recommendations. Confirmed COVID-19 seemed higher among endoscopists and nurses, suggesting that activities in the endoscopy rooms are at considerable viral spread risk.","Capurso, Gabriele; Archibugi, Livia; Vanella, Giuseppe; Testoni, Sabrina G G; Petrone, Maria C; Fanti, Lorella; Greco, Salvatore; Cavenati, Sergio; Gaffuri, Nicola; Lella, Fausto; Pace, Fabio; Cengia, Gianpaolo; Spada, Cristiano; Lovera, Mauro; Missale, Guido; Rosato, Stenio; Radaelli, Franco; Buscarini, Elisabetta; Parente, Fabrizio; Pilati, Stefano; Luigiano, Carmelo; Passoni, Giovanni R; Salerno, Raffaele; Bargiggia, Stefano; Penagini, Roberto; Cantù, Paolo; Fregoni, Fiorenza; Giannetti, Aurora; Devani, Massimo; Manes, Gianpiero; Fiori, Giancarla; Fontana, Paola; Gambitta, Pietro; Masci, Enzo; Mutignani, Massimiliano; Gatti, Mario; Canani, Marcella B; Vailati, Cristian; Dinelli, Marco Emilio; Marzo, Vincenza; Alvisi, Costanza; Caramia, Vitantonio; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Aurelio, Mauro; De Grazia, Federico; Balzarini, Marco; Segato, Sergio; Nella, Giovanni A; Giannini, Patrizia; Leoni, Piera; Testoni, Pier A; Mariani, Alberto; Arcidiacono, Paolo G",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000001440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33060438/,49

A systematic review.",2019,"Despite the outstanding success of the cancer drug imatinib, one obstacle in prolonged treatment is the emergence of resistance mutations within the kinase domain of its target, Abl. We noticed that many patient-resistance mutations occur in the dynamic hot spots recently identified to be responsible for imatinib's high selectivity toward Abl. In this study, we provide an experimental analysis of the mechanism underlying drug resistance for three major resistance mutations (G250E, Y253F, and F317L). Our data settle controversies, revealing unexpected resistance mechanisms. The mutations alter the energy landscape of Abl in complex ways: increased kinase activity, altered affinity, and cooperativity for the substrates, and, surprisingly, only a modestly decreased imatinib affinity. Only under cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations, these changes cumulate in an order of magnitude increase in imatinib's half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). These results highlight the importance of characterizing energy landscapes of targets and its changes by drug binding and by resistance mutations developed by patients.","Hoemberger, Marc; Pitsawong, Warintra; Kern, Dorothee",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1919221117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719139/,49

The majority of COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while some experience a cytokine storm effect, which is considered as one of the leading causes of patient mortality. Lipids are known to be involved in the various stages of the lifecycle of a virus functioning as receptors or co-receptors that controls viral propagation inside the host cell. Therefore, lipid-related metabolomics aims to provide insight into the immune response of the novel coronavirus. Our study has focused on determination of the potential metabolomic biomarkers utilizing a Teslin® Substrate in paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) for the development of a rapid detection test within 60 seconds of analysis time.

METHODS We performed a retrospective study to assess prognostic factors of survival in all allogeneic SCT recipients admitted to the ICU between 2002 and 2013 in our center which has flexible admission criteria, especially regarding GVHD. RESULTS Of 349 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT during the study period, 92 patients (26%) were admitted to the ICU. Intensive care unit and hospital discharge rates were 66% and 46%, respectively, whereas 1 year survival was 24%. Acute GVHD, either grade III to IV (30 patients, 33%) or refractory (12 patients, 13%) had a nonsignificant impact on hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; P = 0.1; OR, 5, P = 0.05, respectively). Fifty percent of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, 30% required vasopressors, 17% required renal replacement therapy, and 28% had liver impairment (bilirubin >34 μmol/L), each of these parameters defining organ failure. Mortality was closely associated with the number of organ failures as hospital discharge rates were 69%, 50%, 42%, and 0% among patients with 0 (26 patients), 1 (26 patients), 2 (26 patients), and 3 to 4 (14 patients) organ failures, respectively (OR, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-4.6; P < 0.001 according to the number of organ failures). CONCLUSIONS Early mortality of allogeneic SCT recipients admitted to the ICU is especially influenced by the number of organ failures and therefore patients with 0 to 2 organ failures should be considered if required. Refractory GVHD affects survival but not within the confined ICU admission.","Orvain, Corentin; Beloncle, Francois; Hamel, Jean-Francois; Thépot, Sylvain; Mercier, Mélanie; Kouatchet, Achille; Farhi, Jonathan; Francois, Sylvie; Guardiola, Philippe; Asfar, Pierre; Hunault-Berger, Mathilde; Mercat, Alain; Ifrah, Norbert; Tanguy-Schmidt, Aline",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000001143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26950729/,49

MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical/psycho/neurological monitoring was performed in 109 patients with internal carotid artery stenosis of 69±7.0% and neurological symptoms of cerebral ischemia, 2-3 degree, in pre- and postoperative periods. Cerebral oximetry was carried out perioperatively. Fifty-four patients were treated with mexidol in a dose of 1000 mg/day for 14-15 days and 55 patients did not received mexidol. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The difference in initial brain oxygenation (rSO2) between the main and comparison groups was shown (60.8±5.0 and 47.29±5.5%, respectively). During operation, the degree of blood oxygenation in these groups decreased by 57% and 41%, respectively. On day 7, sinificant differences in the Schulte test in two groups of patients with similar neurological status were found considering efficiency of work and mental stability before and after operation. No differences were found in the comparison group.

Research into CCSVI will determine its sensitivity and specificity for a diagnosis of MS, its prevalence in MS patients, and its clinical, MRI, and genetic correlates. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and number of intra- and extraluminal structural and functional extracranial venous abnormalities by using DS and MRV, in patients with MS and HCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred fifty patients with MS, 104 (69.3%) with RR and 46 (30.7%) with a progressive MS course, and 63 age- and sex-matched HCs were scanned with 3T MR imaging by using TOF and TRICKS sequences (only patients with MS). All subjects underwent DS examination for intra- and extraluminal structural and functional abnormalities of the IJVs. Absent/pinpoint IJV flow morphology on MRV was considered an abnormal finding. Prominence of collateral extracranial veins was assessed with MRV. RESULTS Patients with MS had a significantly higher number of functional (P < .0001), total (P = .001), and intraluminal (P = .005) structural IJV DS abnormalities than HCs. There was a trend for more patients with MS with extraluminal IJV DS abnormalities (P = .023). No significant differences were found on the MRV IJV flow morphology scale between patients with MS and HCs. Patients with progressive MS showed more extraluminal IJV DS abnormalities (P = .01) and more MRV flow abnormalities on TOF (P = .006) and TRICKS (P = .01) than patients with nonprogressive MS. There was a trend for a higher number of collateral veins in patients with MS than in HCs (P = .016). CONCLUSIONS DS is more sensitive than MRV in detecting intraluminal structural and functional venous abnormalities in patients with MS compared with HCs, whereas MRV is more sensitive in showing collaterals.","Dolic, K; Marr, K; Valnarov, V; Dwyer, M G; Carl, E; Karmon, Y; Kennedy, C; Brooks, C; Kilanowski, C; Hunt, K; Siddiqui, A H; Hojnacki, D; Weinstock-Guttman, B; Zivadinov, R",AJNR.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Twelve client-owned cats with ureteral urolithiasis treated with ureteroneocystostomy. METHODS Records were reviewed for signalment, location of the obstruction, diagnostic tests, surgical technique, perioperative complications, long-term measurements of kidney function, and survival. Cats were divided into two groups; in one group, a DPT was placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy, and, in the other group, a DPT was not placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy (NDPT). RESULTS A DPT was placed in six of 12 cats. The NDPT group included four cats with temporary catheters and two cats with no catheter. Median creatinine concentration decreased from 10.4 mg/dL (range, 1.6-20.3) to 2.2 mg/dL (range, 1.1-3.6) at the time of discharge (P = .015) in all cats. Two cats in the NDPT group required revision surgery for uroabdomen. Eleven cats were discharged from the hospital. Long-term complications (hematuria, pollakiuria, urinary tract infections) were more common in the DPT group (P = .047). Seven cats were alive a median of 329 days (range, 8-1772) after surgery. Median creatinine concentration was 2.0 mg/dL (range, 0.6-6.4) at a median of 157 days (range, 43-1772) after surgery. CONCLUSION Ureteroneocystostomy resulted in acceptable long-term outcomes in 11 of 12 cats. The placement of a DPT did not influence the long-term outcome in this small population.

We formulate this as a non-convex regularisation problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchybased penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artefacts. Despite being non-convex, the proposed technique is guaranteed to convergence through our proposed Cauchy proximal splitting (CPS) method, and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the current state-ofthe- art B-line identification method, and show a considerable performance gain with 87% correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients.","Karakus, Oktay; Anantrasirichai, Nantheera; Aguersif, Amazigh; Silva, Stein; Basarab, Adrian; Achim, Alin","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2020.3016092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784133/,49

Academic feedback groups fit the bill, and promote growth as scholars and humans.",2020-06-01,"PURPOSE Influence of therapeutic thoracentesis on the pleural pressure (Pp) has been discussed in many clinical studies, however reasons of Pp changes are not precisely established. The aim of the study was to use a previously elaborated virtual cardiopulmonary patient (VP) in analysis of impact of physiological factors on Pp during the procedure. METHODS Simulations were performed on VP with default values of parameters for which VP simulated the respiratory system of the average 50-year-old healthy Polish woman according to spirometric examination. Alterations of Pp and the amplitude of Pp changes related to breathing (AP) were analyzed. Model parameters related to chosen factors were deviated from their default values to analyze the degree of their impact on Pp and AP. The analysis was based on and supported by our own clinical data. RESULTS The Pp and AP alteration intensity appeared to be most sensitive to the compliances of the rib cage and mediastinum, and the nonlinearity of the dependence between the recoil pressure and the lung volume: the lower the compliances and the higher the nonlinearity were, the deeper the Pp fall during the procedure and the bigger the AP increase were observed. CONCLUSIONS Experiments in silico are very useful in analyzing sophisticated physiological and medical problems. They made it possible to show which factors are particularly responsible for changes in Pp during thoracentesis. In the future, they may be useful in establishing objective conditions under which thoracentesis needs to be stopped.","Gólczewski, Tomasz; Stecka, Anna M; Michnikowski, Marcin; Grabczak, Elżbieta M; Korczyński, Piotr; Krenke, Rafał",The International journal of artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.5301/ijao.5000636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28799625/,49

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been found at very high concentrations in swab and sputum samples from such individuals. Objective To estimate the virus levels released from individuals with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 into different aerosol sizes by normal breathing and coughing, and to determine what exposure could result from this in a room shared with such individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants This mathematical modeling study combined the size-distribution of exhaled breath microdroplets for coughing and normal breathing with viral swab and sputum concentrations as approximation for lung lining liquid to obtain an estimate of emitted virus levels. Viral data were obtained from studies published as of May 20, 2020. The resulting emission data fed a single-compartment model of airborne concentrations in a room of 50 m3, the size of a small office or medical examination room. Main Outcomes and Measures Modeling was used to estimate the viral load emitted by individuals breathing normally or coughing, and the concentrations expected in the simulated room at different ventilation rates. Results The mean estimated viral load in microdroplets emitted by simulated individuals while breathing regularly was 0.0000049 copies/cm3, with a range of 0.0000000049 to 0.637 copies/cm3. The corresponding estimates for simulated coughing individuals were a mean of 0.277 copies/cm3 per cough, with a range of 0.000277 to 36 030 copies/cm3 per cough. The estimated concentrations in a room with an individual who was coughing frequently were very high, with a maximum of 7.44 million copies/m3 from an individual who was a high emitter. However, regular breathing from an individual who was a high emitter was modeled to result in lower room concentrations of up to 1248 copies/m3. Conclusions and Relevance In this modeling study, breathing and coughing were estimated to release large numbers of viruses, ranging from thousands to millions of virus copies per cubic meter in a room with an individual with COVID-19 with a high viral load, depending on ventilation and microdroplet formation process. The estimated infectious risk posed by a person with typical viral load who breathes normally was low. The results suggest that only few people with very high viral load pose an infection risk in poorly ventilated closed environments. These findings suggest that strict respiratory protection may be needed when there is a chance to be in the same small room with an individual, whether symptomatic or not, especially for a prolonged period.","Riediker, Michael; Tsai, Dai-Hua",JAMA network open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.13807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716517/,49

111129,CEACAM1 regulates TIM-3-mediated tolerance and exhaustion.,2015,"Although previous studies suggest that neural stem cells (NSCs) exist in the adult olfactory bulb (OB), their location, identity and capacity to generate mature neurons in vivo has been little explored. Here, we injected EGFP-expressing retroviral particles into the OB core of adult mice to label dividing cells and to track the differentiation/maturation of any neurons they might generate. EGFP labelled cells initially expressed adult NSC markers on days 1-3 post injection (dpi), including Nestin, GLAST, Sox2, Prominin-1 and GFAP. EGFP+ -doublecortin (DCX) cells with a migratory morphology were also detected and their abundance increased over a 7-day period. Furthermore, EGFP-labeled cells progressively became NeuN+ neurons, they acquired neuronal morphologies and they became immunoreactive for OB neuron subtype markers, the most abundant representing calretinin expressing interneurons. OB-NSCs also generated glial cells, suggesting they could be multipotent in vivo. Significantly, the newly-generated neurons established and received synaptic contacts, and they expressed presynaptic proteins and the transcription factor pCREB. By contrast, when the retroviral particles were injected into the subventricular zone (SVZ), nearly all (98%) EGFP+ -cells were post-mitotic when they reached the OB core, implying that the vast majority of proliferating cells present in the OB are not derived from the SVZ. Furthermore, we detected slowly dividing label-retaining cells (LRCs) in this region that could correspond to the population of resident NSCs. This is the first time NSCs located in the adult OB core have been shown to generate neurons that incorporate into OB circuits in vivo. © AlphaMed Press 2021 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The adult olfactory bulb (OB) receives neurons originating from the subventricular zone (SVZ) and from the elbow of the rostral migratory stream (RMS) but it remains unclear whether local neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to neurogenesis in the OB. Our results show for the first time that NSCs in the adult OB core predominantly give rise to calretinin-expressing interneurons. Notably, not only do the newly generated neurons establish synapses but they also express synaptic proteins and pCREB in vivo, indicating they become incorporated into the OB's synaptic circuits.","Defteralı, Çağla; Moreno-Estellés, Mireia; Crespo, Carlos; Díaz-Guerra, Eva; Díaz-Moreno, María; Vergaño-Vera, Eva; Nieto-Estévez, Vanesa; Hurtado-Chong, Anahí; Consiglio, Antonella; Mira, Helena; Vicario, Carlos",Stem cells,https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.3393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963799/,49

DESIGN Prospective comparative study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1). SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS One hundred twenty-five patients with ovarian endometriomas. INTERVENTIONS Patients with endometrioma were managed by hemostasis with either bipolar coagulation (n = 62) or suturing (n = 63) during LESS-C. We evaluated the impact of surgery on ovarian reserve using serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, which were measured before surgery and 3 months after surgery in all patients. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline characteristics such as age, bilaterality of endometriomas, and preoperative AMH levels were similar between the 2 study groups. There were also no differences between the 2 groups in surgical outcomes, such as operative time, operative blood loss, or operative complications. In both study groups, postoperative AMH levels were lower than preoperative AMH levels (p < .001). The decline rate of AMH levels was significantly greater in the bipolar coagulation group than in the suture group (42.2% [interquartile range, 16.5%-53.0%] and 24.6% [interquartile range, 11.6%-37.0%], respectively, p = .001). CONCLUSION Hemostasis by bipolar coagulation after stripping of the endometrioma during LESS-C reduces ovarian reserve more than suturing does, as determined by serial AMH levels. Therefore, suturing may be a better hemostatic choice after stripping ovarian endometriomas.","Song, Taejong; Kim, Woo Young; Lee, Kyo Won; Kim, Kye Hyun",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2014.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25460517/,49
111387,Coronavirus reinfections: three questions scientists are asking.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND Hyperthermia is a common secondary insult in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim was to evaluate the relationship between hyperthermia and intracranial pressure (ICP), and if intracranial compliance and cerebral blood flow (CBF) pressure autoregulation affected that relationship. The relationships between hyperthermia and cerebral oximetry (BtipO2) and cerebral metabolism were also studied. METHODS A computerized multimodality monitoring system was used for data collection at the neurointensive care unit. Demographic and monitoring data (temperature, ICP, blood pressure, microdialysis, BtipO2) were analyzed from 87 consecutive TBI patients. ICP amplitude was used as measure of compliance, and CBF pressure autoregulation status was calculated using collected blood pressure and ICP values. Mixed models and comparison between groups were used. RESULTS The influence of hyperthermia on intracranial dynamics (ICP, brain energy metabolism, and BtipO2) was small, but individual differences were seen. Linear mixed models showed that hyperthermia raises ICP slightly more when temperature increases in the groups with low compliance and impaired CBF pressure autoregulation. There was also a tendency (not statistically significant) for increased BtipO2, and for increased pyruvate and lactate, with higher temperature, while the lactate/pyruvate ratio and glucose were stable. CONCLUSIONS The major finding was that the effects of hyperthermia on intracranial dynamics (ICP, brain energy metabolism, and BtipO2) were not extensive in general, but there were exceptional cases. Hyperthermia treatment has many side effects, so it is desirable to identify cases in which hyperthermia is dangerous. Information from multimodality monitoring may be used to guide treatment in individual patients.","Nyholm, Lena; Howells, Tim; Lewén, Anders; Hillered, Lars; Enblad, Per",Upsala journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/03009734.2017.1319440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28463046/,49

In this work, a novel and sensitive composite of electrochemically reduced graphene oxide-poly(Procion Red MX-5B)/gold nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE/ERGO-poly(PR)/AuNPs) was assembled for voltammetric detection of benzenediol isomers (RC, CC, and HQ). The nanocomposite displayed high peak currents towards the oxidation of RC, HQ, and CC compared to non-modified GCE. The peak-to-peak separations were 0.44 and 0.10 V for RC-CC and CC-HQ, respectively. The limit of detections were 53, 53, and 79 nM for HQ, CC, and RC with sensitivities of 4.61, 4.38, and 0.56 μA/μM (S/N = 3), respectively.

112814,MRI-aided kernel PET image reconstruction method based on texture features.,2021-06-30,"This article evaluates the suitability of cadavers embalmed by the saturated salt solution (SSS) method for surgical skills training (SST). SST courses using cadavers have been performed to advance a surgeon's techniques without any risk to patients. One important factor for improving SST is the suitability of specimens, which depends on the embalming method. In addition, the infectious risk and cost involved in using cadavers are problems that need to be solved. Six cadavers were embalmed by 3 methods: formalin solution, Thiel solution (TS), and SSS methods. Bacterial and fungal culture tests and measurement of ranges of motion were conducted for each cadaver. Fourteen surgeons evaluated the 3 embalming methods and 9 SST instructors (7 trauma surgeons and 2 orthopedists) operated the cadavers by 21 procedures. In addition, ultrasonography, central venous catheterization, and incision with cauterization followed by autosuture stapling were performed in some cadavers. The SSS method had a sufficient antibiotic effect and produced cadavers with flexible joints and a high tissue quality suitable for SST. The surgeons evaluated the cadavers embalmed by the SSS method to be highly equal to those embalmed by the TS method. Ultrasound images were clear in the cadavers embalmed by both the methods. Central venous catheterization could be performed in a cadaver embalmed by the SSS method and then be affirmed by x-ray. Lungs and intestines could be incised with cauterization and autosuture stapling in the cadavers embalmed by TS and SSS methods. Cadavers embalmed by the SSS method are sufficiently useful for SST. This method is simple, carries a low infectious risk, and is relatively of low cost, enabling a wider use of cadavers for SST.","Hayashi, Shogo; Homma, Hiroshi; Naito, Munekazu; Oda, Jun; Nishiyama, Takahisa; Kawamoto, Atsuo; Kawata, Shinichi; Sato, Norio; Fukuhara, Tomomi; Taguchi, Hirokazu; Mashiko, Kazuki; Azuhata, Takeo; Ito, Masayuki; Kawai, Kentaro; Suzuki, Tomoya; Nishizawa, Yuji; Araki, Jun; Matsuno, Naoto; Shirai, Takayuki; Qu, Ning; Hatayama, Naoyuki; Hirai, Shuichi; Fukui, Hidekimi; Ohseto, Kiyoshige; Yukioka, Tetsuo; Itoh, Masahiro",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000000196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25501070/,49

Its development was preceded by communication and resolution programs that were endorsed by the Joint Commission in 2001, subsequently introduced at several U.S. medical centers, and in 2009 were incorporated within demonstration projects funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. In August 2014, the authors introduced the Care for the Caregiver program across the MedStar Health System, which includes seven hospitals in Maryland and three in the District of Columbia. Here, they describe how the program was initially conceived and structured-and how it evolved in response to the current pandemic.","Morales, Crystal; Brown, Mary-Michael",The American journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.naj.0000749752.80198.c0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872237/,49
113274,Mesoscale coordination constructs.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Continuous monitoring of core temperature is essential during major surgery as a way of improving patient safety. Oesophageal probes or specific arterial catheters are invasive methods used in this setting. A new noninvasive device based on zero-heat-flux (ZHF) technique (SpotOn) seems promising but has been poorly investigated during rapid core temperature changes (RCTC). OBJECTIVE To assess the accuracy of a SpotOn sensor vs. an oesophageal probe or specific arterial catheter during a slow change in core temperature of less than 1 °C within 30 min and RCTC ≥ 1 °C within 30 min. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Operating rooms at the University Hospital of Poitiers, France. PATIENTS Fifty patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled from June 2015 to March 2016. Data from 49 patients were finally analysed. Among these, 15 patients were treated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. INTERVENTION Each patient had a ZHF sensor placed on the skin surface of the forehead (TempZHF) and an oesophageal probe (TempEso) used as a reference method. Twenty-two patients also had a thermodilution arterial catheter (TempArt) placed in the axillary artery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Core temperature was continuously recorded from the three devices after induction of anaesthesia. Comparison of temperature measurements between methods was made using the Bland and Altman method during two separate periods according to the speed of core temperature changes. RESULTS Compared with TempEso, bias and limits of agreement for TempZHF were 0.1 ± 0.5 °C during slow core temperature changes periods and 0.6 ± 1.8 °C during RCTC periods (P = 0.0002). Compared with TempArt, these values were -0.1 ± 0.4 and 0.5 ± 1.7 °C, respectively (P = 0.0039). The ZHF sensor was well tolerated. CONCLUSION A SpotOn sensor using the ZHF method seems reliable for core temperature monitoring during abdominal surgery when variations in core temperature are slow rather than rapid.

Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has demonstrated to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, the need for additional drug treatments, and to reduce the number of moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with allergic asthma caused by mites that had not been adequately controlled. AREAS COVERED : After reviewing the most recent literature, a scientific committee composed by 5 pneumologists experts in asthma proposed 41 items that addressed the diagnosis of allergic asthma caused by mites, the role of house dust mite (HDM) SLIT tablet in the therapeutic plan and in the control of the disease, and the profile of patients with asthma candidates for this therapy. Through a modified Delphi method, the items were send to 106 pneumologists involved in asthma to be agreed. EXPERT OPINION : The high degree of consensus reached by the panel of pneumologists shows the importance of HDM SLIT tablet in the treatment of allergic asthma caused by mites, particularly taking into account that they barely use this therapy because until now they did not have a registered treatment with solid evidence of efficacy and safety.","Plaza, Vicente; Arnedillo, Aurelio; Blanco-Aparicio, Marina; Ignacio, José María; Urrutia, Isabel",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1942846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128758/,49

All biological samples were prepared by protein precipitation method, and ginsenoside-Rg1 was chosen as the internal standard (IS). The analyte and IS were separated using a C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) and a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v) and acetonitrile running at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min for 5 min. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions were monitored at m/z 1219.5-749.5 for anemoside B4 and 845.4-637.4 for ginsenoside-Rg1 in electrospray ionization negative mode. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 10-2000 ng/mL for all biological matrices with a lower limit of quantification of 10 ng/mL. The validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion study. These preclinical data will be beneficial for further development of anemoside B4 in future studies.","He, Mingyu; Ouyang, Hui; He, Mingzhen; Tan, Ting; Li, Junmao; Zhang, Xiaoyong; Jia, Jia; Feng, Yulin; Yang, Shilin",Biomedical chromatography : BMC,https://doi.org/10.1002/bmc.3914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27957737/,49

This emerging paradigm is neither a single-handed problem of biomedical scientists nor of social analysts. It instead needs a strategically oriented collaborative and interdisciplinary preventive effort. To that effect, this article presents some socio-ethical reflections underscoring the judicious use of the insight from care ethics as an asset in minimizing the possible propagation of the COVID-19 virus and the escalation of its vulnerability in the day-to-day human interaction. It further emphasizes that if this insight is overlooked, the effects of the diverse facets of the ""shadow pandemics"" of COVID-19-fallouts on both the affected and the infected-may equally be deadly.","Dine, Charles Biradzem",Asian bioethics review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-020-00143-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717344/,49
116611,Coronavirus vaccines get a biotech boost.,2020-07-01,"Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) connect with photoreceptors and relay visual information to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Retina-specific deletion of Lhx4 in mice results in a visual defect resembling human congenital stationary night blindness. This visual dysfunction results from the absence of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and the loss of selective rod-connecting cone bipolar cell (CBC) subtypes and AII amacrine cells (ACs). Inactivation of Lhx4 causes the apoptosis of BCs and cell fate switch from some BCs to ACs, whereas Lhx4 overexpression promotes BC genesis. Moreover, Lhx4 positively regulates Lhx3 expression to drive the fate choice of type 2 BCs over the GABAergic ACs. Lhx4 inactivation ablates Bhlhe23 expression, whereas overexpression of Bhlhe23 partially rescues RBC development in the absence of Lhx4. Thus, by acting upstream of Bhlhe23, Prdm8, Fezf2, Lhx3, and other BC genes, Lhx4, together with Isl1, could play essential roles in regulating the subtype-specific development of RBCs and CBCs.","Dong, Xuhui; Yang, Hua; Zhou, Xiangtian; Xie, Xiaoling; Yu, Dongliang; Guo, Luming; Xu, Mei; Zhang, Wenjun; Liang, Guoqing; Gan, Lin",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937137/,49

As a result, rising temperatures increase the range of disease-carrying insects to new areas outside of subtropical zones, and increased precipitation causes flooding that is more hospitable for vector breeding. State governments, the federal government, and governmental agencies, like the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of USDA and the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lack a coordinated plan for vector-borne disease accompanying climate change. APHIS focuses its surveillance primarily on the effect of illness on agricultural production, while NNDSS focuses on the emergence of pathogens affecting human health.

The disease produced by this virus, called Covid-19, presents with variable clinical manifestations, from practically asymptomatic patients with catarrhal processes to severe pneumonias that rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. In recent weeks, papers have been published describing coagulation disorders and arterial and venous thrombotic complications in these patients, mainly among those admitted to intensive care units. The infection triggers an immune response, which causes different inflammatory mediators to be released into the blood. These include cytokines, which interact with platelets and different coagulation proteins, and promote thrombogenesis. One of the most widely studied coagulation markers in Covid-19 is D-dimer (DD), raised levels of which have prognostic implications, although the best cut-off point for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in this population has not been clarified, nor has its usefulness in determining the intensity of thromboprophylaxis required in these patients. Until sufficiently robust information (preferably from well-designed clinical trials) is available, the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines for the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of VTE should be followed in Covid-19 patients.","López-Reyes, Raquel; Oscullo, Grace; Jiménez, David; Cano, Irene; García-Ortega, Alberto",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.07.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950309/,49

It remains largely unclear, however, what defines the range and specificity of pathway activation. The adrenal gland represents a useful model to address this question, where the SHH pathway is activated in a very specific subset of cells lying near the SHH-producing cells, even though there is an abundance of lipoproteins that would allow SHH to travel and signal long-range. We determine that, whereas adrenal cells can secrete SHH on lipoproteins, this form of SHH is inactive due to the presence of cosecreted inhibitors, potentially explaining the absence of long-range signaling. Instead, we find that SHH-producing cells signal at short range via membrane-bound SHH, only to receiving cells with primary cilia. Finally, our data from NCI-H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells suggest that adrenocortical tumors may evade these regulatory control mechanisms by acquiring the ability to activate SHH target genes in response to TGF-β.","Mateska, Ivona; Nanda, Kareena; Dye, Natalie A; Alexaki, Vasileia Ismini; Eaton, Suzanne",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201910087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090184/,49

METHODOLOGY A qualitative study of phenomenological research design was used to describe the experiences of 10 Chinese nurses. Data were collected in February 2020 through in-depth interviews and analyzed by conventional content analysis methods. RESULTS Chinese nurses experienced different psychological stages, work pressure, and challenges. New concepts of nursing also emerged during their clinical care for COVID-19 patients. DISCUSSION The guidance synthesized from the Chinese nurse stories could give specific direction for a well-prepared global nursing workforce and high-quality patient care in the present and future epidemics.

During the first month of the outbreak, 2,641 cases of COVID-19 led to 1,832 hospital admissions, 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths. We aimed to identify the source and number of introductions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into Scotland using a combined phylogenetic and epidemiological approach. Sequencing of 1,314 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from available patient samples enabled us to estimate that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Scotland on at least 283 occasions during February and March 2020. Epidemiological analysis confirmed that early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 originated from mainland Europe (the majority from Italy and Spain). We identified subsequent early outbreaks in the community, within healthcare facilities and at an international conference. Community transmission occurred after 2 March, 3 weeks before control measures were introduced. Earlier travel restrictions or quarantine measures, both locally and internationally, would have reduced the number of COVID-19 cases in Scotland.

We examine the prevalence and sources of weight-based victimization targeting youth, consequences of these stigmatizing experiences for their psychological and physical health, and considerations for addressing weight stigma in clinical practice and pediatric care. RECENT FINDINGS Weight stigma is highly prevalent among youth with high body weight, who are targets of weight-based victimization from peers, parents, and teachers. These experiences place youth at risk for psychological distress (primarily depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideation), worse social and academic outcomes, and adverse physical health consequences including maladaptive eating behaviors, lower physical activity, substance use, and weight gain.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 253 patients, who underwent HALDN (51 right and 202 left) from January 2003 to December 2012. Perioperative outcomes including operative time, estimated blood loss, warm ischemic time, hospital stay, complications, and recovery of renal function in recipients were collected and compared between the right hybrid HALDN (rhHALDN) and left-sided HALDN groups. RESULTS The procedure was performed successfully in all 253 patients. No statistical difference in the mean operation time (224.3 vs 217.5 minutes), estimated blood loss (128.1 vs 123.6 mL), warm ischemic time (3.3 vs 3.1 minutes), average time to oral intake (2.4 vs 2.1 days), and mean hospital stay (4.9 vs 5.5 days) was observed between the rhHALDN and left-sided HALDN groups (P >.05). Perioperative complication rates were not statistically different between rhHALDN (2 intraoperative, 3 postoperative; 9.8%) and left-sided HALDN (6 intraoperative, 22 postoperative; 13.9%) group (P = .328). No significant difference in mean serum creatinine level and glomerular filtration rate in recipients from postoperative day 1 to 1 year was observed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION The perioperative outcomes of rhHALDN using a Satinsky clamp were comparable with those of the left-sided standard HALDN.

In response to a prolonged high-frequency stimulation (HFS), GABAergic synapses displayed endocannabinod (eCB)-mediated long-term depression (LTDGABA). When cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) were blocked by a CB1R antagonist, the same stimuli caused LTP at GABAergic synapses (LTPGABA) which was mediated by production of nitric oxide (NO) via activation of NMDA receptors. Intriguingly, NO signaling was necessary for the induction of LTDGABA. In the presence of leptin which blocks CB1 signaling, the prolonged HFS caused LTPGABA which was mediated by NO signaling. These results indicate that long-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex can be modulated by combined effects of eCB and NO signaling. These forms of GABAergic synaptic plasticity in the insular cortex may be crucial synaptic mechanisms in taste learning.","Toyoda, Hiroki",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64236-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346039/,49

This descriptive cross-sectional study included 169 HWs. We used Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for assessment. The mean age of HWs was 33.9±6.9 years and 56.2% were males. Of the HWs; 20.7% were nurses, 33.7% doctors and 45.6% staff members. IES-R classified the HWs as follows: 15.4% of them were affected mildly, 4.7% moderately and 9.5% of them were affected severely. 42.6% of HWs had apoor sleep quality. This study shows that how HWs were affected when the outbreak had not yet reached the hospital in which they work. In total, 29.6% of the HWs were psychologically affected by mild to severe levels from the outbreak in this period. The most prevalent psychological impact was poor sleep quality. Psychological impact on HWs may have begun before the outbreak reached the hospitals; therefore, necessary measures should be taken as early as possible.","Sahin, Sengul Kocamer; Arslan, Esra; Atalay, Ünzile Meryem; Demir, Bahadır; Elboga, Gülcin; Altındağ, Abdurrahman","Psychology, health & medicine",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1900578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726571/,49

Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the association of mandatory mask-wearing policies with behaviors associated with the transmission of COVID-19. Objective To assess the association of mask wearing with face-touching behavior among the general population in public areas. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used videos recorded in public transportation stations, streets, and parks among the general population in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe (ie, England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy), and the US to analyze mask-wearing and face-touching behavior in public areas. Videos before the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded from January 2018 to October 2019, and those during the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded during February 2020 to March 2020 in China, Japan, and South Korea and during March 2020 in Western Europe and the US. Individuals who clearly displayed their face and face-touching behavior were included, and those whose behaviors were influenced by filming or public events were excluded. Exposures Mandatory mask-wearing policies enacted at various time points in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe, and the US. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportion of individuals wearing masks and incidence of face touching. Results This study included 4699 individuals before the COVID-19 pandemic and 2887 individuals during the pandemic. During the periods studied, mask wearing increased in all regions except the US, from 20 of 1745 individuals (1.1%) to 1090 of 1097 individuals (99.4%) in mainland China (P < .001), 44 of 1422 individuals (3.1%) to 346 of 893 individuals (38.7%) in Japan (P < .001), 6 of 717 individuals (0.8%) to 277 of 324 individuals (85.5% ) in South Korea (P < .001), 1 of 546 individuals (0.2%) to 6 of 379 individuals (1.6%) in Western Europe (P = .02), and 1 of 269 individuals (0.4%) to 4 of 194 individuals (2.1%) in the US (P = .17). Surgical masks were predominant in China (989 masks [89.1%]), and fabric masks were predominant in the other regions (Japan: 371 masks [95.1%]; South Korea: 240 masks [84.8%]; Western Europe: 6 masks [85.7%]; US: 5 masks [100%]). Face-touching behaviors decreased from before COVID-19 to during COVID-19 among individuals in China (72 incidences of 1745 observations [4.1%] to 12 incidences of 1097 observations [1.1%]; P < .001), South Korea (80 incidences of 717 observations [11.2%] to 7 incidences of 324 observations [2.2%]; P < .001), and Europe (62 incidences of 546 observations [11.4%] to 23 incidences of 379 observations [6.1%]; P = .01). Logistic regression found that mask wearing was associated with a reduction in face touching in China (odds ratio [OR], 3.91; 95% CI, 2.11-7.24) and South Korea (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 2.69-16.69) and of touching the nose, mouth, and eyes (China: OR, 8.60; 95% CI, 2.65-27.86; South Korea: OR, 29.27; 95% CI, 1.79-478.22). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that mandatory mask-wearing policies were associated with increased mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mask wearing was associated with reduced face-touching behavior, especially touching of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which may prevent contact transmission of COVID-19 among the general population in public areas.","Chen, Yong-Jian; Qin, Gang; Chen, Jie; Xu, Jian-Liang; Feng, Ding-Yun; Wu, Xiang-Yuan; Li, Xing",JAMA network open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.16924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725247/,49
125435,Sweden's gamble.,2020-10-09,"OBJECTIVE The burst of COVID-19 epidemics in Italy prompted the Italian Society of Hypertension to start an observational study to explore the characteristics of the hospitalized victims of the disease. The current analysis aimed to investigate the predictors of healing among Italian COVID-19 patients. We also assessed the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome. METHODS We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to explore the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. We analyzed information from 2446 charts of Italian patients admitted for certified COVID-19 in 27 hospitals. Healing from COVID-19 infection, defined as two consecutive negative swabs, was reported in 544 patients (22.2%), 95% of them were hospitalized. RESULTS Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index were significantly lower in healing compared with nonhealing patients (63 ± 15 vs. 69 ± 15 and 2 ± 2 vs. 3 ± 2, both P < 0.05). In multivariable regression model, predictors of healing were younger age (OR: 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99, P = 0.0001), absence of chronic kidney disease (OR: 0.35; 95% CI 0.17-0.70, P = 0.003) or heart failure (OR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.70, P = 0.001). In the subgroup of patients suffering from hypertension and/or heart failure (n = 1498), no differences were observed in the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that younger age and absence of comorbidities play a major role in determining healing in patients with COVID-19. No effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome was reported.","Mancusi, Costantino; Grassi, Guido; Borghi, Claudio; Carugo, Stefano; Fallo, Francesco; Ferri, Claudio; Giannattasio, Cristina; Grassi, Davide; Letizia, Claudio; Minuz, Pietro; Muiesan, Maria Lorenza; Perlini, Stefano; Pucci, Giacomo; Rizzoni, Damiano; Salvetti, Massimo; Sarzani, Riccardo; Sechi, Leonardo; Veglio, Franco; Volpe, Massimo; Iaccarino, Guido",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000002666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186327/,49

Here we report on the use of RNA interference, either alone or in combination with cidofovir, as an approach to inhibit orthopoxvirus replication. Two selected small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), named siB1R-2 and siG7L-1, and a previously reported siRNA, i.e., siD5R-2 (which targets the viral D5R mRNA), were evaluated for antiviral activity against vaccinia virus (VACV) by plaque reduction and virus yield assays. siB1R-2 and siG7L-1, administered before or after viral infection, reduced VACV replication by more than 90%. Also, these two siRNAs decreased monkeypox virus replication by 95% at a concentration of 1 nM. siB1R-2 and siG7L-1 were demonstrated to specifically silence their corresponding transcripts, i.e., B1R and G7L mRNAs, without induction of a beta interferon response. Strong synergistic effects were observed when siB1R-2, siG7L-1, or siD5R-2 was combined with cidofovir. In addition, the antiviral activities of these three siRNAs were evaluated against VACV resistant to cidofovir and other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates. siG7L-1 and siD5R-2 remained active against four of five VACV mutants, while siB1R-2 showed activity against only one of the mutants. Our results showed that siRNAs are potent inhibitory agents in vitro, not only against wild-type VACV but also against several cidofovir-resistant VACV. Furthermore, we showed that a combined therapy using siRNA and cidofovir may be useful in the treatment of poxvirus infections.","Vigne, Solenne; Duraffour, Sophie; Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert; Garin, Daniel; Crance, Jean-Marc",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01626-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19307376/,49

STUDY DESIGN This prospective cohort study included all delivering patients between May 1 and September 22, 2020 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was performed. SARS-CoV-2 viral reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results and maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected from the electronic medical record. Data were analyzed using univariate statistical methods with clustering for multiple births. RESULTS In total, 1,000 patients delivered between May 1 and September 22, 2020. Fifty-eight (5.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. Twenty-three also tested viral positive during pregnancy. Three of 1,000 (0.3%) were viral positive on admission but antibody negative. The median age was 30 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 26-33 years) and body mass index was 31.75 kg/m2 (IQR 27.7-37.5 kg/m2). The cesarean delivery rate was 34.0%. The study population was primarily white (71.6%); however, 41.0% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients identified as Black, 18.0% as Hispanic/Latino, 3.3% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and only 27.9% as White (p < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 infection was more likely in patients without private insurance (p = 0.0243). Adverse maternal and/or neonatal outcomes were not more likely in patients with evidence of infection during pregnancy. Two SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. There were no maternal deaths during the study period. CONCLUSION In this largely rural Midwest population, 6.1% of delivering patients had evidence of past or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rates of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy were higher among racial and ethnic minorities and patients without private insurance. The SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and their neonates were not found to be at increased risk for adverse outcomes.

It has been observed that the antifungals are not as effective as they used to be. Aims To determine the effectiveness of terbinafine and itraconazole in different doses and in combination in the treatment of tinea infection. Materials and Methods Study design was a randomized parallel group trial. Patients were randomly divided into five parallel arms in which two of the standard drugs in recommended doses were compared with their double doses and with combination of both the drugs. Patients were followed up every 2 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks. Cure was considered as complete clinical resolution of the lesions. Fungal culture and sensitivity were done by disk diffusion method for all patients. Parametric one-way analysis of variance (F test) and Chi-square test were used for the analysis. Results Two-hundred seventy-five patients were included in the study. Itraconazole containing groups showed significantly higher cure rates than terbinafine only groups both at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.001). Itraconazole containing groups, when compared against each other, were not found to be significantly different. The outcomes between terbinafine only groups were also not significantly different. Cure rates at 8 weeks were found to be greater than that at 4 weeks for all groups which were found to be highly significant (P < 0.001). Conclusions Itraconazole seems to be more effective than terbinafine. There is no benefit in increasing the dose or using a combination regimen in the treatment of tinea.

However, the emergence of the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) has generated renewed interest in the potential utility and feasibility of transitioning the clinical practice of neuropsychological assessment from an in-person evaluation to one that occurs at least partially via telehealth. Recent surveys of neuropsychologists practicing in the early stages of COVID-19 indicate that, while most clinicians will or currently engage in TeleNP services, many have concerns about ethical issues related to providing TeleNP. Despite the presence of APA guidelines for telepsychology, no formal APA ethical guidelines or standards of practice exist for TeleNP. We provide ethical considerations and suggestions for potential practitioners of TeleNP based on new models of practice derived in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We provide operational definitions of TeleNP and its models including: In-Clinic, Home, and Hybrid TeleNP models. Results: We outline ethical considerations and suggestions in general and by model related to: issues of competence, education and training, benefits and risks of conducting TeleNP, health disparities, informed consent, patient privacy, confidentiality, test security, and administration and interpretation of standardized assessments. Conclusions: The decision of which TeleNP model to use is a difficult one. Providers must balance several ethical considerations to complete an accurate assessment while managing numerous inherent challenges. Future efforts should focus on the creation of formal ethical guidelines and standards for the practice of TeleNP through joint task force efforts (e.g., APA, Inter Organizational Practice Committee).","Scott, Travis M; Marton, Kacey M; Madore, Michelle R",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2021.1889678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761834/,49

Spatial hodographs, showing the distribution of the field magnitude and orientation, allow the adjustment of interactions and can be an extremely potent tool for prospective experiments, but remain unstudied systematically. Here, we calculate the tunable interactions between spherical particles in rhodonea, conical, cylindrical, and ellipsoidal field hodographs, as the most experimentally important cases. We discovered that spatial hodographs are reduced to each other, providing a plethora of interactions, e.g., repulsive, attractive, barrier-like, and double-scale repulsive ones. Complementing the ""magic"" conical angle, the ""magic"" compression and ellipticity of cylindrical and ellipsoidal hodographs are introduced. In the ""magic"" hodographs, the interactions become spatially isotropic and attain dispersion-force-like asymptotic (the same for pairwise and many-body energies), being attractive or repulsive, if the particle permittivity is larger or smaller than that of the solvent. With the diagrammatic method and numerical calculations, we obtained physically meaningful fits to the many-body tunable potentials for silica (iron oxide) particles in deionised water in the rotating electric (magnetic) fields. Our results provide essential guidance for future experiments and simulations of colloidal liquids, crystals, gels, and glasses, important for a broad range of problems in condensed matter, chemical physics, physical chemistry, materials science, and soft matter.","Komarov, Kirill A; Yurchenko, Stanislav O",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0sm01046d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797126/,49
130156,Post-Hospital Discharge Venous Thromboembolism in Colorectal Surgery.,2016,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Hypoxia reportedly does not impair thermoregulation during exercise in compensable heat stress conditions, but whether it has an impact on maximal heat dissipation and therefore the critical environmental limit for the physiological compensability of core temperature is unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? Although skin blood flow was higher in hypoxia, no differences in sweat rates or the critical environmental limit for the physiological compensability of core temperature - an indicator of maximal heat loss - were found compared to exercise in normoxia, indicating no influence of normobaric hypoxia on thermoregulatory capacity in warm conditions. ABSTRACT Altered control of skin blood flow (SkBF) in hypoxia does not impair thermoregulation during exercise in compensable conditions, but its impact on maximal heat dissipation is unknown. This study therefore sought to determine whether maximum heat loss is altered by hypoxia during exercise in warm conditions. On separate days, eight males exercised for 90 min at a fixed heat production of ∼500 W in normoxia (NORM) or normobaric hypoxia (HYP, FI O2 = 13%) in a 34 °C environment. Ambient vapour pressure was maintained at 2.13 kPa for 45 min, after which it was raised 0.11 kPa every 7.5 min. The critical ambient vapour pressure at which esophageal temperature inflected upward (Pcrit ) indicated that maximum heat dissipation had been reached. Neither local sweat rates on the upper arm, back and forehead [average NORM: 1.46 (0.15) vs. HYP: 1.41 (0.16) mg cm-2 min-1 ; P = 0.59] nor whole-body sweat losses [NORM: 1029 (137) g vs. HYP: 1025 (150) g; P = 0.95] were different between trials. Laser-Doppler flux values (LDF; arbitrary units), an index of SkBF, were not different between NORM and HYP on the forearm (P = 0.23) or back (P = 0.73); however, when normalized as a percentage of maximum, LDF values tended to be higher in HYP compared to NORM at the forearm (condition effect, P = 0.05) but not back (P = 0.19). Despite potentially greater SkBF in hypoxia, there was no difference in Pcrit between conditions [NORM: 3.67 (0.35) kPa; HYP: 3.46 (0.39) kPa; P = 0.22). These findings suggest that hypoxia does not independently alter thermoregulatory capacity during exercise in warm conditions. This article is protected by copyright.

130227,Voltage-induced ferromagnetism in a diamagnet.,2020-07-01,"COVID 19 has raised the profile of biosecurity. However, biosecurity is not only about protecting human life. This issue brings together mini-reviews examining recent developments and thinking around some of the tools, behaviours and concepts around biosecurity. They illustrate the multi-disciplinary nature of the subject, demonstrating the interface between research and policy. Biosecurity practices aim to prevent the spread of harmful organisms; recognising that 2020 is the International Year of Plant Health, several focus on plant biosecurity although invasive species and animal health concerns are also captured. The reviews show progress in developing early warning systems and that plant protection organisations are increasingly using tools that compare multiple pest threats to prioritise responses. The bespoke modelling of threats can inform risk management responses and synergies between meteorology and biosecurity provide opportunities for increased collaboration. There is scope to develop more generic models, increasing their accessibility to policy makers. Recent research can improve pest surveillance programs accounting for real-world constraints. Social science examining individual farmer behaviours has informed biosecurity policy; taking a broader socio-cultural approach to better understand farming networks has the potential to change behaviours in a new way. When encouraging public recreationists to adopt positive biosecurity behaviours communications must align with their values. Bringing together the human, animal, plant and environmental health sectors to address biosecurity risks in a common and systematic manner within the One Biosecurity concept can be achieved through multi-disciplinary working involving the life, physical and social sciences with the support of legislative bodies and the public.","MacLeod, Alan; Spence, Nicola",Emerging topics in life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1042/etls20200343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313786/,49

Phenotypic variation can be observed as intratumor heterogeneity, which is propagated by genome instability leading to mutations, somatic copy-number alterations, and epigenomic changes. TRACERx was set up in 2014 to observe the relationship between intratumor heterogeneity and patient outcome. By integrating multiregion sequencing of primary tumors with longitudinal sampling of a prospectively recruited patient cohort, cancer evolution can be tracked from early- to late-stage disease and through therapy. Here we review some of the key features of the studies and look to the future of the field. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancers evolve and adapt to environmental challenges such as immune surveillance and treatment pressures. The TRACERx studies track cancer evolution in a clinical setting, through primary disease to recurrence. Through multiregion and longitudinal sampling, evolutionary processes have been detailed in the tumor and the immune microenvironment in non-small cell lung cancer and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.

Results Thirty-four articles were identified in the SR of which 19 were included in the MA. Being a smoker or former smoker was shown to be a risk factor for worse progression of Covid-19 infection (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 - 2.83) and a greater probability of presenting a more critical condition (OR 1.79 95% CI, 1.19 - 2.70). As limitations of the MA, we found that most of the studies analyzed were observational with limited publication bias. Two studies that disagreed with the rest were included, although after withdrawing them from the MA, smoking was maintained as a risk factor for worse progress. Conclusion Current and past smoking produces a more serious clinical form of Covid-19 and more frequently leads to intensive care admission, intubation, and death.","Jiménez-Ruiz, Carlos A; López-Padilla, Daniel; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael; Solano-Reina, Segismundo; de Granda-Orive, José Ignacio",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.06.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629638/,49
132023,[State-of-the-art Treatment of Acute Stroke].,2015,"Objectives This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the physical activity (PA) of UK adults and potential motivational determinants of such behaviour. Design and methods A survey was conducted with 1,521 UK adults recruited through Prolific.co in early June 2020. Along with demographic information, questions assessed current PA, changes in PA modalities (i.e., overall, around the home, for transport, in the workplace, in the local neighbourhood, at recreation/sport facilities) related to the lockdown, and beliefs about capabilities, opportunities, and motivations according to the COM-B model. A series of logistic regressions were constructed to examine associations between shifts in the PA modalities and the COM-B components. Results The majority of respondents (57%) had either maintained or increased their levels of PA during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the proportion meeting PA guidelines (31%) was low and engagement in sedentary-related behaviour for both work and leisure increased substantially during the lockdown. The components of the COM-B model were associated with shifts in PA. In particular, physical opportunity (odds ratios ranging from 1.14 to 1.20) and reflective motivation (odds ratios ranging from 1.11 to 1.25) appeared to be the most consistent predictors of behaviour. Conclusions If UK adults believed they had the physical opportunity and were motivated, they were more likely to have maintained or increased their PA during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the majority of adults are not meeting the UK guidelines on PA and the prevalence of PA is substantially lower than national surveys prior to the pandemic. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the daily routines of citizens globally. Engagement in physical activity appears to have declined as a result of the requirement to self-isolate and stay in place. The COM-B model of behaviour change is a useful framework for identifying the correlates and determinants of behaviour. What does this study add? Though most UK adults maintained or increased their engagement in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority did not meet recommended guidelines. Reflective processes and physical opportunity were the primary predictors of change in physical activity.","Spence, John C; Rhodes, Ryan E; McCurdy, Ashley; Mangan, Amie; Hopkins, Debbie; Mummery, W Kerry",British journal of health psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336562/,49

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this article, we discuss the transmission routes, the potential risk of contagion for patients and healthcare providers during procedures, and comment on the changes that will affect head and neck clinical practice in the future of outpatient and surgical activities. RESULTS Otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists and dentists are at high risk for infection contagion and spread because they perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that generate aerosol and droplets thus facilitating virus transmission. Furthermore, examination involves close doctor-patient contact and otolaryngologists and dentists have to remove patient's protective devices during the visit. CONCLUSIONS Special attention to prevention protocols for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the use of protective equipment is of utmost importance to limit contagion and prevent a new virus spread in the near future.","Ralli, M; Candelori, F; Cambria, F; Greco, A; Angeletti, D; Lambiase, A; Campo, F; Minni, A; Polimeni, A; de Vincentiis, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_23062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015816/,49

It may be difficult to determine the etiology of these lesions in view of the increased frequency of handwashing during the pandemic, along with occurrences of irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis due to disinfectant use; usage of herbal medicine and supplements to strengthen the immune system; and urticarial or maculopapular drug eruptions due to COVID-19 treatment. The variety of associated skin manifestations seen with COVID-19 makes it challenging to identify virus-specific skin manifestations. Petechiae, purpura, acrocyanosis and necrotic and non-necrotic purpura, which can be considered as manifestations of vascular involvement on the skin, have been reported. CASE REPORT Here, we report a case of eruptive cherry angiomas, which was thought to have developed due to COVID-19, with a papulovesicular rash on distal extremities that progressed over time to reticular purpura. CONCLUSION The case presented had a papulovesicular rash at the onset, which evolved to retiform purpura, and eruptive cherry angiomas were observed.

133075,Centralisation of complex urological surgery and understanding the three Es: is it inevitable?,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND Barbed suture has been adopted across all surgical specialties. One of the infrequent complications seen with the use of barbed suture is small bowel obstructions (SBOs). In this study, we perform a review of the literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) to characterize SBOs after the use of barbed sutures in a variety of operative procedures. METHODS A review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed and Ovid. We used the search terms: ""barbed,"" ""suture,"" ""bowel,"" and ""obstructions."" For each case report, we examined the initial surgical procedure, type of barbed suture used, the type of complication, the time to complication, the presentation, and the type of operative interventions required. We did the same with the MAUDE database. RESULTS Our review of the literature revealed 18 different cases of SBO secondary to the use of barbed suture. The four most common procedures, with a total of four cases each, were inguinal hernia procedures, myomectomy, hysterectomy, and pelvic floor reconstructive procedures. The average time of presentation to SBO was found to be 26.3 days post-op (1-196 days). A total of 16 patients (88.9%) presented with abdominal pain. Other common complaints included vomiting (33.3%), abdominal distension (27.8%), oral intolerance (22.2%), and constipation (16.7%). A total of 5 cases were also found to have a possible volvulus on computed tomography (CT), and 2 cases were reported to have strangulation. The MAUDE database had 14 cases reporting on obstruction. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons should have a high index of suspicion for SBO if a patient presents with obstructive symptoms after a surgery that used barbed suture. This will often present as a mesenteric volvulus on CT. These particular SBOs require operative exploration, with laparoscopy being successful in the majority of cases.","Clapp, Benjamin; Klingsporn, William; Lodeiro, Carlos; Wicker, Ellen; Christensen, Loyd; Jones, Robert; Tyroch, Alan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06890-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183792/,49

Here the degradation performance of different types of BPs was investigated in the natural environment. Their degradation levels followed the order of pure BPs> BP blends> claimed ""BP""≈ non-biodegradable plastic after 6-month incubation. Photo- and biodegradation were the main degradation mechanisms of these plastics in the air and soil, respectively. Poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) exhibited the highest weight loss potentials in both air (54.7 ± 9.1%) and soil (56.8 ± 4.8%), due to its special ether bond and the rich and diverse microorganisms on its biofilms. The microbiota on PPDO was distinct and enriched with Chloroflexi and Firmicutes that responsible for carbon cycle and organic degradation. The weight loss was only 1.1-8.0% for poly(lactic acid), and 0.8-6.8% for poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), and other plastics are basically non-degradable. Of note, numerous microplastics were formed after PPDO degradation, with 441 ± 326 and 2103 ± 131 item/g plastic in the air and soil, respectively. Taken together, the monitoring of BP biodegradation in the natural environment is of vital importance, and it is risky to promote large-scale application of BPs if the knowledge gap of their environmental behavior has not been well addressed.","Liao, Jin; Chen, Qiqing",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118549/,49
133729,Coronavirus is in the air - there's too much focus on surfaces.,2021-02-01,"A total of 140 weanling pigs (241 × 600, DNA, Columbus, NE initially 5.5 ± 0.79 kg bodyweight) were used in a 32-d study evaluating the effects of increasing dietary Fe from either iron sulfate (FeSO4) or iron carbonate (FeCO3) on nursery pig growth performance and blood Fe status. The pigs used for this trial did not receive an Fe injection after birth in order to increase sensitivity to added dietary Fe after weaning. Pigs were weaned at approximately 21 d and allotted to pens based on initial weight in a completely randomized block design with 5 pigs in each pen and 4 pens per treatment. Experimental treatments were arranged as a 2 × 3 + 1 factorial with main effects of dietary Fe source (FeSO4 vs. FeCO3) and level (10, 30, or 50 mg/kg of added Fe) plus a negative control with no additional dietary Fe. The basal diet contained 40 mg/kg total dietary Fe based on ingredient contributions and was formulated with an Fe-free trace mineral premix. Experimental diets were formulated below the pigs recommended Fe requirement based on NRC (2012) estimates. Experimental diets were fed in pellet form in a single phase for the duration of the trial. From d 0 to 32, there was no evidence for source × level interactions for growth performance, hemoglobin (Hb), or hematocrit (Hct) values. There was no evidence for a difference (P > 0.10) in dietary Fe source. Providing increasing Fe levels in the diet from either FeSO4 or FeCO3 improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain, average daily feed intake, gain-to-feed ratio, and increased (P < 0.05) Hb and Hct values. A day effect (P = 0.001) was observed for both Hb and Hct with values increasing throughout the study. Increasing dietary Fe levels in the diet from either FeSO4 or FeCO3 increased (linear; P < 0.05) Hb and Hct values on d 14, 21, and 32. In summary, these data suggest that the micronized form of FeCO3 is a source of Fe that can be added to nursery diets to yield similar responses to those observed from FeSO4 supplementation. Similar to previous research, increasing dietary Fe improved growth performance and increased Hb and Hct values when pigs have low Fe status at weaning.","Williams, Hayden E; Woodworth, Jason C; DeRouchey, Joel M; Dritz, Steven S; Tokach, Michael D; Fry, Robert S; Kocher, Matt E; Usry, James L; Goodband, Robert D",Journal of animal science,https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skaa211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32619217/,49

RAS pathway mutations, mainly NRASG12D, define the pCMML phenotype as demonstrated by our exome sequencing, progenitor colony assays and a Vav-Cre-NrasG12D mouse model. Further, these mutations promote CMML transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Using a multiomics platform and biochemical and molecular studies we show that in pCMML RAS pathway mutations are associated with a unique gene expression profile enriched in mitotic kinases such as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). PLK1 transcript levels are shown to be regulated by an unmutated lysine methyl-transferase (KMT2A) resulting in increased promoter monomethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3. Pharmacologic inhibition of PLK1 in RAS mutant patient-derived xenografts, demonstrates the utility of personalized biomarker-driven therapeutics in pCMML.","Carr, Ryan M; Vorobyev, Denis; Lasho, Terra; Marks, David L; Tolosa, Ezequiel J; Vedder, Alexis; Almada, Luciana L; Yurcheko, Andrey; Padioleau, Ismael; Alver, Bonnie; Coltro, Giacomo; Binder, Moritz; Safgren, Stephanie L; Horn, Isaac; You, Xiaona; Solary, Eric; Balasis, Maria E; Berger, Kurt; Hiebert, James; Witzig, Thomas; Buradkar, Ajinkya; Graf, Temeida; Valent, Peter; Mangaonkar, Abhishek A; Robertson, Keith D; Howard, Matthew T; Kaufmann, Scott H; Pin, Christopher; Fernandez-Zapico, Martin E; Geissler, Klaus; Droin, Nathalie; Padron, Eric; Zhang, Jing; Nikolaev, Sergey; Patnaik, Mrinal M",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23186-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006870/,49

We aimed to assess the effect of indomethacin on the rate of BABES and short-term cardiovascular mortality, particularly in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy (APT).In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center study, 100 mg indomethacin or placebo was given within 1 hour before biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy to in-patients including those who are receiving APT (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA] and/or clopidogrel). Cardiovascular mortality and BABES were observed for 30 days.Of 576 randomized patients (289 indomethacin, 287 placebo), 87 patients used 100 mg/day ASA and 29 patients took 75 mg/day clopidogrel, among them 5 patients were on dual APT. The ASA and clopidogrel taking patients were older than patients without APT (P < 0.001), but these groups were similar in other parameters. BABES occurred similarly in different subgroups: indomethacin (8.0%) vs placebo (9.4%) (P = 0.56), ASA (10.3%) vs non-ASA (8.4%) (P = 0.54), clopidogrel (6.9%) vs nonclopidogrel (8.8%) (P > 0.99). No BABES was observed among patients on dual APT. There was no difference in cardiovascular mortality between subgroups (P > 0.99).Results indicate that single dose of 100 mg indomethacin does not increase BABES rate and cardiovascular mortality. This result is independent from administering antiplatelet agents.","Patai, Árpád; Solymosi, Norbert; Patai, Arpád V",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000000159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25474427/,49

In this study, we analyzed the molecular, biochemical, and antioxidant properties of GST alpha-4 from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaGSTA-4). Also, the spatial and temporal expression of HaGSTA-4 upon immune challenge with abiotic and biotic stimulants were evaluated. The HaGSTA-4 ORF encodes 223 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25.7 kDa, and an estimated isoelectric point (pI) of 8.47. It consists of the GST_C superfamily and thioredoxin-like superfamily domain. The phylogenetic tree revealed that HaGSTA-4 is evolutionarily conserved with its GST alpha class counterparts. From pairwise alignment, the highest values of identity (78.5%) and similarity (85.7%) were with Parambassis ranga GSTA-4. Protein rHaGSTA-4 exhibited the highest conjugation activity towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) at pH 7 and 20 °C. A disk diffusion assay showed that rHaGSTA-4 significantly protects cells from the stress of exposure to ROS inducers such as CuSO4, CdCl2, and ZnCl2. Furthermore, overexpressed HaGSTA-4 defended cells against oxidative stress caused by H2O2; evidence of selenium-independent peroxidase activity. From qPCR, the tissue-specific expression profile demonstrates that HaGSTA-4 is most highly expressed in the kidney, followed by the intestine and stomach, among fourteen different tissues extracted from healthy seahorses. The mRNA expression profile of HaGSTA-4 upon immune challenge varied depending on the tissue and the time after challenge. Altogether, this study suggests that HaGSTA-4 may be involved in protection against oxidative stress, in immune defense regulation, and xenobiotic metabolism.","Nadarajapillai, Kishanthini; Liyanage, D S; Sellaththurai, Sarithaa; Jeong, Taehyug; Lee, Sukkyoung; Lee, Jehee",Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

134592,Endoscopic saphenous vein and radial harvest: state-of-the-art.,2015,"BACKGROUND Mechanical ventilation technology has evolved rapidly over the last 30 years. One consequence is the creation of an unmanageable number of names to describe modes of ventilation. The proliferation of names makes education of end users difficult, potentially compromising the quality of patient care. OBJECTIVE To determine if stakeholders are familiar enough with published constructs related to modes of mechanical ventilation to form a basis for a consensus, by surveying the medical, education, and business communities. The hypotheses tested were: there is concordance (> 50%) on 10 basic constructs related to modes; concordance with the basic constructs varies among stakeholders according to professional training and professional activity; and concordance varies among the set of constructs. METHODS The survey was distributed through an Internet-based tool to 2,994 physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, engineers, and others involved with mechanical ventilation. Hypotheses were tested with chi-square, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS The response rate was 15%. Respondents were 55% respiratory therapists, 35% physicians, 3% nurses, 1% engineers, and 5% other professionals. There was an 82% concordance with the 10 constructs (P < .001). Respiratory therapists showed the highest degree of concordance (84%) and ""other profession"" showed the lowest (79%) (P = .006). No significant difference (P = .07) in concordance was observed when data were grouped by professional activity. Concordance differed significantly among the survey questions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Survey results indicate that respondents were either familiar with or amenable to the previously published literature that the survey constructs represented. The degree of familiarity and concordance with these constructs represents a sufficient basis for attempting to formalize a taxonomy. Further analysis of the pattern of concordance among the constructs will inform future educational and consensus building efforts.","Chatburn, Robert L; Volsko, Teresa A; Hazy, John; Harris, Louis N; Sanders, Salvatore",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22004898/,49

Nevertheless, the workflows used differ depending on the applied camera, the plants being imaged, the experience of the users, and the measurement set-up. RESULTS This review describes a general workflow for the assessment and processing of hyperspectral plant data at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Aiming at a detailed description of possible error sources, a comprehensive literature review of possibilities to overcome these errors and influences is provided. The processing of hyperspectral data of plants starting from the hardware sensor calibration, the software processing steps to overcome sensor inaccuracies, and the preparation for machine learning is shown and described in detail. Furthermore, plant traits extracted from spectral hypercubes are categorized to standardize the terms used when describing hyperspectral traits in plant phenotyping. A scientific data perspective is introduced covering information for canopy, single organs, plant development, and also combined traits coming from spectral and 3D measuring devices. CONCLUSIONS This publication provides a structured overview on implementing hyperspectral imaging into biological studies at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Workflows have been categorized to define a trait-level scale according to their metrological level and the processing complexity. A general workflow is shown to outline procedures and requirements to provide fully calibrated data of the highest quality.

135793,"Erratum to ""Mixed tumors of the canine mammary glands: Evaluation of prognostic factors, treatment, and overall survival"" [7C (June 2019) 100039].",2020-06-01,"Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are regulators of protein metabolism. However, elevated levels of BCAAs and their metabolites are linked to insulin resistance. We previously demonstrated that the leucine metabolite, α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport in myotubes. Like KIC, inflammatory factors are implicated in the development of insulin resistance. Here, we analyzed the effect of KIC and inflammatory factors (homocysteine [50 μM], TNF-α [10 ng/ml], and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [10 ng/ml]) on myotubes. Although KIC suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose transport, addition of the inflammatory factors did not worsen this effect. Depletion of branched-chain aminotransferase 2, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of leucine into KIC, abrogated the effect of KIC and the inflammatory factors. The effect of insulin on AKTS473 and S6K1T389 phosphorylation was not modified by treatments. There were no treatment effects on glycogen synthase phosphorylation. Depletion of E1α subunit of branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of KIC, suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose transport, especially in cells incubated in KIC. Thus, defects in BCAA catabolism are contributory to insulin resistance of glucose transport in myotubes, especially in the presence of KIC. Interventions that increase BCAA catabolism may promote muscle glucose utilization and improve insulin resistance and its sequelae.","Mann, Gagandeep; Adegoke, Olasunkanmi A J",Physiological reports,https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400857/,49
135977,Utilization of iron (III)-doped nanoshells for in vivo marking of nonpalpable tumors using a VX2 rabbit model.,2016,"Digital health and telehealth connectivity have become important aspects of clinical care. Connected devices, including continuous glucose monitors and automated insulin delivery systems for diabetes, are being used increasingly to support personalized clinical decisions based on automatically collected data. Furthermore, the development, demand, and coverage for telehealth have all recently expanded, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical care, and especially diabetes care, are therefore becoming more digital through the use of both connected digital health devices and telehealth communication. It has therefore become necessary to integrate digital data into the electronic health record and maintain personal data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Connected digital monitoring combined with telehealth communication is known as virtual health. For this virtual care paradigm to be successful, patients must have proper skills, training, and equipment. We propose that along with the five current vital signs of blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, and pain, at this time, digital connectivity should be considered as the sixth vital sign. In this article, we present a scale to assess digital connectivity.","Klonoff, David C; Shang, Trisha; Zhang, Jennifer Y; Cengiz, Eda; Mehta, Chhavi; Kerr, David",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968211015241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980049/,49

However, the mechanism of downregulation of Tregs in URSA patients is still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the changes of Tregs in URSA patients and the epigenetic regulation for these changes. Venous blood samples were collected from 20 patients with URSA and 20 healthy control subjects. Treg number and inhibitory capacity, and Foxp3 mRNA expression and Foxp3 TSDR methylation were compared between the 2 groups. Correlations between Treg frequency and inhibitory function and TSDR methylation status were examined by Spearman's correlation. The proportion of Tregs within the population of CD4+ T cells and the expression of Foxp3 mRNA was significantly lower in URSA patients than in healthy control subjects. Tregs from URSA patients and healthy controls both significantly inhibited the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells toward K562 targets; however, the inhibitory ability of Tregs from URSA patients was significantly lower than that from healthy controls. The methylation level of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) in the Foxp3 gene was significantly greater in URSA patients than in the controls, and the level of methylation was inversely correlated with the proportion of Tregs and Foxp3 mRNA expression in the peripheral blood. However, the methylation level was not correlated with the inhibitory function of Tregs. A decrease of Treg number and function may be related to the pathogenesis of URSA, and Foxp3 hypermethylation may be associated with the decreased Treg number.","Zhu, Liqiong; Liu, Meilan; Zhang, Suning; Ou, Yuhua; Chen, Ying; Wei, Jing; Su, Fang; Chen, Hui; Zhang, Jianping",Reproductive sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-020-00299-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839941/,49

Clinical complication and fatality rate is much higher for patients having co-morbid issues. Compromised immune response and hyper inflammation is hall mark of pathogenesis and major cause of mortality. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is a term used to affiliate the situation of hyper inflammation and therefore use of anti-cytokine and anti-inflammatory drugs is used to take care of this situation. Looking into the clinical benefit of these anti-inflammatory drugs, many of them enter into clinical trials. However, understanding the immunopathology of COVID-19 is important otherwise, indiscriminate use of these drugs could be fetal as there exists a very fine line of difference between viral clearing cytokines and inflammatory cytokines. If any drug suppresses the viral clearing cytokines, it will worsen the situation and hence, the use of these drugs must be based on the clinical condition, viral load, co-existing disease condition and severity of the infection.","Iqubal, Ashif; Hoda, Farazul; Najmi, Abul Kalam; Haque, Syed Ehtaishamul",Drug research,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1291-7692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434935/,49

VPA has been increasingly associated with intentional or unintentional overdose. In patients presenting with severe VPA overdose, supportive care and airway protection are cornerstones of treatment, while levocarnitine is suggested in patients with hyperammonemia and hemodialysis is recommended in patients with VPA serum concentrations (SC) >1,300 mg/L and presence of cerebral edema or shock. Meropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity. The pharmacological interaction between VPA and meropenem is characterized by a rapid decrease in VPA concentrations, which contraindicates concurrent use. Case presentation The following case report describes the use of meropenem to enhance the clearance of VPA in the case of severe VPA overdose. A patient with altered mental status was transported to the emergency department (ED) after VPA overdose. Meropenem was prescribed for significant elevated VPA SC. An important decline in SC was observed with short-term meropenem dosing, and an improvement in mental status occurred shortly after administration. Conclusions Carbapenem therapy has the potential to be used as last line strategy in the management of severe VPA overdose in patients where SC represent a significant risk of toxicity and clinical symptoms suggest difficulty managing the patient.","Muñoz-Pichuante, Daniel; Villa-Zapata, Lorenzo; Lolas, Russi",Drug metabolism and personalized therapy,https://doi.org/10.1515/dmpt-2019-0028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609645/,49

Recent clinical reports support the notion of a direct link between laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections and adverse cardiac events. Objective: Define the molecular mechanisms underlying influenza virus-induced cardiac pathogenesis after resolution of pulmonary infection and the role of necroptosis in this process.Methods and Results: Hearts from wild-type and necroptosis deficient (MLKL-KO) mice were dissected twelve days after initial Influenza A virus (IAV) infection when viral titers were undetectable in the lungs. Immunofluorescence microscopy and plaque assays showed presence of viable IAV particles in the myocardium without generation of interferon responses. Global proteome and phosphoproteome analyses using high resolution accurate mass based LC-MS/MS and label-free quantitation showed that the global proteome as well as the phosphoproteome profiles were significantly altered in IAV-infected mouse hearts in a strain independent manner. Necroptosis deficient mice had increased survival and reduced weight loss post-IAV infection, as well as increased antioxidant and mitochondrial function, indicating partial protection to IAV infection. These findings were confirmed in vitro by pre-treatment of human and rat myocytes with antioxidants or necroptosis inhibitors, which blunted oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage after IAV infection. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that the cardiac proteome and phosphoproteome are significantly altered post pulmonary influenza infection. Moreover, viral particles can persist in the heart after lung clearance, altering mitochondrial function and promoting cell death without active replication and interferon responses. Finally, our findings show inhibition of necroptosis or prevention of mitochondrial damage as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce cardiac damage during influenza infections.","Lin, Yi-Han; Platt, Maryann; Gilley, Ryan P; Brown, David; Dube, Peter H; Yu, Yanbao; Gonzalez-Juarbe, Norberto",Circulation research,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.120.318511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501852/,49

This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels but also disrupt sleep. Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioral therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and homeschooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.","Altena, Ellemarije; Baglioni, Chiara; Espie, Colin A; Ellis, Jason; Gavriloff, Dimitri; Holzinger, Brigitte; Schlarb, Angelika; Frase, Lukas; Jernelöv, Susanna; Riemann, Dieter",Journal of sleep research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246787/,49

Through image-guided techniques, it is possible to use minimally invasive procedures with a percutaneous approach that are usually proposed before classic surgery. Thanks to imaging guidance, it is possible to significantly increase accuracy and decrease complication rates. The pivotal principle of these mini-invasive techniques is to remove a small amount of volume of the nucleus of the intervertebral disc which results in a significant reduction in intradiscal pressure; allowing for a consequent reduction in compression of the nervous structures that generate spinal pain. However, it must be considered that this type of treatment is only addressed to contained disc herniations previously diagnosed with a suitable neuroimaging examination. There are different types of treatment using a variety of chemical, thermal or mechanical processes that result in partial removal of the nucleus pulposus. The purpose of this technical note is to illustrate mechanical disc decompression treatment via a percutaneous approach using the DISKOM device (DISKOM percutaneous discectomy probe, Biopsybell, Mirandola, Italy).

To aid in this effort, we developed a general population risk calculator for COVID-19 mortality based on various sociodemographic factors and pre-existing conditions for the US population, combining information from the UK-based OpenSAFELY study with mortality rates by age and ethnicity across US states. We tailored the tool to produce absolute risk estimates in future time frames by incorporating information on pandemic dynamics at the community level. We applied the model to data on risk factor distribution from a variety of sources to project risk for the general adult population across 477 US cities and for the Medicare population aged 65 years and older across 3,113 US counties, respectively. Validation analyses using 54,444 deaths from 7 June to 1 October 2020 show that the model is well calibrated for the US population. Projections show that the model can identify relatively small fractions of the population (for example 4.3%) that might experience a disproportionately large number of deaths (for example 48.7%), but there is wide variation in risk across communities.

Bariatric surgery is the most effective intervention for sustained weight loss of morbidly obese patients, but WR remains a concern. MATERIALS AND METHODS A PRISMA compliant systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed database, Embase and the Cochrane Library in July of 2019. Studies that reported ≥ 10% WR after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used for assessing study quality. RESULTS Out of 2915 retrieved abstracts, 272 full papers were reviewed, and 32 studies included (25 of high and 7 of fair quality) reporting weight outcomes on 7391 RYGB and 5872 SG patients. 17.6% (95% CI 16.9-18.3) had a WR ≥ 10%. Risk factors related with WR fell into 5 categories, namely anatomical, genetic, dietary, psychiatric, and temporal. Specifically, gastrojejunal stoma diameter, gastric volume following sleeve, anxiety, time after surgery, sweet consumption, emotional eating, portion size, food urges, binge eating, loss of control/disinhibition when eating, and genetics have been positively associated with WR while postprandial GLP-1, eagerness to change physical activity habits, self-esteem, social support, fruit and zinc consumption, HDL, quality of life have been negatively associated. CONCLUSION At least 1 in 6 patients after bariatric surgery had ≥ 10% WR. This review identified several factors related to WR that can be used to counsel patients preoperatively and direct postoperative strategies that minimize WR risk.","Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Martin, Anna; Kapsampelis, Panagiotis; Monfared, Sara; Stefanidis, Dimitrios",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08329-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650001/,49

Methods and Results We examined the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke ( GWTG -Stroke) data to explore the usefulness of SI in predicting in-hospital outcomes in 425 808 acute stroke cases (mean age: 71.0±14.5 years; 48.8% male; 89.7% ischemic stroke and 10.3% intracerebral hemorrhage) admitted between October 2012 and March 2015. Compared with patients with SI of 0.5 to 0.7, patients with SI >0.7 (13.6% of the sample) had worse outcomes, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.00 (95% confidence interval [ CI ], 1.92-2.08) for in-hospital mortality, 1.46 (95% CI , 1.43-1.49) for longer length of hospital stay >4 days, 1.50 (95% CI , 1.47-1.54) for discharge destination other than home, 1.41 (95% CI , 1.38-1.45) for inability to ambulate independently at discharge, and 1.52 (95% CI , 1.47-1.57) for modified Rankin Scale score of 3 to 6 at discharge. Results were similar when analyses were confined to those with available National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or within individual stroke subtypes or when SI was additionally included in the models with or without blood pressure components. Every 0.1 increase in SI >0.5 was associated with significantly worse outcomes in linear spline models. The addition of SI to existing GWTG -Stroke mortality prediction models without NIHSS demonstrated modest improvement, but little to no improvement was noted in models with NIHSS . Conclusions SI calculated at the point of care may be a useful prognostic indicator to identify those with high risk of poor outcomes in acute stroke, especially in hospitals with limited experience with NIHSS assessment.","Myint, Phyo Kyaw; Sheng, Shubin; Xian, Ying; Matsouaka, Roland A; Reeves, Mathew J; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Fonarow, Gregg C; Schwamm, Lee H; Smith, Eric E",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.117.007581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371191/,49

Currently, mounting evidence has shown the occurrence of neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, the detailed mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 attacks the brain is not well characterized. Recent investigations have revealed that a cytokine storm contributes to brain inflammation and subsequently triggers neurological manifestations during the COVID-19 outbreak. Targeting brain inflammation may provide significant clues to the treatment of neurologic complications caused by SARS-CoV-2. Vascular growth factor (VEGF), which is widely distributed in the brain, probably plays a crucial role in brain inflammation via facilitating the recruitment of inflammatory cells and regulating the level of angiopoietins II (Ang II). Also, Ang II is considered as the products of SARS-CoV-2-attacking target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Further investigation of the therapeutic potential and the underlying mechanisms of VEGF-targeted drugs on the neurological signs of COVID-19 are warranted. In any case, VEGF is deemed a promising therapeutic target in suppressing inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection with neurological symptoms.","Yin, Xi-Xi; Zheng, Xiang-Rong; Peng, Wang; Wu, Mao-Lan; Mao, Xiao-Yuan",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32485101/,49

This study evaluates the addition of a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block to the standard ERP. METHODS In this study, 35 consecutive elective patients received a TAP block at the end of LC. The patients were matched by operation, diagnosis, age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) with 35 recent cases and followed in a prospective institutional review board (IRB)-approved database. All the patients were managed with a standardized ERP. The surgeon placed TAP blocks under laparoscopic guidance that infiltrated 15 ml of 0.5 % Marcaine on both sides of the abdomen. RESULTS The cases included 8 low pelvic anastomoses, 4 proctectomies with or without an ileal pouch anal anastomosis, 5 sigmoid/left colectomies, 13 ileocolic/right colectomies, 1 total colectomy, and 5 others. The mean age was 59 years for the TAP group and 64.1 years for the control group (p = 0.21). The mean hospital stay was 2 days for the TAP patients and 3 days for the control patients (p = 0.000013). Of the 35 TAP patients, 13 went home on postoperative day (POD) 1 (37 %), 12 on POD 2 (34 %), 8 on POD 3 (23 %), and the remainder on POD 4.

RESULTS Compared to SN and regardless of MJ use, the HIV+ group had lower FA and higher diffusivities in multiple white matter and subcortical structures (p < 0.001-0.050), as well as poorer cognition in Fluency (p = 0.039), Attention/Working Memory (p = 0.009), Learning (p = 0.014), and Memory (p = 0.028). Regardless of HIV serostatus, MJ users had lower AD in uncinate fasciculus (p = 0.024) but similar cognition as nonusers. HIV serostatus and MJ use showed an interactive effect on mean diffusivity in the right globus pallidus but not on cognitive function. Furthermore, lower FA in left anterior internal capsule predicted poorer Fluency across all participants and worse Attention/Working Memory in all except SN subjects, while higher diffusivities in several white matter tracts also predicted lower cognitive domain Z-scores. Lastly, MJ users with or without HIV infection showed greater than normal age-dependent FA declines in superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and globus pallidus. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that, except in the globus pallidus, chronic MJ use had no additional negative influence on brain microstructure or neurocognitive deficits in HIV+ individuals. However, lower AD in the uncinate fasciculus of MJ users suggests axonal loss in this white matter tract that connects to cannabinoid receptor rich brain regions that are involved in verbal memory and emotion. Furthermore, the greater than normal age-dependent FA declines in the white matter tracts and globus pallidus in MJ users suggest that older chronic MJ users may eventually have lesser neuronal integrity in these brain regions.","Wang, Hannah A; Liang, Hua-Jun; Ernst, Thomas M; Oishi, Kenichi; Chang, Linda",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-020-01910-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758262/,49
144077,Hepatocytes direct the formation of a pro-metastatic niche in the liver.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may cause blindness due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Venous sinus stenosis has been identified in select patients, leading to stenting as a potential treatment, but its effects on global ICP have not been completely defined. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of venous sinus stenting on ICP in a small group of patients with IIH. METHODS Ten patients for whom medical therapy had failed were prospectively followed. Ophthalmological examinations were assessed, and patients with venous sinus stenosis on MR angiography proceeded to catheter angiography, venography with assessment of pressure gradient, and ICP monitoring. Patients with elevated ICP measurements and an elevated pressure gradient across the stenosis were treated with stent placement. RESULTS All patients had elevated venous pressure (mean 39.5 ± 14.9 mm Hg), an elevated gradient across the venous sinus stenosis (30.0 ± 13.2 mm Hg), and elevated ICP (42.2 ± 15.9 mm Hg). Following stent placement, all patients had resolution of the stenosis and gradient (1 ± 1 mm Hg). The ICP values showed an immediate decrease (to a mean of 17.0 ± 8.3 mm Hg), and further decreased overnight (to a mean of 8 ± 4.2 mm Hg). All patients had subjective and objective improvement, and all but one improved during follow-up (median 23.4 months; range 15.7-31.6 months). Two patients developed stent-adjacent stenosis; retreatment abolished the stenosis and gradient in both cases. Patients presenting with papilledema had resolution on follow-up funduscopic imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) and improvement on visual field testing. Patients presenting with optic atrophy had optic nerve thinning on follow-up OCT, but improved visual fields. CONCLUSIONS For selected patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis with an elevated pressure gradient and elevated ICP, venous sinus stenting results in resolution of the venous pressure gradient, reduction in ICP, and functional, neurological, and ophthalmological improvement. As patients are at risk for stent-adjacent stenosis, further follow-up is necessary to determine long-term outcomes and gain an understanding of venous sinus stenosis as a primary or secondary pathological process behind elevated ICP.","Liu, Kenneth C; Starke, Robert M; Durst, Christopher R; Wang, Tony R; Ding, Dale; Crowley, R Webster; Newman, Steven A",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.8.jns16879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009240/,49

METHODS A 53-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. One thousand twenty patients with primary knee OA were randomized to naproxcinod 750 mg, naproxcinod 375 mg, naproxen 500 mg, or placebo (all bid). Coprimary efficacy endpoints were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC™) pain and function subscales and patient overall rating of disease status. An analysis of covariance model tested superiority for both naproxcinod doses over placebo at week 13, and noninferiority of naproxcinod 750 mg bid versus naproxen at weeks 13 and 26. RESULTS Least-square mean changes from baseline were greater for both naproxcinod doses compared with placebo at week 13 for WOMAC pain (-31.3 [standard error 1.67], -28.1 [1.64], and -20.4 [1.62] mm with naproxcinod 750 mg bid [P < 0.0001], 375 mg bid [P = 0.0008], and placebo, respectively), WOMAC function (-27.8 [1.60], -23.8 [1.58], and -14.9 [1.56] mm, respectively, P < 0.0001), and patient overall rating of disease status (1.00 [0.061], 0.81 [0.060], and 0.49 [0.059], respectively, P < 0.0001). Naproxcinod 750 mg bid was noninferior to naproxen at weeks 13 and 26. Naproxcinod was well tolerated, with no notable differences in orthostatic blood pressure response between treatments. CONCLUSION Naproxcinod 750 mg bid and 375 mg bid demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo for treatment of OA and were well tolerated over 1 year. Naproxcinod 750 mg bid was noninferior to naproxen 500 mg bid.","Schnitzer, Thomas J; Hochberg, Marc C; Marrero, Christopher E; Duquesroix, Brigitte; Frayssinet, Hayet; Beekman, Maarten",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2010.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20828790/,49
144579,A basal-bolus insulin regimen integrated microneedle patch for intraday postprandial glucose control.,2020-07-01,"PURPOSE A new medical linear accelerator (linac) platform integrated with helical computed tomography (CT), the uRT-linac 506c, was introduced into clinical application in 2019 by United Imaging Healthcare (UIH) Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). It combines a Carm linac with a diagnostic-quality 16-slice CT imager, providing seamless workflow from simulation to treatment. The aim of this report is to assess the technical characteristics, commissioning results and preliminary experiences stemming from clinical usage. METHODS The mechanical and imaging test procedures, commissioning data collection and TPS validation were summarized. CTIGRT accuracy was investigated with different loads and couch extensions. A series of end-to-end cases for different treatment sites and delivery techniques were tested preclinically to estimate the overall accuracy for the entire treatment scheme. The results of patient-specific QA and machine stability during a one-year operation are also reported. RESULTS Gantry/couch/collimator isocentricity was measured as 0.63 mm in radius. The TPS models were in agreement with the beam commissioning data within a deviation of 2%. An overall submillimeter accuracy was demonstrated for the CT-IGRT process under all conditions. The absolute point dose difference for all the preclinical end-to-end tests was within 3%, and the gamma passing rate of the 2D dose distribution measured by EBT3 film was better than 90% (3% DD, 3 mm DTA and 10% threshold). Pretreatment QA of clinical cases resulted with better than 3% point dose difference and more than 99% gamma passing rate (3% DD/2 mm DTA/10% threshold) tested with Delta4. The output of the linac was mostly within 1% of variation in a one-year operation. CONCLUSION The commissioning results and clinical QA results show that the uRT-linac 506c platform exhibits good and stable performance in mechanical and dosimetric accuracy. The integrated CT system provides an efficient workflow for image guidance with submillimeter localization precision, and will be a good starting point to proceed advanced adaptive radiotherapy.","Yu, Lei; Zhao, Jun; Zhang, Zhen; Wang, Jiazhou; Hu, Weigang",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.13313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151504/,49

145490,"Optimum cystic duct closure: a comparative study using metallic clips, ENSEAL, and ENDOLOOP in swine.",2013,"In this work we tested two reagent kits developed by us for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA using a fragment of the ORF1ab gene in digital PCR and real-time PCR formats. Data were obtained on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19 and asymptomatic carriers. The developed reagent kits provided 100% sensitivity and a detection limit of 103 GE / ml for qPCR, and at least 200 copies / ml of viral RNA when performing digital PCR. These methods were tested using a panel of 1,328 samples collected from patients with suspected COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 in the Russian Federation. It has been shown that dPCR is more sensitive and can be used to analyze samples with low viral load, including those from patients without clinical symptoms. dPCR significantly improves the accuracy of laboratory research and significantly reduces the number of false negative results in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Determination of the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients with different clinical course of the disease showed that the concentration of viral RNA can sharply decrease in the first days of the disease. A low concentration of viral RNA in samples from patients is also characteristic of asymptomatic disease. Digital PCR provides a higher detection rate for asymptomatic cases, which is approximately 75% of those infected, as opposed to 45% for real-time PCR. The results obtained on the use of the digital PCR method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed that this method is especially suitable for detecting RNA in case of its low concentration in contacts, as well as for monitoring changes in viral load in convalescent patients.","Ternovoi, V A; Lutkovsky, R Yu; Ponomareva, E P; Gladysheva, A V; Chub, E V; Tupota, N L; Smirnova, A M; Nazarenko, A A; Loktev, V B; Gavrilova, E V; Agafonov, A P; Maksyutov, R A",Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,https://doi.org/10.18821/0869-2084-2020-65-12-785-792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33373511/,49

Family-centred care (FCC) underpins policy directions for universal, community-based, child and family health services in the early years, although its implementation in this context is poorly understood. This systematic scoping review of the current literature aimed to improve understanding of FCC implementation in maternal, child, and family health universal services. Key databases and grey literature were searched using descriptors of maternal, child, and family health population and context, and FCC concept. Reference checking identified further literature for analysis. Thirteen included papers reported on nine studies from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Limited participant representation of fathers and diverse community members was evident. Deductive thematic analysis identified four areas of FCC demonstrated in this literature: respectful relationships, effective communication to foster shared understanding, flexible and contextualized care, and support for autonomy and agency. The literature demonstrated the interplay between organizational, professional, and recipient factors and their impact on the implementation of FCC. For successful FCC implementation, all these elements should be considered.","Ridgway, Lael; Hackworth, Naomi; Nicholson, Jan M; McKenna, Lisa",Journal of child health care : for professionals working with children in the hospital and community,https://doi.org/10.1177/1367493520930172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602735/,49

146728,Infantile Thinking Against a Childish Measure? Can Artificial Intelligence Help Knock Author Metrics into Shape?,2020-06-01,"Background Pupillary response by pupillary dilatation reflex (PDR) is a robust reflex, even measurable during general anaesthesia. However, the ability of infrared pupillometry to detect PDR differences obtained by intraoperative opioid administration in anaesthesized patients remains largely unknown. We analyzed the performance of automated infrared pupillometry in detecting differences in pupillary dilatation reflex response by a inbuilt standardized nociceptive stimulation program in patients under general anesthesia with a standardized propofol/fentanyl scheme. Methods In this single center, interventional cohort study 38 patients (24-74 years) were enrolled. Patients were anesthetized with propofol until loss of consciousness. Two dynamic pupil measurements were performed in each patient (before opioid administration and after opioid steady state). Automated infrared pupillometry was used to determine PDR during nociceptive stimulations (10-60 mA) applied by a inbuilt pupillary pain index protocol (PPI) to the skin area innervated by the median nerve. Increasing stimulations by protocol are device specific and automatically performed until pupil dilation of > 13%. Pupil characteristics, blood pressure, heart rate values were collected. Results After opioid administration, patients needed a higher stimulation intensity (45.26 mA vs 30.79 mA, p = 0.00001). PPI score showed a reduction after analgesic treatment (5.21 vs 7.68, p = 0.000001), resulting in a 32.16% score reduction. Conclusions PDR via automated increased tetanic stimulation may reflect opioid effect under general anaesthesia. Further research is required to detect possible confounding factors such as medication interaction and optimization of individualized opioid dosage.","Wildemeersch, Davina; Baeten, Michiel; Peeters, Natasja; Saldien, Vera; Vercauteren, Marcel; Hans, Guy",Romanian journal of anaesthesia and intensive care,https://doi.org/10.21454/rjaic.7518.251.wil; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29756058/,49
146763,Is the coronavirus airborne? Experts can't agree.,2020-04-02,"PURPOSE Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a well-known, non-steroidal estrogen with high affinity to the estrogen receptor (ER). Labeled DES would be a useful tool for therapy of ER-positive mammary carcinomas and their metastases. Particularly with Auger emitters, high cytotoxic potential combined with only slight side effects can be expected. MATERIALS AND METHODS DES was labeled by a new method with higher yield and specific activity than former methods. Cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 (human, Caucasian, breast, adenocarcinoma) cells, were tested in relation to radioactivity concentration applied and location of decay. Different iodine isotopes ((123)I, (125)I, (131)I) bound to DES or in the form of iodide were compared with regard to induction of intracellular DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) fragmentation, and decrease of viability. For this purpose the 'Cell Death Detection Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA)' and the water soluble tetrazolium salt WST-1 were used. The radiation protective effects of the radical scavenger vitamin C were also tested. RESULTS The experiments showed a significantly lower viability of cells exposed to the Auger emitters than those with the beta-emitter (131)I. All nuclides induced intracellular DNA fragments. The maximum amount of intracellular DNA fragments was different for all nuclides: (131)I-DES <(125)I-DES <(123)I-DES. With isotopes in the form of iodide, no increase of intracellular DNA fragmentation could be detected. Vitamin C reduced intracellular DNA fragmentation significantly, which points to an induction mechanism mainly via free radicals. CONCLUSIONS Labeled DES is a promising compound with high cytotoxic potential for treatment of ER-positive mamma carcinomas and their metastases.","Fischer, Thomas; Schomacker, Klaus; Schicha, Harald",International journal of radiation biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09553000802499238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19061136/,49
146834,"Linear reinforcement learning in planning, grid fields, and cognitive control.",2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is tremendous. Since the beginning of the pandemic, several actors have raised concerns about the impact of the pandemic on gambling. Many actors fear a switch to online gambling in the context of the closure of many land-based gambling activities due to the restrictions imposed by public health authorities, such as physical distancing and lockdowns. This switch is worrisome because online gambling is considered a high-risk game. In that context, we need to know more about the impacts of the pandemic on gambling. This scoping review aims to summarize the literature that addresses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling. To our knowledge, this is the first review to focus on this subject. METHODS An electronic literature search involving a strategy using keywords related to COVID-19 and gambling was conducted using MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Social Works Abstract, and Socio Index databases on February 25th 2021. This search was combined with a manual search in Google Scholar. To be included, studies had to discuss gambling and COVID-19 as a primary theme, be written in English, and be published in a peer-reviewed journal. After collecting the information, we collated, summarized, and reported the results using narrative synthesis. RESULTS The search identified 181 articles. After the removal of duplicates and screening, 24 full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study: 14 original articles, 8 commentaries or editorials, and 2 protocols. Contrary to expectations, preliminary evidence suggested that gambling behavior often either decreased or stayed the same for most gamblers during the pandemic. However, for the minority who showed increased gambling behavior, there was frequently an association with problem gambling. CONCLUSION The available literature on COVID-19 and gambling is limited and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling behavior and gambling problems is still unclear. Therefore, there is a need for more research on this topic, both qualitative and mixed methods studies, to better understand the impact of the pandemic on gambling. Considering the results, we need to be careful, particularly with problem gamblers and other subgroups of the population who seem to be more vulnerable to increased gambling habits during this pandemic period.","Brodeur, Magaly; Audette-Chapdelaine, Sophie; Savard, Annie-Claude; Kairouz, Sylvia",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146652/,49
147761,Effects of meloxicam administration on physiological and performance responses of transported feeder cattle.,2014,"Le dépistage du coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) est en grande partie passif, ce qui nuit au contrôle de l’épidémie. Nous avons élaboré des stratégies de dépistage actif du SRAS-CoV-2 au moyen d’une amplification en chaîne par polymérase couplée à une transcription inverse (RT-PCR) chez les groupes courant un risque accru de contracter le virus dans les provinces canadiennes. MÉTHODES: Nous avons identifié 5 groupes qui devraient être prioritaires pour le dépistage actif au moyen d’une RTPCR, soit les gens ayant été en contact avec une personne infectée par le SRAS-CoV-2 et ceux qui appartiennent à 4 populations à risque : employés d’hôpitaux, travailleurs en soins de santé communautaires ainsi qu’employés et résidents d’établissements de soins de longue durée, employés d’entreprises essentielles, et élèves et personnel scolaire. Nous avons estimé les coûts, les ressources humaines et la capacité de laboratoire nécessaires au dépistage des membres de ces groupes ou au dépistage sur des échantillons aléatoires aux fins de surveillance. RÉSULTATS: Du 8 au 17 juillet 2020, 41 751 dépistages par RT-PCR étaient réalisés chaque jour en moyenne dans les provinces canadiennes; nous avons estimé que ces tests mobilisaient 5122 employés et coûtaient 2,4 millions de dollars par jour (67,8 millions de dollars par mois). La recherche et le dépistage systématiques des contacts requerraient 1,2 fois plus de personnel et porteraient les coûts mensuels à 78,9 millions de dollars. S’il était réalisé en 1 mois, le dépistage de tous les employés des hôpitaux nécessiterait 1823 travailleurs supplémentaires et coûterait 29,0 millions de dollars. Pour la même période de temps, le dépistage de tous les travailleurs en soins de santé communautaires et de tous les employés et résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée nécessiterait 11 074 employés supplémentaires et coûterait 124,8 millions de dollars, et celui de tous les travailleurs essentiels nécessiterait 25 965 employés supplémentaires et coûterait 321,7 millions de dollars. Enfin, le dépistage sur 6 semaines de la population scolaire nécessiterait 46 368 employés supplémentaires et coûterait 816,0 millions de dollars. Les interventions visant à pallier les inefficacités, comme le dépistage à partir d’échantillons de salive et le regroupement des échantillons, pourraient réduire les coûts de 40 % et les besoins en personnel, de 20 %. Le dépistage de surveillance sur des échantillons de la population autre que les contacts coûterait 5 % des coûts associés à l’adoption d’une approche universelle de dépistage auprès des populations à risque. INTERPRÉTATION: Le dépistage actif des groupes courant un risque accru de contracter le SRAS-CoV-2 semble faisable et favoriserait la réouverture sûre et à grande échelle de l’économie et des écoles. Cette stratégie semble également abordable lorsque comparée aux 169,2 milliards de dollars versés par le gouvernement fédéral dans la lutte contre la pandémie en date de juin 2020.","Campbell, Jonathon R; Uppal, Aashna; Oxlade, Olivia; Fregonese, Federica; Bastos, Mayara Lisboa; Lan, Zhiyi; Law, Stephanie; Oh, Chi Eun; Russell, W Alton; Sulis, Giorgia; Winters, Nicholas; Yanes-Lane, Mercedes; Brisson, Marc; Laszlo, Sonia; Evans, Timothy G; Menzies, Dick",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.201128-f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288513/,49
148372,Year 2020: Science and Engineering Research Continues.,2021-04-07,"Shoulder disorders comprise a large part of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Risk factors, such as repetitiveness and monotony, may cause muscle fatigue and be attenuated by task rotation. We investigated rotation between a dynamic box-lifting task and a relatively static pick-and-place task and aimed to determine whether (1) a high rotation frequency leads to less fatigue development than a low rotation frequency, and (2) a self-selected rotation frequency leads to less fatigue development than imposed rotation frequencies. Ten participants performed four one-hour rotation schedules: two low frequency rotation schedules rotating at 30min, one high frequency rotation schedule rotating every sixth minute, and a self-selected rotation schedule. Borg, SOFI and electromyography of Trapezius and Deltoid subparts served as fatigue indicators. We found significant signs of fatigue for most schedules regarding the Borg and SOFI ratings and the M. Trapezius pars Descendens. Task rotation frequency had no significant effect on any of the outcome parameters, whereas the self-selected rotation schedule clearly resulted in less development of perceived fatigue than imposed schedules. In conclusion, we think that freedom of rotation has the greatest potential to attenuate potential development of musculoskeletal disorders and we require due caution with the use and interpretation of EMG indicators of fatigue.","Luger, Tessy; Bosch, Tim; Hoozemans, Marco J M; Veeger, DirkJan H E J; de Looze, Michiel P",Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelekin.2016.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101392/,49

148777,Correction.,2021-03-25,"PURPOSE Adherence to endocrine therapy for hormone positive breast cancer is a significant problem, especially in minority populations. Further, endocrine therapy reduces recurrence and thus mortality. However, little data are available on interventions to improve adherence. The authors conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of interventions, strategies, or approaches aimed to improve endocrine therapy adherence among women with breast cancer. A secondary aim was to determine if interventions had any cultural modifications. METHODS Two of the authors examined articles published between 2006 and 2017 from a wide variety of databases using Covidence systematic review platform. RESULTS In total, 16 eligible studies met criteria for review including 4 randomized controlled trials, 4 retrospective studies, and 8 with various observational designs. Eligible studies used a broad range of definitions for adherence and measured adherence by self-report, medical records, claims data, and combinations of these. All used 80% medication possession ratio as a standard for adherence. Patient information/education was the most frequent intervention strategy but did not demonstrate a significant effect except in one study. Significant results were noted when education was combined with communication strategies.

148792,Usefulness of an optical tracking system in laparoscopic surgery for motor skills assessment.,2014,"PROBLEM While studies have discussed the parenting practices and challenges of African immigrants, no paper has synthesized the results of these qualitative studies. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the literature to summarize and interpret knowledge of African immigrants' parenting practices and challenges in destination countries to identify future directions for research, policy, and practice. ELIGIBILITY We used a qualitative research synthesis method involving meta-summary and meta-synthesis of the literature. A research librarian assisted in searching ten databases. Two members of the research team independently reviewed 1794 articles. We included articles that: (a) reported a qualitative research study; (b) was written in English; and (c) provided the perspective of African immigrant parents on their parenting practices and/or challenges. SAMPLE A total of 24 articles met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS Our results indicate that parenting practices of African immigrants include the following: changes in discipline practices across transnational borders and the use of physical discipline, respect as a deeply embedded value of parenting, integration of cultural values into parenting, and integration of religious practices into parenting. We also found gender differences in parenting. Challenges faced by African immigrants in parenting their children in destination countries include lack of informal/community support, access to services and lack of formal support, cultural conflict in parenting, fear related to social services, and language barriers. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our study identifies a need for culturally appropriate policies and practices that build on the strengths of African immigrants in destination countries while addressing their unique challenges.","Salami, Bukola; Hirani, Shela Akbar Ali; Meherali, Salima; Amodu, Oluwakemi; Chambers, Thane",Journal of pediatric nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2017.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28888504/,49

Studies have examined BDR's genetic underpinnings, but many did not include children or were not conducted during an asthma exacerbation. This pilot study tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms' (SNPs') association with pediatric African American BDR during an acute asthma exacerbation. METHODS This was a study of pediatric asthma patients in the age group 2-18 years treated in the emergency department for an asthma exacerbation. We measured BDR before and after inhaled bronchodilator treatments using both the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS) and asthma severity score. We collected genomic DNA and examined whether 21 candidate SNPs from a review of the literature were associated with BDR using crude odds ratios (OR) and adjusted analysis. RESULTS The final sample population was 53 children, with an average age of 7.2 years. The average initial PASS score (scale of ascending severity from 0 to 6) was 2.5. After adjusting for BMI, age category, gender and smoke exposure, rs912142 was associated with decreased odds of having low BDR (OR, 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02-0.92), and rs7081864 and rs7903366 were associated with decreased odds of having high BDR (OR, 0.097; 95% CI, 0.009-0.62). CONCLUSIONS We found three SNPs significantly associated with pediatric African American BDR that provide information regarding a child's potential response to emergency asthma exacerbation treatment. Once validated in larger studies, such information could guide pharmacogenomic evidence-based emergency asthma treatment to improve patient outcomes.","Fishe, Jennifer N; Labilloy, Guillaume; Higley, Rebecca; Casey, Deirdre; Ginn, Amber; Baskovich, Brett; Blake, Kathryn V",Pharmacogenetics and genomics,https://doi.org/10.1097/fpc.0000000000000434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851947/,49
150189,Myanmar: palaeontologists must stop buying conflict amber.,2020-08-19,"Background - The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), known to remodel in disease and have an extensive secretome, has recently been isolated from the human heart. However, the effects of normal and diseased cardiac MSCs on myocyte electrophysiology remain unclear. We hypothesize that in disease the inflammatory secretome of cardiac hMSCs remodels and can regulate arrhythmia substrates. Methods - Human cardiac MSCs (hMSCs) were isolated from patients with or without heart failure from tissue attached to extracted device leads and from samples taken from explanted/donor hearts. Failing hMSCs or non-failing hMSCs were co-cultured with normal human myocytes (hCM) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Using fluorescent indicators, APD, Ca2+ alternans, and spontaneous calcium release (SCR) incidence were determined. Results - Failing and non-failing hMSCs from both sources exhibited similar tri-lineage differentiation potential and cell surface marker expression as bone marrow hMSCs. Compared to non-failing hMSCs, failing hMSCs prolonged APD by 24% (p<0.001, n=15), increased Ca2+ alternans by 300% (p<0.001, n=18), and promoted SCR activity (n=14, p <0.013) in hCM. Failing hMSCs exhibited increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (98%, p<0.0001) and IL-6 (460%, p <0.02) compared to non-failing hMSCs. IL-1β or IL-6 in the absence of hMSCs prolonged APD but only IL-6 increased Ca2+ alternans and promoted SCR activity in hCM, replicating the effects of failing hMSCs. In contrast, non-failing hMSCs prevented Ca2+ alternans in hCM during oxidative stress. Finally, non-failing hMSCs exhibited >25 times higher secretion of IGF-1 compared to failing hMSCs. Importantly, IGF-1 supplementation or anti-IL-6 treatment rescued the arrhythmia substrates induced by failing hMSCs. Conclusions - We identified device leads as a novel source of cardiac hMSCs. Our findings show that cardiac hMSCs can regulate arrhythmia substrates by remodeling their secretome in disease. Importantly, therapy inhibiting (anti-IL-6) or mimicking (IGF-1) the cardiac hMSC secretome can rescue arrhythmia substrates.","Sattayaprasert, Prasongchai; Vasireddi, Sunil K; Bektik, Emre; Jeon, Oju; Hajjiri, Mohammad; Mackall, Judith A; Moravec, Christine S; Alsberg, Eben; Fu, Jidong; Laurita, Kenneth R",Circulation.

In this study we have characterized the genetic lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and report the recombination within the genus and subgenus of coronaviruses. Phylogenetic relationship of thirty nine coronaviruses belonging to its four genera and five subgenera was analyzed by using the Neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6.0. Phylogenetic trees of full length genome, various proteins (spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) nucleotide sequences were constructed separately. Putative recombination was probed via RDP4. Our analysis describes that the ""SARS-CoV-2"" although shows great similarity to Bat-SARS-CoVs sequences through whole genome (giving sequence similarity 89%), exhibits conflicting grouping with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences (MG772933 and MG772934). Furthermore, seven recombination events were observed in SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) by RDP4. But not a single recombination event fulfills the high level of certainty. Recombination mostly housed in spike protein genes than rest of the genome indicating breakpoint cluster arises beyond the 95% and 99% breakpoint density intervals. Genetic similarity levels observed among ""SARS-CoV-2"" and Bat-SARS-CoVs advocated that the latter did not exhibit the specific variant that cause outbreak in humans, proposing a suggestion that ""SARS-CoV-2"" has originated possibly from bats.

This review will describe risk and protective factors, focusing on modifiable attributes, in order to inform suicide prevention and early intervention strategies. INTRODUCTION Suicide is the world's second leading cause of death among young people. Depression is closely associated with suicide; however, it lacks specificity as a predictor of suicidal behavior. There is a clear need to improve our understanding of both risk and protective factors associated with the full spectrum of suicidality in young people, across a range of depressive disorders. INCLUSION CRITERIA Studies that include young people 15 to 25 years of age with a diagnosis of depression made in accordance with a diagnostic classification standard will be considered. Diagnosis must be made using a structured clinical interview or be received through standard clinical practice. Analytical cross-sectional studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case-control studies will be included. Studies must include an assessment of suicidality made using standardized or non-standardized tools. A broad range of inpatient and outpatient settings will be considered. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO will be searched for studies published in English, with no date limitation. Two independent reviewers will conduct study screening, assess methodological quality, and extract data using standardized tools. If there is sufficient homogeneity across studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model will be conducted.

In this work, foam fractionation was employed to remove Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) from aqueous solution and dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS12) was used as the collector. Since the attachment of strain cells on the bubble surface would impede the reflux of interstitial liquid in the plateau borders (PBs), a novel strategy in strengthening foam drainage was developed through artificially inducing foam evolution. Two gas distributors with different pore diameters had been mounted at the bottom of the column for regulating the radial distribution of bubble size in the foam phase. Experimental results indicated that gas diffuse and bubble coarsening could be significantly promoted by increasing the size difference among the adjacent bubbles. Bubble coalescence contributed to broadening the width of plateau borders, thereby avoiding the borders blockage by strain cells. During bubble coalescence, surfactant molecules would be partially shifted from the surface of small bubble towards that of large bubble due to the molecule density difference. The increase in surface excess of surfactant molecules on gas-liquid interface was conducive to improving foam stability. Under the suitable conditions of air flow rates of gas distributor with 0.125 mm of pore diameter 75 mL/min and gas distributor with 0.425 mm of pore diameter 125 mL/min, BS12 concentration 0.1 g/L, and P. aeruginosa concentration 2.0 × 104 CFU/mL, the removal percentage and enrichment ratio of P. aeruginosa were 99.6% and 10.6, respectively. This work is expected to provide some new light for strengthening foam drainage in the presence of solid particles and to facilitate the industrialization of foam fractionation in water treatment.","Jia, Lei; Liu, Wei; Cao, Jilin; Wu, Zhaoliang; Yang, Chunyan",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932836/,49

155572,Abstract Journal Military Surgery.,2021-05-01,"Less invasive surgical approaches for intracranial aneurysm clipping may reduce length of hospital stay, surgical morbidity, treatment cost, and improve patient outcomes. We present our experience with a minimally invasive pterional approach for anterior circulation aneurysms performed in a major tertiary cerebrovascular center and compare the results with an aged matched dataset from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). From August 2008 to December 2012, 22 elective aneurysm clippings on patients ≤55 years of age were performed by the same dual fellowship-trained cerebrovascular/endovascular neurosurgeon. One patient (4.5%) experienced transient post-operative complications. 18 of 22 patients returned for follow-up imaging and there were no recurrences through an average duration of 22 months. A search in the NIS database from 2008 to 2010, also for patients aged ≤55 years of age, yielded 1,341 hospitalizations for surgical clip ligation of unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Inpatient length of stay and hospital charges at our institution using the minimally invasive thumb-sized pterional technique were nearly half that of NIS (length of stay: 3.2 vs 5.7 days; hospital charges: $52,779 vs. $101,882). The minimally invasive thumb-sized pterional craniotomy allows good exposure of unruptured small and medium-sized supraclinoid anterior circulation aneurysms. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage from key subarachnoid cisterns and constant bimanual microsurgical techniques avoid the need for retractors which can cause contusions, localized venous infarctions, and post-operative cerebral edema at the retractor sites. Utilizing this set of techniques has afforded our patients with a shorter hospital stay at a lower cost compared to the national average.","Deshaies, Eric M; Villwock, Mark R; Singla, Amit; Toshkezi, Gentian; Padalino, David J",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/51661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26325337/,49

157952,Energy transfer under natural incoherent light: Effects of asymmetry on efficiency.,2020-09-21,"The potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications of oligonucleotides (ONs) have attracted great attention in recent years. The capability of ONs to selectively inhibit target genes through antisense and RNA interference mechanisms, without causing un-intended sideeffects has led them to be investigated for various biomedical applications, especially for the treatment of viral diseases and cancer. In recent years, many researchers have focused on enhancing the stability and target specificity of ONs by encapsulating/complexing them with polymers or lipid chains to formulate nanoparticles/nanocomplexes/micelles. Also, chemical modification of nucleic acids has emerged as an alternative to impart stability to ONs against nucleases and other degrading enzymes and proteins found in blood. In addition to chemically modifying the nucleic acids directly, another strategy that has emerged, involves conjugating polymers/peptide/aptamers/antibodies/proteins, preferably to the sense strand (3'end) of siRNAs. Conjugation to the siRNA not only enhances the stability and targeting specificity of the siRNA, but also allows for the development of self-administering siRNA formulations, with a much smaller size than what is usually observed for nanoparticle (∼200nm). This review concentrates mainly on approaches and studies involving ON-conjugates for biomedical applications.","Gooding, Matt; Malhotra, Meenakshi; Evans, James C; Darcy, Raphael; O'Driscoll, Caitriona M",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2016.07.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27521696/,49

158415,Pandemics and the global environment.,2020-07-01,"While local vibration (LV) has been recently proposed as a potential modality for neuromuscular conditioning, no practical recommendations to optimize its effects have been published. Because changes in corticospinal excitability may reflect at which degree the neuromuscular function is modulated during LV exposure, this study investigated the effects of muscle length and vibration site on LV-induced on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) changes. Twenty-one subjects participated in a single session in which MEPs were evoked on the relaxed knee extensors (KE) during three conditions, i.e., no vibration (CON), muscle (VIBMU), and tendon vibration (VIBTD). Three muscle lengths were tested for each condition, i.e., short/intermediate/long KE muscle length. Both VIBMU and VIBTD significantly increase MEPs compared to CON. Higher increases (P < 0.001) were found for VIBTD compared to VIBMU for vastus lateralis (mean increases of the three angles: +241% vs.+ 148%), vastus medialis (+273% vs. + 180%) and rectus femoris muscles (+191% vs. +141%). The increase in MEPs amplitude was higher (p < 0.001) at an intermediate (mean pooled increase for VIBTD and VIBMU: +265%, +290%, and +212% for VL, VM, and RF, respectively) compared to short (+136%, + 144%, and + 127%) or long (+ 184%, + 246% and + 160%) muscle lengths. These results suggest that LV should be applied to the tendon at an intermediate muscle length to optimize the acute effects of LV on the KE neuromuscular function.","Souron, Robin; Oriol, Marie; Millet, Guillaume Y; Lapole, Thomas",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30233417/,49

After treatment, wounds are covered with dressings that are widely used in wound care management; however, little is known about the effects of wound dressings on individually isolated cells. The sprayed cells have to actively attach, spread, proliferate, and migrate in the wound for successful re-epithelialization, during the healing process. It is expected that exposure to wound dressing material might interfere with cell survival, attachment, and expansion. Two experiments were performed to determine whether some dressing materials have a negative impact during the early phases of wound healing. In one experiment, freshly isolated cells were seeded and cultured for one week in combination with eight different wound dressings used during burn care. Cells, which were seeded and cultured with samples of Adaptic(®), Xeroform(®), EZ Derm(®), and Mepilex(®) did not attach, nor did they survive during the first week. Mepitel(®), N-Terface(®), Polyskin(®), and Biobrane(®) dressing samples had no negative effect on cell attachment and cell growth when compared to the controls. In a second experiment, the same dressings were exposed to pre-cultured cells in order to exclude the effects of attachment and spreading. The results confirm the above findings. This study could be of interest for establishing skin cell grafting therapies in burn medicine and also for wound care in general.","Esteban-Vives, Roger; Young, Matthew T; Ziembicki, Jenny; Corcos, Alain; Gerlach, Jörg C",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2015.06.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26678326/,49

To overcome COVID-19, appropriate diagnosis methods are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to clinically evaluate the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 IgM/IgG antibody (Ab). METHODS Patients confirmed COVID-19 (n = 51) were recruited prospectively from the Musashino Red Cross hospital and Tokyo Medical and Dental University Medical Hospital, between March and May 2020. And the analytical specificity was assessed with serum samples of patients without COVID-19 (n=100) collected between August to September 2019 before SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in China. RESULTS Among COVID-19 patients, a total of 87 serum samples were tested for SARS-Cov-2 IgM/IgG Ab assay. IgM was detected 71.0 %, 86.9 %, and 83.3 % at day8-14, 15-28, >29 after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 81.6 %, 87.0 %, and 94.4 %, respectively. The sensitivity of IgM and IgG Ab after day8 assay was significantly higher than before day7, respectively (p=0.0016, 0.0003). There were no positive results in 100 serum samples from patients without COVID-19.

To assess the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing dexmedetomidine with midazolam. METHODS We searched PubMed, the Cochrane library, and the Igaku-chuo-zasshi database in order to identify randomized trials eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Data from the eligible studies were combined to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (WMD). RESULTS We identified nine randomized trials from the database search. Compared to that of midazolam, the pooled OR for restlessness of dexmedetomidine was 0.078 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.013-0.453, P < 0.0001), and there was no significant heterogeneity among the trial results. Dexmedetomidine significantly increased Ramsay sedation score compared with midazolam (WMD: 0.401, 95% CI: 0.110-0.692, P = 0.0069), without significant heterogeneity. Compared with midazolam, the pooled OR for hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia with dexmedetomidine sedation were 0.454 (95% CI: 0.098-2.11), 1.370 (95% CI: 0.516-3.637), and 2.575 (95% CI: 0.978-6.785), respectively, with no significant differences detected between the groups. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis shows that dexmedetomidine is a safe and effective sedative agent for gastrointestinal endoscopy, especially endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic submucosal dissection.","Nishizawa, Toshihiro; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Sagara, Seiji; Kanai, Takanori; Yahagi, Naohisa",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/den.12399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369736/,49

To the best of our knowledge, since the introduction of HBV vaccination, there have been limited data for vaccine response to HBV and its impact on early childhood HBV infections among children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. AIMS To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV vaccine response in 18 months old children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. METHODS Stored plasma samples from 304 children at 18 months of age and 287 mothers from delivery were tested for HBsAg. Mothers with positive HBsAg had HBV DNA level tested, and their HBV genotypes were determined by amplifying a 415-base pair (bp) region of the surface gene. Plasma samples from children exposed to HIV were tested for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titers. RESULTS No children (0 of 304) were positive for HBsAg at 18 months while 5 (1.74%) of 287 HIV-positive mothers were HBsAg positive. Four of the HBsAg positive mothers were infected with genotype A1, while 1 was infected with genotype E. The median anti-HBs titer in children was 174 mIU/mL [QR: 70, 457]. Three (1.1%) of 269 children had an inadequate vaccine response (<10 mIU/mL), while 266 (98.9%) of 269 had protective immunity. However, when using the ≥100mIU/mL threshold, only 170 (63.2%) of 269 children had complete protection. CONCLUSION No HBsAg positivity was identified in a cohort of children HIV exposed but uninfected. The absence of HBsAg positives was associated with good HBV vaccine responses and low maternal HBsAg prevalence in Botswana.","Baruti, Kabo; Lentz, Kayla; Anderson, Motswedi; Ajibola, Gbolahan; Phinius, Bonolo B; Choga, Wonderful T; Mbangiwa, Tshepiso; Powis, Kathleen M; Sebunya, Theresa; Blackard, Jason T; Lockman, Shahin; Moyo, Sikhulile; Shapiro, Roger; Gaseitsiwe, Simani",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764801/,49

METHODS This prospective cohort study evaluated patients who underwent thoracic esophagectomy with three-field dissection during 2013-2015. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they underwent early or late chest tube removal. Propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio was applied. We compared the incidences of postoperative pulmonary complications and thoracocentesis in the two groups. RESULTS After propensity score matching, 89 patients in each group were analyzed. There was no significant difference between the groups in the incidences of pulmonary complications or thoracocentesis. Significantly more patients achieved first mobilization within 15 h postoperatively in the early removal group (89.8%) than in the late removal group (52%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that early chest tube removal was not a risk factor for pulmonary complications or thoracocentesis. Independent risk factors for pulmonary complications were a history of pulmonary disease (odds ratio: 0.81 [0.63-0.98]; p = 0.02) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (odds ratio: 0.67 [0.32-0.96]; p = 0.04).

165387,Top 12 ‘Quickfire’ Best Poster Presentations,2021,"Background: A current cancer diagnosis is a risk factor for serious COVID-19 complications (CDC). In addition, the pandemic has caused major disruptions in medical care and support networks, resulting in treatment delays, limited access to doctors, worsening health disparities, social isolation;and driving higher utilization of telemedicine and online resources. Breastcancer.org has experienced a sustained surge of new and repeat users seeking urgent information and support. To better understand these unmet needs, we conducted a survey of the Breastcancer.org Community. Methods:Members of the Breastcancer.org Community were invited to complete a survey on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their breast cancer care, including questions on demographics, comorbidities (including lung, heart, liver and kidney disease, asthma, diabetes, obesity, and other chronic health conditions);care delays, anxiety due to COVIDrelated care delays, use of telemedicine, and satisfaction with care during COVID. The survey was conducted between 4/27/2020-6/1/2020 using Survey Monkey. Results were tabulated and compared by chi square test. A p-value of 0.05 is considered significant. Data were analyzed using Stata 16.0 (Stata Corp., Inc, College Station, TX). Results: Our analysis included 568 breast cancer patients of whom 44% had ≥1 other comorbidities associated with serious COVID-19 complications (per CDC) and 37% had moderate to extreme anxiety about contracting COVID. This anxiety increased with the number of comorbidities (p=0.021), age (p=0.040), and with a current breast cancer diagnosis (p=0.011) (see table). Anxiety was significantly higher in those currently diagnosed, ≥65, or with ≥3 other comorbidities, compared to those diagnosed in the past, age &lt;44, or without other comorbidities. Conclusions: Our survey reveals that COVID-related anxiety is prevalent at any age regardless of overall health status, but it increased with the number of other comorbidities, older age, and a current breast cancer diagnosis. Thus, reported anxiety is proportional to the risk of developing serious complications from COVID. Current breast cancer patients of all ages-especially with other comorbidities-require emotional support, safe access to their providers, and prioritization for vaccination.

166842,COVID-19: A Catalyst for the Future of the Life Sciences,2021,"Motivation: DNA metabarcoding is commonly used to infer the species composition of environmental samples, whereby a short, homologous DNA sequence is amplified and sequenced from all members of the community. Samples can comprise hundreds of organisms that can be closely or very distantly related. DNA metabarcoding combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), and sequences are taxonomically identified based on their match to a reference database. Ideally, each species of interest would have a unique DNA barcode. This short, variable sequence needs to be flanked by conserved regions that can be used as primer-binding sites. PCR primer pairs would amplify a variable barcode in a broad evolutionary range of taxa. To date, no tools exist that computationally search and analyze the effectiveness of new primer pairs for large unaligned sequence data sets. More specifically we solve the following problem: Given a set of reference sequences R = {R1, R2,.., Rm}, find a primer set P that allows for a high taxonomic coverage. This goal can be achieved by filtering for frequent primers and ranking by coverage or variation, i.e. the number of unique barcodes for further analysis. Here we present the software PriSeT, an offline primer-discovery tool that is capable of processing large libraries and is robust against mislabeled or low-quality references. It avoids the construction of a multisequence alignment of R. Instead, PriSeT uses encodings of frequent k-mers that allow bit-parallel processing and other optimizations. Results: We first evaluated PriSeT on references (mostly 18S rRNA genes) from 19 clades covering eukaryotic organisms that are typical for freshwater plankton samples. PriSeT recovered several published primer sets as well as additional, more chemically suitable primer sets. For these new sets, we compared frequency, taxonomic coverage, and amplicon variation with published primer sets. For 11 clades we found de novo primer pairs that cover more taxa than the published ones, and for six clades de novo primers resulted in greater sequence (i.e., DNA barcode) variation. We also applied PriSeT to SARS-CoV-2 genomes and computed 114 new primer pairs with the additional constraint that the sequences have no co-occurrences in closely related taxa. These primer sets would be suitable for empirical testing. Availability: https://github.com/mariehoffmann/PriSeT Contact: marie.hoffmann@fu-berlin.de © 2021 ACM.","Hoffmann, M.; Monaghan, M.

170729,Wastewater Based Epidemiology Enabled Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance,2021-06-03,"Background:AML is predominantly a disease of the elderly, yet outcomes remain dismal, particularly for relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML patients (pts). Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD33-commonly expressed on AML blasts, and, critically, AML stem cells (LSC)-linked to the cytotoxin calicheamicin. GO resistance mechanisms include (i) decreased/aberrant blast CD33 expression, (ii) p-glycoprotein export of calicheamicin, and (iii) apoptosis resistance due to deficient activation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, a process highly dependent on BCL-2 expression. GO-induced apoptosis depends on the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak and is inhibited by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 or BCL-XL. Venetoclax (VEN) is a BH3 mimetic, binding BCL-2, dislodging its binding to Bak/Bax, and thus facilitating apoptosis. LSC overexpress BCL-2, however VEN monotherapy is not effective in AML, as resistance develops rapidly. Hypothesis: VEN targeting of BCL-2 proteins that protect LSC from GO-induced apoptosis will synergistically increase GO efficacy.

Major eligibility: ECOG 0-2, adequate organ function, CD33+ in ≥ 20% AML blasts, ≤ 3 lines of prior therapy, and no prior use of GO or VEN, previous VOD, BMT within 2 months, CNS disease, or history of HIV. Induction: 3-day VEN ramp-up to the target dose of 200 (cohort i), 400 (ii), or 600 (iii) mg daily x 28 d, with GO 3mg/m2 infused days 1, 4, and 7. If CR/CRi achieved, pts proceed to BMT if applicable, otherwise, if in CR/CRi (provided ANC > 1000, plts > 100K) or PR (regardless of counts), they are consolidated with VEN at the prescribed dose x 28d and GO 3mg/m2 on days 1 and 4 (Cycle 2). If BMT not applicable, and pt remaining in CR/CRi or PR (as above), then proceed to VEN alone as Maintenance in cycles 3+ until progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint is MTD of VEN with GO. Secondary endpoints include ORR, antileukemic activity, characterization of AEs, and estimates of RFS, EFS, and OS. Progress: This study is currently open to its second dosing cohort and has enrolled 5 pts to date. No dose-limiting toxicities have been encountered. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on enrollment, which is expected to improve as vaccinations expand.

The study included 923 students aged 19 to 28 (73 % females). The students completed the Stress Source Questionnaire, the Academic Functioning Questionnaire, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Four groups of stress sources have been identified. The consequences of isolation represent the strongest stress source, followed by academic stress, the possibility of infection, and family sources of stress. Females experience all sources of stress more intensely than males, and students who changed their residence experience family problems and the consequences of isolation more stressfully than students who live continuously in their families. All sources of stress, except possible infection, are significant predictors of depression, while depression is a significant additional predictor of students' self-rated academic functioning after controlling for gender, change of residence, and sources of stress. The consequences of isolation, as a source of stress, have the strongest effect on depression and self-rated academic functioning.","Zivcic-Becirevic, I.; Smojver-Azic, S.; Dorcic, T.

Methods: In rural Kenya 483 individuals from 47 households were followed for six months (2009-10) with nasopharyngeal swabs collected twice weekly regardless of symptoms. A total of 16,918 swabs were tested for human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43, NL63 and 229E and other respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction. Results: From 346 (71.6%) household members 629 hCoV infection episodes were defined with 36.3% being symptomatic: varying by hCoV type and decreasing with age. Symptomatic episodes (aHR=0.6 (95% CI:0.5-0.8) or those with elevated peak viral load (medium aHR=0.4 (0.3-0.6); high aHR=0.31 (0.2-0.4)) had longer viral shedding compared to their respective counterparts. Homologous reinfections were observed in 99 (19.9%) of 497 first infections. School-age children (55%) were the most common index cases with those having medium (aOR=5.3 (2.3-12.0)) or high (8.1 (2.9-22.5)) peak viral load most often generating secondary cases. Conclusion: Household coronavirus infection was common, frequently asymptomatic and mostly introduced by school-age children. Secondary transmission was influenced by viral load of index cases. Homologous-type reinfection was common. These data may be insightful for SARS-CoV-2.","Nyaguthii, D. M.; Otieno, G. P.; Kombe, I. K.; Koech, D.; Mutunga, M.; Medley, G. F.; Nokes, D. J.; Munywoki, P.

172073,"Two-Dimensional Matter: Order, Curvature and Defects",2008-12-16,"The pandemic in 2020 and the resultant global lockdown led to new dynamics in the homestead. Families faced an accelerated process of digitization of conventional processes like education and white collar jobs. Working women with children of school or kindergarten age were forced to redraw the boundaries between the personal and the professional as the entire family essentially functioned from home, which increased prevalent gender inequalities. Tasks like 'planning', care-giving, emotional care etc. go unaccounted for and remain invisible to other members of the household. We present a feminist design research project that explores how design research can contribute to greater social justice and gender equality by a fairer distribution of domestic labour. We conducted semi-structured interviews in India during the pandemic lockdown, to elicit both explicit as well as tacit information on daily workloads of working women with families. We found disparity in domestic duties between genders, with specific regard to the circumstances created by the 2020 pandemic conditions. Based on our findings and analysis, we prototyped a visualization tool that makes invisible domestic work visible. Our research contribution is a design research methodology to generate insights to enable creation of design interventions for social justice. This was achieved through use of established design research methods, that are conventionally used in face-to-face settings, which were then adapted to exceptional pandemic conditions that required social distancing where communication was remote, and usually virtual. © 2021 ACM.","Dhaundiyal, D.; Pai, S.; Cramer, M.; Buchmueller, S.; Malhotra, S.; Bath, C.",5th Asian CHI Symposium 2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3429360.3468224,49
173493,The Fractional Epidemics Theory: Managing and Ending an Epidemic,2020-11-12,"This article is part of a comprehensive research project on liquidity risk in asset management, which can be divided into three dimensions. The first dimension covers liability liquidity risk (or funding liquidity) modeling, the second dimension focuses on asset liquidity risk (or market liquidity) modeling, and the third dimension considers asset-liability liquidity risk management (or asset-liability matching). The purpose of this research is to propose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity stress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019) and are useful for fund managers. The review of the academic literature and professional research studies shows that there is a lack of standardized and analytical models. The aim of this research project is then to fill the gap with the goal to develop mathematical and statistical approaches, and provide appropriate answers. In this first part that focuses on liability liquidity risk modeling, we propose several statistical models for estimating redemption shocks. The historical approach must be complemented by an analytical approach based on zero-inflated models if we want to understand the true parameters that influence the redemption shocks. Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate population models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral approaches. Once these different statistical models are calibrated, the second big issue is the risk measure to assess normal and stressed redemption shocks. Finally, the last issue is to develop a factor model that can translate stress scenarios on market risk factors into stress scenarios on fund liabilities.","Roncalli, Thierry; Karray-Meziou, Fatma; Pan, Franccois; Regnault, Margaux",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02110v1.pdf,49

ARCH, GARCH, and TGARCH models were applied due to the changing volatility of the series leading to a heteroscedastic variance. The appropriate models for the series were diagnosed and the best model was chosen and used for forecasting by the exponential smoothing methods. The comparison criterion used was the Root Mean Squared Error and the Sum of Squared Residuals. The most appropriate model for modeling and forecasting the Coronavirus deaths series in Iraq was diagnosed as TGARCH (1,1).

The likelihood of cross-species transmission is related to phenotypic plasticity of a virus and its capacity to produce genetically variable progeny. Herein a model is described connecting the production of genetic variability with increasing genome size. Comparing all known zoonotic viral genome sizes to known non-zoonotic viral genome sizes demonstrates that zoonotic viruses have significantly larger genomes. These results support the notion that large viral genomes are important in producing new zoonotic disease, and suggest that genome size may be a useful surrogate in screening for potential zoonotic viruses.","Grewelle, Richard E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.986109,49

Here we show rapid replacement of the Beta variant by the Delta variant, a highly transmissible variant of concern (VOC) that emerged in India and subsequently spread around the world. The Delta variant was imported to South Africa primarily from India, spread rapidly in large monophyletic clusters to all provinces, and became dominant within three months of introduction. This was associated with a resurgence in community transmission, leading to a third wave which was associated with a high number of deaths. We estimated a growth advantage for the Delta variant in South Africa of 0.089 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.084-0.093) per day which corresponds to a transmission advantage of 46% (95% CI 44-48) compared to the Beta variant. These data provide additional support for the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant relative to other VOC and highlight how dynamic shifts in the distribution of variants contribute to the ongoing public health threat.","Tegally, H.; Wilkinson, E.; Althaus, C.

179704,News in brief,2021,"Background: We present the initial clinical evidence of likely mitigation of viral infections in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who previously responded to pembrolizumab. This may constitute a late beneficial effect of ICI treatment, and may identify patients with decreased risk for poor outcomes from major viral infections.While prior clinical reports are lacking, there is abundant laboratory evidence that: 1) immune checkpoint inhibition of the PD-1-mediated signaling pathway augments the response of antigen-specific T cells which likely leads to enhanced viral clearance (Dyke, Eur J Clin Immunol 2017);and 2) high levels of PD-1 positive CD-8 T cells have been demonstrated in HIV, Hepatitis B & C infections, akin to the PD-1 positive tumor-reactive tumor infiltrating cells described in host directed mechanisms against cancer (Rao, Int J Inf Dis 2017). Methods: We report the limited pattern and shortened course of three instances of herpetic infection, and one occurrence of SARSCoV- 2, which suggest enhanced mitigation of viral infection in patients previously treated with ICIs. We have seen no other cases of such limited and rapidly clearing herpes in our thoracic oncology practice. Results: Patient characteristics: ages 38 - 78;1 female;all stage IV extent;1 with squamous cell carcinoma and the others had adenocarcinoma/sarcomatoid carcinoma NSCLC;PDL-1 tumor proportion scores &gt; 90% except for the 1 patient with squamous cell carcinoma who had a PDL-1 score &lt; 1%. One patient received only pembrolizumab;the others also received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. All responded well to anticancer treatment, were off all treatment for &gt; 1 year, and continue to do well 2 - 5 years after diagnosis. Three infections diagnosed as Herpes zoster presented in each case with only one or two vesicles within a single dermatome. Each infection was diagnosed 48 - 72 hours after eruption, was only minimally symptomatic, and cleared within one or two days. The case of documented SARS-CoV-2 occurred in a 60 year old woman with NSCLC and COPD who was off ICI therapy for 3 years with a complete response. She had minimal COVID-19 symptoms which cleared within 3 days. Conclusions: We conclude that: 1) these cases suggest mitigation of viral infections in patients with NSCLC who had prior anticancer benefit with pembrolizumab, and constitute a long term positive effect of ICIs;2) these results support the pre-clinical findings and hypotheses of enhanced antiviral immune response with ICI agents;and 3) prospective evaluation of large populations of patients with cancer receiving ICIs is warranted to determine if this benefit is reproducible, what proportion of patients benefit, the magnitude of benefit, and to guide in prospective antiviral treatment in the highly vulnerable NSCLC population.","Jayarangaiah, A.; Gralla, R.

179940,Nature fights back,2021,"PurposeThis paper aims to put forward a definition of corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) which is relevant to the study of complex organizations and in particular, the multinational enterprise (MNE). This paper then offers a framework as a foundation to discuss the institutional complexity of CSI to aid international business (IB) scholars, practitioners and policymakers achieve a clearer understanding of the mechanisms that may penalize and subsequently deter MNE irresponsibility.Design/methodology/approachIn presenting the approaches taken by social regulation researchers and IB policy scholars to understand MNE irresponsibility, this paper proposes a definition of CSI and explicates the various mechanisms associated with deterring MNEs from behaving irresponsibly.FindingsTherefore, how can MNEs be deterred from behaving irresponsibly? To further the research agenda concerning CSI in IB, far less common are a definition of CSI relevant to the complex IB context;and a framework that explicates both the legal and social components of CSI, particularly as they unfold in a complex, diverse and often divergent institutional landscape. Overcoming these two primary obstacles is important because when complexities associated with CSI emerge, researchers need to be able to ascertain and expound upon what they are observing so that comparisons can be made and more MNE CSI research can be accrued over time.Research limitations/implicationsTo help the development of future research, we offered a more precise definition of CSI, one which is more relevant to the study of the MNE and the complex contemporary IB environment. By embracing complexities, this paper also outlines an institutional complexity approach, one which highlights both the role of formal and informal regulatory institutions. Though IB has traditionally focused on the role of formal regulation, there is much more to be unearthed by exploring the additional and concurrent influence of social regulatory institutions.Practical implicationsThere is a high level of heterogeneity in the motivations and modes used by MNEs to enter international markets, which likely influence efforts made by these firms to adapt to different types of formal and social institutional pressures. When firms invest significantly in a market, they have a greater economic dependence in that market and institutions have a greater opportunity to exert pressures. For instance, foreign direct investment requires a higher level of (longer-term) commitment, transfer of capital, exchange of expertise and learning, meaning that firms depend much more on local authorities to perform in the market and accomplish their goals.Social implicationsEnabled by new technologies and, particularly, social media platforms, stakeholders can now engage in organized forms of regulatory activities, as is evident in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, black lives matter and gender equality social activist movements. Through prominent collective actions, the impacts of globally organized social movements may be increasingly non-location bound, placing MNE managers at the heart of new challenges and opportunities to engage with global stakeholders. Infomediaries such as the press, have always been of historical importance, due to their role in shaping stakeholder expectations and opinions of the firm and thus, the reputation and legitimacy of that firm.Originality/valueThis study enriches the understanding of what CSI is, why we are likely to observe it in practice and how it affects MNEs. This paper offers a definition of CSI that is sufficiently nuanced to capture the complexity of the contemporary IB environment, as well as a framework that, this paper proposes, presents a clearer understanding of the institutional mechanisms that may deter MNEs from behaving irresponsibly. By encouraging scholars to examine the institutional complexity of MNE CSI, the paper hopes to contribute toward building a bridge which connects the IB policy and social regulation research streams.","Brammer, Stephen Nardella Giulio Surdu Irina",Multinational Business Review,https://doi.org/10.1108/mbr-02-2021-0011,49
180864,The carbon footprint of large astronomy meetings,2020-09-23,"Due to its clinical relevance, modulation of functionally relevant amino acids in protein-protein complexes has attracted a great deal of attention. To this end, many approaches have been proposed to predict partner-selecting, i.e., specificity-determining positions in evolutionarily close complexes. These approaches can be grouped into sequence-based machine learning and structure-based energy-driven methods. In this work, we assessed these methods’ ability to map the specificity-determining positions of Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer progression and immune-related diseases. For this, we used three sequence-based predictors – SDPred, Multi-RELIEF, and Sequence Harmony – and a structure-based approach by utilizing HADDOCK and extensive molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, we show that (i) sequence-based methods overpredict the number of specificity-determining positions for Axl complexes and that (ii) combining sequence-based approaches with HADDOCK provides the most coherent set of predictions. Our work lays out a critical study on the comparative performance specificity-determining position predictors. It also presents a combined sequence-structure-based approach, which can guide the development of therapeutic molecules capable of combatting Axl misregulation in different types of diseases.","Karakulak, Tülay; Rifaioglu, Ahmet Sureyya; Rodrigues, João P.G.L.M.; Karaca, Ezgi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428202,49

ECP has been implicated in damage to the cell membrane of many tissue types, but the mechanism is not well known. In the present study, mECP-eGFP-6H, a recombinant fusion protein containing mature ECP (mECP), enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) and a His(6) tag (6H), has been expressed, purified and added to GH3 neuroendocrine cells to study the internalization ability of ECP. We found that mECP-eGFP-6H entered into GH3 neuroendocrine cells and inhibited the growth of the cells with an IC(50) of 0.8 microM. By yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoprecipitation, we have identified a specific protein-protein interaction between mECP and CPE (carboxypeptidase E), a well characterized metalloprotease. Further in vivo yeast two-hybrid screening has also revealed that residues 318-387 located in a region of unknown function in mature CPE are indispensable for association with mECP. In addition, the uptake of mECP-eGFP-6H is suppressed by dominant-negative expression of the recycling defect mutant pre-pro-HA-CPE(S471A,E472A) in GH3 cells, suggesting that the entry of mECP-eGFP-6H is associated with the recycling of CPE in GH3 cells. Taken together, we have demonstrated that CPE possesses a novel function to facilitate the entry of ECP to neuroendocrine cells, and such an endocytotic process allows the cytotoxic ECP to inhibit growth of the target cells.","Wu, Chia-Mao; Chang, Hao-Teng; Chang, Margaret Dah-Tsyr",The Biochemical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15233624/,49
187697,Virtual was the Reality in Neuroscience Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020,"The development of a rhinovirus (RV)-RNA-specific reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay is complicated by the close homology between the RV and enterovirus (EV) genomes in the highly conserved 5'-noncoding region, which is chosen for primer design in most RT-PCR assays. We have developed a sensitive, rapid, and RV-specific nested RT-PCR assay and have used it to test nasopharyngeal aspirates from 556 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections. RV RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR not only in all of 52 samples that were RV positive by virus isolation methods but also in 124 of 367 samples that were negative by virus isolation methods and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, in 23 of 137 samples that were positive for a different respiratory virus by virus isolation and/or ELISA, RV RNA was detected by RT-PCR. EVs, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, coronaviruses, and influenza and parainfluenza viruses, including clinical isolates as well as stock viruses, were not amplified in our RV-specific RT-PCR assay, indicating that this assay was highly specific. The processing time was less than 2 days for the RT-PCR, as opposed to up to 2 weeks for virus isolation. These results indicate that nested RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional methods for the detection of RV in patients experiencing acute respiratory tract infections and represents the only reliable tool for the early laboratory diagnosis of RV infections.

188358,MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.,1936,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is 1 of the most economically important diseases of swine. Detection of the etiologic agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), represents a diagnostic challenge due to the heterogeneity of field isolates as well as the propensity for swine to develop persistent infection in which virus is difficult to detect. Recently European (EU) lineage PRRSV isolates, which are genetically divergent from North American (NA) isolates, have been introduced into NA swine further complicating efforts to diagnose this disease. In this study, real-time (TaqMan) reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays were developed for multiplex detection, differentiation, and quantification of NA and EU PRRSV field isolates. Oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled probes were selected from conserved regions of open-reading frame 7 and the 3'-untranslated region. The real-time RT-PCR assays described for the NA or EU genotype of PRRSV detected viral RNA from 83/83 strains (74 NA; 9 EU) previously isolated by cell culture between 1992 and 2003. The analytical sensitivity of both assays was consistently found to be less than a single TCID50, which corresponded to 5-10 RNA molecules, and was not significantly reduced when the reactions were performed in a multiplex format. When performing multiplex reactions, sensitive detection was possible even when 1 viral RNA concentration was up to 5,000-fold higher than the second. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex reaction was found to be at a minimum equivalent to that of both nested RT-PCR and virus isolation.","Kleiboeker, Steven B; Schommer, Susan K; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Watkins, Sandy; Chittick, Wayne; Polson, Dale","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15825498/,49

The goal of the present study was to evaluate changes in serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity and canine-specific pancreatic lipase after pancreatic fine-needle aspiration and surgical biopsy in 27 clinically healthy dogs. Presurgical, ultrasound-guided aspiration of the pancreas was performed with the dogs under sedation. Subsequently, all the dogs underwent intraoperative pancreatic fine-needle aspiration and clamshell biopsy. After euthanasia, pancreata were sectioned for histopathologic evaluation. Serum pancreatic enzyme levels were measured at 3 time points: baseline, after ultrasound-guided aspiration, and after intraoperative aspiration and biopsy. No significant differences were detected among mean serum pancreatic lipase values at any point (P > 0.05). Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity did not change from baseline (18.2 +/- 2.1 microg/dl; mean +/- standard error) after ultrasound-guided aspiration (13.6 +/- 2.2 microg/dl) but increased significantly after intraoperative sampling (44.8 +/- 1.9 microg/dl; P < 0.0005). After surgical biopsy, the 20 dogs that had both ultrasound-guided and intraoperative sampling had a higher mean (SE) serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (44.8 +/- 1.9 microg/dl) than the 7 dogs that had only intraoperative samples taken (36.4 +/- 4.1 microg/dl; P < 0.05). All 27 pancreata were grossly normal before intraoperative sampling. Pancreatic sampling was associated with increased serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity and mild, peracute necrosis, inflammation, hemorrhage, and fibrin deposition.

In the lungs of the 3 patients, localized necrosis occurred where infiltration of CD45RO (+) T lymphocytes was observed, with only scarce Ki67 (+) T lymphocytes (active T lymphocytes) and B lymphocytes. In the lymph nodes, scattered T lymphocytes positive for Ki67 and CD45RO markers (active T lymphocytes) were seen, but the T lymphocytes subpopulations were obviously decreased, which was especially so with CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells. CONCLUSION Significantly enhanced activity of the macrophages occurs in SARS as the major reactive cells, but T lymphocyte subsets are obviously decreased, indicating the important roles of the macrophages and T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of SARS.","He, Li; Ding, Yan-qing; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Qing-ling; Zhang, Jin-hua; Geng, Jian; Cai, Jun-jie",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12919894/,49
190716,Recommendations for a standardised educational program in robot assisted gynaecological surgery: Consensus from the Society of European Robotic Gynaecological Surgery (SERGS).,2019-03-01,"BACKGROUND Compared to pneumatically controlled pressure support (PSP), neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) was proved to improve patient-ventilator interactions, while not affecting comfort, diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi), and arterial blood gases (ABGs). This study compares neurally controlled pressure support (PSN) with PSP and NAVA, delivered through two different helmets, in hypoxemic patients receiving noninvasive ventilation for prevention of extubation failure. METHODS Fifteen patients underwent three (PSP, NAVA, and PSN) 30-min trials in random order with both helmets. Positive end-expiratory pressure was always set at 10 cm H2O. In PSP, the inspiratory support was set at 10 cm H2O above positive end-expiratory pressure. NAVA was adjusted to match peak EAdi (EAdipeak) during PSP. In PSN, the NAVA level was set at maximum matching the pressure delivered during PSP by limiting the upper pressure. The authors assessed patient comfort, EAdipeak, rates of pressurization (i.e., airway pressure-time product [PTP] of the first 300 and 500 ms after the initiation of patient effort, indexed to the ideal pressure-time products), and measured ABGs. RESULTS PSN significantly increased comfort to (median [25 to 75% interquartile range]) 8 [7 to 8] and 9 [8 to 9] with standard and new helmets, respectively, as opposed to both PSP (5 [5 to 6] and 7 [6 to 7]) and NAVA (6 [5 to 7] and 7 [6 to 8]; P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Regardless of the interface, PSN also decreased EAdipeak (P < 0.01), while increasing PTP of the first 300 ms from the onset of patient effort, indexed to the ideal PTP (P < 0.01) and PTP of the first 500 ms from the onset of patient effort, indexed to the ideal PTP (P < 0.001). ABGs were not different among trials. CONCLUSIONS When delivering noninvasive ventilation by helmet, compared to PSP and NAVA, PSN improves comfort and patient-ventilator interactions, while not ABGs.

The nucleotide and amino acid similarities between the eight IB vaccine strains and the field strain, tl/CH/LDT3/03, which was isolated from a teal (Anas sp.), were not more than 81.1% and 79.2%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 genes showed that the vaccines and field strains belonged to different clusters and showed larger evolutionary distances, and indicated that they were of different genotypes. Four out of the eight vaccines, in addition to the Massachusetts type vaccine H120, were used for protection tests against challenge by the IB virus isolate tl/CH/LDT3/03. This revealed that each of the five IB vaccines induced poor protection against the teal isolate, as assessed by respiratory protection, clinical signs and mortality, indicating the necessity of developing vaccines from local strains for IB control in China.","Liu, Shengwang; Chen, Jianfei; Han, Zongxi; Zhang, Qinxia; Shao, Yuhao; Kong, Xiangang; Tong, Guangzhi",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16990149/,49

A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been recently identified as the etiological agent responsible for the infectious SARS disease. Based on extensively scientific cooperation and almost two-year's studies, remarkable achievements have been made in the understanding of the phylogenetic property and the genome organization of SARS-CoV, as well as the detailed characters of the major proteins involved in SARS-CoV life cycle. In this review, we would like to summarize the substantial scientific progress that has been made towards the structural and functional aspects of SARS-CoV associated key proteins. The progress focused on the corresponding key proteins' structure-based drug and vaccine developments has been also highlighted. The concerted and cooperative response for the treatment of the SARS disease has been proved to be a triumph of global public health and provides a new paradigm for the detection and control of future emerging infectious disease threats.","Chen, Shuai; Luo, Haibin; Chen, Lili; Chen, Jing; Shen, Jianhua; Zhu, Weiliang; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang",Current pharmaceutical design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17168760/,49

It has also affected urology residents, depriving them of training at their usual workplaces and forcing them to support COVID units. This has implied not only the loss of daily activities, but also the uncertainty of job opportunities for the final year residents. In addition, the cancellation of numerous events such as congresses, exams,or courses has affected the annual planning of the specialty. A review of the current literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the de-escalation process, on resident training has been carried out using web search and PubMed. The situation of the residents has been analyzed, both through the information generated by recent literature and by the personal experience of the authors, from different areas: evaluation systems, educational and surgical aspects, as well as healthcare work. As a result of this review, the negative impact of the crisison urology resident training can be observed, especially in the surgical field, but new learning opportunities or new forms of communication with the patient can also be observed. These educational and healthcare resources invite the urology resident in particular, and the medical society in general, to reinvent themselves. The aim of this article is to analyse the training of the urology resident in the de-escalation phase. Similarly, the emerging educational resources during the pandemic are synthesized, inviting the reader, and especially the urology resident, to continue their training and learningin these times of uncertainty.","Seguí-Moya, Elena; González-Padilla, Daniel Antonio; Ortega-Polledo, Luís Enrique; Sánchez-García, María; López-González, José Agustín; Antón-Juanilla, Marta; Mercader-Barrull, Clàudia; Carrión, Diego M; Álvarez-Ossorio, José Luís",Archivos espanoles de urologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538819/,49

The sequence analysis showed that CCoV 1-71 displayed a 98.8-99.8% identity with CCoVs strains V1, K378, and GP. Four putative recombination sites were found at the 5'-end of the S gene, namely at nt 53, 75, 425, 991. Both sequences flanking each site were significantly different. Three recombination hot regions were found on the S gene, namely at nt 337-437, 1545-3405, and 4203-4356, which shared a common recombination signal with Group 2 coronaviruses. The G/CTAAAAA/GT sequence downstream of the recombination site may represent a specific recombination signal in CCoVs. The CCoV 1-71 S protein sequence was found to be similar to those of other CCoVs except for several N-glycosylation sites at the N-terminus of the S protein, which could be related to the differences in virulence and cell tropism in individual CCoVs. This study indicated that the similarity of CCoVs in virulence and tropism was mostly acquired by the homologous RNA recombination and not only by simple mutation and selection.","Wang, Y Y; Lu, C P",Acta virologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19537912/,49

Internet systems are particularly attractive for disease outbreaks because they can provide data in near real-time and can be verified by individuals around the globe. However, most existing systems have focused on disease monitoring and do not provide a data repository for policy makers or researchers. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed Wikipedia article content. We demonstrate how a named-entity recognizer can be trained to tag case counts, death counts, and hospitalization counts in the article narrative that achieves an F1 score of 0.753. We also show, using the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic article as a case study, that there are detailed time series data that are consistently updated that closely align with ground truth data.

Therefore, in this study, the role of calcium (Ca2+) signaling in imparting Ni tolerance was investigated in zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L. cv Courgette d'Italie). Exposure of zucchini seedlings to Hogland solution containing 0.28 mmol L-1 Ni(NO3)2 reduced plant growth, the content of chlorophyll and carotenoids and the relative water content (RWC) in leaves, increased Ni accumulation that was accompanied to depletion of the essential bivalent cations and induced oxidative stress and proline accumulation in both shoots and roots. Pretreatment with the nutrient solution containing 15 mmol L-1 calcium chloride (CaCl2), significantly improved zucchini growth and photosynthetic pigment contents and maintained RWC in leaves under both control and Ni stress conditions. Pretreatment with CaCl2 reduced Ni accumulation, modified cation homeostasis, increased the activities of peroxidase and catalase enzymes and lowered Ni-induced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and proline in leaves and roots. Pre-exposure of root with Ca2+ chelator (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) and plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker (lanthanum chloride) impaired impact of Ca2+ on the aforementioned attributes. Outcomes of this study not only highlight the signaling role of Ca2+ in regulating defensive responses but also suggest an eco- friendly approach for reducing the Ni contamination in plants that ensure food safety.","Valivand, Maryam; Amooaghaie, Rayhaneh",Int J Phytoremediation,,49

210819,Virus variants: GISAID policies incentivize surveillance in global south,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome (MS) during the disease course. Its presence in different ethnicities and continents places MS as an important risk factor for COVID-19. Adequate understanding of the interplay between MS, COVID-19 and proposed therapies is required for optimum management of these patients. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until June 1st, 2020 and accessed the full text on COVID-19 and MS to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Patients with metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and liver disease may face a higher risk of infection of COVID-19, greatly affecting the development and prognosis of the disease, being associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. The proposed drugs that are in clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment must be carefully considered for clinical use, especially in patients with MS. CONCLUSION: MS is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of COVID-2019. The drugs currently evaluated for the infection treatment are promising but need further studies to prove their efficacy and safety, due to the adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection. The development of a vaccine for immunization is still the best long-term solution.","Costa, Fernanda Farias; Rosário, Wilian Reis; Ribeiro Farias, Ana Cláudia; de Souza, Ramon Guimarães; Duarte Gondim, Roberta Sabrine; Barroso, Wermerson Assunção",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,49

211481,[Bats and humans],2020,"Several methodologies for academically exploring causality have been addressed in recent years. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), one of the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, relies on expert judgements to construct an influential network relation map (INRM), revealing the mutual causes and effects of the criteria and dimensions for presentation of the results in a visual manner. The interactional impacts may be evaluated without considering the presumed hypotheses. The DEMATEL has been successfully utilized to assist in complex decision-making problems in various contexts. However, there is controversy about the reliance upon expert judgements, which could be subjective. Thus, this study seeks to overcome this dispute by developing a data-driven, concept-based novel hybrid model which the authors call SEM-DEMATEL. The model first constructs the direct effects between indicators based on structural equation modeling (SEM) and then utilizes DEMATEL to confirm the interdependence among the variables and identify their causes and effects. Finally, an empirical study exploring the key factors affecting mobile payment usage intention is further conducted to demonstrate the feasibility, validity, and reliability of the novel SEM-DEMATEL research approach. The results identify that the perceived value is the key influencing indicator of m-payment usage intention, and the objectivity and efficiency of the research results are compared.","Fang, Ching Ching Liou James J.

215551,Intense bitterness of molecules: machine learning for expediting drug discovery,2020,"BACKGROUND: Earlier serosurveys in India revealed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 0.73% during May-June and 7.1% during August-September 2020. We conducted the third serosurvey during Dec 2020 and Jan 2021, to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in India. METHODS: We conducted the serosurvey in the same 70 districts selected for the first and second serosurveys. From each district, we enrolled at least 400 individuals aged &#8805; 10 years from general population and 100 HCWs from sub-district level health facilities. Sera from general population were tested for presence of IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid (N) and spike protein (S1-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, whereas sera from HCWs were tested for anti-S1-RBD. We estimated weighted seroprevalence adjusted for assay characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 28,598 sera from general population, 4585 (16%) had IgG antibodies against N, 6647 (23.2%) against S1-RBD and 7436 (26%) against either. The weighted and assay characteristic adjusted seroprevalence against either of the antibodies was 24.1 (95%CI: 23.0%-25.3%). Among 7385 HCWs, the seroprevalence of anti-S1-RBD IgG antibodies was 25.6% (95% CI: 23.5%-27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in four individuals aged > = 10 years from general population as well as HCWs in India were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by December 2020.","Murhekar, Manoj V; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Thangaraj, Jeromie Wesley Vivian; Saravanakumar, V; Kumar, Muthusamy Santhosh; Selvaraju, Sriram; Rade, Kiran; Girish Kumar, C P; Sabarinathan, R; Turuk, Alka; Asthana, Smita; Balachandar, Rakesh; Bangar, Sampada Dipak; Bansal, Avi Kumar; Chopra, Vishal; Das, Dasarathi; Deb, Alok Kumar; Devi, Kangjam Rekha; Dhikav, Vikas; Dwivedi, Gaurav Raj; Muhammad Salim Khan, S; Sunil Kumar, M; Laxmaiah, Avula; Madhukar, Major; Mahapatra, Amarendra; Rangaraju, Chethana; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Yadav, Rajiv; Andhalkar, Rushikesh; Arunraj, K; Bharadwaj, Dinesh Kumar; Bharti, Pravin; Bhattacharya, Debdutta; Bhat, Jyothi; Chahal, Ashrafjit S; Chakraborty, Debjit; Chaudhury, Anshuman; Deval, Hirawati; Dhatrak, Sarang; Dayal, Rakesh; Elantamilan, D; Giridharan, Prathiksha; Haq, Inaamul; Hudda, Ramesh Kumar; Jagjeevan, Babu; Kalliath, Arshad; Kanungo, Srikanta; Krishnan, Nivethitha N; Kshatri, Jaya Singh; Kumar, Alok",Int. j. infect. dis,,49

216599,Can B2B Implementation Enhance Competitiveness of Logistic Companies in Coronavirus Economic Recession?,2021,"We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to assess the association of anticoagulants and their dosage with in-hospital all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients. Articles were retrieved until January 8, 2021, by searching in seven electronic databases. The main outcome was all-cause mortality occurred during hospitalization. Data were combined using the general variance-based method on the effect estimate for each study. Separate meta-analyses according to type of COVID-19 patients (hospitalized or intensive care unit [ICU] patients), anticoagulants (mainly heparin), and regimens (therapeutic or prophylactic) were conducted. A total of 29 articles were selected, but 23 retrospective studies were eligible for quantitative meta-analyses. No clinical trial was retrieved. The majority of studies were of good quality; however, 34% did not distinguish heparin from other anticoagulants. Meta-analysis on 25,719 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that anticoagulant use was associated with 50% reduced in-hospital mortality risk (pooled risk ratio [RR]: 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.62; I 2: 87%). Both anticoagulant regimens (therapeutic and prophylactic) reduced in-hospital all-cause mortality, compared with no anticoagulation. Particularly in ICU patients, the anticoagulant therapeutic regimen was associated with a reduced in-hospital mortality risk (RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15-0.60; I 2: 58%) compared with the prophylactic one. However, the former was also associated with a higher risk of bleeding (RR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.60-4.00; I 2: 65%). Anticoagulant use, mainly heparin, reduced all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. Due to the higher risk of bleeding at therapeutic doses, the use of prophylactic dosages of anticoagulant is probably to be preferred in noncritically ill COVID-19 patients.","Parisi, Roberta; Costanzo, Simona; Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; de Gaetano, Giovanni; Donati, Maria Benedetta; Iacoviello, Licia",Semin Thromb Hemost,,49

Here we demonstrate situations where modern machine learning methods are ill-equipped to reveal feature interaction effects and other nonlinear relationships. We propose the use of a conjecturing machine that generates feature relationships in the form of bounds for numerical features and boolean expressions for nominal features that are ignored by machine learning algorithms. The proposed framework is demonstrated for a classification problem with an interaction effect and a nonlinear regression problem. In both settings, true underlying relationships are revealed and generalization performance improves. The framework is then applied to patient-level data regarding COVID-19 outcomes to suggest possible risk factors.","Brooks, J. P.; Edwards, D. J.; Larson, C. E.; Cleemput, N.

222033,Editorial: The Matters that Haunt Us,2021,"Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam that contains ethanol or isopropanol used to disinfect hands. Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (&#8805;60% ethanol or &#8805;70% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Whereas early clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), persons with methanol poisoning might develop severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, seizures, and blindness. If left untreated methanol poisoning can be fatal (5). Survivors of methanol poisoning might have permanent visual impairment, including complete vision loss; data suggest that vision loss results from the direct toxic effect of formate, a toxic anion metabolite of methanol, on the optic nerve (6). CDC and state partners established a case definition of alcohol-based hand sanitizer-associated methanol poisoning and reviewed 62 poison center call records from May 1 through June 30, 2020, to characterize reported cases. Medical records were reviewed to abstract details missing from poison center call records. During this period, 15 adult patients met the case definition, including persons who were American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). All had ingested an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Four patients died and three were discharged with vision impairment. Persons should never ingest alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoid use of specific imported products found to contain methanol, and continue to monitor FDA guidance (7). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning. Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, correction of acidosis, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., fomepizole), and frequently, hemodialysis.","Yip, Luke; Bixler, Danae; Brooks, Daniel E; Clarke, Kevin R; Datta, S Deblina; Dudley, Steven; Komatsu, Kenneth K; Lind, Jennifer N; Mayette, Annaliese; Melgar, Michael; Pindyck, Talia; Schmit, Kristine M; Seifert, Steven A; Shirazi, Farshad Mazda; Smolinske, Susan C; Warrick, Brandon J; Chang, Arthur",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,49

We present, for the first time, predictions of symbol error rate as a function of link distance, signal bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and atmospheric conditions, revealing that long-distance, broadband terahertz communication systems may be limited by inter-symbol interference stemming from group velocity dispersion, rather than attenuation. In such dispersion limited links, increasing signal strength does not improve the symbol error rate and, consequently, theoretical predictions of symbol error rate based only on signal-to-noise ratio are invalid for the broadband case. This work establishes a new and necessary foundation for link budget analysis in future long-distance terahertz communication systems that accounts for the non-negligible effects of both attenuation and dispersion.","Strecker, Karl; Ekin, Sabit; OHara, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00611v2.pdf,49

Retrospective review of the medical records of patients with disc hemorrhage, which was detected during follow up with open angle glaucoma, from January 2010 to March 2018. Patients were divided into glaucoma progression (n = 52) or non-progression (n = 38) groups. We assessed proximal location and morphology of disc hemorrhage; relationship to retinal nerve fiber layer defects with disc hemorrhage; and angular extent of disc hemorrhage, between groups using fundus photography. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to select prognostic factors, and we constructed a nomogram to predict glaucoma progression. The number of disc hemorrhage at the border of retinal nerve fiber layer defects (P = 0.001) and peripapillary disc hemorrhage (P = 0.008) were significantly higher in the progression group. We used angular extent; location of disc hemorrhage with retinal nerve fiber layer defects; and proximal location of disc hemorrhage to construct the nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram was 0.847. We created the nomogram using fundus photography in patients showing disc hemorrhage as a novel and accurate screening method to predict glaucoma progression and aid clinicians to decide on the best treatment plan.","Kim, Sangah; Park, Chan Keum; Kim, Eun Woo; Lee, Sang Yeop; Seong, Gong Je; Kim, Chan Yun; Bae, Hyoung Won",Sci Rep,,49

The secondary outcome was finding out the most preferable webinar setting. METHODS: An online global survey was done between June 06 and July 05, 2020, using SurveyMonkey. The target participants were urology healthcare providers. The survey was disseminated via mailing lists and the Twitter platform. RESULTS: A total of 526 urology providers from 56 countries responded to the survey and it was completed by 73.3%. Participants' overall experience was better in a face-to-face meeting, followed by a hybrid and webinar only meeting. While opportunities for networking was identified as high in face-to-face meeting, online webinars were more cost effective, and learning opportunity and reach of audience was higher for hybrid meetings. For online webinar format, Zoom platform was used by 73% and majority (69%) saw it on their laptop or desktop. The preference was for a 1-hour webinar in the evenings with 3-5 speakers. Urology residents rated face-to-face meetings to have better cost-effectiveness when compared to consultants. Post COVID-19, more than half of all respondents would prefer hybrid meetings compared to the other formats. CONCLUSION: While there will be a place for face-to-face meetings, COVID-19 situation has led to a preference towards hybrid meetings which is ideal for a global reach in the future.

In this report, experts with experience in treating amyloidosis and ATTR-CM developed consensus recommendations for monitoring the course of patients with ATTR-CM and proposed meaningful thresholds and frequency for specific parameters. A set of 11 measurable features across three separate domains were evaluated: (i) clinical and functional endpoints, (ii) biomarkers and laboratory markers, and (iii) imaging and electrocardiographic parameters. Experts recommended that one marker from each of the three domains provides the minimum requirements for assessing disease progression. Assessment of cardiac disease status should be part of a multiparametric evaluation in which progression, stability or improvement of other involved systems in transthyretin amyloidosis should also be considered. Additional data from placebo arms of clinical trials and future studies assessing ATTR-CM will help to elucidate, refine and define these and other measurements.","Garcia-Pavia, Pablo; Bengel, Frank; Brito, Dulce; Damy, Thibaud; Duca, Franz; Dorbala, Sharmila; Nativi-Nicolau, Jose; Obici, Laura; Rapezzi, Claudio; Sekijima, Yoshiki; Elliott, Perry M",Eur. j. heart fail,,49

We aimed to quantify stress, anxiety and depression among individuals with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Australia during the pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey was made available to IBD patients Australia-wide from 17 June to 12 July 2020. Respondents with an underlying diagnosis of IBD and over 18 years of age were included. A validated questionnaire (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Score-21, DASS21) was used to assess depression, anxiety and stress. Data on potential predictors of depression, anxiety and stress were collected. RESULTS: 352 participated in the survey across Australia. 60.5% of respondents fulfilled DASS criteria for at least moderate depression, anxiety or stress. 45% reported a pre-existing diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Over 2/3 of these respondents reported worsening of their pre-existing depression/anxiety due to the current pandemic. Of those without a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety or depression, high rates of at least moderate to severe depression (34.9%), anxiety (32.0%) and stress (29.7%) were noted. Younger age (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98, p<0.001), lack of access to an IBD nurse (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.19, p=0.04) and lack of education on reducing infection risk (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.50, p=0.017) were associated with significant stress, anxiety and/or depression. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of undiagnosed depression, anxiety and stress was identified among respondents.

DISCUSSION: The patient had negative preoperative testing for the virus and presented with profound oxygen desaturation and respiratory failure several days postoperatively. This raised concern for a complication of his arterial switch operation. It was found that one of the patient's caregivers was an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19, and imaging ruled out intracardiac shunting. After initiating treatment for COVID-19, the patient's oxygen requirements and need for anti-arrhythmic agents improved. CONCLUSION: We propose that, despite negative preoperative testing, coronavirus infection may present as refractory tachyarrhythmia, and may be considered along with surgical complications as a cause for unexplained hypoxemia postoperatively.","Lopez, Raymond A; Padilla, Luz A; Sorabella, Robert A; Cleveland, David C; Rhodes, Leslie A; Dabal, Robert J",J Card Surg,,49

Limited availability of contact information made contact tracing difficult or impractical in combating the outbreak. We consider the development of multi-scale public health strategies and simulate policies for community-level response aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as well as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of compliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40% level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected areas. Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further evolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.","Wong, Vincent; Cooney, Daniel; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07020v2.pdf,49

Because simulation is considered best practice for competency-based education, emergency medicine (EM) residencies adapted and innovated to accommodate to the new pandemic normal. Our objectives were to identify the impact of the pandemic on EM residency simulation training, to identify unique simulation adaptations and innovations implemented during the pandemic, and to analyze successes and failures through existing educational frameworks to offer guidance on the use of simulation in the COVID-19 era. Methods: The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM)'s Simulation Academy formed the SimCOVID task force to examine the impact of COVID-19 on simulation didactics. A mixed-methods approach was employed. A literature search was conducted on the subject and used to develop an exploratory survey that was distributed on the Simulation Academy Listserv. The results were subjected to thematic analysis and examined through existing educational frameworks to better understand successes and failures and then used to generate suggestions on the use of simulation in the COVID-19 era. Results: Thirty programs responded to the survey. Strategies reported included adaptations to virtual teleconferencing and small-group in situ training with a focus on procedural training and COVID-19 preparedness. Successful continuation or relaunching of simulation programs was predicated on several factors including willingness for curricular pivots through rapid iterative prototyping, embracing teleconferencing software, technical know-how, and organizational and human capacity. In specific instances the use of in situ simulation for COVID-19 preparedness established the view of simulation as a ""value add"" to the organization. Conclusions: Whereas simulation educator's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic can be better appreciated through the lens of iterative curricular prototyping, their successes and failures depended on existing expertise in technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge. That knowledge needed to exist and synergize within a system that had the human and organizational capacity to prioritize and invest in strategies to respond to the rapidly evolving crisis in a proactive manner. Going forward, administrators and educators will need to advocate for continued investment in human and organizational capacity to support simulation-based efforts for the evolving clinical and educational landscape.","Nadir, Nur-Ain; Kim, Jane; Cassara, Michael; Hrdy, Michael; Zaveri, Pavan; Wong, Ambrose H; Ray, Jessica; Strother, Christopher; Falk, Michael",AEM Educ Train,,49
251377,Recent Randomized Trials of Antithrombotic Therapy for Patients With COVID-19: JACC State-of-the-Art Review,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2 has cost many lives worldwide. In dealing with affected patients, the physician is faced with a very unusual pattern of organ damage that is not easily explained on the basis of prior knowledge of viral-induced pathogenesis. It is established that the main receptor for viral entry into tissues is the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 [""ACE-2"", (1)]. In a recent publication (2), a theory of autoimmunity against ACE-2, and/or against the ACE-2/SARS-COV-2 spike protein complex or degradation products thereof, was proposed as a possible explanation for the unusual pattern of organ damage seen in COVID-19. In the light of more recent information, this manuscript expands on the earlier proposed theory and offers additional, testable hypotheses that could explain both the pattern and timeline of organ dysfunction most often observed in COVID-19.","McMillan, Philip; Dexhiemer, Thomas; Neubig, Richard R; Uhal, Bruce D",Front Immunol,,49
251629,Can Extreme Electromagnetic Fields Accelerate the α Decay of Nuclei?,2020,"The current SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic challenges critical care physicians and other caregivers to find effective treatment for desperately ill patients - especially those with sudden and extreme hypoxemia. Unlike patients with other forms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, these patients do not exhibit increased lung stiffness or dramatic dyspnea., even in the presence of arterial blood oxygen levels lower than that seen normally in mixed venous blood. Urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation with high inflation pressures and raised inhaled oxygen concentration have proved unhelpful or worse, but why? Our Hypothesis is that sudden opening of a previously undetected probe-patent foramen ovale (PPFO) may explain this mystery. As hypoxemia without acidosis is a rather weak stimulus of dyspnea or increased ventilation, and opening of such an intracardiac shunt would not worsen lung mechanical properties, the absence of dramatic symptom changes would not be surprising. We point out the high frequency of PFO both in life and at autopsy, and the physiological evidence of large shunt fractions found in Covid-19 patients. Published evidence of hypercoagulability and abundant evidence of pulmonary emboli found at autopsy are in accord with our hypothesis, as they would contribute to raised pressure in the pulmonary arteries and right heart chambers, potentially causing a shunt to open. We review the interaction between viral corona spike protein and ACE-2 receptors present on the surface of alveolar lining cells, and contribution to hypercoagulabilty caused by the spike protein. Search for an open PFO after a large drop in arterial oxygen saturation can be performed at the bedside with a variety of well-established techniques including bedside echocardiography, nitrogen washout test, and imaging studies. Potential treatments might include balloon or patch closure of the shunt, and various drug treatments to lower pulmonary vascular resistance.","Fisher, H K",Med Hypotheses,,49
252649,Accessing new magnetic regimes by tuning the ligand spin-orbit coupling in van der Waals magnets,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by severe vascular remodelling, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. However, the diagnosis of PAH is often inaccurate. Many cases of PAH are incorrectly diagnosed or missed, and they are often associated with death. The aim of this study was to verify the morphological and histological criteria of fatal cases of PAH and evaluate the lymphocytic populations associated to lesions with reactive neo-angiogenesis. METHODS: Pulmonary lung sections from 10 cases of sudden unexpected death (SUD) in the absence of previously diagnosed diseases and in an apparent state of well-being, with final histological post autopsy diagnosis of PAH were collected. The pathological findings were compared using ten controls from non-pathological lung from deaths from other causes. The autopsies included 4 males (40%) and 6 females (60%) with an average age of 52.1 ± 10.1 years. Sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were revised for a morphological diagnosis. Subsequently, serial sections were performed and stained with immunohistochemistry for anti-CD20 (B-lymphocytes), anti-CD3 (T-lymphocytes), anti-CD4 (T-helper lumphocytes), anti-CD8 (T-cytotoxic lymphocytes) and anti-CD117/C-Kit (mast cells/MCs) to detect inflammatory infiltrate and different ratios of cell-type. Statistical analysis was conducted using a paired t-test looking at 100 cells in 3 different tissue samples representative of vascular lesion and 3 different random normal lung parenchyma fields without lesion (from 10 normal control lungs), to identify specific lymphocyte subpopulations in inflammatory infiltrates. RESULTS: There was a significant percentage increase of CD20 (p < 0.001), CD8 (p = 0.002), CD4 (p < 0.001), and CD117/C-Kit positive (C-Kit+; p < 0.001) cells mainly detected around wall vessels; while increased MCs positivity and C-Kit+ were observed especially in alveolar septa. In addition, reactive angiomatosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory infiltrate should be included for a correct diagnosis of PAH besides the vascular remodelling. The inflammatory infiltrate seems to be implicated as a main factor in the pathogenesis. This finding is important to rule out secondary pulmonary hypertension, to identify SUDs of unknown causes and to add new elements to the literature that can explain the immunologically related pathogenesis of PAH.","Mansueto, Gelsomina; Di Napoli, Mario; Campobasso, Carlo Pietro; Slevin, Mark",Pathol Res Pract,,49

Fish were exposed to different concentrations of EOCA and EOCL to determine time of anesthesia induction and recovery. Induction of anesthesia was observed in all fish exposed to 400, 600 or 800 µL L&#8722;1 EOCA and 300, 400 or 500 µL L&#8722;1 EOCL. Another group of fish were exposed for 8 h to 50, 100, or 200 µL L&#8722;1 of either EOs. Overall, fish exposed to ethanol and both EOs presented higher ventilatory frequencies (VF) than the control group throughout the 8 h of exposure. Net ion (Na+, K+ and Cl&#8722;) effluxes and ammonia excretion were significantly lower in fish exposed to 50, 100 or 200 µL L&#8722;1 of either EOs compared to control fish.

As a result of the rapid growth of COVID-19, hospitals are tasked with managing an increasing volume of these cases with neither a known effective therapy, an existing vaccine, nor well-established guidelines for clinical management. The need for actionable knowledge amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is dire and yet, given the urgency of this illness and the speed with which the healthcare workforce must devise useful policies for its management, there is insufficient time to await the conclusions of detailed, controlled, prospective clinical research. Thus, we present a retrospective study evaluating laboratory data and mortality from patients with positive RT-PCR assay results for SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to identify prognostic serum biomarkers in patients at greatest risk of mortality. To this end, we develop a machine learning model using five serum chemistry laboratory parameters (c-reactive protein, blood urea nitrogen, serum calcium, serum albumin, and lactic acid) from 398 patients (43 expired and 355 non-expired) for the prediction of death up to 48 h prior to patient expiration. The resulting support vector machine model achieved 91% sensitivity and 91% specificity (AUC 0.93) for predicting patient expiration status on held-out testing data. Finally, we examine the impact of each feature and feature combination in light of different model predictions, highlighting important patterns of laboratory values that impact outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Booth, Adam L; Abels, Elizabeth; McCaffrey, Peter",Mod. pathol,,49

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using large nationally representative samples (n &#8805; 1000) to examine the percentage of the population intending to vaccinate, unsure, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine when available. Generic inverse meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to pool estimates and examine time trends. PubMed, Scopus and pre-printer servers were searched from January-November 2020. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020223132). FINDINGS: Twenty-eight nationally representative samples (n = 58,656) from 13 countries indicate that as the pandemic has progressed, the percentage of people intending to vaccinate decreased and the percentage of people intending to refuse vaccination increased. Pooled data from surveys conducted during June-October suggest that 60% (95% CI: 49% to 69%) intend to vaccinate and 20% (95% CI: 13% to 29%) intend to refuse vaccination, although intentions vary substantially between samples and countries (I2 > 90%). Being female, younger, of lower income or education level and belonging to an ethnic minority group were consistently associated with being less likely to intend to vaccinate. Findings were consistent across higher vs. lower quality studies. INTERPRETATION: Intentions to be vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available have been declining across countries and there is an urgent need to address social inequalities in vaccine hesitancy and promote widespread uptake of vaccines as they become available.

Based on a hydrophobic-interaction-based protein docking mechanism, this study reveals that the mutation N501Y obviously increased the hydrophobic attraction and decrease hydrophilic repulsion between the RBD and ACE2 that most likely caused the transmissibility increment of the variants. By analyzing the mutation-induced hydrophobic surface changes in the attraction and repulsion at the binding site of the complexes of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and antibodies, we found out that all the mutations of N501Y, E484K, K417N and L452R can selectively decrease or increase their binding affinity with some antibodies.","Li, Jiacheng; Hou, Chengyu; Wang, Menghao; Liao, Chencheng; Guo, Shuai; Shi, Liping; Ma, Xiaoliang; Zhang, Hongchi; Jiang, Shenda; Zheng, Bing; Ye, Lin; Yang, Lin; He, Xiaodong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00399v1.pdf,49

267776,Side effect worry grows for AstraZeneca vaccine,2021,"Family meetings are fundamental to the practice of palliative medicine and serve as a cornerstone of intervention on the inpatient palliative care consultation service. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the structure and process of in-patient family meetings, owing to necessary but restrictive visitor policies that did not allow families to be present in the hospital. We describe implementation of telemedicine to facilitate electronic family (e-family) meetings to facilitate in-patient palliative care. Of 67 scheduled meetings performed by the palliative care service, only two meetings were aborted for a 97% success rate of scheduled meetings occurring. On a five-point Likert-type scale, the average clinician rating of the e-family meeting overall quality was 3.18 (SD, .96). Of the 10 unique family participants who agreed to be interviewed, their overall ratings of the e-family meetings were high. Over 80% of respondent families participants reported that they agreed or strongly agreed that they were able to ask all of their questions, felt comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings with the clinical team, felt like they understood the care their loved one received, and that the virtual family meeting helped them trust the clinical team. Of patients who were able to communicate, 50% of family respondents reported that the e-family meeting helped them understand their loved one's thoughts and wishes.","Kuntz, Joanne G; Kavalieratos, Dio; Esper, Gregory J; Ogbu, Noble; Mitchell, Julie; Ellis, Cameron M; Quest, Tammie",J Pain Symptom Manage,,49
268097,Measuring satisfaction in the small animal consultation and its relationship to consult length,2020,"PURPOSE: Methadone maintenance treatment is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorders (OUD). The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has introduced many concerns surrounding access to opioid treatment. In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued guidance allowing for the expansion of take-home methadone doses. We sought to describe changes to treatment experiences from the perspective of persons receiving methadone at outpatient treatment facilities for OUD. METHODS: We conducted an in-person survey among 104 persons receiving methadone from three clinics in central North Carolina in June and July 2020. Surveys collected information on demographic characteristics, methadone treatment history, and experiences with take-home methadone doses in the context of COVID-19 (i.e., before and since March 2020). RESULTS: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days' supply of take-home doses at each clinic ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since COVID-19. The clinic-level percent of participants receiving a take-homes days' supply of a week or longer (i.e., &#8805;6 days) since COVID-19 ranged from 11% to 56%. Among 87 participants who received take-homes since COVID-19, only four reported selling their take-home doses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found variation in experiences of take-home dosing by clinic and little diversion of take-home doses. While SAMSHA guidance should allow expanded access to take-home doses, adoption of these guidelines may vary at the clinic level. The adoption of these policies should be explored further, particularly in the context of benefits to patients seeking OUD treatment.","Figgatt, Mary C; Salazar, Zach; Day, Elizabeth; Vincent, Louise; Dasgupta, Nabarun",J Subst Abuse Treat,,49

276031,How countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave,2020,"Plenty of serologic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed so far, thus documenting the importance of evaluating the relevant features of the immune response to this viral agent. The performance of these assays is currently under investigation. Amongst them, LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG by DiaSorin and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 cobas® by Roche are currently used by laboratory medicine hospital departments in Italy and many other countries. In the present study, we firstly compared two serologic tests on serum samples collected at two different time points from 46 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) subjects. Secondly, 85 negative serum samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed. Thirdly, possible correlations between antibody levels and the resulting neutralizing activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Results revealed that both tests are endowed with low sensitivity on the day of hospital admission, which increased to 97.8% and 100% for samples collected after 15 days for DiaSorin and Roche tests, respectively. The specificity evaluated for the two tests ranges from 96.5% to 100%, respectively. Importantly, a poor direct correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity levels was evidenced in the present study. These data further shed light on both potentials and possible limitations related to SARS-CoV-2 serology. In this context, great efforts are still necessary for investigating antibody kinetics to develop novel diagnostic algorithms. Moreover, further investigations on the role of neutralizing antibodies and their correlate of protection will be of paramount importance for the development of effective vaccines.","Criscuolo, Elena; Diotti, Roberta A; Strollo, Marta; Rolla, Serena; Ambrosi, Alessandro; Locatelli, Massimo; Burioni, Roberto; Mancini, Nicasio; Clementi, Massimo; Clementi, Nicola",J. med. virol,,49

277848,Behind the scenes of the CRISPR story,2021,"The healthcare industry requires the integration of digital technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), to their full potential, particularly during this challenging time and the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the disruptions in healthcare delivery, service operations, and shortage of healthcare personnel. However, every opportunity has barriers and bumps, and when it comes to IoT healthcare, data privacy is one of the main growing issues. Despite the recent advances in the development of IoT healthcare architectures, most of them are invasive for the data subjects. In this context, the broad applications of AI in the IoT domain have also been hindered by emerging strict legal and ethical requirements to protect individual privacy. Camera-based solutions that monitor human subjects in everyday settings, e.g., for Online Range of Motion (ROM) detection, are making this problem even worse. One actively practiced branch of such solutions is telerehabilitation, which provides remote solutions for the physically impaired to regain their strength and get back to their normal daily routines. The process usually involves transmitting video/images from the patient performing rehabilitation exercises and applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to extract meaningful information to help therapists devise further treatment plans. Thereby, real-time measurement and assessment of rehabilitation exercises in a reliable, accurate, and Privacy-Preserving manner is imperative. To address the privacy issue of existing solutions, this paper proposes a holistic Privacy-Preserving (PP) hierarchical IoT solution that simultaneously addresses the utilization of AI-driven IoT and the demands for data protection. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed architecture is demonstrated by a novel machine learning-based system that allows immediate assessment and extraction of ROM as the critical information for analyzing the progress of patients.","Nadian-Ghomsheh, Ali; Farahani, Bahar; Kavian, Mohammad",Multimed Tools Appl,,49

280278,Pandemics: global biobanking for equitable testing,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused public lockdowns around the world. We analyzed if the public lockdown altered the referral pattern of Code Stroke patients by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to our Comprehensive Stroke Center. METHODS: Retrospective single-center study at a Bavarian Comprehensive Stroke Center. Patients who were directly referred to our stroke unit by EMS between the 1st of January 2020 and the 19th of April 2020 were identified and number of referrals, clinical characteristics and treatment strategies were analyzed during the public lockdown and before. The public lockdown started on 21st of March and ended on 19th April 2020. RESULTS: In total 241 patients were referred to our center during the study period, i.e. 171 before and 70 during the lockdown. The absolute daily number of Code Stroke referrals and the portion of patients with stroke mimics remained stable. The portion of female stroke patients decreased (55% to 33%; p = 0.03), and stroke severity as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median 3 (IQR 0-7) versus 6 (IQR 1-15.5) points; p = 0.04) increased during the lockdown. There was no difference of daily numbers of patients receiving thrombolysis and thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Referral of Code Stroke patients by EMS could be maintained sufficiently despite the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. However, patients' health care utilization of the EMS may have changed within the public lockdown. EMS remains a useful tool for Code Stroke patient referral during lockdowns, but public education about stroke is required prior to further lockdowns.","Ikenberg, Benno; Hemmer, Bernhard; Dommasch, Michael; Kanz, Karl-Georg; Wunderlich, Silke; Knier, Benjamin",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,49

282260,Labs rush to study coronavirus in transgenic animals - some are in short supply,2020,"Many works have been done to handle the uncertainties in the data using type 1 fuzzy regression. Few type 2 fuzzy regression works used interval type 2 for indeterminate modeling using type 1 fuzzy membership. The current survey proposes a triangular type-2 fuzzy regression (TT2FR) model to ameliorate the efficiency of the model by handling the uncertainty in the data. The triangular secondary membership function is used instead of widely used interval type models. In the proposed model, vagueness in primary and secondary fuzzy sets is minimized and also, a specified x-plane of observed value is included in the same {\alpha}- plane of the predicted value. Complex calculations of the type-2 fuzzy (T2F) model are simplified by reducing three dimensional type-2 fuzzy set (3DT2FS) into two dimensional interval type-2 fuzzy (2DIT2F) models. The current survey presents a new regression model of T2F by considering the more general form of T2F membership functions and thus avoids high complexity. The performance of the developed model is evaluated using the TAIEX and COVID-19 forecasting datasets. Our developed model reached the highest performance as compared to the other state-of-art techniques. Our developed method is ready to be tested with more uncertain data and has the potential to use to predict the weather and stock prediction.","Zare, Assef; Shoeibi, Afshin; Shafaei, Narges; Moridian, Parisa; Alizadehsani, Roohallah; Halaji, Majid; Khosravi, Abbas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05461v1.pdf,49

The reported rate of secondary infections was quite low in previous studies. The objectives of our study were to investigate the rate of secondary infections, risk factors for secondary infections and risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study in mechanically ventilated critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our Critical Care Unit (CCU). We recorded the patients' demographic data; clinical data; microbiology data and incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and nosocomial bacteremia (primary and secondary). RESULTS: A total of 107 patients with a mean age 62.2 ± 10.6 years were included. Incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay was 43.0% (46 patients), including nosocomial bacteremia (34 patients) and VAP (35 patients). Age was related to development of secondary infection (65.2 ± 7.3 vs. 59.9 ± 12.2 years, p=0.007). Age &#8805; 65 years and secondary infection were independent predictors of mortality (OR=2.692, 95% CI 1.068-6.782, p<0.036; and OR=3.658, 95% CI 1.385- 9.660, p=0.009, respectively). The hazard ratio for death within 90 days in the &#8805; 65 years group and in patients infected by antimicrobial resistant pathogens was 1.901 (95% CI 1.198- 3.018; p= 0.005 by log-rank test) and 1.787 (95% CI 1.023-3.122; p= 0.036 by log-rank test), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the incidence of secondary infection and infection by antimicrobial resistant pathogens is very high in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a significant impact on prognosis.","Suarez-de-la-Rica, A; Serrano, P; De-la-Oliva, R; Sánchez-Díaz, P; Molinero, P; Falces-Romero, I; Ferrando, C; Rello, J; Maseda, E",Rev Esp Quimioter,,49

Micronesians, mostly Chuukese and Marshallese, were the most severely affected. Disproportionate COVID-19 infection in racial or ethnic groups in the US occur because of socioeconomic factors. The COVID-19 pandemic can be thought of as a syndemic-where cases cluster ""on a background of social and economic disparity"". In this brief report, we describe factors that put Chuukese and Marshallese at increased risk for COVID-19 in Hawaii. We show that Micronesians had increased risk for COVID-19 due to limited employment opportunities, housing insecurity, and underlying comorbid conditions in the context of rescinded federal health insurance and broken government promises. We also highlight the resiliency that many community members demonstrated in preventing new infections and supporting those infected. We conclude that COVID-19 in Hawaii should be understood as a syndemic, where Micronesians were disproportionately affected due to disparities in housing, employment, and health access. Our work supports efforts to continue addressing underlying socioeconomic disparities in creating a more equitable future for our Micronesian community in Hawaii.","Hosaka, Kalei R J; Castanera, Max P; Yamada, Seiji",Asia Pac J Public Health,,49

A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).","Kimball, Anne; Hatfield, Kelly M; Arons, Melissa; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Spicer, Kevin; Bardossy, Ana C; Oakley, Lisa P; Tanwar, Sukarma; Chisty, Zeshan; Bell, Jeneita M; Methner, Mark; Harney, Josh; Jacobs, Jesica R; Carlson, Christina M; McLaughlin, Heather P; Stone, Nimalie; Clark, Shauna; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Page, Libby C; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Russell, Denny; Hiatt, Brian; Gant, Jessica; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Clark, Thomas A; Honein, Margaret A; Reddy, Sujan C; Jernigan, John A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,49

Substantial research has mainly examined problems related to potential negative effects of video games ranging from sedentary screen time, exposure to violence, and excessive or problematic gaming. However, over the past two decades, the use of video games in psychotherapy has become increasingly popular with a lot of applications. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After a review of the use and the effectiveness of commercial video games in the psychotherapy framework, we will share our experience in the use of video games in a child and adolescent psychiatric unit. We will illustrate it with the presentation of specific case reports. RESULT: As video games are highly popular among children and adolescents, they are also interesting tools in the psychotherapeutic work with them. It's a new kind of play therapy, considering the setting, the psychological material that expresses during the game, the interpersonal relationships between gamers, the projective representation within the avatars, the cognitive strategies within the game. CONCLUSIONS: Video games represent an essential tool in taking care of child psychiatric patients because of their popularity. They contribute greatly to build the patient/psychotherapist relationship. They help to approach cognitive, emotional and social patient's functioning, and also psychopathologic understanding and then psychiatric diagnosis.","Al Husni Al Keilani, Mouna; Delvenne, Veronique",Psychiatr Danub,,49
293394,Finding a new balance,2020,"BACKGROUND: Existing estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 burden on mental wellbeing come from countries with high mortality rates. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, which had lower infection rates, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation. METHODS: Using a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n = 2836) and again in July 2020 (n = 1526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture risk for stress/depression (WHO-5 < 50) and functional impairment (WSAS > 10). Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well as to answers in re-interviews in July. RESULTS: In our fully controlled models, we find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home (-.089, p < .01 (from pre lockdown baseline .273)). Measures of functional impairment also declined immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home (-.066, p < .05 (from pre lockdown baseline .150)). Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July (+.199, p < .001 (from pre lockdown baseline .248)), but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July (-.033, p < .05 (from pre lockdown baseline .332). CONCLUSIONS: Findings in Denmark indicate that living with children at home may have, in the short term, buffered the potential mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 shutdown.","Andersen, Lars H; Fallesen, Peter; Bruckner, Tim A",BMC Public Health,,49

The situation quickly escalated and turned into a global pandemic. COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease that leads to decreased respiratory, physical, and psychological function of affected patients (2). Patients' symptoms widely vary; from asymptomatic course to severe symptoms. Decrease in physical function, and, in some cases, a persistence of symptoms may be observed in patients, who overcame the infection period. Rehabilitation represents a potential treatment option for COVID-19 patients in post-infection period.

295529,Personalised ecology and detection functions,2020,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the most common types of acute kidney injury. Spironolactone has shown promising kidney protective effects in renal IRI in rats. We investigated the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of spironolactone (100 mg/kg) administered immediately after 40 min unilateral kidney ischemia in rats. Hyperpolarized MRI using co-polarized [1-13 C]pyruvate and [13 C,15 N2 ]urea as well as 1 H dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI was performed 24 h after induction of ischemia. We found a significant decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) in the ischemic kidney compared with the contralateral one measured using DCE and [13 C,15 N2 ]urea. The RBF measured using [1-13 C]pyruvate and [13 C,15 N2 ]urea was significantly altered by spironolactone. The RBFs in the ischemic kidney compared with the contralateral kidney were decreased similarly as measured using both [13 C,15 N2 ]urea and [1-13 C]pyruvate in the spironolactone-treated group. Spironolactone treatment increased the perfusion-corrected pyruvate metabolism by 54% in both the ischemic and contralateral kidney. Furthermore, we showed a correlation between vascular permeability using a histological Evans blue analysis and the ratio of the volumes of distribution (VoDs), ie VoD-[13 C,15 N2 ]urea/VoD-[1-13 C]pyruvate. This suggests that [13 C,15 N2 ]urea/[1-13 C]pyruvate VoD ratio may be a novel indicator of renal vascular permeability associated with renal damage in rodents.","Lindhardt, Jakob Lykke; Nielsen, Per Mose; Hansen, Esben Søvsø Szocska; Qi, Haiyun; Tougaard, Rasmus Stilling; Mariager, Christian Østergaard; Bertelsen, Lotte Bonde; Kim, Won Yong; Laustsen, Christoffer",NMR Biomed,,49

COVID-19 also affords opportunities to study the emergence of prejudice as a factor in taking protective actions. This study investigated the association of COVID-19 concerns, prejudicial beliefs, and personal actions that involve life disruptions among people not living with and people living with HIV. 338 Black/African American men not living with HIV who reported male sex partners and 148 Black/African American men living with HIV who reported male sex partners completed a confidential survey that measured COVID-19 concern, COVID-19 prejudice, and personal action and institutionally imposed COVID-19 disruptions. Participants reported having experienced multiple social and healthcare disruptions stemming from COVID-19, including reductions in social contacts, canceling medical appointments, and inability to access medications. Mediation analyses demonstrated that COVID-19 concerns and COVID-19 prejudice were associated with personal action disruptions, indicating that these social processes are important for understanding how individuals modified their lives in response to COVID-19. It is imperative that public health efforts combat COVID-19 prejudice as these beliefs undermine investments in developing healthcare infrastructure to address COVID-19 prevention.","Kalichman, Seth C; El-Krab, Renee; Shkembi, Bruno; Kalichman, Moira O; Eaton, Lisa A",Transl Behav Med,,49

The rapid progress in the field of oncological treatments has led to a steady increase in long-term cancer survivors. Care for cardiovascular complications is therefore becoming increasingly important. In addition, the establishment of new oncological therapies has resulted in the identification of previously unknown cardiovascular side effects. Oncocardiology aims to detect and treat cardiovascular diseases associated with cancer and cancer therapy. Continuous scientific, clinical, and structural developments are necessary as the basis for the best care of the growing number of affected patients. This review summarizes current developments in the field of oncocardiology with regard to advances in cancer therapy and challenges in clinical oncocardiology work. Cardiovascular side effects by targeted cancer therapies are characterized and recent advances in the field of cardiovascular diagnostics are outlined. Developments to better integrate oncocardiology into the medical care system and perspectives for modern, patient-oriented care are shown. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, current challenges and opportunities are highlighted. The relevance of profitable further advances in oncocardiology including standardized guidelines and educational programs is delineated as a mandatory requirement for the successful development of oncocardiology.","Michel, Lars; Schadendorf, Dirk; Rassaf, Tienush",Herz,,49

METHODS: Research questions were formulated focusing on diagnosis and treatment of adult patients with RMD within the context of the pandemic, including the management of RMD in patients who developed COVID-19. MEDLINE was searched for eligible studies to address the questions, and the APLAR COVID-19 task force convened 2 meetings through video conferencing to discuss its findings and integrate best available evidence with expert opinion. Consensus statements were finalized using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: Agreement was obtained around key aspects of screening for or diagnosis of COVID-19; management of patients with RMD without confirmed COVID-19; and management of patients with RMD with confirmed COVID-19. The task force achieved consensus on 25 statements covering the potential risk of acquiring COVID-19 in RMD patients, advice on RMD medication adjustment and continuation, the roles of telemedicine and vaccination, and the impact of the pandemic on quality of life and on treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence primarily from descriptive research supported new recommendations for aspects of RMD care not covered in the previous document, particularly with regard to risk factors for complicated COVID-19 in RMD patients, modifications to RMD treatment regimens in the context of the pandemic, and COVID-19 vaccination in patients with RMD.","Tam, Lai-Shan; Tanaka, Yoshiya; Handa, Rohini; Li, Zhanguo; Lorenzo, Jose Paulo; Louthrenoo, Worawit; Hill, Catherine; Pile, Kevin; Robinson, Philip C; Dans, Leonila F; Hsu, Li Yang; Lee, Sang-Min; Cho, Jiacai; Hasan, A T M Tanveer; Salim, Babur; Samreen, Saba; Shaharir, Syahrul Sazliyana; Wong, Priscilla; Chau, Jeffrey; Danda, Debashish; Haq, Syed Atiqul",Int. j. rheum. dis,,49

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19. Subversion of host protein synthesis is a common strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to shut down host protein synthesis and that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein NSP14 exerts this activity. We show that the translation inhibition activity of NSP14 is conserved in human coronaviruses. NSP14 is required for virus replication through contribution of its exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. Mutations in the ExoN or N7-MTase active sites of SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 abolish its translation inhibition activity. In addition, we show that the formation of NSP14-NSP10 complex enhances translation inhibition executed by NSP14. Consequently, the translational shutdown by NSP14 abolishes the type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Together, we find that SARS-CoV-2 shuts down host innate immune responses via a translation inhibitor, providing insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Hsu, Jack Chun-Chieh; Laurent-Rolle, Maudry; Pawlak, Joanna B; Wilen, Craig B; Cresswell, Peter",Proc.

306126,RSV genomic diversity and the development of a globally effective RSV intervention,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Prolonged and unaddressed hypoxia can lead to poor patient outcomes. Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non-intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City. We included patients suspected of having COVID-19 with hypoxia on arrival. A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO2 . SpO2 measurements were recorded at triage and after 5 minutes of proning. Supplemental oxygenation methods included non-rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula. We also characterized post-proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. Overall, the median SpO2 at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85). After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90). After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO2 improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95). Comparison of the pre- to post-median by the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test yielded P = 0.001. Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED. CONCLUSION: Awake early self-proning in the emergency department demonstrated improved oxygen saturation in our COVID-19 positive patients. Further studies are needed to support causality and determine the effect of proning on disease severity and mortality.","Caputo, Nicholas D; Strayer, Reuben J; Levitan, Richard",Acad Emerg Med,,49
306462,Global virus tracker,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CD4 T cell loss is the hallmark of uncontrolled HIV-1 infection. Strikingly, CD4 T cell depletion is a strong indicator for disease severity in the recently emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We reviewed recent single-cell immune profiling studies in HIV-1 infection and COVID-19 to provide critical insight in virus-induced immunopathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Cytokine dysregulation in HIV-1 leads to chronic inflammation, while severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cytokine release syndrome and increased mortality. HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells are dysfunctional, while SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells exhibit robust Th1 function and correlate with protective antibody responses. In HIV-1 infection, follicular helper T cells (TFH) are susceptible to HIV-1 infection and persist in immune-sanctuary sites in lymphoid tissues as an HIV-1 reservoir. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, TFH are absent in lymphoid tissues and are associated with diminished protective immunity. Advancement in HIV-1 DNA, RNA, and protein-based single-cell capture methods can overcome the rarity and heterogeneity of HIV-1-infected cells and identify mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence and clonal expansion dynamics. SUMMARY: Single-cell immune profiling identifies a high-resolution picture of immune dysregulation in HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection and informs outcome prediction and therapeutic interventions.","Collora, Jack A; Liu, Runxia; Albrecht, Kristen; Ho, Ya-Chi",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,,49

Quickly published and shared on social media and social networking sites. There is limited evidence, however, as to whether and how social media has been used and impact on social media consumers. Aim: This study aims to assess the usage of social media and its impact on social media consumers during pandemic disease covid-19 in India. Methods: An online questionnaire was prepared and conducted to study in India with a total of 210 social media consumers. This study used a Quantitative data analysis method. As a result, data were analysed using Microsoft Office Excel. Results: Participants showed that Social media play an important role to deal with the pandemic disease. Whatsapp and Instagram were the most used social media platform for getting and sharing information about covid-19. We found a weak statistical correlation between social media impact on frequently usage of social media during covid-19 (R=0.215825619). Social media had equally impacted on gender group during the Covid-19 situation in India. Conclusions: During Covid-19 Pandemic, people are using social media platforms to get and share information about Covid-19. Social media has no negative impact on social media consumers.

314025,Looking out for yourself and those around you,2020,"Whereas physiological vascular permeability (VP) mediates selective transport of plasma, electrolytes, proteins, and cells across an intact endothelial barrier, pathological VP results in the loss of endothelial barrier integrity. Whereas physiological VP is a feature of regular host defense and tissue repair, compromised barrier function may lead to aberrant vascular leakage, concurrent tissue edema, and inflammation eventually causing life-threatening conditions such as acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, cancer, kidney injury, etc. Measurement of VP helps to identify, design, and optimize anti-leak therapies. Further, it can define the effect of a stimulus or a gene modulation in endothelial-barrier regulation. The degree of VP can be of importance to determine the stage of cancer and disease prognosis. This chapter discusses Miles assay, which is a well-established, relatively simple, and a reliable in vivo technique to assess VP as a surrogate measurement. Although a reliable technique, Miles assay is time-consuming, and the technique does not consider the compounding factors that may increase VP independently of endothelial-barrier regulation, such as blood pressure or blood flow. As an alternative, we describe fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran lung permeability assay, a method that can also be adapted to measure VP and edema in other organs such as the brain and kidney.","Adil, Mir S; Somanath, Payaningal R",Methods mol. biol,,49

DATA: The PICO strategy was used to include randomized clinical trials in human subjects with DH (P) after NSPT treated with DA (I) compared to those treated with placebo or control (C) to identify DH relief (O). The Cochrane guidelines and GRADE was used to classify the risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, respectively. SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, Cochrane Library databases, and OpenGrey were searched on the 20th of May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Nine studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Five meta-analyses were performed. Three meta-analyzes assessed the effectiveness of DA compared to a placebo or control in relation to pain assessment stimuli and two meta-analyzes assessed the mechanism of action of DA. For the mechanical stimulus in overall analysis, the control group presented a higher mean of pain reduction (SMD 1.03 [0.73, 1.32], p < 0.001) with very low certainty of evidence. For water (SMD -0.78 [-1.22, -0.35], p = 0.0009) and evaporative in overall analysis (SMD -1.21 [-1.79, -0.64], p < 0.001) stimuli, the DA decreased DH pain with very low and low certainty of evidence, respectively. CONCLUSION: Due to the limited quality of evidence, there is no definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of DA on DH after NSPT. Thus, further clinical studies with a low risk of bias and high-quality evidence are encouraged to reinforce the certainty of evidence on that issue. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of desensitizing agents can be promising to relieve dentin hypersensitivity after non-surgical periodontal therapy. Therefore, it could be applied routinely after this periodontal treatment.","de Oliveira, Roberta Pimentel; Alencar, Cristiane de Melo; Silva, Fábio Alves; Magno, Marcela Baraúna; Maia, Lucianne Cople; Silva, Cecy Martins",J Dent,,49

Here I discuss it in the context of engineering systems and biology, where strong emergence takes place due to a combination of upwards emergence and downwards causation [Ellis 2020]. Firstly, I show that causal closure is strictly limited in terms of spatial interactions because these are cases that are of necessity strongly interacting with the environment. Effective Spatial Closure holds ceteris parabus, and can be violated by Black Swan Events. Secondly, I show that causal closure in the hierarchy of emergence is a strictly interlevel affair, and in the cases of engineering and biology encompasses all levels from the social level to the particle physics level. However Effective Causal Closure can usefully be defined for a restricted set of levels, and one can experimentally determine Effective Theories that hold at each level. This does not however imply those effective theories are causally complete by themselves. In particular, the particle physics level is not causally complete by itself in the contexts of solid state physics (because of interlevel wave-particle duality), digital computers (where algorithms determine outcomes), or biology (because of time dependent constraints). Furthermore Inextricably Intertwined Levels occur in all these contexts.","Ellis, George F R",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00972v4.pdf,49

METHODS: A prospective online survey was sent out to 4234 surgeons of the AGA - Society of Arthroscopy and Joint-Surgery (Gesellschaft für Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey was created using SurveyMonkey software and consisted of 23 questions relating to the reduction of orthopaedic services at the participating centres and the impact that the pandemic is having on each surgeon. RESULTS: A total of 890 orthopaedic surgeons responded to the online survey. Approximately 90% of them experienced a reduction in their surgical caseload and patient contact. 38.7% stated that their institutions returned to providing diagnostic arthroscopies. 54.5% reported that they went back to performing anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR), 62.6% were performing arthroscopic meniscus procedures, and 55.8% had resumed performing shoulder arthroscopy. Only 31.9% of the surgeons were able to perform elective total joint arthroplasty. 60% of the participants stated that they had suffered substantial financial loss due to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A gradual resumption of orthopaedic health-care services was observed in May 2020. Typical orthopaedic surgical procedures like ACLR, shoulder arthroscopy and elective total joint arthroplasty were reported to be currently performed by 54%, 56% and 32% of surgeons, respectively. Despite signs of improvement, it appears that there is a prolonged curtailment of orthopaedic health-care at present in the middle of Europe.","Liebensteiner, M C; Khosravi, I; Hirschmann, M T; Heuberer, P R; Saffarini, M; Thaler, M",J Exp Orthop,,49

321502,An antiviral trap made of protein nanofibrils and iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed multiple public health, socio-economic, and institutional crises. Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the ""COVID-19 Disorder Tracker"" initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that livelihoods and virus containment policies are not perceived as mutually exclusive.","Campedelli, Gian Maria; D039,; Orsogna, Maria R",PLoS One,,49
322876,Generation of recombinant hyperimmune globulins from diverse B-cell repertoires,2021,"As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.","Porcheddu, Rossella; Serra, Caterina; Kelvin, David; Kelvin, Nikki; Rubino, Salvatore",J Infect Dev Ctries,,49
324441,Pfizer COVID vaccine protects against worrying coronavirus variants,2021,"Recently, social media platforms have introduced several measures to counter misleading information. Among these measures are state media labels which help users identify and evaluate the credibility of state-backed news. YouTube was the first platform to introduce labels that provide information about state-backed news channels. While previous work has examined the efficiency of information labels in controlled lab settings, few studies have examined how state media labels affect user perceptions of content from state-backed outlets. This paper proposes new methodological and theoretical approaches to investigate the effect of state media labels on user engagement with content. Drawing on a content analysis of 8,071 YouTube comments posted before and after the labelling of five state-funded channels (Al Jazeera English, CGTN, RT, TRT World, and Voice of America), this paper analyses the effect state media labels had on user engagement with state-backed media content. We found the labels had no impact on the amount of likes videos received before and after the policy introduction, except for RT which received less likes after it was labelled. However, for RT, comments left by users were associated with 30 percent decrease in the likelihood of observing a critical comment following the policy implementation, and a 70 percent decrease in likelihood of observing a critical comment about RT as a media source. While other state-funded broadcasters, like Al Jazeera English and VOA News, received fewer critical comments after YouTube introduced its policy; this relationship was associated with how political the video was, rather than the policy change. Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the efficacy of platform governance in relation to state-backed media, showing that audience preferences impact the effectiveness of labels.","Bradshaw, Samantha; Elswah, Mona; Perini, Antonella",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06978v1.pdf,49

326232,Symposium 8,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus-2 that interfaces with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This interaction has been proposed as a potential risk factor in patients treated with RAAS inhibitors. OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed whether RAAS inhibitors modify the risk for COVID-19. METHODS: The RASTAVI (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial is an ongoing randomized clinical trial randomly allocating subjects to ramipril or control groups after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 14 centers in Spain. A non-pre-specified interim analysis was performed to evaluate ramipril's impact on COVID-19 risk in this vulnerable population. RESULTS: As of April 1, 2020, 102 patients (50 in the ramipril group and 52 in the control group) were included in the trial. Mean age was 82.3 ± 6.1 years, 56.9% of the participants were male. Median time of ramipril treatment was 6 months (interquartile range: 2.9 to 11.4 months). Eleven patients (10.8%) have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (6 in control group and 5 receiving ramipril; hazard ratio: 1.150; 95% confidence interval: 0.351 to 3.768). The risk of COVID-19 was increased in older patients (p = 0.019) and those with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.066), lower hematocrit (p = 0.084), and more comorbidities according to Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (p = 0.065). Admission and oxygen supply was required in 4.9% of patients (2 in the ramipril group and 3 in the control group), and 4 of them died (2 in each randomized group). A higher body mass index was the only factor increasing the mortality rate (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk population of older patients with cardiovascular disease, randomization to ramipril had no impact on the incidence or severity of COVID-19. This analysis supports the maintenance of RAAS inhibitor treatment during the COVID-19 crisis.

326410,Massive data initiatives and AI provide testbed for pandemic forecasting,2020,"The study aimed to explore the effect of perceived stress of healthcare workers on anxiety and sleep level in intensive care units during corona virus pandemic. The research was conducted in descriptive and cross-sectional types. The study was conducted between April 2020 and July 2020 at Atatürk University Research Hospital and Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital. In the research, it was aimed to reach all the healthcare professionals (260) working in intensive care units without selecting a sample. The data was collected by using the personal information form prepared by the researchers in line with the literature, Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Visual Analog Sleep Scale. Of the 210 participants, 75.4% were female, and 88.1% were nurses. The mean age of the participants was 27.04 ± 5.71 years, and 51.9% of the participants were 20-25 years old. The mean perceived stress, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and visual analog sleep scores were moderate and found as 29.9 ± 6.83, 43.09 ± 5.55, 46.15 ± 5.3, and 503.79 ± 134.24, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether telephone-based reality orientation therapy (T-ROT) can improve cognition, mood, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) who are forced to isolate and also whether T-ROT can relieve the burden of distress among their caregivers. DESIGN: Nonrandomized interventional comparison study. SETTING: Individual telephone calls between practitioners and patients and their caregivers. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven patients (14 in the experimental group, 13 in the control group) with a major NCD and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION: Ten T-ROT sessions and a pretest-posttest neuropsychological evaluation over 4 wk. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes measured included cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs and correlations between changes in patient clinical condition and caregiver stress. Primary outcome measures were two measures of depressive symptoms, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and the Telephone Mini-Mental State Examination, administered at baseline and program discharge. RESULTS: T-ROT significantly outperformed nontreatment on all measures of depression, behavior, cognition, and caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: T-ROT combined with emotional support appears to be an effective intervention for monitoring and managing the behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs who are forced to isolate. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: Occupational therapy practitioners can use T-ROT or similar procedures not only during a pandemic but also when it is not possible to treat patients in person at a hospital or at home. Telephone-based treatment may also represent a good practice to be integrated into traditional rehabilitation programs.","Panerai, Simonetta; Raggi, Alberto; Tasca, Domenica; Musso, Sabrina; Gelardi, Donatella; Prestianni, Giuseppina; Catania, Valentina; Muratore, Stefano; Ferri, Raffaele",Am J Occup Ther,,49

327689,Diabetic neuropathy: are we still barking up the wrong tree and is change finally in sight?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Telehealth, the delivery of health care through telecommunication technology, has the potential to address multiple health system concerns. Despite this potential, only 15% of pediatric primary care clinicians reported using telemedicine as of 2016, with the majority identifying inadequate payment for these services as the largest barrier. The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in payment and regulations surrounding telehealth, allowing for integration into primary care pediatrics. OBJECTIVE: Due to limited use of telemedicine in primary care pediatrics prior to COVID-19, much is unknown about the role of telemedicine in pediatric primary care. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the association between practice-level telemedicine use within a large pediatric primary care network and practice characteristics, telemedicine visit diagnoses, in-person visit volume, child-level variation in telemedicine use and clinician attitudes towards telemedicine. METHODS: We analyzed electronic health record data from 45 primary care practices and administered a clinician survey to practice clinicians. Practices were stratified into tertiles based on rates of telemedicine use (low, intermediate, high) per 1000 patients per week during a two-week period (4/19-5/2/2020). By practice tertile, we compared (1) practice characteristics, (2) telemedicine visit diagnoses, (3) in-person visit rates to office, urgent care and emergency department, (4) child-level variation in telemedicine use and (5) clinician attitudes towards telemedicine across these practices. RESULTS: Across pediatric primary care practices, telemedicine visit rates ranged from 5 to 23 telemedicine visits per 1000 patients per week. Across all tertiles, the most frequent telemedicine visit diagnoses were mental health (28-36% of visits) and dermatologic (15-28%). Compared to low telemedicine use practices, high telemedicine use practices had fewer in-person office visits (10 vs. 16 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.005), but overall more total encounters (in-office and telemedicine: 28 vs. 22 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.006). Telemedicine use varied with child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care, but no significant interactions existed between these characteristics and practice-level telemedicine use. Finally, clinician attitudes regarding the usability and impact of telemedicine did not vary significantly across tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: Across a network of pediatric practices, we identified significant practice-level variation in telemedicine use, with increased use associated with more varied telemedicine diagnoses, fewer in-person office visits, and increased overall primary care encounter volume. Thus in the context of the pandemic when underutilization of primary care was prevalent, higher practice-level telemedicine use supported pediatric primary care encounter volume closer to usual rates. Child-level telemedicine use differed by child age, race/ethnicity, and recent preventive care, building upon prior concerns about differences in access to telemedicine. However, increased practice-level use of telemedicine services was not associated with reduced nor worsened differences in utilization, suggesting further work is needed to promote equitable access to primary care telemedicine.","Schweiberger, Kelsey; Hoberman, Alejandro; Iagnemma, Jennifer; Schoemer, Pamela; Squire, Joseph; Taormina, Jill; Wolfson, David; Ray, Kristin N",J. med. internet res,,49

333017,Calf scour: focus on cryptosporidiosis,2020,"Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) become critically ill primarily around the time of activation of the adaptive immune response. Here, we provide evidence that antibodies play a role in the worsening of disease at the time of seroconversion. We show that early phase severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein-specific IgG in serum of critically ill COVID-19 patients induces excessive inflammatory responses by human alveolar macrophages. We identified that this excessive inflammatory response is dependent on two antibody features that are specific for patients with severe COVID-19. First, inflammation is driven by high titers of anti-spike IgG, a hallmark of severe disease. Second, we found that anti-spike IgG from patients with severe COVID-19 is intrinsically more pro-inflammatory because of different glycosylation, particularly low fucosylation, of the antibody Fc tail. Notably, low fucosylation of anti-spike IgG was normalized in a few weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the increased antibody-dependent inflammation mainly occurs at the time of seroconversion. We identified FcÎ³ Receptor (FcÎ³R) IIa and FcÎ³RIII as the two primary IgG receptors that are responsible for the induction of key COVID-19-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. In addition, we show that anti-spike IgG-activated human macrophages can subsequently break pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induce microvascular thrombosis in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by anti-spike IgG can be specifically counteracted by fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk kinase.","Anonymous,",Sci. transl. med,,49

The efficacy of CP and in which situations it was effective were investigated. CONCLUSION: 80 % of the patients recovered, and 20 % died in our study. The mean age of the patients who died was found to be higher than the patients who recovered. CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil, MPV, and NLR counts were found to be higher, and lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower in the deceased group after CP. It was determined that patients who received CP within the first five days were hospitalized for a shorter period. DISCUSSION: Administration of CP transfusion within the first five days in severe COVID-19 patients has been shown to reduce hospital stay length.","Akay Cizmecioglu, Hilal; Goktepe, Mevlut Hakan; Demircioglu, Sinan; Tekinalp, Atakan; Cizmecioglu, Ahmet; Tuna, Ali Kursat; Ozer, Huseyin",Transfus Apher Sci,,49

Chloroquine is known to prolong the QRS and QTc interval on the ECG. To assess the effect of chloroquine on QRS and QTc intervals in COVID-19 patients, we included all inpatients treated with chloroquine for COVID-19 in the Spaarne Gasthuis (Haarlem/Hoofddorp, the Netherlands) and had an ECG performed both in the 72 h before and during or at least 48 h after treatment. We analyzed the (change in) QRS and QTc interval using the one-sample t-test. Of the 106 patients treated with chloroquine, 70 met the inclusion criteria. The average change in QRS interval was 6.0 ms (95% CI 3.3-8.7) and the average change in QTc interval was 32.6 ms (95% CI 24.9-40.2) corrected with the Bazett's formula and 38.1 ms (95% CI 30.4-45.9) corrected with the Fridericia's formula. In 19 of the 70 patients (27%), the QTc interval was above 500 ms after start of chloroquine treatment or the change in QTc interval was more than 60 ms. A heart rate above 90 bpm, renal dysfunction, and a QTc interval below 450 ms were risk factors for QTc interval prolongation. Chloroquine prolongs the QTc interval in a substantial number of patients, potentially causing rhythm disturbances. Since there is no substantial evidence for a beneficial effect of chloroquine, these results discourage its use in COVID-19 patients.","Becker, Matthijs L; Snijders, Dominic; van Gemeren, Claudia W; Kingma, Hylke Jan; van Lelyveld, Steven F L; Giezen, Thijs J",Cardiovasc. toxicol.

Of the participants, 2545 (51%) reported having clinical responsibilities, 2412 (48%) had at least 1 child aged 18 years or younger, 3316 (66%) were staff, 791 (16%) were faculty, and 640 (13%) were trainees. Nearly one-half of parents reported that parenting (1148 participants [49%]) and managing virtual education for children (1171 participants [50%]) were stressors. Across all participants, 1061 (21%) considered leaving the workforce, and 1505 (30%) considered reducing hours. Four hundred forty-nine faculty (55%) and 397 trainees (60%) perceived decreased productivity, and 2334 participants (47%) were worried about COVID-19 impacting their career development, with 421 trainees (64%) being highly concerned. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of 5030 faculty, staff, and trainees of a US health system, many participants with caregiving responsibilities, particularly women, faculty, trainees, and (in a subset of cases) those from racial/ethnic groups that underrepresented in medicine, considered leaving the workforce or reducing hours and were worried about their career development related to the pandemic. It is imperative that medical centers support their employees and trainees during this challenging time.","Delaney, Rebecca K; Locke, Amy; Pershing, Mandy L; Geist, Claudia; Clouse, Erin; Precourt Debbink, Michelle; Haaland, Benjamin; Tanner, Amy J; Anzai, Yoshimi; Fagerlin, Angela",JAMA Netw Open,,49
348611,Electrical Switching of the Nonreciprocal Directional Microwave Response in a Triplon Bose-Einstein Condensate,2020,"We present a winning method of the IEEE DataPort Competition on Day-Ahead Electricity Demand Forecasting: Post-COVID Paradigm. The day-ahead load forecasting approach is based on online forecast combination of multiple point prediction models. It contains four steps: i) data cleaning and preprocessing, ii) a holiday adjustment procedure, iii) training of individual forecasting models, iv) forecast combination by smoothed Bernstein Online Aggregation (BOA). The approach is flexible and can quickly adopt to new energy system situations as they occurred during and after COVID-19 shutdowns. The pool of individual prediction models ranges from rather simple time series models to sophisticated models like generalized additive models (GAMs) and high-dimensional linear models estimated by lasso. They incorporate autoregressive, calendar and weather effects efficiently. All steps contain novel concepts that contribute to the excellent forecasting performance of the proposed method. This holds particularly for the holiday adjustment procedure and the fully adaptive smoothed BOA approach.","Ziel, Florian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06268v1.pdf,49

350512,Genome analyses help track coronavirus' moves,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic. This study addresses the clinical and immunopathological characteristics of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe and nonsevere groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics. A panel of blood cytokines was quantified over time. Biopsy specimens from 2 deceased cases were obtained for immunopathological, ultrastructural, and in situ hybridization examinations. RESULTS: Circulating cytokines, including IL-8, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IP10, MCP1, and RANTES, were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. Dynamic IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated to infect type II and type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis. In severe cases, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were observed in both blood and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions. Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both cytopathy caused by SARS-CoV-2 and immunopathologic damage. Strategies that prohibit pulmonary recruitment and overactivation of inflammatory cells by suppressing cytokine storm might improve the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19.","Li, Shaohua; Jiang, Lina; Li, Xi; Lin, Fang; Wang, Yijin; Li, Boan; Jiang, Tianjun; An, Weimin; Liu, Shuhong; Liu, Hongyang; Xu, Pengfei; Zhao, Lihua; Zhang, Lixin; Mu, Jinsong; Wang, Hongwei; Kang, Jiarui; Li, Yan; Huang, Lei; Zhu, Caizhong; Zhao, Shousong; Lu, Jiangyang; Ji, Junsheng; Zhao, Jingmin",JCI insight,,49

Chaperones play an important role in these alterations, but how these changes are executed remains largely unknown. Our study unveils a specific N-glycosylation pattern used by a chaperone, Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), to alter its conformational fitness and stabilize a state most permissive for stable interactions with proteins at the plasma membrane. This ""protein assembly mutation' remodels protein networks and properties of the cell. We show in cells, human specimens, and mouse xenografts that proteome connectivity is restorable by inhibition of the N-glycosylated GRP94 variant.

355729,Mice with severe COVID symptoms could speed vaccine effort,2021,"The human pandemic COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in China in 2019 and has rapidly spread around the world, leading to extreme control measures such as population confinement and industry activity closure. Although small ruminants are not sanitary affected by this virus, the short-term economic impact derived by COVID-19 on Spanish flocks is estimated in this study, using data provided by producers and two major slaughterhouses. Milk prices of dairy goat flocks suffered a substantial drop in April 2020, close to 4.5 cts EUR/liter compared to the previous month. In contrast, the monthly milk prices in sheep remained almost stable during this period, and even increases of more than EUR 6 cts were reported in comparison with the previous year. Nevertheless, economical differences are reported by areas where producers could receive a higher income, close to EUR 0.3 per liter of milk. Global data provided by feedlots affecting 2750 Spanish flocks evidenced a lamb price drop ranging from 16.8% to 26.9% after the pandemic arrival; in line with the data directly reported by a limited sample of producers (ranging from 11.0% to 23.7%). The goat kid meat market also suffered a reduction in prices per kg, near 12.5%; although, for some flocks, losses reached up to 40%. In the same line, 2 slaughterhouses reported a sudden sacrifice drop around 27% for lambs and goat kids sacrifices in April, in contrast with the usual sacrifice figures from the beginning of 2020. Moreover, our study showed a temporary and unexpected retention of lambs and goat kids at farms due to a reduction in animals slaughtered during this period. In conclusion, data evidenced a considerable negative economic impact on Spanish small ruminant flocks, throughout the first 60 days after COVID-19's pandemic declaration. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term economic consequences, in order to establish contingency plans and avoid the collapse of small ruminant industries when a crisis of these characteristics occurs.","Vidaurreta, Irene; de la Fe, Christian; Orengo, Juan; Gómez-Martín, Ángel; Benito, Bernardino",,,49

Thus, this study was designed to investigate meal kits' essential attributes representing food quality, menu variety, health-oriented, convenience and price in association with their effects upon users' perceived value, and intention to continuously use. Two attributes representing high quality food dishes and menu variety were found to be the most important meal kit attributes because they both strongly improved hedonic and functional value for consumers. Results identified meal kit food quality as having more positive effects upon perceived value for the multi-person household segment when compared with the single-person household group. Comparatively, the effects of menu variety upon perceived value were more positive in the single-person household group than in the multi-person household group.

358163,University of Cape Town's battle to tackle a racist legacy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Children are at risk for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Cardiovascular complications, including ventricular dysfunction and coronary dilation, are frequent, but there are limited data on arrhythmic complications. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of children and young adults aged &#8804;21 years admitted with MIS-C. Demographic characteristics, electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram findings, and hospital course were described. RESULTS: Among 25 patients admitted with MIS-C (60% male; median age 9.7 [interquartile range 2.7-15.0] years), ECG anomalies were found in 14 (56%). First-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) was seen in 5 (20%) patients a median of 6 (interquartile range 5-8) days after onset of fever and progressed to second- or third-degree AVB in 4 patients. No patient required intervention for AVB. All patients with AVB were admitted to the ICU (before onset of AVB) and had ventricular dysfunction on echocardiograms. All patients with second- or third-degree AVB had elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels, whereas the patient with first-degree AVB had a normal brain natriuretic peptide level. No patient with AVB had an elevated troponin level. QTc prolongation was seen in 7 patients (28%), and nonspecific ST segment changes were seen in 14 patients (56%). Ectopic atrial tachycardia was observed in 1 patient, and none developed ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Children with MIS-C are at risk for atrioventricular conduction disease, especially those who require ICU admission and have ventricular dysfunction. ECGs should be monitored for evidence of PR prolongation. Continuous telemetry may be required in patients with evidence of first-degree AVB because of risk of progression to high-grade AVB.","Dionne, Audrey; Mah, Douglas Y; Son, Mary Beth F; Lee, Pui Y; Henderson, Lauren; Baker, Annette L; de Ferranti, Sarah D; Fulton, David R; Newburger, Jane W; Friedman, Kevin G",Pediatrics,,49

359925,NIH move to ax bat coronavirus grant draws fire,2020,"Under the current COVID‐19 global pandemic, most of the world is operating online, which has increased the importance of better understanding the perceived color quality of video conference calls. We performed two experiments to evaluate the white balance appearance preference for images simulating a scene from a video conference call where a person is using a virtual background. Due to the dissimilarities of the light sources used for the subject and the background scene, the overall picture may look aesthetically unappealing. The first experiment was designed to assess the preference of white balance for images containing a foreground subject, with three different skin tones: light, medium, and dark, and a background scene, with five different color temperature appearances, cool to warm. The background scenes include famous attractions in the United States, water bodies, foliage, and a few less common scenes like a sculpture at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and a ColorChecker. Observers were presented with a pair of images of the same subject with same background scene, but with different white balance appearance. These comparisons were performed for each foreground subject with all background scenes. Both experiments were performed by naïve observers, who were from around the globe with no knowledge of color science and observers from the Munsell Color Science Lab (MCSL) at the RIT. The results show that observers' preference increases as we go from cooler to warmer appearance for the Canyon, RIT, Snow, Flower, and Autumn backgrounds, and vice versa for the Lake background. The Golden Gate background results are the most scattered among all scenes with very small differences in their scale values. MCSL observers show a strong agreement in preference to warmer appearance for light and dark skin tones for the RIT scene, and neutral and warmer appearance for medium skin tone for the RIT and Golden Gate scenes, respectively. To understand the relation between the background scene and foreground subject's white balance appearance, a second experiment was performed. The subjects had three different appearances: cool, neutral, and warm. Based on the results of the first experiment, five scenes with two white balance appearances, the most preferred rendition and the neutral rendition (original appearance at the time of the scene was captured), were used for the second paired comparison study. The results indicated that preference varied based on the foreground subject skin tone and background scene. However, the background preferences follow similar trends to the first experiment. There were variations in the degree of agreement, some showed very strong agreement, like dark skin tone with the RIT background, whereas for others, like autumn background with light skin tone, preferences were more scattered. Overall, the differences in the scale values were smaller as compared to the first experiment, which indicates that, as we present the observers with more options, the decision became harder.

360491,Making waves: Wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 - approaches and challenges for surveillance and prediction,2020,"Most African countries have recorded relatively lower COVID-19 burdens than Western countries. This has been attributed to early and strong political commitment and robust implementation of public health measures, such as nationwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, face mask wearing, testing, contact tracing, and isolation, along with community education and engagement. Other factors include the younger population age strata and hypothesized but yet-to-be confirmed partially protective cross-immunity from parasitic diseases and/or other circulating coronaviruses. However, the true burden may also be underestimated due to operational and resource issues for COVID-19 case identification and reporting. In this perspective article, we discuss selected best practices and challenges with COVID-19 contact tracing in Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. Best practices from these country case studies include sustained, multi-platform public communications; leveraging of technology innovations; applied public health expertise; deployment of community health workers; and robust community engagement. Challenges include an overwhelming workload of contact tracing and case detection for healthcare workers, misinformation and stigma, and poorly sustained adherence to isolation and quarantine. Important lessons learned include the need for decentralization of contact tracing to the lowest geographic levels of surveillance, rigorous use of data and technology to improve decision-making, and sustainment of both community sensitization and political commitment. Further research is needed to understand the role and importance of contact tracing in controlling community transmission dynamics in African countries, including among children. Also, implementation science will be critically needed to evaluate innovative, accessible, and cost-effective digital solutions to accommodate the contact tracing workload.","Nachega, Jean B; Atteh, Rhoda; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Adejumo, Prisca; Nsanzimana, Sabin; Rwagasore, Edson; Condo, Jeanine; Paleker, Masudah; Mahomed, Hassan; Suleman, Fatima; Ario, Alex Riolexus; Kiguli-Malwadde, Elsie; Omaswa, Francis G; Sewankambo, Nelson K; Viboud, Cecile; Reid, Michael J A; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kilmarx, Peter H",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,49

360949,Relief and worry for immune-suppressed people,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study compared the genome, mutations, and infectivity/transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with selected betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs). This study further examined the origin, risk factors, and outbreaks caused by beta-CoVs. We searched the following databases for relevant studies: PubMed, Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database. A close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS bat-like CoV RaTG13 (98.9%) was found at the amino acid level, followed by pangolin CoVs. Non-synonymous mutations occur at high frequencies in the open reading frame (ORF) 1ab, spike (S) protein, and nucleocapsid. Mutations P323L and D614G in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and S protein, respectively, occur at a high frequency globally. Mutations at position 3037 in the nonstructural protein (Nsp) 3, 14408 (RdRp), and 23403 (S) confer transmissibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has higher infectivity and transmissibility than SARS-CoV, which shares the same receptor. Although bats are confirmed reservoirs, intermediate hosts are currently unknown. Smoking, old age, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension have all been associated with COVID-19. Within six months of its outbreak, COVID-19 was reported in all countries worldwide, whereas SARS was reported in 28 countries and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 5 countries. However, the fatality rate of MERS (65%) was higher than that of COVID-19 (4.9%) and SARS (6.6%). Identifying the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts will help prevent future outbreaks. Attention should be given to the pangolin CoVs. Variations in the S gene may confer transmissibility and infectivity.

367081,Universal Error Bound for Constrained Quantum Dynamics,2020,"The description of a so-called cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 has prompted consideration of anti-cytokine therapies, particularly interleukin-6 antagonists. However, direct systematic comparisons of COVID-19 with other critical illnesses associated with elevated cytokine concentrations have not been reported. In this Rapid Review, we report the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 studies published or posted as preprints between Nov 1, 2019, and April 14, 2020, in which interleukin-6 concentrations in patients with severe or critical disease were recorded. 25 COVID-19 studies (n=1245 patients) were ultimately included. Comparator groups included four trials each in sepsis (n=5320), cytokine release syndrome (n=72), and acute respiratory distress syndrome unrelated to COVID-19 (n=2767). In patients with severe or critical COVID-19, the pooled mean serum interleukin-6 concentration was 36·7 pg/mL (95% CI 21·6-62·3 pg/mL; I2=57·7%). Mean interleukin-6 concentrations were nearly 100 times higher in patients with cytokine release syndrome (3110·5 pg/mL, 632·3-15â302·9 pg/mL; p<0·0001), 27 times higher in patients with sepsis (983·6 pg/mL, 550·1-1758·4 pg/mL; p<0·0001), and 12 times higher in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome unrelated to COVID-19 (460 pg/mL, 216·3-978·7 pg/mL; p<0·0001). Our findings question the role of a cytokine storm in COVID-19-induced organ dysfunction. Many questions remain about the immune features of COVID-19 and the potential role of anti-cytokine and immune-modulating treatments in patients with the disease.","Leisman, Daniel E; Ronner, Lukas; Pinotti, Rachel; Taylor, Matthew D; Sinha, Pratik; Calfee, Carolyn S; Hirayama, Alexandre V; Mastroiani, Fiore; Turtle, Cameron J; Harhay, Michael O; Legrand, Matthieu; Deutschman, Clifford S",Lancet Respir Med,,49

367676,Reply,2020,"The main purpose of our paper is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on randomness in volatility series of world major markets and to examine its effect on their interconnections. The data set includes equity (Bitcoin and Standard and Poor's 500), precious metals (Gold and Silver), and energy markets (West Texas Instruments, Brent, and Gas). The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model is applied to the return series. The wavelet packet Shannon entropy is calculated from the estimated volatility series to assess randomness. Hierarchical clustering is employed to examine interconnections between volatilities. We found that (i) randomness in volatility of the S&P500 and in the volatility of precious metals were the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, while (ii) randomness in energy markets was less affected by the pandemic than equity and precious metal markets. Additionally, (iii) we showed an apparent emergence of three volatility clusters: precious metals (Gold and Silver), energy (Brent and Gas), and Bitcoin and WTI, and (iv) the S&P500 volatility represents a unique cluster, while (v) the S&P500 market volatility was not connected to the volatility of Bitcoin, energy, and precious metal markets before the pandemic. Moreover, (vi) the S&P500 market volatility became connected to volatility in energy markets and volatility in Bitcoin during the pandemic, and (vii) the volatility in precious metals is less connected to volatility in energy markets and to volatility in Bitcoin market during the pandemic. It is concluded that (i) investors may diversify their portfolios across single constituents of clusters, (ii) investing in energy markets during the pandemic period is appealing because of lower randomness in their respective volatilities, and that (iii) constructing a diversified portfolio would not be challenging as clustering structures are fairly stable across periods.","Lahmiri, Salim; Bekiros, Stelios",Entropy,,49

METHODOLOGY: Three hundred and eight patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups according to whether occlusal reduction was done or not (n=154). For all patients, root canal treatment was carried out in two visits without intracanal medication. Patients assessed their pain using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) 6h, 12h 24h, 48h after the first visit (Postinstrumentation) and 6h and 12h following root canal filling (Postobturation). Patients, also, recorded their medication intake (Sham or analgesic) postinstrumentation and postobturation; patients initially received a sham capsule, but, if pain persisted, an analgesic was prescribed. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-test, Friedman's test, Wilcoxon's rank test and Chi2 (&#967;2 ) test. The Relative Risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for binary data. RESULTS: Occlusal reduction was associated with less pain intensity than no occlusal reduction at 12h and 24h postinstrumentation (p<0.05). Pain intensity significantly and gradually decreased with both groups at all postinstrumentation and postobturation timepoints compared to preoperative pain (p<0.05). The RR of moderate-to-severe pain was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.91) 12h postinstrumentation and the RR of pain incidence, regardless of its level, was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.92) 24h postinstrumentation. There was no significant difference in medication intake (sham or analgesic) between groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Occlusal reduction was effective in reducing the intensity of postoperative pain 12h and 24h after root canal instrumentation in the first visit in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with sensitivity to percussion. Occlusal reduction lowered the risk of moderate-to-severe pain by about 40% 12h postinstrumentation and the overall risk of pain by 25% 24h postinstrumentation; yet, it did not affect medication intake.","Ahmed, Y E; Emara, R S; Sarhan, S M; El Boghdadi, R M; El-Bayoumi, M A A; El-Far, H M M; Sabet, N E; Abou El-Nasr, H M; Gawdat, S I; Amin, S A W",Int. endod. j,,49

We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients, hospitalized with COVID-19. Serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL was considered VDD. Patients were classified as having mild and severe disease on basis of the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI). Of the 410 patients recruited, patients with VDD (197,48.2%) were significantly younger and had lesser comorbidities. The levels of PTH were significantly higher in the VDD group (63.5 ± 54.4 vs. 47.5 ± 42.9 pg/mL). The proportion of severe cases (13.2% vs.14.6%), mortality (2% vs. 5.2%), oxygen requirement (34.5% vs.43.4%), ICU admission (14.7% vs.19.8%) was not significantly different between patients with or without VDD. There was no significant correlation between serum 25-OHD levels and inflammatory markers studied. Serum parathormone levels correlated with D-dimer (r 0.117, p- 0.019), ferritin (r 0.132, p-0.010), and LDH (r 0.124, p-0.018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with oral cholecalciferol (median dose of 60,000 IU). The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, serum 25-OHD levels at admission did not correlate with inflammatory markers, clinical outcomes, or mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Treatment of VDD with cholecalciferol did not make any difference to the outcomes.","Jevalikar, Ganesh; Mithal, Ambrish; Singh, Anshu; Sharma, Rutuja; Farooqui, Khalid J; Mahendru, Shama; Dewan, Arun; Budhiraja, Sandeep",Sci Rep,,49

There are few data on human coronavirus infections among individuals living with HIV. In this study we probed the role of pneumococcal coinfections with seasonal CoVs among children living with and without HIV hospitalized for pneumonia. We also described the prevalence and clinical manifestations of these infections. A total of 39,836 children who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) were followed for lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations until 2 years of age. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected at the time of hospitalization and were screened by PCR for four seasonal CoVs. The frequency of CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in children living with HIV (19.9%) than in those without HIV (7.6%, P < 0.001). Serial CoV infections were detected in children living with HIV. The case fatality risk among children with CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in those living with HIV (30.4%) than without HIV (2.9%, P = 0.001). C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were elevated in 36.8% (&#8805;40 mg/liter) and 64.7% (&#8805;0.5 ng/ml), respectively, of the fatal cases living with HIV. Among children without HIV, there was a 64.0% (95% CI: 22.9% to 83.2%) lower incidence of CoV-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among PCV9 recipients compared to placebo recipients. These data suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae infections might have a role in the development of pneumonia associated with endemic CoVs, that PCV may prevent pediatric CoV-associated hospitalization, and that children living with HIV with CoV infections develop more severe outcomes.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe hospitalization, but little is known about the role of secondary bacterial infection in these severe cases, beyond the observation of high levels of reported inflammatory markers, associated with bacterial infection, such as procalcitonin. We did a secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized trial of PCV to examine its impact on human CoV infections before the pandemic. We found that both children living with and without HIV randomized to receive PCV had evidence of less hospitalization due to seasonal CoV, suggesting that pneumococcal coinfection may play a role in severe hospitalized CoV infections.","Nunes, Marta C; Cutland, Clare L; Klugman, Keith P; Madhi, Shabir A",mBio (Online),,49

383686,Photothermal therapy with silver nanoplates in HeLa cells studied by in situ fluorescence microscopy,2021,"Advance care directives (ACDs) are instructions regarding what types of medical treatments a patient desires and/or who they would like to designate as a healthcare surrogate to make important healthcare decisions when the patient is mentally incapacitated. At end-of-life, when faced with poor prognosis for a meaningful health-related quality of life, most patients indicate their preference to abstain from aggressive, life-sustaining treatments. Patients whose wishes are left unsaid often receive burdensome life sustain therapy by default, prolonging patient suffering. The CoVID pandemic has strained our healthcare resources and raised the need for prioritization of life-sustaining therapy. This highlights the urgency of ACDs more than ever. Despite ACDs' potential to provide patients with care that aligns with their values and preferences and reduce resource competition, there has been relatively little conversation regarding the overlap of ACDs and CoVID-19. There is low uptake among patients, lack of training for healthcare professionals, and inequitable adoption in vulnerable populations. However, solutions are forthcoming and may include electronic medical record completion, patient outreach efforts, healthcare worker programs to increase awareness of at-risk minority patients, and restructuring of incentives and reimbursement policies. This review carefully describes the above challenges and unique opportunities to address them in the CoVID-19 era. If solutions are leveraged appropriately, ACDs have the potential to address the described challenges and ethically resolve resource conflicts during the current crisis and beyond.","Gupta, Amol; Bahl, Bhavyaa; Rabadi, Saher; Mebane, Alexander; Levey, Robert; Vasudevan, Viswanath",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,49

In early life, HIV-1 infection is established in an immunologically inexperienced environment in which maternal ART and immune dynamics during pregnancy play a role in reservoir establishment. Children that initiated early antiretroviral therapy (ART) and maintained long-term suppression of viremia have smaller and less diverse HIV reservoirs than adults, although their proviral landscape during ART is reported to be similar to that of adults. The ability of these early infected cells to persist long-term through clonal expansion poses a major barrier to finding a cure. Furthermore, the effects of life-long HIV persistence and ART are yet to be understood, but growing evidence suggests that these individuals are at an increased risk for developing non-AIDS-related comorbidities, which underscores the need for an HIV cure.","Katusiime, Mary Grace; Van Zyl, Gert U; Cotton, Mark F; Kearney, Mary F",Viruses,,49

386760,How epidemics end,2021,"Coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). More than 90 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more than 2 million people have died of complications due to COVID-19 worldwide. COVID-19, in its severe form, presents with an uncontrolled, hyperactive immune response and severe immunological injury or organ damage that accounts for morbidity and mortality. Even in the absence of complications, COVID-19 can last for several months with lingering effects of an overactive immune system. Dysregulated myeloid and lymphocyte compartments have been implicated in lung immunopathology. Currently, there are limited clinically-tested treatments of COVID-19 with disparities in the apparent efficacy in patients. Accurate model systems are essential to rapidly evaluate promising discoveries but most currently available in mice, ferrets and hamsters do not recapitulate sustained immunopathology described in COVID19 patients. Here, we present a comprehensively humanized mouse COVID-19 model that faithfully recapitulates the innate and adaptive human immune responses during infection with SARS-CoV-2 by adapting recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-driven gene therapy to deliver human ACE2 to the lungs &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of MISTRG6 mice. Our unique model allows for the first time the study of chronic disease due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the context of patient-derived antibodies to characterize in real time the potential culprits of the observed human driving immunopathology;most importantly this model provides a live view into the aberrant macrophage response that is thought to be the effector of disease morbidity and ARDS in patients. Application of therapeutics such as patient-derived antibodies and steroids to our model allowed separation of the two aspects of the immune response, infectious viral clearance and immunopathology. Inflammatory cells seeded early in infection drove immune-patholgy later, but this very same early anti-viral response was also crucial to contain infection.","Sefik, E.; Israelow, B.; Zhao, J.; Qu, R.; Song, E.; Mirza, H.; Kaffe, E.; Halene, S.; Meffre, E.; Kluger, Y.; Nussenzweig, M.; Wilen, C.; Iwasaki, A.; Flavell, R.

390168,Biological HRPs in wastewater,2020,"The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2), first identified in India, is currently replacing pre-existing variants in Europe, the USA, and many other parts of the world. It is essential to monitor efficiently its spread to help guide public health policies. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta, but is time-consuming, expensive, and unavailable in many regions. We describe here a rapid and relatively inexpensive alternative to sequencing for specific identification of the Delta variant, by application of double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR). The technique exploits forward and reverse allele-specific primers, targeting two spike gene mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of each primer is enhanced by the presence of an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3' end. Amplicons are detected in real-time by means of a conventional fluorescently-labelled hydrolysis probe. Specificity was assessed by testing a range of well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples, most of which had previously been fully sequenced. In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing, and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants of concern (Alpha, B.1.1.7 and Beta, B.1.351), and 'wild-type' SARS-CoV-2. Other respiratory viruses, including influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, were non-reactive in the assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay, which targets the E gene. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus could successfully be genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR. The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that has the ability to conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant throughout the world, and its proportional representation in any SARS-CoV-2-infected population.","Garson, Jeremy A; Badru, Samuel; Parker, Eleanor L; Tedder, Richard S; McClure, Myra O",,,49
391664,"A Holistic Review of the State-of-the-Art Microfluidics for Exosome Separation: An Overview of the Current Status, Existing Obstacles, and Future Outlook",2021,"MOTIVATION: Human microbes play critical roles in drug development and precision medicine. How to systematically understand the complex interaction mechanism between human microbes and drugs remains a challenge nowadays. Identifying microbe-drug associations can not only provide great insights into understanding the mechanism, but also boost the development of drug discovery and repurposing. Considering the high cost and risk of biological experiments, the computational approach is an alternative choice. However, at present, few computational approaches have been developed to tackle this task. RESULTS: In this work, we leveraged rich biological information to construct a heterogeneous network for drugs and microbes, including a microbe similarity network, a drug similarity network, and a microbe-drug interaction network. We then proposed a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based framework for predicting human Microbe-Drug Associations, named GCNMDA. In the hidden layer of GCN, we further exploited the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which can ensure that similar nodes (i.e., microbes or drugs) have similar representations. To more accurately aggregate representations of neighborhoods, an attention mechanism was designed in the CRF layer. Moreover, we performed a random walk with restart (RWR) based scheme on both drug and microbe similarity networks to learn valuable features for drugs and microbes respectively. Experimental results on three different datasets showed that our GCNMDA model consistently achieved better performance than seven state-of-the-art methods. Case studies for three microbes including SARS-CoV-2 and two antimicrobial drugs (i.e., Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin) further confirmed the effectiveness of GCNMDA in identifying potential microbe-drug associations.

Method An online survey was conducted in China during February and March, 2020 to record the Chinese population's PTS (using the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, PCL-C) and PTG (using the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, PTGI) due to COVID-19. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) and a Two-Part Model (TPM) of regression analysis were conducted. Results In total, 29,118 Chinese completed the survey (54.2% were in their 20s, 68.0% were males, 60.3% had a college education). CFA results illustrated that bifactor models were better at describing the Chinese participants’ psychometric traits of PTS and PTG relative to the default models. Results of TPM suggested that female, low-educated, and middle-aged individuals were more vulnerable to PTS. Remarkably, mutual and positive correlations between PTS and PTG, though small in statistics, were observed through regression analyses. Conclusions The current results presented new best-fit structural models, potential predictors, and valuable baseline information on PTS and PTG of the Chinese population in the context of COVID-19.

399174,"A year after lockdowns began, has research got any kinder?",2021,"At the end of 2020, a new term ""post-COVID-19 syndrome"" appeared in the medical community. The prevalence of this syndrome reaches more than 30% among patients who have had COVID-19, and its duration can vary from 12 weeks to 6 months. One of the most severe consequences of COVID19 is the defeat of the cardiovascular system, which has a variety of mechanisms: dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system;pathological systemic inflammatory response;direct action of the virus on the myocardium with the development of myocarditis;respiratory failure with hypoxia, leading to damage to cardiomyocytes;microvascular damage due to hypoperfusion, increased vascular permeability, angiospasm and the direct damaging effect of the virus on the endothelium of the coronary arteries;thrombotic complications due to the procoagulant and prothrombogenic effect of systemic inflammation. One of the most promising directions in the treatment and prevention of damage to the cardiovascular system in patients with hypertension who have undergone COVID-19 is the appointment of antihypertensive drugs that have the most pronounced organoprotective properties together with statins. The single pill combination of lisinopril, amlodipine and rosuvastatin is an effective drug that allows achieving not only adequate hypotensive and lipid-lowering effects, but also due to its pronounced organoprotective properties, to expect a reduction in cardiovascular risk and complications in patients who have suffered a new coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Podzolkov, V.

Drawing on event system theory and literature on job insecurity, we conceptualize COVID-19 as an event relevant to employees' work, and propose that event strength (i.e., novelty, disruption, and criticality) of COVID-19 influences employee job insecurity, which in turn affects employee work and non-work outcomes. We also identified important organization adaptive practices responding to COVID-19 based on a preliminary interview study, and examined its role in mitigating the undesired effects of COVID-19 event strength. Results from a two-wave lagged survey study indicated that employees' perceived COVID-19 event novelty and disruption (but not criticality) were positively related to their job insecurity, which in turn was positively related to their emotional exhaustion, organizational deviance, and saving behavior. Moreover, organization adaptive practices mitigated the effects of COVID-19 event novelty and criticality (but not disruption) on job insecurity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a nationwide analysis on hospitalized PD patients in Germany and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an administrative claims database covering 1468 hospitals and 5,210,432 patient hospitalizations including a total of 30,872 COVID-19+ cases between January 16 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, hospitalizations for PD transiently decreased by up to 72.7% in 2020. COVID-19 frequency was significantly higher in the population of 64,434 PD patients (693 being COVID-19+ ) than in non-PD patients (1.1% vs. 0.6%, P < 0.001), especially in subjects with advanced age (&#8805; 65 years). Regarding established COVID-19 risk comorbidities, COVID-19+ inpatients with PD showed higher incidences than non-PD COVID-19+ subjects, particularly hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Advanced age and male sex were significantly more frequent in COVID-19+ than in COVID-19- PD patients. The COVID-19 inpatient mortality rate was much higher in PD patients than in non-PD patients (35.4% vs. 20.7%, P < 0.001), especially in patients aged 75-79 years. Of note, overall inpatient mortality of PD patients was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (5.7% vs. 4.9%, P < 0.001).

We globally evaluate the effect of social media and online foreign disinformation campaigns on vaccination rates and attitudes towards vaccine safety. METHODS: Weuse a large-n cross-country regression framework to evaluate the effect ofsocial media on vaccine hesitancy globally. To do so, we operationalize social media usage in two dimensions: the use of it by the public to organize action(using Digital Society Project indicators), and the level of negative lyoriented discourse about vaccines on social media (using a data set of all geocoded tweets in the world from 2018-2019). In addition, we measure the level of foreign-sourced coordinated disinformation operations on social media ineach country (using Digital Society Project indicators). The outcome of vaccine hesitancy is measured in two ways. First, we use polls of what proportion ofthe public per country feels vaccines are unsafe (using Wellcome Global Monitor indicators for 137 countries). Second, we use annual data of actual vaccination rates from the WHO for 166 countries. RESULTS: We found the use of social media to organise offline action to be highly predictive of the belief that vaccinations are unsafe, with such beliefs mounting as more organisation occurs on social media. In addition, the prevalence of foreign disinformation is highly statistically and substantively significant in predicting a drop in mean vaccination coverage over time. A 1-point shift upwards in the 5-point disinformation scale is associated with a 2-percentage point drop in mean vaccination coverage year over year. We also found support for the connection of foreign disinformation with negative social media activity about vaccination. The substantive effect of foreign disinformation is to increase the number of negative vaccine tweets by 15% for the median country. CONCLUSION: There is a significant relationship between organisation on social media and public doubts of vaccine safety. In addition, there is a substantial relationship between foreign disinformation campaigns and declining vaccination coverage.","Wilson, Steven Lloyd; Wiysonge, Charles",,,49

The initial step for all drug discovery models is the identification of suitable targets. One approach organizations may take to tackle this involves issuing raw data publicly for collaboration with other organizations in order to spark discussion, collectively experiment and stay up to date with advances in scientific knowledge. Areas covered: Numerous organizations have released genomic data, amongst other tools, for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this has led to the development of growing datasets of knowledge for continued collaboration amongst different scientific communities. A different technique employs a more closed, market-driven method in order to stay ahead financially in the race for developing a suitable antiviral or vaccine. The latter allows sustained motivation for company ambitions and progress has been made toward clinical trials for potential drugs. Expert opinion: A case can be made for both open and closed drug discovery models; however, due to the rapidly evolving nature of this deadly virus, organizations should collate their research and support one another to ensure satisfactory treatment can be approved in a timely manner.","Harky, Amer; Mishra, Vaibhav; Ansari, Daniyal Matin; Melamed, Naomi",Expert Opin Drug Discov,,49

410331,Designed proteins assemble antibodies into modular nanocages,2021,"UV254 irradiation disinfection is a commonly used method to inactivate pathogenic viruses in water and wastewater treatment. Model prediction method can serve as a pre-screening tool to quickly estimate the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation on emerging or unculturable viruses. In this study, an improved prediction model was applied to estimate UV254 photolysis kinetics of viral genomes (kpred, genome) based on the genome sequences and their photoreactivity and to correlate with the experimental virus infectivity loss kinetics (kexp, infectivity). The UV254 inactivation data of 102 viruses (including 2 dsRNA, 65 ssRNA, 33 dsDNA and 2 ssDNA viruses) were collected from the published experimental data with kexp, infectivity ranging from 0.016 to 3.49 cm2 mJ-1. The model had fairly good performance in predicting the virus susceptibility to UV254 irradiation except dsRNA viruses (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.64) and 70% of kpred, genome fell in the range of 1/2 to 2 times of kexp, infectivity. The positive deviation of the model often occurred for photoresistant viruses with low kexp, infectivity less than 0.20 cm2 mJ-1 (e.g., Adenovirus, Papovaviridae and Retroviridae). We also applied this model to predict the UV254 inactivation rate of SARS-CoV-2 (kpred, genome = 3.168 cm2 mJ-1) and a UV dose of 3 mJ cm-2 seemed to be able to achieve a 2-log removal by conservative calculation using 1/2kpred, genome value. This prediction method can be used as a prescreening tool to assess the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation for emerging/unculturable viruses in water or wastewater treatment.","Cheng, Shuangshuang; Ge, Yuexian; Lee, Yunho; Yang, Xin",Water Res,,49

In the first study, nasal specimens and either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens from 251 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (&#8804;7 days from symptom onset [DSO]), &#8805;18 years of age, were utilized to compare Veritor with the Lyra® SARS-CoV-2 PCR Assay (Lyra). In the second study, nasal specimens from 361 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (&#8804;5 DSO), &#8805;18 years of age, were utilized to compare performance of Veritor to that of the Sofia® 2 SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2). Positive, negative, and overall percent agreement (PPA, NPA, and OPA, respectively) were the primary outcomes.Results: In study 1, PPA for Veritor, compared to Lyra, ranged from 81.8%-87.5% for 0-1 through 0-6 DSO ranges. In study 2, Veritor had a PPA, NPA, and OPA of 97.4%, 98.1%, and 98.1%, respectively, with Sofia 2. Discordant analysis showed one Lyra positive missed by Veritor and five Lyra positives missed by Sofia 2; one Veritor positive result was negative by Lyra.Conclusions: Veritor met FDA-EUA acceptance criteria for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing (&#8805;80% PPA point estimate) for the 0-5 and 0-6 DSO ranges. Veritor and Sofia 2 showed a high degree of agreement for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

She suffered from headache and malaise with no respiratory symptoms, fever or chills. Chest radiological imaging was unremarkable but, the laboratory results showed significant thrombocytopenia associated with relatively decreased lymphocytes. Based on her high-risk work environment, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal swab. Complete blood count (CBC) of patient was re-checked during admission and platelet count showed rising trend up to normal levels.

418207,The lasting misery of coronavirus long-haulers,2020,"The coronavirus 3C-like (3CL) protease is a Cysteine protease. It plays an important role in viral infection and immune escape by not only cleaving the viral polyprotein ORF1ab at 11 sites, but also cleaving the host proteins. However, there is still a lack of effective tools for determining the cleavage sites of the 3CL protease. This study systematically investigated the diversity of the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease on the viral polyprotein, and found that the cleavage motif were highly conserved for viruses in the genera of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. Strong residue preferences were observed at the neighboring positions of the cleavage sites. A random forest (RF) model was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the representation of residues at cleavage site and neighboring positions by amino acid indexes, and the model achieved an AUC of 0.96 in cross-validations. The RF model was further tested on an independent test dataset composed of cleavage sites on host proteins, and achieved an AUC of 0.88 and a prediction precision of 0.80 when considering the accessibility of the cleavage site. Then, 1,079 human proteins were predicted to be cleaved by the 3CL protease by the RF model. These proteins were enriched in pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases and pathogen infection. Finally, a user-friendly online server named 3CLP was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the RF model. Overall, the study not only provides an effective tool for identifying the cleavage sites of the 3CL protease, but also provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of coronaviruses.","Chen, Huiting; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xingyi; Zheng, Heping; Peng, Yousong",,,49

Preference for a particular path was influenced the most by comfort, forward speed, and characteristics of the turns. Preference was also strongly associated with the users' perceived naturalness, which was primarily determined by the ability to see salient objects, the distance to the walls and objects, as well as the turns.

422946,Reporting on Adverse Clinical Events,2020,"The monthly air traffic of a city is a time series with an obvious seasonal pattern, and is closely related to the economic situation and social environment of the city. In Hong Kong, for example, July, August, and October tend to be the peak season of traffic flow, while there is also a relatively fixed off-season. In the case of a stable social environment, a carefully identified and fitted seasonal ARIMA model can predict the traffic flow in the future months well. This work selects the air traffic data, including arrival and departure passengers of Hong Kong, after the financial crisis and before the political storm. A sparse seasonal ARIMA$(0,1,1)\times(4,1,0)_{12}$ is built, which can correctly predict the air traffic from January to July in 2020 within its $95\%$ confidence interval. Furthermore, this work decomposes the time-series and find that important events, like the financial crisis, political storm, and the COVID-19 outbreak, affect the level of air traffic to some extent. For example, the political storm and epidemic prevention and control that happened after 2019 made the air traffic drop significantly. According to my sparse seasonal ARIMA model, the air traffic from February to November in 2020 is only $5\%$ of what it should be without these two events. This is a valuable application of the time-series model in the air traffic loss estimation.","Chai, Shuwen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05817v1.pdf,49

In this review we assess existing literature on the diverse role of males within bumble bee nests and their importance to queen health and fitness, as well as to overall nest success. The implications of reproductive measures, including sperm transfer, mating behavior, mating plugs, and male immunity, among other topics, are examined.

430564,Principles to Practices for Responsible AI: Closing the Gap,2020-06-08,"The rapid spread of the new pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has seriously threatened global health. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the tried-and-true polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but PCR is a laborious, time-consuming and complicated manual process that is in short supply. Deep learning based computer-aided screening, e.g., infection segmentation, is thus viewed as an alternative due to its great successes in medical imaging. However, the publicly available COVID-19 training data are limited, which would easily cause overfitting of traditional deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other hand, fast training/testing and low computational cost are also important for quick deployment and development of computer-aided COVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods, especially for image segmentation, are usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant strengths: i) it only has 472K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii) it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a comprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg with traditional methods. Code and models will be released to promote the research and practical deployment for computer-aided COVID-19 screening.","Qiu, Yu; Liu, Yun; Xu, Jing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09750v1.pdf,49

According to a report by Public Health England, after accounting for sex, age, deprivation and region, ‘people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death when compared with people of White British ethnicity. Not only is the imprisoning, assault and murder of protestors a violation of the human rights to free speech and free assembly, guaranteed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but the targeting of medical professionals and interfering in their activities is an abuse of the principle of medical neutrality, enshrined in the Fourth Geneva Convention.8 Not only is this a violation of the rights of doctors and other colleagues, it is also detrimental to the healthcare of patients, diminishing their right to the highest standard of health which is guaranteed by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which was ratified by Myanmar in 2017. A piece has been written for the British Medical Journal to raise awareness,10 the BMA has written to the Foreign Secretary requesting that coordinated international action be explored to oppose the human rights abuses of medical professionals, and a joint statement of solidarity with several UK royal medical colleges and other organisations representative of medical professionals has been published, which has collated resources that may be of use to those from abroad looking to offer support in Myanmar and for healthcare professionals in Myanmar also.","Norcliffe-Brown, Dominic Brannan Sophie Davies Martin English Veronica Mussell Rebecca Sheather Julian C.",Journal of Medical Ethics,,49

439275,After the Megafires: What Next for Australian Wildlife?,2020,"In recent months, there has been a lot of debate surrounding the use of those COVID-19 vaccines that have been either tested or manufactured with cell lines that were isolated from the remains of an aborted fetal child. Most faithful and orthodox Catholic moral theologians, among whom I count myself, have concluded that their use is not intrinsically evil. Therefore, like every other decision that falls into the category of actions that are not intrinsically evil, the decision to be vaccinated with these morally controversial vaccines has to be governed by the virtue of prudence. It is a decision that calls for a wisdom that properly sees this action within the constellation of actions that propels the human agent to the heights of holiness. This is why prayer is so essential for authentic moral judgment. With prayer, we ask the Holy Spirit who is the all-prudent one to guide our actions so that we can choose and act well not only for our only well-being but for the well-being of all. Acts that are not themselves intrinsically evil are deemed virtuous or not within the narrative of the individual person?s life.","Austriaco, Nicanor Pier Giorgio",The Linacre Quarterly,,49
440590,Neutralizing antibody vaccine for pandemic and pre-emergent coronaviruses,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the demographic and diagnostic distribution of patients presenting to the ophthalmology department during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic period METHODS: The study included patients who made outpatient appointments in our ophthalmology department. The COVID-19 group (CovG) comprised patients who presented between April 15 and May 15, 2020, the 30-day period with the highest daily number of new cases in Turkey. The control group (CG) was obtained by randomization through a computer program from among 2 245 patients who applied in the same period of the previous year. The patients' presenting complaint(s), diagnostic(s) and demographic information's were collected from a database, with all identifying information concealed. For patients who presented more than once, their initial complaint and diagnoses were analyzed RESULTS: The study included a total of 400 patients: 200 in the CovG and 200 in the CG. Mean ages in the CovG and CG were 41.23 ± 14.48 and 48.20 ± 17.49 years, respectively (p < 0.001). The female to male patient ratio was 0.53 in the CovG and 0.83 in the CG (p = 0.032). There were fewer university graduates compared to other education levels among the patients who presented during the pandemic (p = 0.013). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no increase in presentation frequency for any ocular disease compared to the previous year. The only statistical decrease in patient application complaints was observed in reading difficultness (11 % in CovG vs. 37 % in CG; p < 0.001). Presentations due to dry eye (DE) and allergic conjunctivitis (AC) were similar to the same period of the year (p = 0.303 and p = 0.550, respectively). At least 1 chronic ocular disease was present in 25 % of the CovG and 45.5 % of the CG (p < 0.001). A statistically significant decrease was observed in CovG for age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma in the diagnoses made at the end of the examination (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, the most common outpatient presentations to the ophthalmology department were for the diagnoses of DE and AC. During peak pandemic period, elderly patients, women and academically trained patients significantly reduced their visits to the Eye Clinic. The reduction in presentation of patients with glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration may be due to the longterm treatment planning for these patients and the social isolation measures issued for the older population. These patients should be encouraged to use video consultation / telemedicine in eye patients at risk of vision loss.","Fatih, Aslan; Öktem, C",Cesk Slov Oftalmol,,49

The present situation demands the countries to scale up their testing and design innovative strategies to conserve diagnostic kits and reagents. The pooling of samples saves time, workforce and most importantly diagnostic kits and reagents. In the present study, we tried to define the pool size that could be applied with acceptable confidence for testing. Materials and Methods: We used repeatedly tested positive clinical sample elutes having different levels of SARS CoV 2 RNA and negative sample elutes to prepare seven series of 11 pools each, having pool sizes ranging from 2 to 48 samples to estimate the optimal pool size. Each pool had one positive sample elute in different compositions. All the pools were tested by SARS CoV 2 reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Out of the 77 pools, only 53 (68.8%) were found positive. The sensitivity of pools of 2-48 samples was decreased from 100% (95% confidence interval [CL]; 98.4-100) to 41.41% (95% CL; 34.9-48.1). The maximum size of the pool with acceptable sensitivity (>95%) was found to be of six samples. For the pool size of six samples, the sensitivity was 97.8% and the efficiency of pooling was 0.38. Conclusions: The pooling of samples is a practical way for scaling up testing and ultimately containing the further spread of the CoV disease 2019 pandemic.","Khodare, Arvind; Padhi, Abhishek; Gupta, Ekta; Agarwal, Reshu; Dubey, Shantanu; Sarin, Shiv Kumar",Indian J Med Microbiol,,49
444720,High-Throughput Discovery of Novel Cubic Crystal Materials Using Deep Generative Neural Networks,2021,"In recent decades, the number of farmer?s markets has increased dramatically across the country. Though farmers markets have been described as White spaces, they can play important roles in reducing food insecurity. This is particularly true in Michigan where farmer?s markets were crucial collaborators in pioneering programs such as Double-Up Food Bucks that help low-income residents and people of color gain access to fresh, healthy, locally grown food. This article examines the questions: (1) What are the demographic characteristics of the farmers market managers, vendors, and customers and how do these influence market activities? (2) To what extent do farmers markets participate in programs aimed at reducing food insecurity? (3) To what extent do farmers markets serve low-income residents and people of color? and (4) How has the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) affected the operations of farmers markets. This article discusses the findings of a 2020 study that examined the extent to which Michigan?s farmer?s markets served low-income customers and people of color and participated in food assistance programs. The study examined 79 farmers markets and found that 87.3% of the farmer?s market managers are White. On average, roughly 79% of the vendors of the markets are White and almost 18% are people of color. Most of the vendors in the markets participate in nutrition assistance programs. Market managers estimate that about 76% of their customers are White and about 23% are people of color. Farmers markets operated by people of color attract higher numbers of customers and vendors of color than those operated White market managers. Almost half of the farmer?s markets started operations later than usual in 2020 because of the pandemic. More than a third of the markets reported that their funding declined during the pandemic. Moreover, the number of vendors declined at two thirds of the markets and the number of customers dipped at more than 40% of the markets. On the other hand, the number of people requesting food assistance during the pandemic increased in more than half of the markets.","Taylor, Dorceta E.; Lusuegro, Alliyah Loong Victoria Cambridge Alexis Nichols Claire Goode Maeghen McCoy Ember Daupan Socorro M.; Bartlett, M’Lis Noel Erin Pollvogt Brayden",American Behavioral Scientist,,49

Valuation of life linked to an individual's country of origin, the pharmaceutical industry's prioritisation of profit, the exploitation of vulnerable groups in clinical trials, and the resulting hesitancy towards drugs and vaccines have, among other factors, made the human right to health unattainable for many people. The COVID-19 pandemic presents itself as an opportunity to reverse this long-standing trajectory of unethical practices in global health. By ensuring the ethical inclusion of vulnerable groups in the vaccine development process and making a safe, effective vaccine accessible to all, pharmaceutical companies, governments, and international organisations can usher in a new era of global health that relies solely on ethical decision making.","Binagwaho, Agnes; Mathewos, Kedest; Davis, Sheila",Lancet Glob Health,,49

METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Santa Maria Annunziata Hospital (Florence, Italy), from February 25 to April 25, 2020, with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. NI/I-VS was defined as the need for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) (non-invasive ventilation) or mechanical ventilation, not including low-flow systems of oxygen therapy such as the Venturi mask or nasal cannula. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were enrolled; 61.9% (60/97) were male and the median patient age was 64 years. The in-hospital mortality was 9.3%. Thirty-five of the 97 patients (36%) required ICU admission and 94.8% (92/97) were prescribed oxygen therapy: 10.8% (10/92) by nasal cannula, 44.5% (41/92) by Venturi mask, 31.5% (29/92) by CPAP, 2.2% (2/92) by BPAP, and 10.8% (10/92) by mechanical ventilation following intubation. On univariate analysis, patients with a body mass index >30, type II diabetes mellitus, and those presenting with dyspnoea, asthenia, SOFA score &#8805;2 points, PaO2/FiO2 <300, temperature >38 °C, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein, and a d-dimer >1000 ng/mL at admission more frequently underwent NI/I-VS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed temperature >38 °C (odds ratio (OR) 21.2, 95% confidential interval (95% CI) 3.5-124.5, p = 0.001), LDH >250 U/l (OR 15.2, 95% CI 1.8-128.8, p = 0.012), and d-dimer >1000 ng/mL (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-17.3, p = 0.027) as significantly associated with the requirement for NI/I-VS. A non-significant trend (p = 0.051) was described for PaO2/FiO2 <300. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature >38 °C, LDH > 250 U/l, and d-dimer >1000 ng/mL were found to be independent risk factors for NI/I-VS in COVID-19 patients. In order to quickly identify patients likely at risk of developing a critical illness, inflammatory markers should be assessed upon hospital admission.","Suardi, Lorenzo Roberto; Pallotto, Carlo; Esperti, Sara; Tazzioli, Elisa; Baragli, Filippo; Salomoni, Elena; Botta, Annarita; Covani Frigieri, Francesca; Pazzi, Maddalena; Stera, Caterina; Carlucci, Martina; Papa, Raffaella; Meconi, Tommaso; Pavoni, Vittorio; Blanc, Pierluigi",Int J Infect Dis,,49

A Review",2021,"Purpose Over the last two decades, the number of Americans misusing opioids has reached epidemic levels. With such drastic increases in opioid misuse, audiologists are more likely to have patients with opioid-induced hearing loss or neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) than in previous years. More attention is needed on how these increases might influence clinical practice and such a discussion could be useful for audiologists. The goal of this article, therefore, is to summarize what is currently known regarding the relationship between opioid misuse and audiology to help guide hearing health care providers (with a particular focus on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS). This article (a) summarizes the overlap in opioid misuse and hearing loss populations, (b) describes the evidence linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, (c) discusses clinical implications that opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS have for practicing audiologists, and (d) recommends directions for future audiological research on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Conclusions There is considerable overlap between populations at-risk for hearing loss and opioid misuse. Additionally, compelling evidence exists linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, but the specific causal mechanisms remain unclear, indicating a need for additional research. This article attempts to fill a gap in the audiological literature and has the potential to serve as a guide for hearing health care providers to make more informed clinical decisions regarding patients with opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Clinicians may wish to consider the concerns raised in this article before intervening with such concerns, especially in the absence of best practice protocols.","Rigg, Khary K; Rigg, Malika S",Am J Audiol,,49
455873,Turning the Tables: The View from Offshore During 60 Days in JST,2021-05-11,"The use of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) devices in the upper zones of occupied buildings has gained increased attention as one of the most effective mitigation technologies for the transmission of COVID-19. To ensure safe and effective use of upper-room UVGI, it is necessary to devise a simulation technique that enables engineers, designers, and users to explore the impact of different design and operational parameters. We have developed a simulation technique for calculating UV-C fluence rate within the volume of the upper zone and planar irradiance in the lower occupied zone. Our method is based on established ray-tracing light simulation methods adapted to the UV-C wavelength range. We have included a case study of a typical hospital patient room. In it, we explored the impact of several design parameters: ceiling height, device location, room configuration, proportions, and surface materials. We present a spatially mapped parametric study of the UV-C irradiance distribution in three dimensions. We found that the ceiling height and mounting height of the UVGI fixtures combined can cause the largest variation (up to 22%) in upper zone fluence rate. One of the most important findings of this study is that it is crucial to consider interreflections in the room. This is because surface reflectance is the design parameter with the largest impact on the occupant exposure in the lower zone: Applying materials with high reflectance ratio in the upper portion of the room has the highest negative impact (over 700% variation) on increasing hot spots that may receive over 6 mJ/cm2 UV dose in the lower occupied zone.","Hou, Miaomiao; Pantelic, Jovan; Aviv, Dorit",Indoor air,,49

Each country worldwide has faced this pandemic differently, reflected in its statistical number of confirmed and death cases. Predicting the number of confirmed and death cases could allow us to know the future number of cases and provide each country with the necessary information to make decisions based on the predictions. Recent works are focused only on confirmed COVID-19 cases or a specific country. In this work, the firefly algorithm designs an ensemble neural network architecture for each one of 26 countries. In this work, we propose the firefly algorithm for ensemble neural network optimization applied to COVID-19 time series prediction with type-2 fuzzy logic in a weighted average integration method. The proposed method finds the number of artificial neural networks needed to form an ensemble neural network and their architecture using a type-2 fuzzy inference system to combine the responses of individual artificial neural networks to perform a final prediction. The advantages of the type-2 fuzzy weighted average integration (FWA) method over the conventional average method and type-1 fuzzy weighted average integration are shown.","Melin, Patricia; Sánchez, Daniela; Monica, Julio Cesar; Castillo, Oscar",Soft comput,,49

Research involving the patients' perspectives may help to improve healthcare professionals' understanding of ways to support patients. AIMS: To gain in-depth understanding of the meaning of a COVID-19 illness trajectory from the patients' perspective. METHODS: Fifteen participants who had undergone an illness trajectory due to confirmed COVID-19 infection participated in individual qualitative interviews. Data collection, analysis and interpretation were inspired by Ricoeur's philosophy and Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception and embodiment has been applied as a theoretical frame. FINDINGS: Being infected with coronavirus is expressed as an experience in which the participants oscillate between relief, security, imprisonment and raw fear. A predominant focus on the physical dimensions of the diseased body was found in the encounters between patient and healthcare system, and distance may furthermore be a consequence of use of protective equipment. Stigma and fear of infection were also expressed. After COVID-19, an overwhelming feeling of a door opening to freedom is perceived. However, the body is marked, and bears witness to decay from this insidious and frightening virus. The responsibility for assessing their bodily symptoms is placed with the individual patients themselves, who feel lonely and fearful and this keeps them indoors. CONCLUSIONS: During a COVID-19 illness, trajectory concerns about the unknown course of this disease are highlighted. Isolation is confrontational; however, a companionship between patients might emerge. The study shed light on an unavoidable gap between the patients and healthcare professionals due to the use protective equipment. After COVID-19, the body is labelled as something others fear and become a symbol of awe and alienation for others.","Missel, Malene; Bernild, Camilla; Westh Christensen, Signe; Dagyaran, Ilkay; Kikkenborg Berg, Selina",Scand. j. caring sci,,49

Soluble extracellular proteins, including immunoglobulins, blood clotting factors, proteins of the complement system, and/or antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can exert direct effects by binding to a virus capsid that modifies interactions with pattern recognition receptors and downstream signaling. In addition, the presence, generation, or secretion of extracellular proteins can indirectly influence the response to HAdVs via the activation and recruitment of cells at the site of infection.","Chéneau, Coraline; Kremer, Eric J",Viruses,,49

The Pituitary Society produced recommendations to guide management during this era. We sought to assess contemporary neurosurgical practice and the impact of COVID-19. METHODS: A multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study was conducted at twelve tertiary neurosurgical units (UK and Ireland). Data were collected from March 23rd-July 31st, 2020 inclusive. Data points collected were patient demographics, pre-operative COVID-19 testing, intra-operative operative modifications, and 30-day COVID infection rates. RESULTS: 124 patients were included. 116 patients (n=116/124, 94%) underwent COVID-19 testing pre-operatively (TSA: 97/105, 92%; EEA: 19/19, 100%). One patient (n=1/115, 1%) tested positively for COVID-19 pre-operatively, requiring a delay of operation until the infection was confirmed as resolved. Asides from transient diabetes insipidus; no other complications were reported for this case. All theatre staff wore at least level 2 PPE. Adaptations to surgical techniques included minimising drilling, draping modifications, and using nasal iodine wash. At 30 days postoperatively, there was no evidence of COVID infection (symptoms or on formal testing) in our cohort, and no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative screening protocols and operative modifications have facilitated endonasal neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Pituitary Society guidelines followed for the majority of these operations. There was no evidence of COVID infection in our cohort, and no mortality, supporting the use of risk mitigation strategies to continue endonasal neurosurgery in subsequent pandemic waves.","Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Khan, Danyal Z; Marcus, Hani J; Schroeder, Benjamin E; Patel, Vikesh; O039,; Donnell, Alice; Ahmed, Shahzada; Alalade, Andrew F; Ali, Ahmad Ms; Allison, Callum; Al-Barazi, Sinan; Al-Mahfoudh, Rafid; Amarouche, Meriem; Bahl, Anuj; Bennett, David; Bhalla, Raj; Bhatt, Pragnesh; Boukas, Alexandros; Cabrilo, Ivan; Chadwick, Annabel; Chowdhury, Yasir A; Choi, David; Cudlip, Simon A; Donnelly, Neil; Dorward, Neil L; Dow, Graham; Fountain, Daniel M; Grieve, Joan; Giamouriadis, Anastasios; Gilkes, Catherine; Gnanalingham, Kanna; Halliday, Jane; Hanna, Brendan; Hayhurst, Caroline; Hempenstall, Jonathan; Henderson, Duncan; Hossain-Ibrahim, Kismet; Hirst, Theodore; Hughes, Mark; Javadpour, Mohsen; Jenkins, Alistair; Kamel, Mahmoud; Mannion, Richard J; Kolias, Angelos G; Khan, Habibullah; Khan, Mohammad Saud; Lacy, Peter; Mahmood, Shumail; Maratos, Eleni; Martin, Andrew",World neurosurgery (Online),,49
462457,L’emergenza diventa volano per l’intelligenza artificiale,2020,"BACKGROUND: The assessment of real-world effectiveness of immunomodulatory medications for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may guide therapy. METHODS: We analyzed surveillance data on inpatients younger than 21 years of age who had MIS-C and were admitted to 1 of 58 U.S. hospitals between March 15 and October 31, 2020. The effectiveness of initial immunomodulatory therapy (day 0, indicating the first day any such therapy for MIS-C was given) with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus glucocorticoids, as compared with IVIG alone, was evaluated with propensity-score matching and inverse probability weighting, with adjustment for baseline MIS-C severity and demographic characteristics. The primary outcome was cardiovascular dysfunction (a composite of left ventricular dysfunction or shock resulting in the use of vasopressors) on or after day 2. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary outcome, the receipt of adjunctive treatment (glucocorticoids in patients not already receiving glucocorticoids on day 0, a biologic, or a second dose of IVIG) on or after day 1, and persistent or recurrent fever on or after day 2. RESULTS: A total of 518 patients with MIS-C (median age, 8.7 years) received at least one immunomodulatory therapy; 75% had been previously healthy, and 9 died. In the propensity-score-matched analysis, initial treatment with IVIG plus glucocorticoids (103 patients) was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular dysfunction on or after day 2 than IVIG alone (103 patients) (17% vs. 31%; risk ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.94). The risks of the components of the composite outcome were also lower among those who received IVIG plus glucocorticoids: left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 8% and 17% of the patients, respectively (risk ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.19 to 1.15), and shock resulting in vasopressor use in 13% and 24% (risk ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.00). The use of adjunctive therapy was lower among patients who received IVIG plus glucocorticoids than among those who received IVIG alone (34% vs. 70%; risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.65), but the risk of fever was unaffected (31% and 40%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.13). The inverse-probability-weighted analysis confirmed the results of the propensity-score-matched analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Among children and adolescents with MIS-C, initial treatment with IVIG plus glucocorticoids was associated with a lower risk of new or persistent cardiovascular dysfunction than IVIG alone.

463153,Mexico's controversial coronavirus czar,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based cell transplantation is an effective means of treating chronic liver injury, fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. However, extensive studies have found that only a small number of transplanted cells migrate to the site of injury or lesion, and repair efficacy is very limited. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were generated that overexpressed the erythropoietin (EPO) gene using a lentivirus. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect the viability of BM-MSCs after overexpressing EPO. Cell migration and apoptosis were verified using Boyden chamber and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the anti-fibrosis efficacy of EPO-MSCs was evaluated in vivo using immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: EPO overexpression promoted cell viability and migration of BM-MSCs without inducing apoptosis, and EPO-MSC treatment significantly alleviated liver fibrosis in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced mouse liver fibrosis model. CONCLUSION: EPO-MSCs enhance anti-fibrotic efficacy, with higher cell viability and stronger migration ability compared with treatment with BM-MSCs only. These findings support improving the efficiency of MSCs transplantation as a potential therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis.","Wang, Xianyao; Wang, Huizhen; Lu, Junhou; Feng, Zhanhui; Liu, Zhongshan; Song, Hailiang; Wang, Heng; Zhou, Yanhua; Xu, Jianwei",,,49

The purpose of this study was to examine the psychological status of children and their parent during 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China. Data were collected from children (n = 1360) and their parent (n = 1360) in China using online survey during February 2020. Demographic information, media exposure, and psychological status including anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed using self-report measures. The results indicated that, for children, 1.84% experienced moderate anxiety, 2.22% experienced depression and 3.16% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD; for parent, 1.18%, 0.01% and 3.60% experienced moderate anxiety, severe depression, and moderate depression, respectively, and 3.53% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Moreover, excessive media exposure (ß = -0.08 ~ 0.13, ps < 0.05) was a risk factor for anxiety and PTSD for children, a positive factor against anxiety and depression for parent. Being a mother (ß = 0.07 ~ 0.21, ps < 0.01), being younger (ß = -0.09 ~ -0.07, ps < 0.05), lower levels of educational attainment (ß = -0.17 ~ -0.08, ps < 0.01) and family monthly income (ß = -0.17 ~ -0.11, ps < 0.05) were risk factors for anxiety, depression and PTSD for parent. Findings suggested that children and their parent in non-severe area didn't suffer major psychological distress during the outbreak. Factors associated with lower levels of mental health problems were identified to inform the use of psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the pandemic.","Yue, Jinming; Zang, Xueyan; Le, Yunying; An, Yuanyuan",Curr Psychol,,49

465954,Joint Characterization of Spatiotemporal Data Manifolds,2021-08-21,"BACKGROUND: Old age is associated with a significantly increased mortality in COVID-19 patients exposed to long-term controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and suggested to be due to the hyperinflammatory response associated with the viral infection. However, our understanding of age-related differences in the response to CMV in the absence of a viral infection remains insufficient. METHODS: Young (7-8 months) and old (28-32 months) F344 BN hybrid rats were exposed to the ICU condition for 5 days, i.e., complete immobilization, mechanical ventilation, and extensive monitoring. Transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and proteomics (Proximity Extension Assay) analyses of the diaphragm and proteomics analysis of plasma were conducted to investigate the molecular differences between young and old rats exposed to the ICU condition. RESULTS: According to multi-omics analyses, significant differences were observed in the diaphragm between young and old rats in response to 5 days CMV and immobilization. In young rats, metabolic pathways were primarily downregulated in response to immobilization (post-synaptic blockade of neuromuscular transmission). In old rats, on the other hand, dramatic immune and inflammatory responses were observed, i.e., an upregulation of specific related pathways such as ""IL-17 signaling pathway"", along with a higher level of inflammatory factors and cytokine/chemokine in plasma. CONCLUSIONS: The dramatically increased mortality in old ICU patients with COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and cytokine storm need not only reflect the viral infection but may also be associated with the ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) and hyperinflammatory responses induced by long-term CMV per se. Although mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention in COVID-19 ICU patients, CMV should be cautiously used especially in old age and other means of respiratory support may be considered, such as negative pressure ventilation.","Lyu, Qiong; Wen, Ya; Zhang, Xiang; Addinsall, Alex B; Cacciani, Nicola; Larsson, Lars",Skelet Muscle,,49
466374,The tail of the distribution of fatalities in epidemics,2020-10-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic is endangering the world due to the spread of respiration droplets with viruses. Medical workers and frontline staff need to wear respirators to protect themselves from breathing in the virus-containing respiration droplets. The most frequently used state-of-the-art respirators are of N95 standard; however, they lack self-decontamination capabilities. In addition, the viruses and bacteria can accumulate on the respirator surfaces, possessing high risks to the wearers over long-term usage. Photothermal decontamination is a contactless, fast, low-cost, and widely available method, capable of decontaminating the respirators. Herein, we report a plasmonic photothermal and superhydrophobic coating on N95 respirators, possessing significantly better protection than existing personal protection equipment. The plasmonic heating can raise the surface temperature to over 80 °C for this type of respirator within 1 min of sunlight illumination. The superhydrophobic features prohibit respiration droplets from accumulating on the respirator surfaces. The presence of the silver nanoparticles can provide additional protection via the silver ion's disinfection toward microbes. These synergistic features of the composite coatings provide the N95 respirator with better protection and can inspire experts from interdisciplinary fields to develop better personal protection equipment to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhong, Hong; Zhu, Zhaoran; You, Peng; Lin, Jing; Cheung, Chi Fai; Lu, Vivien L; Yan, Feng; Chan, Ching-Yuen; Li, Guijun",ACS Nano,,49

477097,Reply,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the worldwide coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, starting in late 2019. The standard diagnostic methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 are PCR-based genetic assays. Antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic assays are alternative methods of detecting this virus. Rapid diagnosis kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. STUDY DESIGN: Three monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein were used to develop an antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic kit to detect SARS-CoV-2. These assays were evaluated usingã nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected of having COVID-19. RESULTS: These assays detected recombinant SARS-CoV-2â¯N protein at concentrations >0.2â¯ng/mL within 10â¯min after protein loading, but did not detect the N proteins of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 299E (HCoV-229E) and other pathogens causing respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained 1ï½3, 4ï½9, and &#8805; 10 days after symptom onset from COVID-19 patients diagnosed by RT-PCR showed positivity rates of 100 %, >80 %, and <30 %, respectively.

478106,Why indoor spaces are still prime COVID hotspots,2021,"BACKGROUND: As a consequence of global warming, heat waves are expected to become more frequent, more intense, and longer. The elderly and persons with chronic diseases are especially vulnerable to health problems due to heat. This article is devoted to the question of the extent to which the effects of heat waves in Germany are changing over time, and whether preventive health measures are working. METHODS: We use a statistical model to quantify the effect of high mean temperatures on mortality. Within this model, different exposure-response curves for the three temporal intervals 1992-2000, 2001-2010, and 2011-2017 are estimated. Attention is also paid to the delayed effect on mortality of high mean temperatures in the preceding week. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a clear, systematic association of the mean temperature in the current week, as well as the mean temperature in the preceding week, with weekly mortality. This association is more pronounced for higher age groups and decreases over the years under analysis, with the exception of a relatively weak effect of heat in southern Germany in 1992-2000. The strongest effects were related to the heat waves in 1994 and 2003, with approximately 10 200 and 9600 fatalities, respectively. Approximately 7800 fatalities were estimated for the summer of 2006, and 4700 and 5200 for 2010 and 2015, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Germany, as elsewhere, climate change has been causing more frequent, more intense, and longer periods of heat in the summer. The harmful effect of heat on health is reduced by adaptive processes, presumably including successful preventive measures. Such measures should be extended in the future, and perhaps complemented by other measures in order to further diminish the effect of heat on mortality .","An der Heiden, Matthias; Muthers, Stefan; Niemann, Hildegard; Buchholz, Udo; Grabenhenrich, Linus; Matzarakis, Andreas",Dtsch Arztebl Int,,49
482243,Symposium 7,2021,"Until an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is available on a widespread scale, the control of the COVID-19 pandemic is reliant upon effective pandemic control measures. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable on surfaces and in aerosols, means indirect contact transmission can occur and there is an opportunity to reduce transmission using effective disinfectants in public and communal spaces. Virusend (TX-10), a novel disinfectant, has been developed as a highly effective disinfectant against a range of microbial agents. Here we investigate the ability of Virusend to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Using surface and solution inactivation assays, we show that Virusend is able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titre by 4 log10 p.f.u. ml-1 within 1 min of contact. Ensuring disinfectants are highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 is important in eliminating environmental sources of the virus to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Anderson, E. R.; Hughes, G.

Concise, persuasive messaging is crucial, particularly given substantial levels of vaccine hesitancy in the UK. Our aim was to test which types of written information about COVID-19 vaccination, in addition to a statement of efficacy and safety, might increase vaccine acceptance. METHODS: For this single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we aimed to recruit 15 000 adults in the UK, who were quota sampled to be representative. Participants were randomly assigned equally across ten information conditions stratified by level of vaccine acceptance (willing, doubtful, or strongly hesitant). The control information condition comprised the safety and effectiveness statement taken from the UK National Health Service website; the remaining conditions addressed collective benefit, personal benefit, seriousness of the pandemic, and safety concerns. After online provision of vaccination information, participants completed the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (outcome measure; score range 7-35) and the Oxford Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale (mediation measure). The primary outcome was willingness to be vaccinated. Participants were analysed in the groups they were allocated. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN37254291. FINDINGS: From Jan 19 to Feb 5, 2021, 15 014 adults were recruited. Vaccine hesitancy had reduced from 26·9% the previous year to 16·9%, so recruitment was extended to Feb 18 to recruit 3841 additional vaccine-hesitant adults. 12 463 (66·1%) participants were classified as willing, 2932 (15·6%) as doubtful, and 3460 (18·4%) as strongly hesitant (ie, report that they will avoid being vaccinated for as long as possible or will never get vaccinated). Information conditions did not alter COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in those willing or doubtful (adjusted p values >0·70). In those strongly hesitant, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reduced, in comparison to the control condition, by personal benefit information (mean difference -1·49, 95% CI -2·16 to -0·82; adjusted p=0·0015), directly addressing safety concerns about speed of development (-0·91, -1·58 to -0·23; adjusted p=0·0261), and a combination of all information (-0·86, -1·53 to -0·18; adjusted p=0·0313). In those strongly hesitant, provision of personal benefit information reduced hesitancy to a greater extent than provision of information on the collective benefit of not personally getting ill (-0·97, 95% CI -1·64 to -0·30; adjusted p=0·0165) or the collective benefit of not transmitting the virus (-1·01, -1·68 to -0·35; adjusted p=0·0150). Ethnicity and gender were found to moderate information condition outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In the approximately 10% of the population who are strongly hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines, provision of information on personal benefit reduces hesitancy to a greater extent than information on collective benefits.

483711,Classical and alternative disinfection strategies to control the COVID-19 virus in healthcare facilities: a review,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Besides the common symptoms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including fever, shortness of breath, and cough, a ""sudden loss of smell"" has recently been added as a diagnostic symptom. The relationship between paranasal sinus computed tomography (PNS CT) and sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups were selected for the study, the COVID-19 and the control groups. The control group consisted of 40 patients who applied to our clinic with headache and therefore underwent PNS CT. The other group consisted of 40 patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed with sudden loss of smell with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test. Clinical and demographic characteristics, tomography results, and olfactory test scores of patients with COVID-19 loss of smell and control group patients were recorded. The relationship between CT changes in the olfactory cleft and the degree of loss of smell was evaluated. The ""Opacification in the olfactory cleft"" was accepted as a positive CT finding. RESULTS: Comparison of patients with COVID-19 who had a loss of smell and the control group indicated that a significant difference was observed in terms of CT findings (P = .022). When we evaluated the paranasal CTs obtained from our patients with loss of smell, the CT of 13 patients showed pathological findings (P < .05). As the COVID-19 progressed (pneumonia and respiratory failure), the degree of loss of smell increased (P < .05). A statistically significant relationship was found between the CCCRC score and the presence of PNS CT findings (P = .0012). CONCLUSION: The PNS CT findings are significant in patients with COVID-19 with a loss of smell and were significantly associated with the degree of loss of smell. In patients with olfactory loss due to COVID-19, PNS CT can help in diagnosis. However, for this imaging to be diagnostic, a larger patient series is needed.","Yildiz, Erkan; Balci, Aydin; Selendili, Okan; Kuzu, Selçuk",Ear Nose Throat J,,49
484763,Rapid coronavirus tests: a guide for the perplexed,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Vocal fold atrophy and scar can lead to loss of normal superficial lamina propria, negatively affecting the vibratory function of the vocal fold. These changes can lead to dysphonia, vocal fatigue, decreased volume, and altered pitch. Treatment options for these conditions are limited. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) consists of platelets, growth factors, and cytokines derived from the patient's own blood and is believed to activate tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to review the technical aspects of collecting PRP and injecting it into the vocal fold injection - based on our initial experience with this procedure. CASE: A patient with vocal fold scar was identified and enrolled in an ongoing prospective clinical trial study of a series of 4 monthly subepithelial vocal fold PRP injections, which was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient underwent a single injection of autologous PRP into the left vocal fold. There were no adverse events during the study period. Subjective improvement in voice was noted at 1 month after injection with subsequent return to baseline over the next 4 months. Videostroboscopy performed on postinjection day 1 and day 7 and demonstrated no concerning exam changes. Compared to the preinjection baseline, the patient-reported voice-handicap index-10 (VHI-10) and voice catastrophization index were similar at 4 months following injection (20 to 20 and 4 to 3, respectively). Independent perceptual analysis of voice showed improvement at 4 months postinjection, compared to baseline consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice 60 to 44. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report was part of a prospective trial investigating the use of PRP to treat vocal fold atrophy and scar. This work highlights the technical considerations for injecting PRP into the vocal fold. Planned prospective enrollment in this study will help to validate the safety and efficacy of PRP injections.","Bhatt, Neel K; Gao, William Z; Timmons Sund, Lauren; Castro, M Eugenia; O039,; Dell, Karla; Johns, Michael M",J. voice,,49

In addition to addressing wound etiology and treating infection, regular debridement is a key component of wound care with a proven ability to accelerate healing. In this regard, a significant innovation in wound care has been the development of ultrasound debridement technology. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current evidence behind the technology with an emphasis on noncontact low-frequency (NCLF) ultrasound. A number of studies, especially those evaluating NCLF technology, have demonstrated the potential of ultrasound debridement to effectively remove devitalized tissue, control bioburden, alleviate pain, and expedite healing. However, most of the studies are underpowered, involve heterogeneous ulcer types, and demonstrate significant methodological limitations making comparison between studies difficult; there is a paucity of data on cost-effectiveness. Future clinical trials on ultrasound debridement technology must address the design issues prevalent in current studies, and report on clinically relevant endpoints before adoption into best-practice algorithms can be recommended.","Kotronis, Georgios; Vas, Prashanth R J",Int J Low Extrem Wounds,,49

METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases i.e. PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, OVID and Google scholar was performed using a comprehensive search strategy. The searches were current through 31st May 2020. Pooled data from cross-sectional studies was used for meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis was conducted for studies where a meta-analysis was not feasible. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies reporting 2347 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included. Pooled data showed that 11.64% of COVID-19 patients had ocular surface manifestations. Ocular pain (31.2%), discharge (19.2%), redness (10.8%), and follicular conjunctivitis (7.7%) were the main features. 6.9% patients with ocular manifestations had severe pneumonia. Viral RNA was detected from the ocular specimens in 3.5% patients. CONCLUSION: The most common reported ocular presentations of COVID-19 included ocular pain, redness, discharge, and follicular conjunctivitis. A small proportion of patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival/tear samples. The available studies show significant publication bias and heterogeneity. Prospective studies with methodical collection and data reporting are needed for evaluation of ocular involvement in COVID-19.","Aggarwal, Kanika; Agarwal, Aniruddha; Jaiswal, Nishant; Dahiya, Neha; Ahuja, Alka; Mahajan, Sarakshi; Tong, Louis; Duggal, Mona; Singh, Meenu; Agrawal, Rupesh; Gupta, Vishali",PLoS One,,49

The time at which the number of infected individuals starts decreasing cannot be reliably calculated before it is actually attained. A standard SIR model with confinement shows that infection spread is inhibited only above a threshold. Confinement induces a slow-down in the expansion phase that does not guarantee an eventual control of the epidemic. A Bayesian fit to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic in Spain shows that we can infer neither its peaking time nor whether there is a peak at all. The dispersion of possible trajectories grows extremely fast, yielding a short horizon for reliable prediction. As unpredictability is intrinsic, not due to incomplete or wrong data, our study advocates for a scenario of probabilistic forecasting.","Castro, Mario; Ares, Sa'ul; Cuesta, Jos'e A.; Manrubia, Susanna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08842v1.pdf,49

Additionally, we estimate the short-, medium-, and long-cycle connectedness of systemic risk over the study period that covers three financial burst periods: the global financial crisis (GFC), the European sovereign debt crisis (ESDC), and the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, spillover indexes notably rise around well-known financial/geopolitical events over the study period. Finally, we examine the network connectedness of systemic risk spillovers during the GFC, the ESDC, and COVID-19 periods and thereby compare them. Our results highlight an efficient regulatory mechanism to control systemic risk contagion.","Polat, Onur",Borsa Istanbul Review,,49

494703,Pandemic by choice,2020,"Recently the role of metabolic signaling pathways has emerged as playing a critical role in dictating the outcome of T cell responses. The uptake and metabolism of the amino acid glutamine is essential for effector T cell activation. Since the growth and expansion of tumor cells relies on similar anabolic and metabolic requirements, we hypothesized that glutamine blockage might represent a promising strategy to promote allograft survival while inhibit tumor growth. 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) was used as a glutamine antagonist. First, an in vitro study of T cell proliferation was performed to examine the ability of glutamine antagonism to inhibit T cell proliferation. Then we investigated whether DON could prolong allograft survival and inhibit tumor growth by using a fully MHC-mismatched mice full thickness skin transplantation model and a mice TC-1 tumor-bearing model. The proliferation study demonstrated that DON inhibited effector T cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. We found a marked prolonged graft median survival time and significant tumor inhibition for mice that received DON compared to those that received no treatment. These results highlight that targeting glutamine metabolism can promote allograft acceptance in a long tumor-free period.","Lee, Chen-Fang; Cheng, Chih-Hsien; Hung, Hao-Chien; Chan, Kun-Ming; Lee, Wei-Chen",Transpl Immunol,,49

METHODS: The study included 142 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Huoshenshan Hospital from February to March 2020. Nursing measures in the treatment (n = 111) and control (n = 31) groups included integrated management care and usual care. The integrated management model had eight components: WeChat group management, early Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment, emotional nursing, music therapy, observation of tongue coating and pulse, vital Qi strengthening, preventing recurrence after recovery, and an individualized follow-up scheme. The endpoints included clinical outcome, recovery time of clinical symptoms and signs, days of hospital stay, and survival without intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Recovery time from clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and fatigue in the treatment group was shorter than that in the control group. Less time was required to show negative chest computed tomography findings in the treatment group than in the control group (13.0 ± 2.8 vs. 16.7 ± 3.9, p < .025). The lengths of hospital stay in the two groups were 16.4 ± 7.3 days (treatment group) and 24.4 ± 4.8 days (control group) (p < .001). Kaplan-Meier curves for survival without ICU transfer showed statistical difference between the two groups (&#967;2 = 5.427, p = .020). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the integrated management mode can relieve the symptoms of patients faster, shorten hospital stay and disease course, and reduce the rate of ICU transfers.","Chu, Lanfang; Zhang, Yongwen",Jpn J Nurs Sci,,49

Answering this question has fundamental implications not only for understanding the political consequences of polarization, but also for understanding how citizens form preferences. Under most political circumstances, this is a difficult question to answer, but the novel coronavirus pandemic allows us to understand how partisan animus contributes to opinion formation. Using a two-wave panel that spans the outbreak of COVID-19, we find a strong association between citizens' levels of partisan animosity and their attitudes about the pandemic, as well as the actions they take in response to it. This relationship, however, is more muted in areas with severe outbreaks of the disease. Our results make clear that narrowing of issue divides requires not only policy discourse but also addressing affective partisan hostility.","Druckman, James N; Klar, Samara; Krupnikov, Yanna; Levendusky, Matthew; Ryan, John Barry",,,49

501939,New polio vaccine poised to get emergency WHO approval,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic, countries have been mirroring each other's policies to mitigate the spread of the virus. Whether current measures alone will lead to behavioral change such as social distancing, washing hands, and wearing a facemask is not well understood. The objective of this study is to better understand individual variation in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by exploring the influence of beliefs, motivations and policy measures on public health behaviors. We do so by comparing The Netherlands and Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our final sample included 2,637 respondents from The Netherlands and 1,678 from Flanders. The data was nationally representative along three dimensions: age, gender, and household income in both countries. Our key outcome variables of interest were beliefs about policy effectiveness; stated reasons for complying with public rules; and changes in behavior. For control variables, we included a number of measures of how severe the respondent believed Covid-19 to be and a number of negative side effects that the person may have experienced: loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and conflicts with friends and neighbors. Finally, we controlled for socio-demographic factors: age, gender, income (categorical), education (categorical) and the presence of Covid-19 risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, allergies). The dependent variable for each of the estimation models is dichotomous, so we used Probit models to predict the probability of engaging in a given behavior. We found that motivations, beliefs about the effectiveness of measures, and pre-pandemic behavior play an important role. The Dutch were more likely to wash their hands than the Flemish (15.4%, p<0.01), visit family (15.5%, p < .01), run errands (12.0%, p<0.05) or go to large closed spaces such as a shopping mall (21.2%, p<0.01). The Dutch were significantly less likely to wear a mask (87.6%, p<0.01). We also found that beliefs about the virus, psychological effects of the virus, as well as pre-pandemic behavior play a role in adherence to recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that policymakers should consider behavioral motivations specific to their country in their COVID-19 strategies. In addition, the belief that a policy is effective significantly increased the probability of the behavior, so policy measures should be accompanied by public health campaigns to increase adherence.","van den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Atherly, Adam",PLoS One,,49

512755,Reply,2020,"Objectives Vaccination remains the most effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most vaccines use two-dose regimens. In turn, single-dose vaccines also have high potential, since, on the one hand, they simplify the vaccination program, make it more accessible and convenient for more people around the world, and on the other hand, they are better suited for subsequent revaccination. However, there is not enough data on the effectiveness of single-dose vaccine variants against new genetic lines to assess their current potential. It is not clear how much a single dose of immunization protects against the globally dominant delta variant. In this work, we investigated the effectiveness of a single dose vaccine (Sputnik Light, the first component of Sputnik V vaccine) against the Delta variant in Moscow. Methods To assess the effectiveness of one dose of viral vector vaccine based on rAd26 against the delta variant in Moscow, we used data from the Moscow registries of vaccination against COVID-19 and the incidence of COVID-19. The availability of data on the number of seropositive residents of Moscow made it possible to consider the size of the immune layer formed because of a previous COVID-19 disease or vaccination. To calculate the effectiveness, the proportion of COVID-19 cases among those vaccinated with a single dose and the proportion of cases among those who were not vaccinated in July 2021. Results Our data indicate that throughout July 2021, the dominant variant of the coronavirus at the level of 99.5% in Moscow was the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant and its subsidiary lines. Considering the immune layer of 46% allowed us to calculate the effectiveness of a one-shot vaccine against the delta variant in Moscow during the first three months after vaccination at the level of 69.85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.08 to 74.70). In the 18-29-year-old group, the overall vaccine efficacy against the delta variant was 88.61%, in the 18-59 group - 75.28%. Sputnik Light demonstrates higher efficacy against Delta variant than many two-shot vaccines. Conclusion The results indicate a high efficacy of a single immunization first component of Sputnik V vaccine against delta variant among young and middle-aged people (86.2% and 75.28%, respectively), at least during the first 3 months after receiving the one-shot vaccine.","Dolzhikova, Inna; Gushchin, Vladimir; Shcheblyakov, Dmitry; Tsybin, Alexander; Shchetinin, Alexey; Pochtovyi, Andrey; Komissarov, Andrey; Kleymenov, Denis; Kuznetsova, Nadezhda; Tukhvatulin, Amir; Zubkova, Olga; Dzharullaeva, Alina; Kovyrshina, Anna; Lubenets, Nadezhda; Grousova, Daria; Erokhova, Alina; Izhaeva, Fatima; Popova, Olga; Ozharovskaya, Tatiana; Semikhin, Alexander; Tokarskaya, Elizaveta; Shmarov, Maksim; Nikitenko, Natalia; Shidlovskaya, Elena V; Bykonia, Evgeniia; Mazunina, Elena; Divisenko, Elizaveta; Vasilchenko, Lyudmila; Popova, Liubov; Danilenko, Daria; Lioznov, Dmitry; Tkachuk, Artem; Borisevich, Sergei; Naroditsky, Boris; Logunov, Denis; Gintsburg, Alexander",,,49

524264,Material Challenges for Colloidal Quantum Nanostructures in Next Generation Displays,2020-12-24,"INTRODUCTION: Frontline healthcare workers have a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. The use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to prevent this occupational disease. Surgical masks and filtering face piece (FFP) respirators are important parts of this PPE. European standard EN 149 establishes three protection levels for FFP respirators (FFP1, FFP2, FFP3), depending on the particle infiltration degree through their materials, and these, in turn, are based on their filtration effectiveness. The aim of this laboratory test is to determine and quantify the filtration and fit rate of different FFP respirators, singly and in combination with surgical masks, by performing a series of fit tests and consequently, to check whether this combination improves protection levels for healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Several FFP respirators and surgical masks, singly and in combination, were fit tested with a PortaCount Pro + 8038, which fulfills OSHA standards, in a series of tests performed on healthcare workers in seven different breathing situations when taking care on COVID-19 patients, in order to determine and quantify their fit to the workers' face. RESULTS: Wearing a surgical mask together with a highly efficient FFP respirator provided increased respiratory protection. Interestingly, one of these highly efficient FFP models, combined with a surgical mask, achieved a protection factor over 200 (whereas 100 is the minimum required protection factor). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical masks, when used together with a FFP2 respirator, could significant ly improve the degree of fit of all self-filtering face piece by providing greater filtration efficiency and greater user protection from exposure to aerosols.","García Vela, Raquel; Cabanas Valdés, Rosa; Huertas Ríos, Santos; Donat Roca, Rafel; Monné Cuevas, Pol; Moizé Arcone, Luciana; Calvo Sanz, Jordi",Arch Prev Riesgos Labor,,49

In this work, we analyzed the expression of TNF‐α gene in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Serum TNF‐α levels were found to be elevated in all chronic hepatitis C patients including those cases presenting sustained biochemical remission of the disease after interferon therapy. Untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C showed increased TNF‐α messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the liver and mononuclear cells as compared with healthy controls. After completion of treatment with interferon, patients experiencing sustained complete response showed values of TNF‐α mRNA, both in the liver and in peripheral mononuclear cells, within the normal range, significantly lower than patients who did not respond to interferon and than those with complete response who relapsed after interferon withdrawal. Pretreatment values of TNF‐α mRNA were lower in long‐term responders to interferon than in cases who failed to respond to the treatment. Values of TNF‐α mRNA in the liver or in mononuclear cells were higher in specimens with positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA than in those samples where the virus was undetectable. Neither the intensity of the liver damage nor the amount of HCV RNA in serum or in cells showed correlation with the levels of TNF‐α transcripts in peripheral mononuclear cells but it was found that high TNF‐α values were associated with genotype 1b. In conclusion, there is an enhanced expression of TNF‐α in HCV infection. High levels of this cytokine may play a role in the resistance to interferon therapy.","Larrea, E; Garcia, N; Qian, C; Civeira, M P; Prieto, J",Hepatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8591843/,49

593782,Applications of Paper as a support material in biomedical sciences: A Decadal review,2020-04-09,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals around the globe. One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about the radiation damaging the fiber material within the mask, specifically by causing cross-linking of polymers, leading to cracking and degradation during fitting and/or deployment. A set of 3M 8210 and 9105 masks were irradiated using MIT's Co-60 irradiator. Three masks of each type received 0 kiloGray (kGy), 10 kGy and 50 kGy of approximately 1.3 MeV gamma radiation from the circular cobalt sources, at a dose rate of 2.2 kGy per hour. Following this sterilization procedure, the irradiated masks passed a OSHA Gerson Qualitative Fit Test QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) when donned correctly, performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, in a blinded study repeated in triplicate. However, the masks' filtration of 0.3 um particles was significantly degraded, even at 10 kGy. These results suggest against gamma, and possibly all ionizing radiation, as a method of disposable N95 sterilization. Even more importantly, they argue against using the qualitative fit test alone to assess mask integrity.","Cramer, A.; Tian, E.; Yu, S. H.; Galanek, M.; Lamere, E.; Li, J.; Gupta, R.; Short, M.

In this study, we tackle cross-sectional dependence problem and use CADF and CIPS unit root tests in contrast to conventional unit root tests. Moreover, we employ LM bootstrap panel co-integration test. The results of DOLS show that GDP and GDP squares have opposite signs which shows inverted u-shaped hypothesis between GDP growth and carbon emissions. We find an evidence of EKC proposition in case of Asian economies. Tourism has a vital role in increasing environment degradation of Asian economies as magnitude of coefficient is 0.132. Moreover, energy use, urbanization, trade, and financial development have direct and a profound impact on environmental degradation. The empirical results thus point to the fact that tourism, trade openness, and urbanization have contributed to the environmental degradation in the Asian region. Hence, the counties of the region should harness renewable energy sources along with environment-friendly technologies to support the tourism at a sustainable level that may be conducive to economic growth and environmental quality as well.","Nosheen, Misbah; Iqbal, Javed; Khan, Hidayat Ullah",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11759-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398754/,49
594474,Effects of humidity and other factors on the generation and sampling of a coronavirus aerosol,2007-07-25,"Eukaryotic positive-strand RNA [(+)RNA] viruses are intracellular obligate parasites replicate using the membrane-bound replicase complexes that contain multiple viral and host components. To replicate, (+)RNA viruses exploit host resources and modify host metabolism and membrane organization. Phospholipase D (PLD) is a phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing enzyme that catalyzes the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid second messenger that modulates diverse intracellular signaling in various organisms. PA is normally present in small amounts (less than 1% of total phospholipids), but rapidly and transiently accumulates in lipid bilayers in response to different environmental cues such as biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. However, the precise functions of PLD and PA remain unknown. Here, we report the roles of PLD and PA in genomic RNA replication of a plant (+)RNA virus, Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV). We found that RCNMV RNA replication complexes formed in Nicotiana benthamiana contained PLDα and PLDβ. Gene-silencing and pharmacological inhibition approaches showed that PLDs and PLDs-derived PA are required for viral RNA replication. Consistent with this, exogenous application of PA enhanced viral RNA replication in plant cells and plant-derived cell-free extracts. We also found that a viral auxiliary replication protein bound to PA in vitro, and that the amount of PA increased in RCNMV-infected plant leaves. Together, our findings suggest that RCNMV hijacks host PA-producing enzymes to replicate.","Hyodo, Kiwamu; Taniguchi, Takako; Manabe, Yuki; Kaido, Masanori; Mise, Kazuyuki; Sugawara, Tatsuya; Taniguchi, Hisaaki; Okuno, Tetsuro",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26020241/,49

RESULTS: HRV strains were detected in 271 ARTIs cases, 65% of which tested positive for HRV-A, 25% for HRV-B, and 10% for HRV-C. Aside from fever, pharyngeal congestion and headache were the most common clinical symptoms observed in the HRVs infected patients. HRV-A infected patients had a higher percentage of upper respiratory symptoms than patients infected by the two other HRV species. Systemic symptoms such as chilliness and myalgia were more frequent in people infected by HRV-B. The three HRV species exhibited unique infection timing when analyzed monthly.

These include the world‐wide pandemics of racism, COVID‐19 and climate change. This paper argues that all of these swirling pandemics are manifestations of the archetype of the apocalypse, which is constellating now in a very powerful way. Any one of these phenomena could swallow humanity whole as a species. Together they represent a seemingly overwhelming challenge for us to meet over the next century of life on earth. If humanity cannot meet the challenge of these combined negative forces, it could simply perish. A multi‐layered intersecting set of challenges such as this has never yet occurred in human history. We must therefore be very alert to what is going on, and as to how we can consciously mediate these threats, both individually and collectively.

These deny communities of the plausible supply of resources from FS. This paper assesses the perception underpinning the occurrence of nonfaecal matter in FS in Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 400 respondents in four communities in Brong Ahafo and Greater Accra Regions of Ghana, using a structured questionnaire. Data were analysed by using STATA software version 15. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were conducted on all independent variables and statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. The study identified the following as the most perceived frequently disposed nonfaecal matter into FS: sanitary pads and diapers (38.5%), fabrics/rags (23.2%), toilet rolls (20.8%), razor/shaving sticks (10.3%), and others (7.2%). Gender, state of toilet facility (roof or unroofed), presence of container for collecting other types of waste in the toilet room, and state of container in toilet room either covered or uncovered were the factors found to be significantly associated with the disposal of solid waste (SW) into FS at 95% confidence level. The fear of exposing used sanitary materials for rituals, the use of fabric as an alternative to toilet rolls, and the desire to conceal aborted pregnancies from the public were some of the reasons alluded to the disposal acts. Education and awareness campaigns on proper SW disposal practices, appropriate use of toilet facilities, and the resource potentials of FS were found to be the best way forward to discourage indiscriminate disposal of SW into FS.","Quarshie, Ama Mbeaba; Gyasi, Samuel Fosu; Kuranchie, Francis Atta; Awuah, Esi; Darteh, Eugene",J Environ Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/2672491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046071/,49
599843,Cameroon: doubt could mean vaccine doses expire,2021,"BACKGROUND: Consumer wrist-worn wearable activity monitors are widely available, low cost and are able to provide a direct measurement of several markers of physical activity. Despite this, there is limited data on their use in perioperative risk prediction. We explored whether these wearables could accurately approximate metrics (anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake and peak work) derived using formalised cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. METHODS: Patients scheduled for major elective intra-abdominal surgery and undergoing CPET were included. Physical activity levels were estimated through direct measures (step count, floors climbed and total distance travelled) obtained through continuous wear of a wrist worn activity monitor (Garmin Vivosmart HR+) for 7 days prior to surgery and self-report through completion of the short International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Correlations and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis explored the relationships between parameters provided by CPET and physical activity. DEVICE SELECTION: Our choice of consumer wearable device was made to maximise feasibility outcomes for this study. The Garmin Vivosmart HR+ had the longest battery life and best waterproof characteristics of the available low-cost devices. RESULTS: Of 55 patients invited to participate, 49 (mean age 65.3 ± 13.6 years; 32 males) were enrolled; 37 provided complete wearable data for analyses and 36 patients provided full IPAQ data. Floors climbed, total steps and total travelled as measured by the wearable device all showed moderate correlation with CPET parameters of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)) (R = 0.57 (CI 0.29–0.76), R = 0.59 (CI 0.31–0.77) and R = 0.62 (CI 0.35–0.79) respectively), anaerobic threshold (R = 0.37 (CI 0.01–0.64), R = 0.39 (CI 0.04–0.66) and R = 0.42 (CI 0.07–0.68) respectively) and peak work (R = 0.56 (CI 0.27–0.75), R = 0.48 (CI 0.17–0.70) and R = 0.50 (CI 0.2–0.72) respectively). Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis for direct and self-reported measures of 7-day physical activity could accurately approximate the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (V(E)/VCO(2)) and the anaerobic threshold. The area under these curves was 0.89 for V(E)/VCO(2) and 0.91 for the anaerobic threshold. For peak VO(2) and peak work, models fitted using just the wearable data were 0.93 for peak VO(2) and 1.00 for peak work. CONCLUSIONS: Data recorded by the wearable device was able to consistently approximate CPET results, both with and without the addition of patient reported activity measures via IPAQ scores. This highlights the potential utility of wearable devices in formal assessment of physical functioning and suggests they could play a larger role in pre-operative risk assessment.

Importantly, a number of the medications likely to receive significant use can themselves, particularly in combination, be pro-arrhythmic. Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval is primarily caused by inhibition of the hERG potassium channel either directly and/or by impaired channel trafficking. Concurrent use of multiple hERG-blocking drugs may have a synergistic rather than additive effect which, in addition to any pre-existing polypharmacy, critical illness or electrolyte imbalance, may significantly increase the risk of arrhythmia and Torsades de Pointes.

Together these strategies allow widespread infection and increased viral load. Despite the efforts of immune subversion, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection activates innate immune pathways inducing a robust type I/III interferon response, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and recruitment of neutrophils and myeloid cells. This may induce hyperinflammation or alternatively, effectively recruit adaptive immune responses that help clear the infection and prevent reinfection. The dysregulation of the renin‐angiotensin system due to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, together with the activation of type I/III interferon response, and inflammasome response converge to promote free radical production and oxidative stress. This exacerbates tissue damage in the respiratory system but also leads to widespread activation of coagulation pathways leading to thrombosis. Here, we review the current knowledge of the role of the innate immune response following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, much of which is based on the knowledge from SARS‐CoV and other coronaviruses. Understanding how the virus subverts the initial immune response and how an aberrant innate immune response contributes to the respiratory and vascular damage in COVID‐19 may help explain factors that contribute to the variety of clinical manifestations and outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Amor, Sandra; Fernández Blanco, Laura; Baker, David",Clin Exp Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978971/,49

Viral suspensions of 106–107 pfu/TCID50 or sfu were prepared in each of the antiseptic/ disinfectant solutions in the presence of a bovine serum/yeast extract mixture to simulate ‘dirty conditions’. During incubation, aliquots were removed at predetermined timepoints up to 10 min to assess the kinetics of inactivation. Results indicate that all products were effective in inactivating the enveloped viruses herpes simplex virus type 1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1, whilst being ineffective in inactivating human coronavirus, also enveloped, and the non-enveloped viruses. The exception to this was the benzalkonium chloride-based product (Dettol Hospital Concentrate) which was active against the non-enveloped human coxsackie virus. Four antiseptic/disinfectant solutions with chloroxylenol, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide/ chlorhexidme and povidone-iodine were also assessed for antiviral effect against human immunodeficiency virus in the presence of whole human blood. All four solutions proved to be effective within l min despite the cytotoxic nature of the compounds to the detection system.","Wood, A.; Payne, D.",Journal of Hospital Infection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670198900779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9602977/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670198900779,49

During the formation of the coronaviral replication/transcription complex, essential steps include processing of the conserved polyprotein nsp7–10 region by the main protease M(pro) and subsequent complex formation of the released nsp's. Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7–10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2 : 2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold. In conclusion, native MS, opposed to other methods, can expose the processing dynamics of viral polyproteins and the landscape of protein interactions in one set of experiments. Thereby, new insights into protein interactions, essential for generation of viral progeny, were provided, with relevance for development of antivirals.","Krichel, Boris; Falke, Sven; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Redecke, Lars; Uetrecht, Charlotte",Biochem J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32083638/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20200029,49

Considering the high transmissibility of COVID-19, ED may be a concerning consequence for a large segment of the population. AIMS: To (1) summarize existing published evidence for the impact of COVID-19 on the prevalence, severity, treatment, and management of ED; and (2) identify health-related trends in the emerging literature and identify gaps in the existing research literature and make recommendations for future research needs in the area. METHODS: A scoping literature search was conducted on April 27, 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was followed. The literature search was performed in PubMed using the terms: COVID-19, erectile, sexual, and dysfunction. A total of 693 publications were screened for relevance. Studies were appraised for their level of evidence based on study design and the rigor of methodology. RESULTS: The evidence that COVID-19 infection causes or impacts ED is compelling. Four topics emerged regarding the nature of the association between COVID-19 and ED: (1) the biological impact of COVID-19 infection on ED; (2) the mental health impact of COVID-19 on ED; (3) the impact of COVID-19 on the management of ED and access to ED treatment; and (4) health disparities and the impact of COVID-19 on ED. Long-term and well-designed studies are needed to clarify the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on ED. The pandemic exposed several vulnerabilities within worldwide healthcare and social systems. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has a uniquely harmful impact on men's health and erectile function through biological, mental health, and healthcare access mechanisms. As the pandemic wanes, strategies to identify long-term effects and additional health care support may be needed to adequately mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on men's health.","Hsieh, Tung-Chin; Edwards, Natalie C.; Bhattacharyya, Samir K.; Nitschelm, Krista D.; Burnett, Arthur L.",Sex Med Rev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2050052121000779?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sxmr.2021.09.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2050052121000779,49

In the early phases of a new pandemic, identifying the most relevant evidence and quantifying which studies are shared the most can help researchers and policy makers. The aim of this study is to describe and quantify the impact of early scientific production in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. The study consisted of: 1) review of the scientific literature produced in the first 30 days since the first COVID-19 paper was published; 2) analysis of papers' metrics with the construction of a Computed-Impact-Score (CIS) that represents a unifying score over heterogeneous bibliometric indicators. In this study we use metrics and alternative metrics collected into five separate categories. On top of those categories we compute the CIS. Highest CIS papers are further analyzed. Results. 239 papers have been included in the study. The mean of citations, mentions and social media interactions resulted in 1.63, 10 and 1250, respectively. The paper with highest CIS resulted ""Clinical features of patients[...]"" by Chaolin Huang et al., which rated first also in citations and mentions. This is the first paper describing patients affected by the new disease and reporting data that are clearly of great interest to both the scientific community and the general population. Conclusions. The early response of scientific literature during an epidemic does not follow a pre- established pattern. Being able to monitor how communications spread from the scientific world toward the general population using both traditional and alternative metric measures is essential, especially in the early stages of a pandemic.","Golinelli, D.; Nuzzolese, A.

611080,Reply,2020-12-17,"Abstract To test the potential for parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based vectors to provide protection from vaccinia virus (VACV) infection, PIV5 was engineered to express secreted VACV L1R and B5R proteins, two important antigens for neutralization of intracellular mature (IMV) and extracellular enveloped (EEV) virions, respectively. Protection of mice from lethal intranasal VACV challenge required intranasal immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R in a prime-boost protocol, and correlated with low VACV-induced pathology in the respiratory tract and anti-VACV neutralizing antibody. Mice immunized with PIV5-L1R/B5R showed some disease symptoms following VACV challenge such as loss of weight and hunching, but these symptoms were delayed and less severe than with unimmunized control mice. While immunization with PIV5 expressing B5R alone conferred at least some protection, the most effective immunization included the PIV5 vector expressing L1R alone or in combination with PIV5-B5R. PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors elicited protection from VACV challenge even when CD8+ cells were depleted, but not in the case of mice that were defective in B cell production. Mice were protected from VACV challenge out to at least 1.5years after immunization with PIV5-L1R/B5R vectors, and showed significant levels of anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential for PIV5-based vectors to provide long lasting protection against complex human respiratory pathogens such as VACV, but also highlight the need to understand mechanisms for the generation of strong immune responses against poorly immunogenic viral proteins.","Clark, Kimberly M.; Johnson, John B.; Kock, Nancy D.; Mizel, Steven B.; Parks, Griffith D.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211003485; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211003485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21885079/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.08.005,49
611255,The great viral team-up,2020-10-24,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic can no longer be mitigated by nationwide approach of individual nations alone. Given its scale and accelerating expansion COVID-19 behooves a coordinated and simultaneous Whole- of-World approach that galvanizes clear global leadership and solidarity from all governments of the world. Considering an ‘all hands-on deck’ concept, we present a comprehensive list of tools and entities responsible for and enabling them, as well a conceptual framework to achieve the maximum impact. The list is drawn from pandemic mitigation tools developed in response to past outbreaks including influenza, coronaviruses, and Ebola and includes tools to minimize transmission in various settings including person-to-person, crowd, funerals, travel, workplace, and events and gatherings including business, social and religious venues. Included are the roles of individuals, communities, government and other sectors such as school system, health, institutions, and business. While individuals and communities have significant responsibilities to prevent person-to-person transmission, other entities can play a significant role to enable individuals and communities to make use of the tools. Historic and current data indicate the role of political will, whole-of-government approach, and the role of early introduction of mitigation measures. There is also an urgent need to further elucidate the immunologic mechanisms underlying the epidemiological characteristics such as the low disease burden among women, and role of COVID-19 in inducing Kawasaki like syndromes in children. Understanding the role of and development of anti-inflammatory strategies based on our understanding pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL-6) is also critical. Similarly, the role of oxygen therapy as an anti-inflammatory strategy is evident and access to oxygen therapy should be prioritized to avoid the aggravation of COVID-19 infection. We highlight the need for global solidarity to share both mitigation commodities and infrastructure between countries. Given the global reach ofCOVID-19 and potential for repeat waves of outbreaks, we call on all countries and communities to act synergistically and emphasize the need for synchronized pan-global mitigation efforts to minimize everyone's risk, maximize collaboration and to commit to shared progress.","Ebrahim, Shahul H.; Zhuo, Jiatong; Gozzer, Ernesto; Ahmed, Qanta A.; Imtiaz, Rubina; Ahmed, Yusuf; Doumbia, Seydou; Rahman, N.

We performed a comprehensive, systematic literature search for studies published between December 2019 and July 5, 2020 in five databases. The prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes was evaluated through a meta-analysis. Thirty-five articles with 8,170 patients were included, and all the available studies were case series. The pooled odds ratio for the development of severe COVID-19 was 3.21 for patients with CHD (fixed-effects model, 95% CI: 2.58-3.99), 2.27 for patients with hypertension (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-2.90) and 2.34 for patients with diabetes (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-3.05). The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate for the effect of CHD on COVID-19 severity, but was high for the effects of diabetes and hypertension. Funnel plots and Egger’s tests revealed no publication bias in the CHD and hypertension analyses, but suggested publication bias in the diabetes analysis. This bias was corrected using the trim-and-fill method, and was ultimately found to have no effect on the results. Our findings suggest patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes are at greater risk for developing severe COVID-19 than those without these conditions.","Meng, Meng; Zhao, Qianwen; Kumar, Rahul; Bai, Chen; Deng, Yunlei; Wan, Bo",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199670/,49

These restriction factors are constitutively expressed, but triggered upon infection by interferons. Both pre-integration and post-integration events of the HIV-1 life cycle appear to play distinct roles in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which encode antiviral restriction factors. However, HIV-1 counteracts the mechanisms mediated by these restriction factors through its encoded components. Here, we review the recent findings of pathways that lead to the induction of ISGs, and the mechanisms employed by the restriction factors such as IFITMs, APOBEC3s, MX2, and ISG15 in preventing HIV-1 replication. We also reflect on the current understanding of the counter-mechanisms employed by HIV-1 to evade innate immune responses and overcome host restriction factors.

This study is a multi-centre, cross-sectional epidemiological study that uses nationwide data to assess the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and burnout among health care workers managing COVID-19 patients in Cyprus. The study also investigates the mechanism behind the manifestation of these pathologies, as to allow for the design of more effective protective measures. METHODS: Data on the mental health status of the healthcare workers were collected from healthcare professionals from all over the nation, who worked directly with Covid patients. This was done via the use of 64-item, self-administered questionnaire, which was comprised of the DASS21 questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and a number of original questions. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate factors associated with each of the mental health measures. RESULTS: The sample population was comprised of 381 healthcare professionals, out of which 72.7% were nursing staff, 12.9% were medical doctors and 14.4% belonged to other occupations. The prevalence of anxiety, stress and depression among the sample population were 28.6%, 18.11% and 15% respectively. The prevalence of burnout was 12.3%. This was in parallel with several changes in the lives of the healthcare professionals, including; working longer hours, spending time in isolation and being separated from family. DISCUSSION: This study indicates that the mental health of a significant portion of the nation’s workforce is compromised and, therefore, highlights the need for an urgent intervention particularly since many countries, including Cyprus, are suffering a second wave of the pandemic. The identified risk factors should offer guidance for employers aiming to protect their frontline healthcare workers from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kapetanos, Konstantinos; Mazeri, Stella; Constantinou, Despo; Vavlitou, Anna; Karaiskakis, Marios; Kourouzidou, Demetra; Nikolaides, Christoforos; Savvidou, Niki; Katsouris, Savvas; Koliou, Maria",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34648565/,49

METHODS: An S‐I‐R (susceptible‐infectious‐resolved) model is used to estimate the likely benefits of a suppression COVID‐19 response compared to a herd immunity alternative. Direct impacts of the virus are calculated on the basis of sick leave, hospitalizations, and fatalities, while indirect impacts related to response actions are excluded. RESULTS: Preliminary modeling indicates that approximately 1700 vulnerable person deaths are likely to have been prevented over 1 year from adopting a suppression response rather than a herd immunity response, and approximately 4500 hospitalizations. These benefits are valued at around AUD4.7 billion. If a do nothing policy had been adopted, the number of people in need of hospitalization is likely to have overwhelmed the hospital system within 50 days of the virus being introduced. Maximum hospital capacity is unlikely to be reached in either a suppression policy or a herd immunity policy. CONCLUSION: Using early international estimates to represent the negative impact each type of policy response is likely to have on gross state product, results suggest the benefit–cost ratio for the suppression policy is slightly higher than that of the herd immunity policy, but both benefit–cost ratios are less than one.","Cook, David C.; Fraser, Rob W.; McKirdy, Simon J.",Health Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136653/,49
624775,Prenatal maternal distress associates with a blunted cortisol response in rhinovirus-positive infants,2019-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 418,000 people live in care homes in the UK, yet accessible, robust data on care home populations and organisation are lacking. This hampers our ability to plan, allocate resources or prevent risk. Large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in care homes offer a potential solution. The value of detailed data on residents’ demographics, outcomes and contextual information captured in RCTs has yet to be fully realised. Irrespective of the intervention tested, much of the trial data collected overlaps in terms of structured assessments and descriptive information. Given the time and costs required to prospectively collect data in these populations, pooling anonymised RCT data into a structured repository offers benefit; secondary analyses of pooled RCT data can improve understanding of this under-researched population and enhance the future trial design. This protocol describes the creation of a project-specific repository of individual participant data (IPD) from trials conducted in care homes and subsequent expansion into a legacy dataset for wider use, to address the need for accurate, high-quality IPD on this vulnerable population. METHODS: Informed by scoping of relevant literature, the principal investigators of RCTs conducted in adult care homes in the UK since 2010 will be invited to contribute trial IPD. Contributing trialists will form a Steering Committee who will oversee data sharing and remain gatekeepers of their own trial’s data. IPD will be cleaned and standardised in consultation with the Steering Committee for accuracy. Planned analyses include a comparison of pooled IPD with point estimates from administrative sources, to assess generalisability of RCT data to the wider care home population. We will also identify key resident characteristics and outcomes from within the trial repository, which will inform the development of a national minimum dataset for care homes. Following project completion, management will migrate to the Virtual Trials Archives, forming a legacy dataset which will be expanded to include international RCTs, and will be accessible to the wider research community for analyses. DISCUSSION: Analysis of pooled IPD has the potential to inform and direct future practice, research and policy at low cost, enhancing the value of existing data and reducing research waste. We aim to create a permanent archive for care home trial data and welcome the contribution of emerging trial datasets.","Irvine, Lisa; Burton, Jennifer Kirsty; Ali, Myzoon; Quinn, Terence J.; Goodman, Claire",Trials,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05107-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622396/,49

By contrast, RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein antigenic site II humanized monoclonal antibodies, palivizumab and motavizumab, have been shown to reduce RSV-related hospitalization in infants. Immunogenicity and efficacy studies were conducted in cotton rats comparing a recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine with palivizumab and controlled with live RSV virus intranasal immunization and, formalin inactivated RSV vaccine. Active immunization with RSV F nanoparticle vaccine containing an alum adjuvant induced serum levels of palivizumab competing antibody (PCA) greater than passive administration of 15mg/kg palivizumab (human prophylactic dose) in cotton rats and neutralized RSV-A and RSV-B viruses. Immunization prevented detectable RSV replication in the lungs and, unlike passive administration of palivizumab, in the nasal passage of challenged cotton rats. Histology of lung tissues following RSV challenge showed no enhanced disease in the vaccinated groups in contrast to formalin inactivated ‘Lot 100’ vaccine. Passive intramuscular administration of RSV F vaccine-induced immune sera one day prior to challenge of cotton rats reduced viral titers by 2 or more log10 virus per gram of lung and nasal tissue and at doses less than palivizumab. A recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine protected lower and upper respiratory tract against both RSV A and B strain infection and induced polyclonal palivizumab competing antibodies similar to but potentially more broadly protective against RSV than palivizumab.","Raghunandan, Rama; Lu, Hanxin; Zhou, Bin; Xabier, Mimi Guebre; Massare, Michael J.; Flyer, David C.; Fries, Louis F.; Smith, Gale E.; Glenn, Gregory M.",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14012894; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.09.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X14012894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269094/,49

While delivering billions of COVID 19 doses globally addressing vaccine hesitancy will be one of the most significant public health communication efforts ever undertaken. Objective: The goal of this study is to explore predictors of COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy, including sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, risk perception, and experience of discrimination, in a sample of the U.S. population. Design: We used a cross sectional online survey study design. The survey was implemented between Dec 13 and 23, 2020. Setting: The survey was limited to respondents over 18 years of age residing in the USA. Participants: Respondents were individuals belonging to priority groups for vaccine distribution. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Respondents were asked how likely they would be to take a COVID 19 vaccine if offered at no cost within two months. Vaccine hesitancy was measured using a scale ranging from 1 (low hesitancy) to 6 (high hesitancy). Results: Responses were received from 2,650 respondents (response rate 84%) from all 50 states and Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. The majority were in the age category between 25 and 44 years (66%), male (53%), and working in the healthcare sector (61%). Most were White and non-Hispanic (66%) respondents followed by Black non-Hispanic (14%) and Hispanic (8%) respondents. Experience with racial discrimination was a predictor of vaccine hesitancy. Those reporting racial discrimination having 21% increased odds of being at a higher level of hesitancy compared to those who did not report such experience (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 1.01-1.45).

With a priori concepts identified from previous multi-stage models, our framework was developed by analyzing two cases of the introduction of vital signs monitoring systems in hospitals to identify the important stages and influencing factors for healthcare IT pre-adoption.","Yang, Zhenbin; Kankanhalli, Atreyi; Ng, Boon-Yuen; Lim, Justin Tuang Yong",Information & Management,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378720615000087; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720615000087,49

Structural comparison provides insights into protein function and evolution. Here, we review some of the original findings and thoughts that have led to the current established structure-based phylogeny of viruses: starting from the original observation that the major capsid proteins of plant and animal viruses possess similar folds, to the idea that each virus has an innate “self”. This latter idea fueled the conceptualization of the PRD1-adenovirus lineage whose members possess a major capsid protein (innate “self”) with a double jelly roll fold. Based on this approach, long-range viral evolutionary relationships can be detected allowing the virosphere to be classified in four structure-based lineages. However, this process is not without its challenges or limitations. As an example of these hurdles, we finally touch on the difficulty of establishing structural “self” traits for enveloped viruses showcasing the coronaviruses but also the power of structure-based analysis in the understanding of emerging viruses","Ravantti, Janne J.; Martinez-Castillo, Ane; Abrescia, Nicola G.A.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12101146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050291/,49

Virus bioinformatics has become central to virology research, and advances in bioinformatics have led to improved approaches to investigate viral infections and outbreaks, being successfully used to detect, control, and treat infections of humans and animals. This active field of research has attracted approximately 110 experts in virology and bioinformatics/computational biology from Europe and other parts of the world to attend the two-day meeting in Glasgow to increase scientific exchange between laboratory- and computer-based researchers. The meeting was held at the McIntyre Building of the University of Glasgow; a perfect location, as it was originally built to be a place for “rubbing your brains with those of other people”, as Rector Stanley Baldwin described it. The goal of the meeting was to provide a meaningful and interactive scientific environment to promote discussion and collaboration and to inspire and suggest new research directions and questions. The meeting featured eight invited and twelve contributed talks, on the four main topics: (1) systems virology, (2) virus-host interactions and the virome, (3) virus classification and evolution and (4) epidemiology, surveillance and evolution. Further, the meeting featured 34 oral poster presentations, all of which focused on specific areas of virus bioinformatics.

We performed a detailed outbreak analysis of the transmission and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a geriatric ward by combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with epidemiological data. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) from the ward with a nasopharyngeal sample (NPS) positive for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA during the outbreak period. METHODS: Patient data regarding clinical characteristics, exposure and outcome were collected retrospectively from medical records. Stored NPSs from 32 patients and 15 HCWs were selected for WGS and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The median patient age was 84 years and 17 (53%) of 32 were male. Also, 14 patients (44%) died within 30 days of sampling. Viral loads were significantly higher among the deceased. WGS was successful in 28 (88%) of 32 patient samples and 14 (93%) of 15 HCW samples. Moreover, 3 separate viral clades were identified: 1 clade and 2 subclades among both patient and HCW samples. Integrated epidemiological and genetic analyses revealed 6 probable transmission events between patients and supported hospital-acquired COVID-19 among 25 of 32 patients. CONCLUSIONS: WGS provided an insight into the outbreak dynamics and true extent of nosocomial COVID-19. The extensive transmission between patients and HCWs indicated that current IPC measures were insufficient. We recommend increased use of WGS in outbreak investigations to identify otherwise unknown transmission links and to evaluate IPC measures.","Myhrman, Sofia; Olausson, Josefin; Ringlander, Johan; Gustavsson, Linéa; Jakobsson, Hedvig E.; Sansone, Martina; Westin, Johan",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496989/; https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.374,49

In an attempt to understand the evolution of PEDV in the United States and possibly develop a control strategy, we compared the genome sequences of a PEDV strain isolated from an infected piglet against its in vitro adapted version. The original PEDV strain was grown in Vero cells and passed 10 times serially in a MARC145 cell line. The sequence analysis of the native PEDV strain and in vitro passaged virus shows that the cell culture adaptation specifically modifies PEDV spike protein whereas the open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b)-encoded polyprotein, the nucleoprotein, NS3B (ORF3), and membrane and envelope proteins remain unchanged.","Lawrence, Paulraj K.; Bumgardner, Eric; Bey, Russell F.; Stine, Douglas; Bumgarner, Roger E.",Genome Announc,https://doi.org/10.1128/genomea.00503-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926047/,49

The strategy during the second wave was to minimize the restrictions set for children. Children spread influenza and therefore simultaneous influenza and COVID‐19 surges were feared. The aim of this report is to analyze the epidemiology of influenza season 2020–2021 in Finland. Data for this retrospective register‐based study were gathered from the National Infectious Disease Register, all laboratory‐confirmed influenza cases from August 2017 to March 2021 were included. The positive influenza findings were stratified by age, and incidences per 100 000 persons were calculated. Only 41 influenza A and B cases have been reported in this season from August 2020 to March 2021, which adds up to an incidence of 0.9 per 100 000 person‐years. In the three preceding years, the numbers and corresponding incidences from August to March were 12 461 (282 per 100 000 person‐years) in 2019–2020, 15 276 (346 per 100 000 person‐years) in 2018–2019, and 33 659 (761 per 100 000 person‐years) in 2017–2018. Nonpharmaceutical interventions combined with the lockdown measures interrupted the influenza season in Finland in March 2020. Despite looser restrictions, alongside traveling restrictions and facial masks, failing to prevent the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, these restrictions have proved to be effective against seasonal influenza.","Kuitunen, Ilari",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945636/,49

However, due to COVID-19, many mass treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis have been halted with uncertain implications for the programmes. Method: We use mathematical modelling to explore how postponement of MDA and various mitigation strategies affect achievement of the EPHP goal for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. Results: In moderate and some high prevalence settings, the disruption may delay the goal by up to two years. In some high prevalence settings EPHP is not achievable with current strategies, and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal. The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and stage of the programme. Conclusions: Schistosomiasis MDA programmes in medium and high prevalence areas should restart as soon as is feasible, and mitigation strategies may be required in some settings.","KURA, K.; Ayabina, D.; Toor, J.; Hollingsworth, T.

We described changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption after implementation of these restrictions among a small number of participants in a tuberculosis treatment cohort. Method: The timeline follow-back procedure and Fägerstrom test for nicotine dependence was used to collect monthly alcohol and tobacco use information. We report changes in heavy drinking days (HDD), average amount of absolute alcohol (AA) consumed per drinking day, and cigarettes smoked daily during the alcohol and tobacco ban compared to use prior to the ban. Results: Of the 61 participants for whom we have pre-ban and within-ban alcohol use information, 17 (27.9%) reported within-ban alcohol use. On average, participants reported one less HDD per fortnight (interquartile range (IQR): −4, 1), but their amount of AA consumed increased by 37.4 g per drinking occasion (IQR: −65.9 g, 71.0 g). Of 53 participants who reported pre-ban tobacco use, 17 (32.1%) stopped smoking during the ban. The number of participants smoking >10 cigarettes per day decreased from 8 to 1. Conclusions: From these observations, we hypothesize that policies restricting alcohol and tobacco availability seem to enable some individuals to reduce their consumption. However, these appear to have little effect on the volume of AA consumed among individuals with more harmful patterns of drinking in the absence of additional behavior change interventions.","Myers, Bronwyn; Carney, Tara; Rooney, Jennifer; Malatesta, Samantha; White, Laura F.; Parry, Charles D.

However, the long-term success of these medicines is highly dependent on maintaining consistency in quality, safety and efficacy while minimizing any risk of divergence during life-cycle management. In recognition of this need and demand from global manufacturers, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Biological standardization established the WHO 1(st) International standard (IS) for Adalimumab (coded 17/236) in October 2019 with a defined unitage ascribed to each of the individual bioactivities evaluated in the study namely, TNF-α binding, TNF-α neutralization, complement dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. For development of the IS, two candidate standards were manufactured as per WHO recommendations. Analysis of extensive datasets generated by testing of a common set of samples including the candidate standards by multiple stakeholders including regulatory agencies using their own qualified assays in a large international collaborative study showed comparable biological activity for the tested candidates for the different activities. Use of a common standard significantly decreased the variability of bioassays and improved agreement in potency estimates. Data from this study clearly supports the utility of the IS as an important tool for assuring analytical assay performance, for bioassay calibration and validation, for identifying and controlling changes in bioactivity during life-cycle management and for global harmonization of adalimumab products. In addition, in a separate multi-center study which included involvement of hospital and clinical diagnostic laboratories, the suitability of the adalimumab IS for therapeutic drug monitoring assays was examined by analysis of data from testing of a common blind coded panel of adalimumab spiked serum samples representative of the clinical scenario along with the IS and in-house standards in diverse immunoassays/platforms. Both commercially available and in-house assays that are routinely used for assessing adalimumab trough levels were included. Excellent agreement in estimates for adalimumab content in the spiked samples was observed regardless of the standard or the method with inter-laboratory variability also similar regardless of the standard employed. This data, for the first time, provides support for the extended applicability of the IS in assays in use for therapeutic drug monitoring based on the mass content of the IS. The adalimumab IS, in fulfilling clinical demand, can help toward standardizing and harmonizing clinical monitoring assays for informed clinical decisions and/or personalized treatment strategies for better patient outcomes. Collectively, a significant role for the adalimumab IS in assuring the quality, safety and efficacy of adalimumab products globally is envisaged.","Wadhwa, Meenu; Bird, Chris; Atkinson, Eleanor; Cludts, Isabelle; Rigsby, Peter",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936049/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.636420,49

Despite its associated significant morbidity and mortality, there are no definitive cures and no fully preventative measures to combat SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the urgency to identify the pathobiological mechanisms underlying increased risk for and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mounting. One contributing factor, the accumulation of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, is a leading trigger for the activation of nuclear factor-kB and the IRF (interferon regulatory factors), such as IRF7. Activation of these pathways, particularly in the lung and other organs, such as the heart, contributes to a burst of cytokine release, which predisposes to significant tissue damage, loss of function, and mortality. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds damage-associated molecular patterns is expressed in the lung and heart, and in priming organs, such as the blood vessels (in diabetes) and adipose tissue (in obesity), and transduces the pathological signals emitted by damage-associated molecular patterns. It is proposed that damage-associated molecular pattern-RAGE enrichment in these priming tissues, and in the lungs and heart during active infection, contributes to the widespread tissue damage induced by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the RAGE axis might play seminal roles in and be a target for therapeutic intervention in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Roy, Divya; Ramasamy, Ravichandran; Schmidt, Ann Marie",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33327744/; https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.120.315527,49

For a time-sensitive emergency such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS), streamlined workflow times are essential to ensure good clinical outcomes. METHODS: The aim of this single-center, retrospective, observational study was to describe changes in stroke workflow patterns and clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from AIS patients undergoing emergent endovascular treatment (EVT) between 23 January and 8 April 2020 were retrospectively collected and compared with data from patients admitted during a similar period in 2019. The primary outcome was difference in time from symptom onset to recanalization. Secondary outcomes included workflow times, clinical management, discharge outcomes, and health-economic data. RESULTS: In all, 21 AIS patients were admitted for emergent EVT during the 77-day study period, compared with 42 cases in 2019. Median time from symptom onset to recanalization was 132 minutes longer during the pandemic compared with the previous year (672 vs. 540 min, P=0.049). Patients admitted during the pandemic had a higher likelihood of endotracheal intubation (84.6% vs. 42.4%, P<0.05) and a higher incidence of delayed extubation after EVT (69.2% vs. 45.5%, P<0.05). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at hospital discharge was similar in the 2 cohorts, whereas neurointensive care unit stay was longer in patients admitted during the pandemic (10 vs. 7 days, P=0.013) and hospitalization costs were higher (123.9 vs. 95.2 thousand Chinese Yuan, P=0.052). CONCLUSION: Disruptions to medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic has particularly impacted AIS patients undergoing emergent EVT, resulting in increased workflow times.

In the second step, these siRNAs join a multinuclease complex, which degrades the homologous single‐stranded mRNAs. The delivery of siRNA involves viral‐ and non‐viral‐mediated delivery systems; the approaches for chemical modifications have also been developed. It has various therapeutic applications for disorders like cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatic disorders, etc. The present review gives an overview of the applications of siRNA and their potential for treating many hitherto untreatable diseases.","Goyal, Bhoomika R.; Patel, Mayur M.; Soni, Mithil K.; Bhadada, Shraddha V.",Fundam Clin Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709318/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-8206.2009.00694.x,49

648023,Will vaccine immunity last?,2020-12-26,"Several decades after its discovery, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) still displays one of the most successful pathogens in human populations worldwide. The identification and characterization of interactions between cellular and pathogenic components are essential for the development of antiviral treatments. Due to its small-sized genome, HBV highly depends on cellular functions to produce and export progeny particles. Deploying biochemical-silencing methods and molecular interaction studies in HBV-expressing liver cells, we herein identified the cellular ERGIC-53, a high-mannose-specific lectin, and distinct components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export machinery COPII as crucial factors of viral trafficking and egress. Whereas the COPII subunits Sec24A, Sec23B and Sar1 are needed for both viral and subviral HBV particle exit, ERGIC-53 appears as an exclusive element of viral particle propagation, therefore interacting with the N146-glycan of the HBV envelope in a productive manner. Cell-imaging studies pointed to ER-derived, subcellular compartments where HBV assembly initiates. Moreover, our findings provide evidence that HBV exploits the functions of ERGIC-53 and Sec24A after the envelopment of nucleocapsids at these compartments in conjunction with endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) components. These data reveal novel insights into HBV assembly and trafficking, illustrating therapeutic prospects for intervening with the viral life cycle.","Zeyen, Lisa; Döring, Tatjana; Prange, Reinhild",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806600/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9081889,49

Myocarditis and idiopathic cardiomyopathy have been reported in the domestic cat, although a viral etiology has not been demonstrated. Because of the continuing interest in the potential relationship between viral myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, we evaluated hearts from cats with spontaneous, idiopathic cardiomyopathy for viral genomic material within myocytes by polymerase chain reaction, and for the presence of myocarditis by light microscopy. Thirty-one (31) formalin-fixed hearts from domestic cats who died of idiopathic cardiomyopathy were randomly selected from pathology archives. Seventeen (17) formalin-fixed hearts from healthy cats were similarly selected as normal controls. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate myocardial tissue for the presence of viral genome from feline panleukopenia virus, herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Hearts were examined using light microscopy for histologic evidence of myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria. Panleukopenia virus was identified by PCR in 10 of 31 cats with cardiomyopathy but in none of the controls. Neither cardiomyopathic or control cats tested positive by PCR for herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Myocarditis was detected by histologic examination in 18 of 31 cardiomyopathic cats and in none of 17 control cats. Myocarditis and or feline panleukopenia virus genome was detected in felines with idiopathic hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, suggesting a possible role of viral infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in this species.","Meurs, Kathryn M; Fox, Philip R; Magnon, Alexander L; Liu, Si-Kwang; Towbin, Jeffrey A",Cardiovasc Pathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054880700000314; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054880700000314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10867362/,49

649698,Scent of a vaccine,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted consistent inequities in incidence, disease severity, and mortality across racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States (US) and beyond. While similar patterns have been observed with previous viral respiratory pathogens, to date, no systematic review has comprehensively documented these disparities or potential contributing factors. In response, this review aims to synthesize data on racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality due to viral acute respiratory infections (ARI) other than SARS-CoV-2. This review will focus on understanding structural health and social factors to contextualize race and ethnicity driving these disparities in the US. METHODS: We will conduct a systematic review of studies published from January 1, 2002, onward. Our search will include PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO Host-CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to identify relevant articles. We will include studies of any design that describe racial/ethnic disparities associated with viral ARI conducted in the US. Primary outcomes include incidence, disease severity or complication, hospitalization, or death attributed to ARI. Secondary outcomes include uptake of preventive interventions including vaccination, handwashing, social distancing, and wearing masks. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract relevant data. Data characterizing individual-, community-, and structural-level factors associated with these disparities will be abstracted to better understand the underlying structural inequities contributing to racial disparities in ARI. We will assess the methodological quality of all studies and will conduct meta-analyses using random effects models if appropriate. DISCUSSION: Findings from this systematic review will shed light on patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in viral ARI in the United States to support mathematical modeling of epidemic trajectories, intervention impact, and structural drivers of transmission, including structural racism. Moreover, data emerging from this review may reignite pandemic preparedness focused on communities with specific vulnerabilities related to living and working conditions given prevailing structural inequities, thus facilitating improved future pandemic responses to novel or endemic viral respiratory pathogens.

Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission in domestic cats. Cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel cats were introduced. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats. Serology showed that both, principals and sentinels, developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels. The results of this study are critical for understanding the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment.","Gaudreault, Natasha N.; Trujillo, Jessie D.; Carossino, Mariano; Meekins, David A.; Morozov, Igor; Madden, Daniel W.; Indran, Sabarish V.; Bold, Dashzeveg; Balaraman, Velmurugan; Kwon, Taeyong; Artiaga, Bianca Libanori; Cool, Konner; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Ma, Wenjun; Wilson, William C.; Henningson, Jamie; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

663053,Overview of Bat and Wildlife Coronavirus Surveillance in Africa: A Framework for Global Investigations,2021-05-18,"The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic emerged at a time of substantial investment in the United States substance use service infrastructure. A key component of this fiscal investment was funding for training and technical assistance (TA) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to newly configured Technology Transfer Centers (TTCs), including the Addiction TTCs (ATTC Network), Prevention TTCs (PTTC Network), and the Mental Health TTCs (MHTTC Network). SAMHSA charges TTCs with building the capacity of the behavioral health workforce to provide evidence-based interventions via locally and culturally responsive training and TA. This commentary describes how, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, TTCs rapidly adapted to ensure that the behavioral health workforce had continuous access to remote training and technical assistance. TTCs use a conceptual framework that differentiates among three types of technical assistance: basic, targeted, and intensive. We define each of these types of TA and provide case examples to describe novel strategies that the TTCs used to shift an entire continuum of capacity building activities to remote platforms. Examples of innovations include online listening sessions, virtual process walkthroughs, and remote “live” supervision. Ongoing evaluation is needed to determine whether virtual TA delivery is as effective as face-to-face delivery or whether a mix of virtual and face-to-face delivery is optimal. The TTCs will need to carefully balance the benefits and challenges associated with rapid virtualization of TA services to design the ideal hybrid delivery model following the pandemic.","Becker, Sara; Chaple, Michael; Freese, Tom; Hagle, Holly; Henry, Maxine; Koutsenok, Igor; Krom, Laurie; Martin, Rosemarie; Molfenter, Todd; Powell, Kristen; Roget, Nancy; Saunders, Laura; Velez, Isa; Yanez, Ruth",J Subst Abuse Treat,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547220304141?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223379/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108157; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740547220304141,49

It results in immunity for the vaccinated individuals, but it also reduces the infection pressure for unvaccinated people. Thus people may actually escape infection without being vaccinated: the so‐called “herd effect.” We analytically study the relation between the herd effect and the vaccination fraction for the seminal SIR compartmental model, which consists of a set of differential equations describing the time course of an epidemic. We prove that the herd effect is in general convex‐concave in the vaccination fraction and give precise conditions on the epidemic for the convex part to arise. We derive the significant consequences of these structural insights for allocating a limited vaccine stockpile to multiple non‐interacting populations. We identify for each population a unique vaccination fraction that is most efficient per dose of vaccine: our dose‐optimal coverage. We characterize the solution of the vaccine allocation problem and we show the crucial importance of the dose‐optimal coverage. A single dose of vaccine may be a drop in the ocean, but multiple doses together can save a population. To benefit from this, policy makers should select a subset of populations to which the vaccines are allocated. Focusing on a limited number of populations can make a significant difference, whereas allocating equally to all populations would be substantially less effective.","Duijzer, Lotty E.; van Jaarsveld, Willem L.; Wallinga, Jacco; Dekker, Rommert",Prod Oper Manag,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327917/,49

The EBOV glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral entry into host cells. For this, GP depends on priming by the pH-dependent endolysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and, to a lesser degree, cathepsin L (CatL), at least in most cell culture systems. However, there is limited information on whether and how EBOV-GP can acquire resistance to CatB/L inhibitors. Here, we addressed this question using replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus bearing EBOV-GP. Five passages of this virus in the presence of the CatB/CatL inhibitor MDL28170 were sufficient to select resistant viral variants and sequencing revealed that all GP sequences contained a V37A mutation, which, in the context of native GP, is located in the base of the GP surface unit. In addition, some GP sequences harbored mutation S195R in the receptor-binding domain. Finally, mutational analysis demonstrated that V37A but not S195R conferred resistance against MDL28170 and other CatB/CatL inhibitors. Collectively, a single amino acid substitution in GP is sufficient to confer resistance against CatB/CatL inhibitors, suggesting that usage of CatB/CatL inhibitors for antiviral therapy may rapidly select for resistant viral variants.","Hoffmann, Markus; Kaufmann, Svenja Victoria; Fischer, Carina; Maurer, Wiebke; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8040192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618932/,49

These compounds inhibited viral glycoprotein interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Based on this property, we evaluated their antiviral efficacy against several different viruses known to employ GAGs for host cell entry. RESULTS: Extensive analysis of the tannins’ mechanism of action was performed on a panel of viruses during the attachment and entry steps of infection. Virus-specific binding assays and the analysis of viral spread during treatment with these compounds were also conducted. CHLA and PUG were effective in abrogating infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), measles virus (MV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), at μM concentrations and in dose-dependent manners without significant cytotoxicity. Moreover, the natural compounds inhibited viral attachment, penetration, and spread, to different degrees for each virus. Specifically, the tannins blocked all these steps of infection for HCMV, HCV, and MV, but had little effect on the post-fusion spread of DENV and RSV, which could suggest intriguing differences in the roles of GAG-interactions for these viruses. CONCLUSIONS: CHLA and PUG may be of value as broad-spectrum antivirals for limiting emerging/recurring viruses known to engage host cell GAGs for entry. Further studies testing the efficacy of these tannins in vivo against certain viruses are justified.","Lin, Liang-Tzung; Chen, Ting-Ying; Lin, Song-Chow; Chung, Chueh-Yao; Lin, Ta-Chen; Wang, Guey-Horng; Anderson, Robert; Lin, Chun-Ching; Richardson, Christopher D",BMC Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23924316/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-13-187,49

STUDY DESIGN We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from April 2019 through February 2021, enrolling participants undergoing osmotic dilator (Dilapan®) placement for a planned, next-day D&E. Participants took mifepristone 200 mg or placebo orally 18-24 hours before dilator placement. We used a gestational age-based protocol for minimum number of dilators. Our primary outcome was the proportion of participants for whom two or more additional dilators could be placed compared to the minimum gestational age-based standard. We secondarily evaluated cervical dilation after dilator removal in the operating room, subjective procedure ease, and complication rates (cervical laceration, uterine perforation, blood transfusion, infection, hospitalization, or extramural delivery). RESULTS Of the planned 66 participants, we enrolled 44 (stopped due to coronavirus disease 2019-related obstacles), and 41 (19 mifepristone; 22 placebo) completed the study. We placed two or more additional dilators compared to standard in seven (36.8%) and three (13.6%) participants after mifepristone and placebo, respectively (p=0.14). We measured greater median initial cervical dilation in the mifepristone (3.2 cm[2.6-3.6]) compared to placebo (2.6 cm[2.2-3.0]) group, p=0.03. Surgeon's perception of procedure being ""easy"" (8/19[42.1] vs. 9/22[40.9], respectively, p=1.00) and complication rate (3/19[15.8%] vs. 3/22[13.6], respectively, p=1.00) did not differ. CONCLUSION Our underpowered study did not demonstrate a difference in cervical dilator placement, but mifepristone 18-24 hours prior to dilators increases cervical dilation without increasing complications. IMPLICATIONS Mifepristone 18-24 hours prior to cervical dilator placement may be a useful adjunct to cervical dilators based on increased cervical dilation at time of procedure; however, logistical barriers, such as an additional visit, may preclude routine adoption without definite clinical benefit.","Uhm, Suji; Mastey, Namrata; Baker, Courtney C; Chen, Melissa J; Matulich, Melissa C; Hou, Melody Y; Melo, Juliana; Wilson, Susan F; Creinin, Mitchell D",Contraception,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464634/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2021.08.013,49

Stringent physical distancing recommendations and shelter-in-place were first introduced in the hardest-hit provinces, and by March, these recommendations were uniform throughout the country. In the presence of an evolving and deadly pandemic, we sought to investigate the impact of this pandemic on individual well-being and prevention practices among Chinese urban residents. From March 2-11, 2020, 4,607 individuals were recruited from 11 provinces with varying numbers of COVID-19 casers using the social networking app WeChat to complete a brief, anonymous, online survey. The analytical sample was restricted to 2,551 urban residents. Standardized scales measured generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the primary outcome. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify correlates of GAD alongside assessment of community practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, recommended public health practices significantly (p <0.001) increased, including wearing facial mask, practicing physical distancing, handwashing, decreased public spitting, and going outside in urban communities. Overall, 40.3% of participants met screening criteria for GAD and 49.3%, 62.6%, and 55.4% reported that their work, social life, and family life were interrupted by anxious feelings, respectively. Independent correlates of having anxiety symptoms included being a healthcare provider (aOR=1.58, p <0.01), living in regions with a higher density of COVID-19 cases (aOR=2.13, p <0.01), having completed college (aOR=1.38, p =0.03), meeting screening criteria for depression (aOR=6.03, p <0.01) and poorer perceived health status (aOR=1.54, p <0.01).

The data were collected during the periods of Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) from October 11 to December 31, 2020. Data collection was completed through an online questionnaire survey conducted among a sample of 432 enterprises from four industrial sectors, namely services, retail, manufacturing, and tourism, in all states in Malaysia. The sample was selected using cluster and systematic random sampling. The questionnaire asked respondents to state whether they used the Internet, computers, phones, web sites, e-payment, and e-commerce to complete their activities relating to finance, production and operations, human resource management, and marketing. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulation. The data show the extent of digital adoption by Malaysian enterprises during the pandemic in comparison to the situation before the pandemic. The data may be of use to other similar researchers as comparison and to policy makers as guides in devising related policies.","Muhamad, Suriyani; Kusairi, Suhal; Man, Mustafa; Majid, Nur Fatma Hasni; Wan Kassim, Wan Zulkifli",Data Brief,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352340921004819; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.107197; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921004819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150965/,49

The coding sequence of gene 1 is divided into two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that overlap by 43 nucleotides. In the region of the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap, the genomic RNA displays two elements that are known to mediate (-1) ribosomal frameshifting. These are the slippery sequence, UUUAAAC, and a 3' pseudoknot structure. By introducing site-specific mutations into synthetic mRNAs, we have analysed the predicted structure of the HCV 229E pseudoknot and shown that besides the well-known stem structures, S1 and S2, a third stem structure, S3, is required for a high frequency of frameshifting. The requirement for an S3 stem is independent of the length of loop 2.","Herold, J; Siddell, S G",Nucleic acids research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8290341/,49
681995,Does wearing masks offer protection against viruses?,2020-08-08,"Initial efforts to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 relied on intensive social distancing measures such as school and workplace closures, shelter-in-place orders, and prohibitions on the gathering of people. Other non-pharmaceutical interventions for suppressing transmission include active case finding, contact tracing, quarantine, immunity or health certification, and a wide range of personal protective measures. Here we investigate the potential effectiveness of these alternative approaches to suppression. We introduce a conceptual framework represented by two mathematical models that differ in strategy. We find both strategies may be effective, although both require extensive testing and work within a relatively narrow range of conditions. Generalized protective measures such as wearing face masks, improved hygiene, and local reductions in density are found to significantly increase the effectiveness of targeted interventions.","Drake, John M.; Rohani, Pej; Dahlin, Kyle; Handel, Andreas",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766603/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165159; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.30.20165159v1?rss=1,49

This study aims to evaluate incidence, risk factors and case-fatality rate of AKI in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed the health medical records of 307 consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the University Hospital of Modena, Italy. RESULTS: AKI was diagnosed in 69 out of 307 (22.4%) COVID-19 patients. Stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI accounted for 57.9%, 24.6% and 17.3%, respectively. AKI patients had a mean age of 74.7 ± 9.9 years. These patients showed higher serum levels of the main markers of inflammation and higher rate of severe pneumonia than non-AKI patients. Kidney injury was associated with a higher rate of urinary abnormalities including proteinuria (0.44 ± 0.85 vs 0.18 ± 0.29 mg/mg; P = < 0.0001) and microscopic hematuria (P = 0.032) compared to non-AKI patients. Hemodialysis was performed in 7.2% of the subjects and 33.3% of the survivors did not recover kidney function after AKI. Risk factors for kidney injury were age, male sex, CKD and higher non-renal SOFA score. Patients with AKI had a mortality rate of 56.5%. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that COVID-19-associated AKI was independently associated with in-hospital death (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.82; CI 95%, 1.36–17.08) compared to non-AKI patients. CONCLUSION: AKI was a common and harmful consequence of COVID-19. It manifested with urinary abnormalities (proteinuria, microscopic hematuria) and conferred an increased risk for death. Given the well-known short-term sequelae of AKI, prevention of kidney injury is imperative in this vulnerable cohort of patients.

684350,The coronavirus outbreak could make it quicker and easier to trial drugs,2020,"Patients with COVID-19 have revealed a massive outbreak around the world, leading to widespread concerns in global scope. Figuring out the transmission route of COVID-19 is necessary to control further spread. We analyzed the data of 43 patients in Baodi Department Store (China) to supplement the transmission route and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in a cluster outbreak. Incubation median was estimated to endure 5.95 days (2–13 days). Almost 76.3% of patients sought medical attention immediately uponillness onset. The median period ofillness onsetto hospitalization and confirmation were 3.96 days (0–14) and 5.58 days (1–21), respectively. Patients with different cluster case could demonstrate unique epidemiological characteristics due to the particularity of outbreak sites. SRAS-CoV-2 can be released into the surrounding air through patient’s respiratory tract activities, and can exist for a long time for long-distance transportation. SRAS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in aerosol in different sites, including isolation ward, general ward, outdoor, toilet, hallway, and crowded public area. Environmental factors influencing were analyzed and indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 transportation in aerosol was dependent on temperature, air humidity, ventilation rate and inactivating chemicals (ozone) content. As for the infection route of case numbers 2 to 6, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 23, we believe that aerosol transmission played a significant role in analyzing their exposure history and environmental conditions in Baodi Department Store. Aerosol transmission could occur in some cluster cases when the environmental factors are suitable, and it is an indispensable route of COVID-19 spread.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients’ intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. METHODS: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. MEASUREMENTS: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. MAIN RESULTS: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. CONCLUSION: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early. The model may be the basis to simulate stochastic models for bed occupation in intensive care units under different casemix scenarios.","Henzi, Alexander; Kleger, Gian-Reto; Hilty, Matthias P.; Wendel Garcia, Pedro D.; Ziegel, Johanna F.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606773/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247265,49

Several pharmaceutical companies made significant progress in developing effective vaccines against the Covid-19 virus that has claimed the lives of more than a million people over the world. On the other hand, there is growing evidence of re-infection by the virus, which can cause further outbreaks. In this paper, we apply statistical physics tools to examine the vaccination rate required to control the pandemic for three different vaccine efficiency scenarios. Also, we study the effect of temporal restrictions/reliefs on the pandemic's outbreak, assuming that re-infection is possible. When examining the efficiency of the vaccination rate of the general population in preventing an additional outbreak of the disease, we find that a high vaccination rate (where at least 0.3% of the population is vaccinated daily, which is equivalent to ~ 1 million vaccine doses in the United States daily) is required to gain control over the spread of the virus without further restrictions. Due to feasible limitations on the vaccination rate, the vaccination process should be accompanied by the prevailing restrictions until most of the population is vaccinated.","De-Leon, Hilla; Pederiva, Francesco",Physical review.
