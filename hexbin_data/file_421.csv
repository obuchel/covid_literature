Early setbacks with complex rotameric amide mixtures, provided the ideal environment for the discovery of the Oxa-Shono reaction-Osp 2 -Csp 3 bond cleavage of esters-providing two useful products in one-step: aldehyde selective oxidation level products and a mild de-esterification method to afford carboxylic acids in the process. The development of the Oxa-Shono reaction provided the impetus for the discovery of other electrically propelled-Nsp 2 -Csp 2 and Nsp 2 -Csp 3 -bond breaking reactions in bioactive amide and sulfonamide systems. Understanding the voltammetric behaviour of the molecule under study, switching between controlled current- or controlled potential- electrolysis, and restricting electron flow (the reagent), affords exquisite control over the reaction outcomes in batch and flow. Importantly, this bio-inspired advance in electrosynthetic dealkylation chemistry mimics the metabolic outcomes observed in nature.","Jones, Alan M",Chemical record,421,27

However, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying social behavior is elusive. Integrating the seemingly different fields of robotics and preclinical research could bring new insight on social behavior. Toward this aim, we established ""behavioral teleporting"" as an experimental solution to independently manipulate multiple factors underpinning social interactions. Behavioral teleporting consists of real-time transfer of the complete ethogram of a live zebrafish onto a remotely-located robotic replica. Through parallel and simultaneous behavioral teleporting, we studied the interaction between two live fish swimming in remotely-located tanks: each live fish interacted with an inanimate robot that mirrored the behavior of the other fish, and the morphology of each robot was independently tailored. Our results indicate that behavioral teleporting can preserve natural interaction between two live animals, while allowing fine control over morphological features that modulate social behavior.","Karakaya, Mert; Macrì, Simone; Porfiri, Maurizio",iScience,421,1

The effect of caffeine on preterm neonatal renal regional saturation of oxygen (RrSO2) is unknown. METHODS RrSO2 was recorded continuously in neonates < 32 weeks' gestation until 7 days of age with INVOS™ neonatal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors. Baseline RrSO2 values were established by averaging the saturations in the 20 min prior to caffeine administration. Subgroup analysis was performed based on pre-caffeine RrSO2 averages. Change in RrSO2 was recorded at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 h after maintenance caffeine administration. RESULTS Of 35 eligible neonates, 31 (median gestational age 28.4 weeks) received 156 caffeine doses (median 8 mg/kg). Analysis of combined doses showed no significant changes in RrSO2 after caffeine administration at any time. However, neonates with baseline 20-29.9% had significant increases from 1 to 12 h (range of increase 5.9-13.9%), and those with baseline 30-39.9 had significant increases at 1 h (8.06%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Maintenance caffeine dosing increased RrSO2 in neonates with low RrSO2 in the first week. Further research is needed to determine the effect of loading doses of caffeine and if increases in RrSO2 correlate with improved clinical kidney outcomes. IMPACT Caffeine administration is associated with increased renal tissue oxygenation in preterm neonates with low baseline values under 40%. The most significant renal tissue oxygenation changes occur in the first 3 h after IV caffeine administration. With recent studies suggesting low RrSO2 values in preterm neonates are associated with AKI, caffeine should be studied as a potential therapeutic for this common and complex morbidity in preterm neonates.","Harer, Matthew W; Rothwell, Amy C; Richard, Luke J; Adegboro, Claudette O; McAdams, Ryan M",Pediatric research,421,25

In an attempt to enhance the adsorption capacity of toxic chromium on the prepared modified biopolymer, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles have been loaded on the modified adsorbent to form the magnetite adsorbent (Fe3O4@CTS-Nap). The adsorption mechanism of both adsorbents is explored by batch experiments, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, XRD, VSM, and EDS. The optimum adsorption is achieved at pH 1.5 for CTS-Nap and 1.0 for Fe3O4@CTS-Nap. Pseudo second order illustrated the best description for the adsorption process with correlation coefficient R2 = 0.999 and the film diffusion or chemisorption is the rate-limiting step. The equilibrium data is analyzed using five isotherm models, the experimental data agreed well with the Freundlich model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 78.12 mg g-1 and 57.14 mg g-1 for CTS-Nap and Fe3O4@CTS-Nap, respectively. However, this unexpected result revealed that the presence of magnetic nanoparticles does not always enhance the adsorption process and many other factors could control the adsorption process. Generally, these outcomes revealed that the unmagnetite modified adsorbent CTS-Nap have practical greater influence on wastewater treatment management rather than the magnetic modified chitosan Fe3O4@CTS-Nap.","Khalil, Tarek E; Elhusseiny, Amel F; Ibrahim, Nagwa M; El-Dissouky, Ali",International journal of biological macromolecules,421,1

METHODS Retrospective study of dogs in which thoracoscopic pericardial window was performed using a three-cannula technique. Surgery time, complications, postoperative management, area of resected pericardium, histopathology results and outcome were evaluated. RESULTS Diagnoses included dogs with idiopathic pericardial effusion (n = 10), cardiac mass (n = 4) and mesothelioma (n = 1). One case required conversion to sternotomy. Median thoracoscopic surgery time was 52 · 5 (range, 45-80) minutes. Complications occurred in four (26%) cases. Median time to discharge was one (range, 1-6) day. Of dogs with idiopathic pericardial effusion, one is alive at 150 days, one was lost to follow-up at 180 days while eight were euthanased of which five were for unrelated reasons. All dogs with neoplastic causes died or were euthanased because of their illness. Median survival time for dogs with idiopathic pericardial effusion (635 days; range, 70-1165) was significantly longer than that for dogs with neoplasia (30 days; range, 1-107). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Thoracoscopic pericardial window is of low morbidity with short surgery and hospitalisation times. It provides good long-term control of idiopathic pericardial effusion but short-term palliation of clinical signs in dogs with neoplastic disease.","Atencia, S; Doyle, R S; Whitley, N T",The Journal of small animal practice,421,20

The novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus which was the causative agent of this epidemic raised the possibility of triggering a large-scale influenza pandemic worldwide. It seemed likely that fast molecular detection assays specific for this virus would be in great demand. Here, we report a one-step reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid detection of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of H7N9 virus, the minimum detection limit of which was evaluated using in vitro RNA transcription templates. In total, 135 samples from clinical specimens (from either patients or poultry) were tested using this method in comparison with the real-time PCR recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Our results showed that (i) RT-LAMP-based trials can be completed in approximately 12 to 23 min and (ii) the detection limit for the H7 gene is around 10 copies per reaction, similar to that of the real-time PCR, whereas the detection limit for its counterpart the N9 gene is 5 copies per reaction, a 100-fold-higher sensitivity than the WHO-recommended method. Indeed, this excellent performance of our method was also validated by the results for a series of clinical specimens. Therefore, we believe that the simple, fast, and sensitive method of RT-LAMP might be widely applied for detection of H7N9 infections and may play a role in prevention of an influenza pandemic.","Zhang, Jinhai; Feng, Youjun; Hu, Dan; Lv, Heng; Zhu, Jing; Cao, Min; Zheng, Feng; Zhu, Jin; Gong, Xiufang; Hao, Lina; Srinivas, Swaminath; Ren, Hao; Qi, Zhongtian; Li, Bingjun; Wang, Changjun",Journal of clinical microbiology,421,28

Here, we highlight the link between OAS and the germinal center reaction (GCR), a process unique to activated B cells undergoing somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. It is the powerful response of activated memory B cells and the accompanying GCR that establish the foundations of OAS. We apply these concepts to the current COVID-19 pandemic and put forth several possible scenarios whereby OAS may result in either beneficial or harmful outcomes depending, hypothetically, on prior exposure to antigens shared between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) that include betacoronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) and alphacoronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) (E.

Less well studied are the similar acts of protest that occurred during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, when residents, business owners, clergy, and even local politicians grew increasingly restless by the ongoing public health measures, defied public health edicts, and agitated to have them rescinded. We explore several of the themes that emerged during the late fall of 1918 and conclude that, although the nation seems to be following the same path as it did in 1918, the motivations for pushback to the 2020 pandemic are decidedly more political than they were a century ago.

In our studies, we found that these widely used techniques had several technical limitations that have precluded a complete picture of antigen trafficking or retention across lymph node cell types. To address these limitations, we developed a 'molecular tracking device' to follow the distribution, acquisition, and retention of antigen in the lymph node. Utilizing an antigen conjugated to a nuclease-resistant DNA tag, acting as a combined antigen-adjuvant conjugate, and single-cell mRNA sequencing we quantified antigen abundance in lymph node. Variable antigen levels enabled the identification of caveolar endocytosis as a mechanism of antigen acquisition or retention in lymphatic endothelial cells. Thus, these molecular tracking devices enable new approaches to study dynamic tissue dissemination of antigen-adjuvant conjugates and identify new mechanisms of antigen acquisition and retention at cellular resolution in vivo.","Walsh, Shannon M; Sheridan, Ryan M; Lucas, Erin D; Doan, Thu A; Ware, Brian C; Schafer, Johnathon; Fu, Rui; Burchill, Matthew A; Hesselberth, Jay R; Tamburini, Beth Ann Jiron",eLife,421,1

All the data from discharge notes were collected between March 15th and June 15th of 2020 (n=59), and in the homologous period of the previous year (n=178). The referral after evaluation (primary care, child and adolescent psychiatry consultation, inpatient unit) was considered a measure of severity.ResultsThe demographic variables (sex, age) were homogeneous between the two groups (p ≥ 0,05). 17,4% (n=31) of the sample from 2019, and 16,9% (n=10) of the sample of 2020 had suicidal ideation, which was not statistically different between groups (p=1,000). The referral, after evaluation between groups were also not statistically different (p=0,186).ConclusionsEven though the proportion of patients with suicidal ideation was homogenous during the two periods, the total number of patients evaluated in the emergency room were lower during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic. We assume that the population had fear of seeking help in hospital facilities, but we also believe that the pause on school burdens and the reconnection between some families could have function as protective factors.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Cordeiro, F.; Santos, V.; Cartaxo, T.",European Psychiatry,421,5

Three isolates could be serially propagated in turkey embryos inoculated by the amniotic route with clarified intestinal contents. Purification and concentration of viral particles contained in intestinal contents of infected embryos were achieved by precipitation with polyethylene glycol and ultracentrifugation on sucrose density gradients. Three particle types were demonstrated: intact virions with a density of 1.18 to 1.20 g/ml and incomplete particles with densities of 1.14 and 1.24 g/ml. Hemagglutination of rabbit and guinea pig erythrocytes was demonstrated with the intact viral particles; the hemagglutinin was not dependent on incubation temperature. All the isolates were antigenically related, as shown by hemagglutination-inhibition. The turkey coronaviruses did not cross-react with antisera against coronaviruses of avian infectious bronchitis, porcine transmissible enteritis, bovine neonatal calf diarrhea, or mouse hepatitis.

Secondly, IFN-alpha/beta has been shown to act as a differentiation/maturation factor for DCs.

Most cases present, after an incubation of 2 to 11 days, with fever and chills, which are followed by dry cough and dyspnea before the onset of respiratory failure. The management of SARS is controversial, largely due to the lack of data from controlled trials, which were logistically impossible to design or execute at the time of the overwhelming outbreak between March and June 2003. The use of an antiviral is logical although there is no effective agent against SARS-CoV, with the widespread use of ribavirin in 2003 attracting considerable scepticism. The use of ribavirin as a monotherapy in SARS is not recommended. Retrospective data suggest that administration of the anti-HIV drug Kaletra in combination with ribavirin could reduce mortality and incidence of respiratory failure. The use of corticosteroid was based on the similarity between SARS and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Corticosteroid use is considered important in subsets of patients with SARS.

We present the variation of image findings of a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. DESCRIPTION:we present the case of a 56-year-old male patient who required initial hospitalization of 14 days because of symptoms secondary to multilobar severe pneumonia due to SARS-COV-2 infection with initial tomographic findings of classic pattern given by ground glass opacities of subpleural distribution predominantly in the lower lobes. The patient was discharged with low flow oxygen supplementation and attended the pulmonology consultation a month later reporting improvement in dyspnea with medical research council score grade 1 and complete withdrawal of oxygen support. A control chest computed tomography was taken 6 weeks since initial evaluation reporting subpleural bullae of recent appearance in the upper and lower right lobe with diameters of up to 80 mm. It was also described a small residual laminar pneumothorax adjacent to the lingula with pleural effusion with apparent septae. Given these findings, an intervention by thoracic surgery was requested who decided to schedule a surgical procedure and performed a new control image corresponding to 8 weeks from the initial one with findings of complete and spontaneous resolution of the pneumothorax as well as the pleural effusion although persistence of the bullas. It was decided there was not required further interventions and patient was discharged from follow-up.DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV2 infection manifests itself in different patterns of lung damage and can have long term pulmonary sequelae that are only identified with judicious and strict follow-up during the first months after infection. Nevertheless, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) has recommended the first image follow-up to be preformed after 3 months of the initial symptoms because of the high incidence of image alterations in that period of time and lesser probability of occult malignancy. This case described a rare presentation of lung damage with equally spontaneous resolution of the complications confirming the timeframe proposed by the BTS.","Espinal Martínez, A.; Enciso, L.

The outbreak currently includes over 3.7 million cases and 260,000 fatalities. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 encodes for a papain-like protease (PLpro) that is likely responsible for cleavage of the coronavirus (CoV) viral polypeptide. The PLpro is also responsible for suppression of host innate immune responses by virtue of its ability to reverse host ubiquitination and ISGylation events. Here, the biochemical activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro against ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) substrates is evaluated, revealing that the protease has a marked reduction in its ability to process K48 linked Ub substrates compared to its counterpart in SARS-CoV.

A prospective study using psychophysical testing,21.040026,10.447135,2021,"Background: Orthopedic surgery is currently the least diverse field in medicine. COVID-19 necessitated a virtual rotation and interview process for orthopedic residency applications in 2020. Given the pressing need to address disparities within the field, any change in the application process should be examined with regard to the potential effects it could have on the diversity of trainees in orthopedic surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of virtual rotations and interviews on the demographic distribution of applicants to orthopedic surgery residency. Methods: A retrospective review of orthopedic surgery residency applicants was performed comparing the 2018 and 2020 application cycle. Self-reported ethnicity on Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) forms was recorded for all applicants who met prescreening criteria, were invited to interview and who completed interviews. The proportion of underrepresented minority (URM) applicants was compared between these two cohorts. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2018 and 2020 application cohorts in terms of number or proportion of URM applicants that met initial screening criteria (p=0.7598), female applicants that met initial screening criteria (p=0.3106), URM applicants who were invited to interview (p=0.6647), or female applicants who were invited to interview (p=0.63). Overall, applicants in the 2018 cycle were 2.38 times more likely to be invited to interview (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.6886-3.3623, p<0.0001) and applicants who were invited to interview were 20.96 times more likely to interview in the 2020 cycle than in the 2018 cycle (OR 20.96, 95% CI 4.89-90.09, p<0.0001). Conclusion: The proportion of URMs applying to orthopedic surgery residency was not significantly different after transitioning to a virtual rotation and interview platform at the single institution studied. Applicants were 2.38 times more likely to be invited to interview in 2018 and were 20.96 times more likely to attend the interview in 2020. Level of Evidence: III.","Caldwell, L. S.; Lawler, E.

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Besides, it investigates the likelihood of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from pregnant women to their neonates. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in three medical centers during the period from March to November 2020. Data were collected from the available medical records in the respective hospitals using a standardized questionnaire on maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes. All pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection across the three hospitals and their neonates were eligible to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics were presented as a median and interquartile range (IQR) or frequencies and percentages as appropriate using SPSS 24.0 software. RESULTS: This study has identified a total of 288 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection over the study period of a median age of 30 years and median GA at diagnosis 38 weeks (IQR: 39 -33) as well as 27% of them were obese (n=78). The majority of pregnant women were symptomatic with cough (n=92, 31.9%) being the most frequent COVID-19 symptom followed by fever and dyspnea (n=36, 12.5%). Two-hundred and four pregnant delivered (70.84%) and caesarean sections were prevalent among 35.8% of them. The most common adverse pregnancy outcome was premature (n=31, 15.5%), followed by fetal distress (n=13, 6.5%), preeclampsia (n=4, 2.0%), and one pregnant woman died. The laboratory results exhibit that temperature higher than 38 (n=27), leukopenia (n=19), neutropenia (n=54), ALT (n=12), AST (n=31), and thrombocytopenia (n=35) were less frequent among pregnant women while lymphopenia (n=126), hemoglobin levels lower than 13.0 (n=218), deceased albumin levels (n=195) were most frequent among them. However, a small proportion of pregnant women were admitted to the ICU (3.8%). The most frequent maternal treatments were antibiotics (n=81), antiviral (n=49), and corticosteroid (n=24). Of 204 neonates, four had died and all the remaining neonates were alive. The median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (IQR: 35-40). Most neonates had normal laboratory results. However, 14 had lymphopenia (7.0%), 22 had neutropenia (11.0%), and 11 had thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Four infants had low hemoglobin levels of less than 13.0 (2.0%) and 81 had hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., total bilirubin of higher than 23; 40.5%). Approximately less than one-half of neonates required admission to the NICU (n=86, 43%), 7% of them required respiratory support of mechanical ventilation, and none of them get infected with COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study suggests that the majority of pregnant women had mild or moderate disease symptoms. Nevertheless, this study did not find any evidence of possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from mothers to their babies. This study may provide a baseline for further studies focusing on investigating long-term maternal and neonate's outcomes and possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mothers to their newborn babies.","Al-Matary, Abdulrahman; Almatari, Faeza; Al-Matary, Mariam; AlDhaefi, Alaa; Alqahtani, Mohammed Hassan S; Alhulaimi, Emad Ahmad; AlOtaiby, Shahad; Almehiny, Khowlah; John, Lincy Soosan; Alanazi, Faisal Samah; Ali, Aisha Mansoor; Aldandan, Faisal K",J Infect Public Health,421,1

We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients reported to the Brazilian surveillance system. METHODS: We analysed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who travelled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators were used for validation. RESULTS: We described 1468 COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR) and 4271 patients with other illnesses. With a data subset including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41-96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%). In a validation dataset including the other 20% of patients from SP and RJ, this model exhibited an AUC of 95.01% (92.51-97.5%) and accuracy of 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%). CONCLUSION: We obtained a model suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 based on routinely collected surveillance data. Applications of this tool include early identification for specific treatment and isolation, rational use of laboratory tests, and input for modelling epidemiological trends.","Diaz-Quijano, Fredi A; da Silva, José M N; Ganem, Fabiana; Oliveira, Silvano; Vesga-Varela, Andrea L; Croda, Julio",Trop Med Int Health,421,21

The infection is caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and clinically characterized by common symptoms including fever, dry cough, loss of taste/smell, myalgia and pneumonia in severe cases. With overwhelming spikes in infection and death, its pathogenesis yet remains elusive. Since the infection spread rapidly, its healthcare demands are overwhelming with uncontrollable emergencies. Although laboratory testing and analysis are developing at an enormous pace, the high momentum of severe cases demand more rapid strategies for initial screening and patient stratification. Several molecular biomarkers like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL6), eosinophils and cytokines, and artificial intelligence (AI) based screening approaches have been developed by various studies to assist this vast medical demand. This review is an attempt to collate the outcomes of such studies, thus highlighting the utility of AI in rapid screening of molecular markers along with chest X-rays and other COVID-19 symptoms to enable faster diagnosis and patient stratification. By doing so, we also found that molecular markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6 eosinophils, etc. showed significant differences between severe and non-severe cases of COVID-19 patients. CT findings in the lungs also showed different patterns like lung consolidation significantly higher in patients with poor recovery and lung lesions and fibrosis being higher in patients with good recovery. Thus, from these evidences we perceive that an initial rapid screening using integrated AI approach could be a way forward in efficient patient stratification.","Shafi, Gowhar; Desai, Shruti; Srinivasan, Krithika; Ramesh, Aarthi; Chaturvedi, Rupesh; Uttarwar, Mohan",Mol Genet Genomics,421,16

Methods: We used local “Get With The Guidelines” stroke data for patients with ischemic stroke (IS), transient ischemic attack (TIA), and intracerebral hemorrhage/subarachnoid hemorrhage (ICH/SAH) from March 20-April 14, 2020 (study period) and January 1-March 19, 2020 (control period #1) and March 20-April 14, 2019 (control period #2). We examined daily admission rates, transfers, tPA administration, thrombectomy, and time from last well to hospital arrival. Results: There were 349 patients (n=40 study period, n=225 control period #1, n=84 control period #2);263 with IS, 37 with TIA, and 49 with ICH/SAH. Overall, 46% were female, 82% white, with median age 70 years (IQR 58-82 years). Daily admission rates were 1.4 IS/day for the study period compared to 2.1 IS/day (Incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.49 95% CI 1.05-2.13, p=0.027) and 2.2 IS/day (IRR 1.57 1.04-2.37, p=0.033) for control periods #1 and #2 (Table), respectively. There was only one admission for TIA in the study period compared to approximately one every 4 days in control period #1 (IRR 7.2 95% CI 1.0-53.7, p=0.053) and one every 2 days in control period #2 (IRR 14.0 95% CI 1.8-106.5, p=0.011). ICH/SAH admissions were fewer in the study period. Transfers were less common with approximately one transfer every four days in the study period compared to one each day of the control periods. Rates of tPA, thrombectomy, and time from last well to first hospital contact did not differ across the epochs. Conclusions: Our data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic response has led to reduced admissionvolumes for all stroke types in the University of Rochester Medical Center catchment area, partlydue to decreases in hospital transfers. These data raise the question whether fewer patients soughtcare for stroke symptoms at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.","George, B. P.; Boerman, C.; Papadakos, P. J.; Benesch, C.; Holloway, R.

The potential application of Impella has become particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic, for patients with acute severe heart failure complicating viral illness. Standard implantation of the Impella CP is performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Positioning of the Impella CP can be confirmed with transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography. We describe an alternative approach to guide intracardiac implantation of the Impella CP using two-dimensional and three-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography. This new technique can be useful in selected groups of patients when fluoroscopy, transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography is deemed inapplicable or limited for epidemiological or clinical reasons. Intracardiac three-dimensional echocardiography is a feasible alternative to the traditional techniques for implantation of an Impella CP device but careful consideration must be given to the potential limitations and complications of this technique.","Yastrebov, Konstantin; Brunel, Laurencie; Paterson, Hugh S; Williams, Zoe A; Wise, Innes K; Burrows, Christopher S; Bannon, Paul G",Sci Rep,421,16

Concepts and terms used to describe populations disproportionately impacted in emergencies vary over time and across disciplines, but United States (US) federal guidance and law require equal access to our nation's emergency resources. At all levels of emergency planning, public health and their partners must be accountable to populations with existing inequities, which requires a conceptual shift toward using the data-driven social determinants of health (SDOH). SDOH are conditions in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks. This article reviews the historic use of concepts and terms to describe populations disproportionately impacted by emergencies.

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Sixty healthy volunteers who had a first or second mandibular molar diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis participated in the present study. This study was composed of three arms for the first molar and three arms for the second molar. Subjects in test arm A received two IANB injections (3.6 mL). Subjects in test arm B received 1.8 mL IANB injection plus 1.8 mL buccal infiltration. Subjects in test arm C received 1.8 mL IANB injection plus 1.8 mL lingual infiltration. Articaine (4%) with 1:100,000 epinephrine was used for all injections. The subject's pain during access preparation and pulp extirpation was recorded on the Heft-Parker visual analog scale. Success was defined as ""none"" or ""mild"" pain during treatment. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare pain categories in three groups of interventions for each mandibular molar. RESULTS: IANB with a supplemented buccal infiltration provided more success than IANB alone or IANB plus lingual infiltration, in first molars (P = .019). There were no significant differences between ï»¿the three injection techniques in second molars (P = .795).

The limiting object is the manifold itself endowed with the population Fermat distance, an intrinsic metric that accounts for both the geometry of the manifold and the density that produces the sample. This result is applied to obtain intrinsic persistence diagrams, which are less sensitive to the particular embedding of the manifold in the Euclidean space.

Didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) is an EPA-registered disinfectant, it was also a component in humidifier disinfectants that had caused idiopathic pulmonary diseases in Korea. In this study, we identified the possible pulmonary toxic response and mechanism using human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells and mice. First, cell viability decreased sharply at a 4 μg/mL of concentration. The volume of intracellular organelles and the ROS level reduced, leading to the formation of apoptotic bodies and an increase of the LDH release. Secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 also significantly increased. More importantly, lamellar body-like structures were formed in both the cells and mice exposed to DDAC, and the expression of both the indicator proteins for lamellar body (ABCA3 and Rab11a) and surfactant proteins (A, B, and D) was clearly enhanced. In addition, chronic fibrotic pulmonary lesions were notably observed in mice instilled twice (weekly) with DDAC (500 μg), ultimately resulting in death. Taken together, we suggest that disruption of pulmonary surfactant homeostasis may contribute to DDAC-induced cell death and subsequent pathophysiology and that the formation of lamellar body-like structures may play a role as the trigger. In addition, we propose that the cause of sudden death of mice exposed to DDAC should be clearly elucidated for the safe application of DDAC.","Park, Eun-Jung; Seong, Eunsol; Kang, Min-Sung; Lee, Gwang-Hee; Kim, Dong-Wan; Han, Ji-Seok; Lim, Hyun-Ji; Lee, Seung Hyeun; Han, Hyoung-Yun",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,421,20

The obtained samples were characterized by Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to analyze the effect of the grinding time on the copper particles adhesion to the graphene sheets. Composites of silicon with two contents of G/Cu, at two weight ratios, nanostructures were prepared and the crosslinking characteristics were analyzed by a rubber process analyzer. The thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity and antimicrobial characteristics against E. coli and S. aureus for these silicon/G/Cu composites were determined. It was found that the use of IL enhances the G/Cu nanostructures dispersion into the silicon polymer matrix with a noticeable improvement in thermal conductivity of 1.12 W/mK for a 7 wt% of G/Cu, a volume electrical resistivity of 4.1 × 10(10) Ω cm with 7 wt% of G/Cu nanoparticles and antimicrobial response of 4.21 ± 0.11 to E. coli and 5.33 ± 0.11 to S. aureus with 7% of G/Cu nanoparticles. It was determined that π–π interactions between graphene and aromatic molecule of IL may be influencing the observed improvement in G/Cu dispersion and final composite performance. The novelty of this work is the use of IL to improve the G/Cu NPs dispersion into the silicon polymer matrix. This silicon/G/Cu composite could be an option to prepare medical devices for electrotherapy or face protection against COVID-19 or other silicon-based devices for medical applications.

This may be, in part, due to a historical separation of evolutionary and medical fields, but there is a large, somewhat nuanced body of evidence-supported theory on the evolution of infectious disease. In this review, we synthesize this evolutionary theory in order to provide a framework for clearer understanding of the key principles. Specifically, we discuss the selection acting on zoonotic pathogens' transmission rates and virulence at spillover and during emergence. We explain how the direction and strength of selection during epidemics of emerging zoonotic disease can be understood by a three Ts framework: trade-offs, transmission, and time scales. Virulence and transmission rate may trade-off, but transmission rate is likely to be favoured by selection early in emergence, particularly if maladapted zoonotic pathogens have ‘no-cost’ transmission rate improving mutations available to them. Additionally, the optimal virulence and transmission rates can shift with the time scale of the epidemic. Predicting pathogen evolution, therefore, depends on understanding both the trade-offs of transmission-improving mutations and the time scales of selection.","Visher, Elisa; Evensen, Claire; Guth, Sarah; Lai, Edith; Norfolk, Marina; Rozins, Carly; Sokolov, Nina A.; Sui, Melissa; Boots, Michael",Proceedings.

This cascading failure underscores the need for the network analysis and advanced resilience analytics we find lacking in the existing supply chain literature. This paper reviews supply chain resilience literature that focuses on resilience modeling and quantification and connects the supply chain to other networks, including transportation and command and control. We observe a fast increase in the number of relevant papers (only 47 relevant papers were published in 2007–2016, while 94 were found in 2017–2019). We observe that specific disruption scenarios are used to develop and test supply chain resilience models, while uncertainty associated with threats including consideration of “unknown unknowns” remains rare. Publications that utilize more advanced models often focus just on supply chain networks and exclude associated system components such as transportation and command and control (C2) networks, which creates a gap in the research that needs to be bridged. The common goal of supply chain modeling is to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, but trade-offs of efficiency and leanness with flexibility and resilience may not be fully addressed. We conclude that a comprehensive approach to network resilience quantification encompassing the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed to address the emerging challenges in the field. The connection to systemic threats, such as disease pandemics, is specifically discussed.

This paper therefore undertakes a whole-system approach and explores optimal pathways towards 100% renewable energy by 2050. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which currently has the highest share of variable renewable electricity on a synchronous power system. Large numbers of scenarios are developed using the Irish TIMES model to address uncertainties. Results show that compared to decarbonization targets, focusing on renewable penetration without considering carbon capture options is significantly less cost effective in carbon mitigation. Alternative assumptions on bioenergy imports and maximum variability in power generation lead to very different energy mixes in bioenergy and electrification levels. All pathways suggest that indigenous bioenergy needs to be fully exploited and the current annual deployment rate of renewable electricity needs a boost. Pathways relying on international bioenergy imports are slightly cheaper and faces less economic and technical challenges. However, given the large future uncertainties, it is recommended that further policy considerations be given to pathways with high electrification levels as they are more robust towards uncertainties.","Yue, Xiufeng; Patankar, Neha; Decarolis, Joseph; Chiodi, Alessandro; Rogan, Fionn; Deane, J.P.; O’Gallachoir, Brian",Energy (Oxf),421,21

Because of the close genetic relationship, in many areas they have interbred with domestic pigs and formed considerable populations of feral suids that represent wild boar and feral pig crosses. Wild suid populations are relatively hardy and most disease research has been focused on their potential as a reservoir for diseases of concern for commercial pig production.

Our knowledge on the aggregation behaviour of viral proteins, however, is still rather limited. Here, we investigated this behaviour in the the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteomes. An initial analysis using a panel of sequence-based predictors suggested the presence of multiple aggregation-prone regions in these proteomes, and revealed an enhanced aggregation propensity in some SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We then studied the in vitro aggregation of predicted aggregation-prone SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the signal sequence peptide and fusion peptide 1 of the spike protein, a peptide from the NSP6 protein (NSP6-p), the ORF10 protein, and the NSP11 protein. Our results show that these peptides and proteins form aggregates via a nucleation-dependent mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrated that the aggregates of NSP11 are toxic to mammalian cell cultures. These findings provide evidence about the aggregation of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Significance The aggregation of proteins is linked with human disease in a variety of ways. In the case of viral infections, one could expect that the aberrant aggregation of viral proteins may damage the host cells, and also that viral particles may trigger the misfolding and aggregation of host proteins, resulting in damage to the host organism. Here we investigate the aggregation propensity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and show that many of them can form aggregates that are potentially cytotoxic. In perspective, these results suggest that a better understanding of the effects of viruses on the human protein homeostasis system could help future therapeutic efforts.","Bhardwaj, Taniya; Gadhave, Kundlik; Kapuganti, Shivani K; Kumar, Prateek; Brotzakis, Zacharias Faidon; Saumya, Kumar Udit; Nayak, Namyashree; Kumar, Ankur; Garg, Neha; Vendruscolo, Michele; Giri, Rajanish",bioRxiv,421,16

Often orthologs of functional receptors are present in a wide range of species, but amino acid differences can render these receptors non-functional. In some cases amino acid differences result in additional N-linked glycosylation that blocks virus infection. The latter block to retrovirus infection can be overcome by treatment of cells with compounds such as tunicamycin, which prevent the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides. RESULTS: We have discovered that treatment of cells with liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine (PS) can also overcome the block to infection mediated by N-linked glycosylation. Importantly, this effect occurs without apparent change in the glycosylation state of the receptors for these viruses. This effect occurs with delayed kinetics compared to previous results showing enhancement of virus infection by PS treatment of cells expressing functional virus receptors. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that PS treatment can relieve the block to retrovirus infection of cells expressing retroviral receptors that have been rendered non-functional by glycosylation. These findings have important implications for the current model describing inhibition of virus entry by receptor glycosylation.","Coil, David A; Miller, A Dusty",Retrovirology,421,25

BACKGROUND: During the COVID‐19 pandemic, studies have shown an increased level of stress and burnout among health care workers, especially nurses. This study responds to the call for research to explore the mechanisms of servant leadership in predicting nurses' burnout by employing the perspective of conservation of resources theory. METHODS: Through a cross‐sectional quantitative research design, data were collected in three waves from 443 nurses working in Pakistan's five public sector hospitals. Data were analysed by employing the partial least squares path modelling (PLS‐PM) technique. RESULTS: Servant leadership (β = −0.318; 95% CI = 0.225, 0.416) and psychological safety (β = −0.342; CI = 0.143, 0.350) have an inverse relationship with nurses' burnout and explain 63.1% variance. CONCLUSIONS: Servant leadership significantly reduces nurses' burnout, and psychological safety mediates this relationship. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Human resource management policies in health care must emphasize training nursing leaders in servant leadership behaviour.","Ma, Ying; Faraz, Naveed Ahmad; Ahmed, Fawad; Iqbal, Muhammad Khalid; Saeed, Umair; Mughal, Muhammad Farhan; Raza, Ali",J Nurs Manag,421,27

METHODS: Three populations were included: “severe-to-critical” ICU-hospitalized patients (n = 18), “mild-to-moderate” hospitalized patients (n = 16) and non-hospitalized symptomatic patients (n = 24). Four commercial immunoassays were analyzed and validated: anti-IgG ARCHITECT® (Abbott), anti-Total antibodies (Ab) VITROS® (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics), anti-IgG NovaLisa® (NovaTec Immundiagnostica) and Healgen® IgM and IgG (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech). Sensitivities were evaluated according to days post-symptoms onset (pso). Specificities were evaluated on SARS-CoV-2-negative control sera collected before January 2020. RESULTS: A majority of severe-to-critically ill patients showed detectable Ab already at day 14 and sensitivities reached 100 % after 22 days pso. For patients with “mild-to-moderate” illness, sensitivities increased by at least 5-fold from day 0 to day 14 pso. Non-hospitalized symptomatic individuals already seroconverted at day 14 days pso with 100 % sensitivities for Total Ab VITROS®. Specificities were evaluated at 97 % for ARCHITECT® and NovaLisa®, 98 % for VITROS® and at 94 % for Healgen® combined IgM and IgG. Five “severe-to-critically” ill patients presented high positive Ab levels for at least 16 weeks pso. CONCLUSION: The Ab levels and the evaluated sensitivities, representing the true positive rate, increased overtime and were related to the COVID-19 severity. Automated Total Ab immunoassay showed better sensitivities and specificity for immunological surveillance and vaccine evaluation.","Catry, E.; Jacqmin, H.; Dodemont, M.; Saad Albichr, I.; Lardinois, B.; de fays, B.; Delaere, B.; Closset, M.; Laurent, T.; Denis, O.; Galanti, L.; Mullier, F.; Huang, T.D.",J Virol Methods,421,32

The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity, e.g., in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models and was expected by epidemiologists; see graphs Fig. 1,2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider trees with the constant number [Formula: see text] of branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with an algebraic structure, these are [Formula: see text]-adic number fields. We apply theory of the [Formula: see text]-adic diffusion equation to describe a virus spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, a virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy’s levels composing this barrier. We consider linearly increasing barriers. A virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model; in particular, by notion of the probability to be infected (at time [Formula: see text] in a social cluster [Formula: see text]). We present socio-medical specialties of the covid-19 epidemic supporting our model.","Khrennikov, Andrei",Physica A,421,3
