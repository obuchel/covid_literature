6147,Das Herz bei viralen Infektionen,2010-06-09,"The adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by extended inflammatory processes in the lung microvascular, interstitial, and alveolar compartments, resulting in vasomotor disturbances, plasma leakage, cell injury, and complex gas exchange disturbances. Abnormalities in the alveolar surfactant system have long been implicated in the pathogenetic sequelae of this life-threatening syndrome. This hypothesis is supported by similarities in pulmonary failure between patients with ARDS and preterm babies with infant respiratory distress syndrome, known to be triggered primarily by lack of surfactant material. Mechanisms of surfactant alterations in ARDS include: (a) lack of surface-active compounds (phospholipids, apoproteins) due to reduced generation/release by diseased pneumocytes or to increased loss of material (this feature includes changes in the relative composition of the surfactant phospholipid and/or apoprotein profiles); (b) inhibition of surfactant function by plasma protein leakage (inhibitory potencies of different plasma proteins have been defined); (c) “incorporation” of surfactant phospholipids and apoproteins into polymerizing fibrin upon hyaline membrane formation; and (d) damage/inhibition of surfactant compounds by inflammatory mediators (proteases, oxidants, nonsurfactant lipids). Alterations in alveolar surfactant function may well contribute to a variety of pathophysiological key events encountered in ARDS. These include decrease in compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatch including shunt flow due to altered gas flow distribution (atelectasis, partial alveolar collapse, small airway collapse), and lung edema formation. Moreover, more speculative at the present time, surfactant abnormalities may add to a reduction in alveolar host defense competence and an upregulation of inflammatory events under conditions of ARDS. Persistent atelectasis of surfactant-deficient and in particular fibrin-loaded alveoli may represent a key event to trigger fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis in late ARDS (“collapse induration”). Overall, the presently available data on surfactant abnormalities in ARDS lend credit to therapeutic trials with transbronchial surfactant administration. In addition to the classical goals of replacement therapy defined for preterm infants (rapid improvement in lung compliance and gas exchange), this approach will have to consider its impact on host defense competence and inflammatory and proliferative processes when applied in adults with respiratory failure.","Seeger, W.; Günther, A.; Walmrath, H.

11290,Perioperative Outcomes of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: an Analysis of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Database,2019-10-09,"BACKGROUND: The judicialization of medicine can lead to professional disenchantment and defensive attitudes among surgeons. Some quantitative studies have investigated this topic in spine surgery, but none has provided direct thematic feedback from physicians. This qualitative study aimed to identify the impact of this phenomenon in the practice of spine neurosurgeons. METHODS: We proposed a qualitative study using grounded theory approach. Twenty-three purposively selected private neurosurgeons participated. Inclusion took place until data saturation was reached. Data were collected through individual interviews and analyzed thematically and independently by three researchers (an anthropologist, a psychiatrist, and a neurosurgeon). RESULTS: Data analysis identified five superordinate themes that were based on items that recurred in interviews: (1) private practice of spinal surgery (high-risk surgery based on frequent functional symptoms, in an unfavorable medicolegal context); (2) societal transformation of the doctor-patient relationship (new societal demands, impact of the internet and social network); (3) judicialization of spine surgery (surgeons’ feelings about the frequency and motivation of the complaints they receive, and their own management of them); (4) coping strategies (identification and solutions for “at risk” situations and patients); and (5) professional disenchantment (impact of these events on surgeons’ daily practice and career planning). Selected quotes of interviews were reported to support these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights several elements that can alter the quality of care in a context of societal change and the judicialization of medicine. The alteration of the doctor-patient relationship and the permanent pressure of a possible complaint encourage surgeons to adopt defensive attitudes in order to minimize the risks of litigation and increased insurance premiums. These phenomena can affect the quality of care and the privacy of physicians to the extent that they may consider changing or interrupting their careers earlier.

16768,Trends in Emergent Groin Hernia Repair—An Analysis From the Herniamed Registry,2021-03-30,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The objective was to assess if puborectalis muscle (PRM) function changes in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) undergoing pessary treatment. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of women with symptomatic POP choosing pessary treatment. An interview, clinical examination and 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound were performed at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. POP was assessed using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system (POPQ). Parameters compared between baseline and follow-up were: hiatal area at rest (HArest), maximal contraction (HActx), and maximal Valsalva maneuver (HAVal), displacement in contraction (DISPL-ctx, i.e., relative difference between HArest and HActx), and displacement in Valsalva (DISPL-Val, i.e., relative difference between and HAVal and HArest). Parameters were compared in women with and those without complete avulsion. RESULTS: A total of 162 women were assessed and 34 were included. Mean age was 64 years (SD 11.4), and mean BMI 24 kg/m(2) (SD 3.1). Thirty-one women had a cystocele, 8 a uterine prolapse, and 12 had a posterior compartment prolapse. Twenty-one women (61.8%) had a POP stage II, and 13 (38.2%) a POP stage III. Ring pessaries were most frequently used (97%). In the entire group a statistically significant increase in DISPL-ctx was observed (mean difference 2.1%, p = 0.017). In the no avulsion group HArest and DISPL-ctx increased significantly (mean difference 4.1%, p = 0.016 and 2.7%, p = 0.016 respectively) and the increase in DISPL-ctx was higher than in the avulsion group (mean difference 2.7% vs 0.2%, p = 0.056). CONCLUSION: Our results show that PRM function changes in women with POP undergoing pessary treatment and suggest that such change occurs mainly in the absence of complete avulsion.","Manzini, Claudia; van den Noort, Frieda; Grob, Anique T.

59999,Adnexal Masses Treated Using a Combination of the SILS Port and Noncurved Straight Laparoscopic Instruments: Turkish Experience and Review of the Literature.,2013,"In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial disruptions in global activities. The disruptions also included intentional and unintentional reductions in health services, including immunization campaigns against the transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2). Building on a recently updated global poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model, we explored the implications of immunization disruption and restrictions of human interactions (i.e., population mixing) on the expected incidence of polio and on the resulting challenges faced by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). We demonstrate that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, the GPEI could largely mitigate the impact of COVID-19 to the delays incurred. The relative importance of reduced mixing (leading to potentially decreased incidence) and reduced immunization (leading to potentially increased expected incidence) depends on the timing of the effects. Following resumption of immunization activities, the GPEI will likely face similar barriers to eradication of WPV and elimination of cVDPV2 as before COVID-19. The disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic may further delay polio eradication due to indirect effects on vaccine and financial resources.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Voorman, Arend; Pallansch, Mark A; Wassilak, Steven G F; Cochi, Stephen L; Badizadegan, Kamran; Thompson, Kimberly M",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.04.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962838/,594
60100,Transumbilical single port laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of concomitant disease.,2013,"Objective. To report our experience treating adnexal masses using a combination of the SILS port and straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments. Study Design. This prospective feasibility study included 14 women with symptomatic and persistent adnexal masses. Removal of adnexal masses via single-incision laparoscopic surgery using a combination of the SILS port and straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments was performed. Results. All of the patients had symptomatic complex adnexal masses. Mean age of the patients was 38.4 years (range: 21-61 years) and mean duration of surgery was 71 min (range: 45-130 min). All surgeries were performed using nonroticulating straight laparoscopic instruments. Mean tumor diameter was 6 cm (range: 5-12 cm). All patient pathology reports were benign. None of the patients converted to laparotomy. All the patients were discharged on postoperative d1. Postoperatively, all the patients were satisfied with their incision and cosmetic results. Conclusion. All 14 patients were successfully treated using standard, straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments via the SILS port. This procedure can reduce the cost of treatment, which may eventually lead to more widespread use of the SILS port approach. Furthermore, concomitant surgical procedures are possible using this approach. However, properly designed comparative studies with single port and classic laparoscopic surgery are urgently needed.","Dursun, Polat; Tezcaner, Tugan; Zeyneloglu, Hulusi B; Alyazıcı, Irem; Haberal, Ali; Ayhan, Ali",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/836380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24307944/,594

Gene therapy has a promising future in treating neurodegenerative disorders by correcting the genetic defects or by therapeutic protein delivery and is now an attraction for neurologists to treat brain disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Gene therapy allows the transgene induction, with a unique expression in cells' substrate. This article mainly focuses on the delivering modes of genetic materials in the CNS, which includes viral and non-viral vectors and their application in gene therapy. Despite the many clinical trials conducted so far, data have shown disappointing outcomes. The efforts done to improve outcomes, efficacy, and safety in the identification of targets in various neurological disorders are also discussed here. Adapting gene therapy as a new therapeutic approach for treating neurological disorders seems to be promising, with early detection and delivery of therapy before the neuron is lost, helping a lot the development of new therapeutic options to translate to the clinic.","Parambi, Della Grace Thomas; Alharbi, Khalid Saad; Kumar, Rajesh; Harilal, Seetha; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber; Cruz-Martins, Natália; Magdy, Omnia; Musa, Arafa; Panda, Dibya Sundar; Mathew, Bijo",Molecular neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-021-02555-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34655056/,594

61159,Mesh-reinforced hiatal hernia repair: a review on the effect on postoperative dysphagia and recurrence.,2012,"UNLABELLED Lytic infection by herpesviruses induces cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition. This appears to be a function of multiple herpesvirus proteins, but only a minority of herpesvirus proteins have been examined for cell cycle effects. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the viral proteins that contribute to G1/S arrest, we screened a library of over 200 proteins from herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for effects on the G1/S interface, using HeLa fluorescent, ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) cells in which G1/S can be detected colorimetrically. Proteins from each virus were identified that induce accumulation of G1/S cells, predominantly tegument, early, and capsid proteins. The identification of several capsid proteins in this screen suggests that incoming viral capsids may function to modulate cellular processes. The cell cycle effects of selected EBV proteins were further verified and examined for effects on p53 and p21 as regulators of the G1/S transition. Two EBV replication proteins (BORF2 and BMRF1) were found to induce p53 but not p21, while a previously uncharacterized tegument protein (BGLF2) was found to induce p21 protein levels in a p53-independent manner. Proteomic analyses of BGLF2-interacting proteins identified interactions with the NIMA-related protein kinase (NEK9) and GEM-interacting protein (GMIP). Silencing of either NEK9 or GMIP induced p21 without affecting p53 and abrogated the ability of BGLF2 to further induce p21. Collectively, these results suggest multiple viral proteins contribute to G1/S arrest, including BGLF2, which induces p21 levels likely by interfering with the functions of NEK9 and GMIP. IMPORTANCE Most people are infected with multiple herpesviruses, whose proteins alter the infected cells in several ways. During lytic infection, the viral proteins block cell proliferation just before the cellular DNA replicates. We used a novel screening method to identify proteins from three different herpesviruses that contribute to this block. Several of the proteins we identified had previously unknown functions or were structural components of the virion. Subsets of these proteins from Epstein-Barr virus were studied for their effects on the cell cycle regulatory proteins p53 and p21, thereby identifying two proteins that induce p53 and one that induces p21 (BGLF2). We identified interactions of BGLF2 with two human proteins, both of which regulate p21, suggesting that BGLF2 induces p21 by interfering with the functions of these two host proteins. Our study indicates that multiple herpesvirus proteins contribute to the cell proliferation block, including components of the incoming virions.","Paladino, Patrick; Marcon, Edyta; Greenblatt, Jack; Frappier, Lori",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00059-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501404/,594

61422,Comparison of the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on remission of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,2020-03-11,"Depression and insomnia commonly co-occur, resulting in greater morbidity for patients, and difficult diagnostic and treatment decisions for clinicians. When patients report symptoms of both depression and insomnia, it is common for medical practitioners to conceptualise the insomnia as a secondary symptom of depression. This implies that there is little purpose in treating insomnia directly, and that management of depression will improve both the depression and insomnia symptoms. In this review, we present an overview of research investigating the comorbidity and treatment approaches for patients presenting with depression and insomnia in primary care. Evidence shows that clinicians should avoid routinely conceptualising insomnia as a secondary symptom of depression. This is because insomnia symptoms: (i) often occur before mood decline and are independently associated with increased risk of future depression; (ii) commonly remain unchanged following depression treatment; and (iii) predict relapse of depression after treatment for depression only. Furthermore, compared with control, cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia improves symptoms of both depression and insomnia. It is critical that primary care clinicians dedicate specific diagnostic and treatment attention to the management of both depression (eg, psychotherapy, antidepressants) and insomnia (eg, cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia administered by trained therapists or psychologists through a mental health treatment plan referral, by online programs, or by a general practitioner or nurse) when they co-occur. These treatments may be offered concurrently or sequentially (eg, insomnia treatment followed by depression treatment, or vice versa), depending on presenting symptoms, history, lifestyle factors and other comorbidities.","Sweetman, Alexander; Lack, Leon; Van Ryswyk, Emer; Vakulin, Andrew; Reed, Richard L; Battersby, Malcolm W; Lovato, Nicole; Adams, Robert J",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34392547/,594

61734,Long-term recurrence and complication rates after incisional hernia repair with the open onlay technique.,2009,"OBJECTIVE Self-efficacy expectations are associated with improvements in problematic outcomes widely considered clinically significant (i.e., emotional distress, fatigue, pain), related to positive health behaviors, and, as a type of personal agency, inherently valuable. Self-efficacy expectancies, estimates of confidence to execute behaviors, are important in that changes in self-efficacy expectations are positively related to future behaviors that promote health and well-being. The current meta-analysis investigated the impact of psychological interventions on self-efficacy expectations for a variety of health behaviors among cancer patients. METHODS Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched with specific search terms for identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focused on psychologically-based interventions. Included studies had: 1) an adult cancer sample, 2) a self-efficacy expectation measure of specific behaviors and 3) an RCT design. Standard screening and reliability procedures were used for selecting and coding studies. Coding included theoretically informed moderator variables. RESULTS Across 79 RCTs, 223 effect sizes, and 8678 participants, the weighted average effect of self-efficacy expectations was estimated as g=0.274 (p<.001). Consistent with Self-Efficacy Theory, the average effect for in-person intervention delivery (g=0.329) was significantly greater than for all other formats (g=0.154, p=.023; e.g., audiovisual, print, telephone, web/internet). CONCLUSIONS The results establish the impact of psychological interventions on self-efficacy expectations as comparable in effect size to commonly reported outcomes (distress, fatigue, pain). Additionally, the result that in-person interventions achieved the largest effect is supported by Social Learning Theory and could inform research related to the development and evaluation of interventions.","Merluzzi, T V; Pustejovsky, J E; Philip, E J; Sohl, S J; Berendsen, M; Salsman, J M",Psycho-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206917/,594
62282,Efficiency and safety of bipolar vessel and tissue sealing in visceral surgery.,2012,"Many studies indicate that increasing self-awareness leads to individuals reflecting on their values and ideals (Silvia & Duval, 2001). This self-reflection appears to increase prosocial behaviour (Berkowitz, 1987). However, previously studies typically manipulated self-awareness in situations in which the individual may have felt pressure from the researcher to help. Thus, experimenter pressure to behave prosocially confounds the self-awareness explanation provided in past research. We used a novel experimental paradigm to manipulate self-awareness and remove the researcher's presence to decrease the likelihood that the participant would conform to experimenter demand. Participants were 36 college students (Mage = 19.52; 25 women). The results indicated a strong probability that the experimental condition participants were more prosocial than control condition participants. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that self-reflection increases prosocial behaviour, even without experimenter demands. These findings and the importance of studying objective self-awareness in light of the coronavirus are discussed.","Lewis, Jerome Anthony; Himmelberger, Zachary M; Elmore, J Dean",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33319358/,594

First, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody response, measured by plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT(80)), and clinical response of the two viruses in groups of four ewes each. The virus dose was 1×10(5)plaque forming units (PFU). Control groups of four ewes each were also inoculated with a similar dose of RVF MP-12 or the parent recombinant virus (arMP-12). Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 3 of 4 animals inoculated with arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 on Day 5 post inoculation and all four animals had PRNT(80) titers of ≥1:20 on Day 6. Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 2 of 4 ewes inoculated with arMP-12ΔNSs16/198 on Day 7 and all had PRNT(80) titers of ≥1:20 on Day 10. We found the mean PRNT(80) response to arMP-12ΔNSs16/198 to be 16- to 25-fold lower than that of ewes inoculated with arMP-12ΔNSm21/384, arMP-12 or RVF MP-12. No abortions occurred though a single fetal death in each of the arMP-12 and RVF MP-12 groups was found at necropsy. The poor PRNT(80) response to arMP-12ΔNSs16/198 caused us to discontinue further testing of this candidate and focus on arMP-12ΔNSm21/384. A dose escalation study of arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 showed that 1×10(3)plaque forming units (PFU) stimulate a PRNT(80) response comparable to doses of up to 1×10(5)PFU of this virus. With further study, the arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 virus may prove to be a safe and efficacious candidate for a livestock vaccine. The large deletion in the NSm gene may also provide a negative marker that will allow serologic differentiation of naturally infected animals from vaccinated animals.","Morrill, John C; Laughlin, Richard C; Lokugamage, Nandadeva; Pugh, Roberta; Sbrana, Elena; Weise, William J; Adams, L Garry; Makino, Shinji; Peters, C J",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153443/,594
64004,Self-gripping versus sutured mesh for inguinal hernia repair: a systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature.,2013,"BACKGROUND Studies on families with sleepwalking are uncommonly published but can give further information on the phenotype of patients with chronic sleepwalking. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Out of 51 individuals referred for chronic sleepwalking during a 5-year period, we obtained sufficient information on 7 families with direct relatives who reported sleepwalking with or without sleep terrors. Among 70 living direct family members, we obtained questionnaire responses from 50 subjects and identified 34 cases with a history of sleepwalking. Of the 50 subjects, 16 completed only questionnaires, while all the others also completed a clinical evaluation and nocturnal sleep recordings. RESULTS There was a positive history of sleepwalking on either the paternal or maternal side of the family over several generations in our 7 families. Thirty-three clinically evaluated subjects had evidence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), with associated craniofacial risk factors for SDB (particularly maxillary and/or mandibular deficiencies). There was a complete overlap with the report of parasomnias and the presence of SDB. In cases with current sleepwalking, treatment of SDB coincided with clear improvement of the parasomnia. CONCLUSION All of our subjects with parasomnias presented with familial traits considered as risk factors for SDB. These anatomical risk factors are present at birth and even subtle SDB can lead to sleep disruption and instability of NREM sleep. The question raised is: are factors leading to chronic sleep disruption the familial traits responsible for familial sleepwalking?","Cao, Michelle; Guilleminault, Christian",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2010.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20598633/,594
64322,Surgical Techniques for Implanting the EVAHEART 2 Double Cuff Tipless Inflow Cannula.,2018,"Purpose: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways are increasingly implemented. Goal directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is a core component of ERAS pathways that limit excessive volume administration and is associated with increased use of intraoperative vasopressors. Vasopressor effects on anastomotic healing and pancreatic fistula are inconclusive. We hypothesized that intraoperative vasopressor use in an ERAS GDFT algorithm would not increase risk of pancreatic fistulas. Methods: We reviewed all adult patients undergoing pancreatectomy at an academic institution from January 2013 to February 2016, before and after implementation of an ERAS pathway in July 2014. Retrospective chart review was performed. Log-binomial regression, weighted by stabilized inverse probability-of-treatment weights, estimated effect of ERAS and intraoperative vasopressors on fistula risk. Results: One hundred thirty two patients met inclusion criteria: 74 (56.1%) in the ERAS cohort. No significant differences in overall leak risk (risk ratio [RR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-2.09) were observed between the ERAS and pre-ERAS cohorts. Similarly, vasopressor infusions, independent of ERAS pathway, did not significantly increase the risk of anastomotic leaks (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.52-2.72). Conclusions: Increased use of vasopressor infusions as part of an ERAS pathway for pancreatic surgery is not associated with an increase in the risk of clinically significant pancreatic fistulas.","Laks, Shachar; Isaak, Robert S; Strassle, Paula D; Hance, Lyla; Kolarczyk, Lavinia M; Kim, Hong Jin",Journal of pancreatic cancer,https://doi.org/10.1089/pancan.2018.0007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631856/,594

64519,Laparoscopic posterior colporrhaphy using a unidirectional barbed suture for risk hedging laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy.,2017,"BACKGROUND Governments in some countries or states/provinces mandate school-based policies intended to improve the health and well-being of primary and secondary students and in some cases the health of school staff. Examples include mandating a minimum time spent per week in programmed physical activity, mandating provision of healthy foods and limiting fat content of school meals, and banning tobacco products or use on school campuses. Although school health researchers have studied whether schools, districts, or states/provinces are meeting requirements, it is unclear to what extent implementation processes and determinants are assessed. The purposes of the present systematic review of quantitative measures of school policy implementation were to (1) identify quantitative school health policy measurement tools developed to measure implementation at the school, district, or state/provincial levels; (2) describe the policy implementation outcomes and determinants assessed and identify the trends in measurement; and (3) assess pragmatic and psychometric properties of identified implementation measures to understand their quality and suitability for broader application. METHODS Peer-reviewed journal articles published 1995-2020 were included if they (1) had multiple-item quantitative measures of school policy implementation and (2) addressed overall wellness, tobacco, physical activity, nutrition, obesity prevention, or mental health/bullying/social-emotional learning. The final sample comprised 86 measurement tools from 67 peer-review articles. We extracted study characteristics, such as psychometric and pragmatic measure properties, from included articles based on three frameworks: (1) Implementation Outcomes Framework, (2) Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and (3) Policy Implementation Determinants Framework. RESULTS Most implementation tools were developed to measure overall wellness policies which combined multiple policy topics (n = 35, 40%) and were in survey form (n = 75, 87%). Fidelity was the most frequently prevalent implementation outcome (n = 70, 81%), followed by adoption (n = 32, 81%). The implementation determinants most assessed were readiness for implementation, including resources (n = 43, 50%), leadership (n = 42, 49%), and policy communication (n = 41, 48%). Overall, measures were low-cost and had easy readability. However, lengthy tools and lack of reported validity/reliability data indicate low transferability. CONCLUSIONS Implementation science can contribute to more complete and rigorous assessment of school health policy implementation processes, which can improve implementation strategies and ultimately the intended health benefits. Several high-quality measures of implementation determinants and implementation outcomes can be applied to school health policy implementation assessment. Dissemination and implementation science researchers can also benefit from measurement experiences of school health researchers.","McLoughlin, Gabriella M; Allen, Peg; Walsh-Bailey, Callie; Brownson, Ross C",Implementation science communications,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00169-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174969/,594

The current COVID 19 pandemic impact on health services mandated an utmost readiness to implement telemedicine which in part is dependent on health care providers willingness to adopt such platforms. AIM The aim of this cross sectional study was to assess knowledge and attitude toward telemedicine Egyptian dermatologists amidst the COVID 19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross sectional study was designed and data were collected using structured self-administered online questionnaires. RESULTS Dermatologists had a good knowledge about telemedicine (mean 4.17 ± 1.63; p < 0.05). Of those completing the questionnaire, 193 (68.9%) were familiar with the term ""telemedicine"" and 164 (58.6%) were familiar with tools like teleconferencing. The majority of responding dermatologists 227 (81.1%) were confident that the COVID 19 pandemic is a good opportunity to start applying telemedicine protocols however the majority 234 (83.6%) preferred using it on trial basis at first before full implementation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and reorganization of chest pain centers (CPC) on the practice of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and prognosis of STEMI patients. This single-center retrospective survey included all patients with STEMI admitted to our CPC from January 22, 2020 to April 30, 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan), compared with those admitted during the analogous period in 2019, in respect of important time points of PPCI and clinical outcomes of STEMI patients. In the present article, we observed a descending trend in STEMI hospitalization and a longer time from symptom onset to first medical contact during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the control period (4.35 h versus 2.58 h). With a median delay of 17 minutes in the door to balloon time (D2B), the proportion of in-hospital cardiogenic shock was significantly higher in the COVID-19 era group (47.6% versus 19.5%), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) tend to increase in the 6-month follow-up period (14.3% versus 2.4%). Although the reorganization of CPC may prolong the D2B time, immediate revascularization of the infarct-related artery could be offered to most patients within 90 minutes upon arrival. PPCI remained the preferred treatment for patients with STEMI during COVID-19 pandemic in the context of timely implementation and appropriate protective measures.","Lu, Qing; Wang, Jiu-Long; Chen, Zhi-Nan; Fu, Wen-Bo; Liu, Hui-Jian; Ding, Shi-Fang",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2021.01.243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792269/,594
65145,A novel device for cleaning the camera port during laparoscopic surgery.,2016,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular mechanism that is triggered in order to cope with the stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This response is initiated by the endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and PKR-like ER kinase, which increase the expression of the genes involved in the folding and degradation processes and decrease the protein input into the ER by inhibiting translation. It has been shown that viruses both induce and manipulate the UPR in order to protect the host cells from an ER stress-mediated death, thus permitting the translation of viral proteins and the efficient replication of the virus. To understand the cellular events that occur during the rotavirus replication cycle, we examined the activation of the three UPR arms following infection, using luciferase reporters driven by promoters of the ER stress-responsive genes and real-time reverse transcription-PCR to determine the levels of the stress-induced mRNAs. Our findings indicated that during rotavirus infection two of the three arms of the UPR (IRE1 and ATF6) become activated; however, these pathways are interrupted at the translational level by the general inhibition of protein synthesis caused by NSP3. This response seems to be triggered by more than one viral protein synthesized during the replication of the virus, but not by the viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), since cells transfected with psoralen-inactivated virions, or with naked viral dsRNA, did not induce UPR.","Trujillo-Alonso, Vicenta; Maruri-Avidal, Liliana; Arias, Carlos F; López, Susana",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05620-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937647/,594
65661,Follow Up Data of MRI-Visible Synthetic Meshes for Reinforcement in Large Hiatal Hernia in Comparison to None-Mesh Repair-A Prospective Cohort Study.,2019,"Aquatic biofilms are heterogeneous assemblages of microorganisms surrounded by a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Recent studies suggest that aquatic biofilms can physically act as sorptive sponges of DNA. We took the opportunity from already available samples of stone biofilms and macroinvertebrates specimens collected in parallel at the same sites to test the capacity of biofilms to act as DNA samplers of macroinvertebrate communities in streams. Macroinvertebrate communities are usually studied with metabarcoding using the DNA extracted from their bodies bulk samples, which remains a time-consuming approach and involves the destruction of all individual specimens from the samples. The ability of biofilms to capture DNA was explored on 19 rivers sites of a tropical island (Mayotte Island, France). First, macroinvertebrate specimens were identified based on their morphological characteristics. Second, DNA was extracted from biofilms, and macroinvertebrate communities were targeted using a standard COI barcode. The resulting morphological and molecular inventories were compared. They provided comparable structures and diversities for macroinvertebrate communities when one is working with the unassigned OTU data. After taxonomic assignment of the OTU data, diversity and richness were no longer correlated. The ecological assessment derived from morphological bulk samples was conserved by the biofilms samples. We also showed that the biofilm method allows to detect a higher diversity for some organisms (Cnidaria), that is hardly accessible with the morphological method. The results of this study exploring the DNA signal captured by natural biofilms are encouraging. However, a more detailed study integrating more replicates and comparing the biodiversity signal based on both morphological and molecular bulk macroinvertebrate samples to the one captured by biofilms will be necessary. Better understanding how the DNA signal captured by natural biofilms represents the biodiversity of a given sampling site is necessary before considering its use for bioassessment applications.","Rivera, Sinziana F; Vasselon, Valentin; Mary, Nathalie; Monnier, Olivier; Rimet, Fréderic; Bouchez, Agnès",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385843/,594
65694,"Laparoscopic splenectomy: perioperative management, surgical technique, and results.",2014,"BACKGROUND Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and access to timely rehabilitation can reduce morbidity and help patients to return to normal life. Telerehabilitation can deliver rehabilitation services with the use of technology to increase patient options, deliver services more efficiently and overcome geographical barriers to healthcare access. Despite its popularity, there is conflicting evidence for its effectiveness. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to update the current evidence base on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation for stroke. METHODS A systematic search of databases (Medline Ovid; Embase; Emcare; Scopus; The Cochrane Library; PEDro; OTSeeker) was conducted in April 2018 (updated in October 2018). This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and methodology registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018090445). A modified McMaster critical appraisal tool for quantitative studies was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Given the heterogeneity of the included studies, a descriptive synthesis was conducted. RESULTS Out of 1868 studies, 13 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. A diverse range of interventions were delivered through a variety of telerehabilitation systems and the effectiveness measured through a myriad of outcome measures. Summarised findings from the heterogeneous evidence base indicate that telerehabilitation may have a positive impact on a range of primary and secondary outcomes. However, despite these positive findings, the current evidence lacks clarity and uniformity in terms of intervention parameters and measurement of outcomes, which limits broader application of these results. DISCUSSION Telerehabilitation, as an alternate form of rehabilitation for people with stroke, shows potential. However, due to methodological and practical concerns, an unequivocal recommendation cannot be made. Findings from this review may inform future policies and practices regarding the use of telerehabilitation for stroke patients.","Appleby, Emma; Gill, Sophie Taylor; Hayes, Lucinda Kate; Walker, Tessa Lauren; Walsh, Matt; Kumar, Saravana",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31714924/,594

66076,Characteristics of different mesh types for abdominal wall repair in an experimental model of peritonitis.,2017,"Bas-Congo virus (BASV) is a novel rhabdovirus recently identified from a patient with acute hemorrhagic fever in the Bas-Congo province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Here we show that the BASV glycoprotein (BASV-G) can be successfully used to pseudotype glycoprotein-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), allowing studies of BASV-G-driven membrane fusion and viral entry into target cells without replication-competent virus. BASV-G displayed broad tissue and species tropism in vitro, and BASV-G-mediated membrane fusion was pH dependent. The conformational changes induced in BASV-G by acidification were fully reversible and did not lead to inactivation of the viral fusion protein. Our data combined with comparative sequence similarity analyses suggest that BASV-G shares structural and functional features with other rhabdovirus glycoproteins and falls into the group of class III viral fusion proteins. However, activation of BASV-G-driven fusion required a lower pH and higher temperatures than did VSV-G-mediated fusion. Moreover, in contrast to VSV-G, mature BASV-G in VSV pseudotypes consists of a mixture of high-mannose and complex glycans that enables it to bind to certain C-type lectins, thereby enhancing its attachment to target cells. Taken together, the results presented in this study will facilitate future investigations of BASV-G-mediated cell entry and its inhibition in the absence of an infectious cell culture assay for BASV and at lower biosafety levels. Moreover, serology testing based on BASV-G pseudotype neutralization can be used to uncover the prevalence and importance of BASV as a potential novel human pathogen in the DRC and throughout Central Africa.","Steffen, Imke; Liss, Nathan M; Schneider, Bradley S; Fair, Joseph N; Chiu, Charles Y; Simmons, Graham",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01183-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23785218/,594
66308,"Short-term strength of non-penetrating mesh fixation: LifeMesh™, Tisseel™, and ProGrip™.",2017,"INTRODUCTION Trapezoidal fractures account for only 0.4% of all carpal bone fractures. Owing to their rarity, there is paucity in the literature regarding the clinical findings and treatment. This paper aims to summarize the current understanding of trapezoidal fractures and present a novel classification algorithm. METHODS A diagnostic classification algorithm was created based on the known blood supply and ligamentous attachment of the trapezoid. The proposed treatment algorithm was then applied to trapezoidal fractures in the literature to validate the algorithm and determine whether patients received treatment that was in accordance. RESULTS A total of 19 articles, representing 22 trapezoidal fractures were included, with two additional cases presented by the authors. Presenting symptoms were pain (n = 21) and swelling (n = 12). Diagnosis was made on CT in a majority of the time, 79.2% (n = 18). All outcomes were favorable with symptomatic resolution and full range of motion after treatment, except in four patients that had co-existing wrist injuries. When the algorithm was applied, 89.5% (n = 17) of the patients received treatment in accordance with the proposed algorithm and demonstrated good outcomes. In the remaining patients (n = 2) whose treatment differed, one had diminished grip strength and the other was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Given a degree of clinical suspicion including a history of blunt trauma to the hand and persisting pain, trapezoidal fractures should remain on the differential when plain radiographs fail to identify any fracture. Operative treatment is suggested if there is any significant displacement, compromise of the dorsal surface, or breech of the trapezoidal ligaments causing possible dislocation.

However how they enter and are deposited within the respiratory tract remains poorly documented. Data using animal testing led to the establishment of mathematical models allowing the estimation of aerosol dispersion risks. But direct extrapolation to humans is questionable and experimental models more physiologically representative of the inhalation route are welcome. The aim of this study was to develop a model as close as possible to the human anatomy and physiology allowing determining the deposition pattern of aerosolized Legionella while limiting in vivo experiments. To that purpose, we adapted the chimeric respiratory tract model we previously developed. This original model consisted of a replica of the human upper respiratory airways made by additive manufacturing connected to ex vivo porcine lungs ventilated by passive expansion, as for humans in physiological conditions. These experiments didn't imply specific animal sacrifices as pigs were bred for human consumption and lungs were considered as wastes by the slaughterhouse. Fluorescent Legionella were aerosolized and visualized using Cellvizio® Lab (probe-based confocal fluorescence microscope). Legionella were found in the whole respiratory tract. Broncho-alveolar lavages were also performed and the amount of Legionella reaching the thoracic region was quantified by culture and qPCR. Legionella were found preferentially in the left upper lobe compared to the right lower lobe. To our knowledge, it is the first time that experiments mimicking so closely human exposure by inhalation are performed while limiting animal experiments and providing a model for further Legionella infectious risk assessment.","Perinel, Sophie; Forest, Valérie; Landraud, Mathilde; Pourchez, Jérémie; Girardot, Françoise; Riffard, Serge; Stauffert, Magalie; Vergnon, Jean-Michel; Allegra, Séverine",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2017.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29174976/,594

METHODS A prospective AVM registry was searched to identify patients with Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II AVMs treated using resection during a 16-year period. RESULTS Of the 232 surgical patients included, 120 (52%) presented with hemorrhage, 33% had Spetzler-Martin Grade I, and 67% had Grade II AVMs. Overall, 99 patients (43%) underwent preoperative embolization, with unruptured AVMs embolized more often than ruptured AVMs. AVM resection was accomplished in all patients and confirmed angiographically in 218 patients (94%). There were no deaths among patients with unruptured AVMs. Good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-1) were found in 78% of patients, with 97% improved or unchanged from their preoperative mRS scores. Patients with unruptured AVMs had better functional outcomes (91% good outcome vs 65% in the ruptured group, p = 0.0008), while relative outcomes were equivalent (98% improved/unchanged in patients with ruptured AVMs vs 96% in patients with unruptured AVMs). CONCLUSIONS Surgery should be regarded as the ""gold standard"" therapy for the majority of low-grade AVMs, utilizing conservative embolization as a preoperative adjunct. High surgical cure rates and excellent functional outcomes in patients with both ruptured and unruptured AVMs support a dominant surgical posture for low-grade AVMS, with radiosurgery reserved for risky AVMs in deep, inaccessible, and highly eloquent locations. Despite the technological advances in endovascular and radiosurgical therapy, surgery still offers the best cure rate, lowest risk profile, and greatest protection against hemorrhage for low-grade AVMs. ARUBA results are influenced by a low randomization rate, bias toward nonsurgical therapies, a shortage of surgical expertise, a lower rate of complete AVM obliteration, a higher rate of delayed hemorrhage, and short study duration. Another randomized trial is needed to reestablish the role of surgery in unruptured AVM management.","Potts, Matthew B; Lau, Darryl; Abla, Adib A; Kim, Helen; Young, William L; Lawton, Michael T",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.12.jns14938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25658789/,594

METHODS From December 2004 to August 2008, 100 cirrhotic patients (54 men and 46 women) underwent Lap-Sp for a clinical application of interferon therapy. All the patients were Child-Pugh class A or B with thrombocytopenia (average platelet count, 56 × 10(3) /mm(3)). The HCV genotype was type 1 in 80 patients and type 2 in 20 patients. RESULTS Pure laparoscopic or hand-assisted laparoscopy was performed in 78 and 22 patients, respectively, without mortality. Conversion to open surgery was not required in any of the patients. The platelet counts improved (mean platelet count 172 × 10(3) /mm(3) 1 month after surgery) and interferon (IFN) therapy was started in 97 patients. In this study period, 36 patients obtained a sustained virologic response. Eight patients discontinued IFN therapy because of depression, neutropenia or other reasons. CONCLUSIONS Lap-Sp permits most patients with HCV cirrhosis and hypersplenism to receive sufficient IFN therapy. Therefore, Lap-Sp can become a strong supportive surgery for cirrhotic patients who require antiviral therapy.","Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Tomikawa, Morimasa; Kawanaka, Hirofumi; Furusyo, Norihiro; Kinjo, Nao; Tsutsumi, Norifumi; Nagao, Yoshihiro; Hayashi, Jun; Hashizume, Makoto; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.2011.06870.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21793908/,594

PATIENTS AND METHODS This is the first prospective observational study on patient-reported outcomes, quality of life (HRQOL) and satisfaction in patients with cancer with their care management in a day hospital during the period of May-June 2020. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Screener and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey were used. RESULTS The survey was completed by 189 of 267 patients. They were generally aged 61 to 70 years and women and presented with lung, breast, or colorectal cancer. Patients had low anxiety scores (mean: 3.2±4.5), with only 11.1% showing anxiety. Risk factors of anxiety included female gender (p=0.03) and lifestyle (residence, family environment) (p=0.01). The patient's physical health was stable, whereas mental health had deteriorated (p<0.0001). Risk factors of altered HRQOL included age and lifestyle. Patients greatly appreciated all the facilities of the day hospital and its organisation. CONCLUSION This study shows a preserved HRQOL and low anxiety of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Baffert, Kim-Arthur; Darbas, Tiffany; Lebrun-Ly, Valerie; Pestre-Munier, Julia; Peyramaure, Clementine; Descours, Clementine; Mondoly, Melanie; Latrouite, Simon; Bignon, Elisa; Nicouleau, Samantha; Geyl, Sophie; Leobon, Sophie; Deluche, Elise",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402524/,594
68179,Open vs robotic radical gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer.,2016,"BACKGROUND A renal biopsy is needed to define active inflammatory infiltration and guide therapeutic management in drug-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (D-ATIN). However, factors such as various contraindications, refusal of informed consent and limited technical support may stop the biopsy process. It is thus of great importance to explore approaches that could deduce probable pathologic changes. METHODS A total of 81 biopsy-proven D-ATIN patients were enrolled from a prospective cohort of ATIN patients at Peking University First Hospital. The systemic inflammation score (SIS) was developed based on the CRP and ESR levels at biopsy, and patients were divided into high-SIS, median-SIS, and low-SIS groups. The demographic data, clinicopathologic features, and renal outcomes were compared. RESULTS The SIS was positively correlated with inflammatory cell infiltration and was inversely correlated with interstitial fibrosis. The number of interstitial inflammatory cells increased significantly with increasing SISs. The proportions of neutrophils and plasma cells were the highest in the high-SIS group compared with the other two groups. Prednisone (30-40 mg/day) was prescribed in all patients. The high-SIS group tended to have more favorable renal restoration than the other two groups. By 12 months postbiopsy, a decreased eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was observed in 66.7% of medium-SIS patients, 32.4% of high-SIS patients, and 30.4% of low-SIS patients. CONCLUSION The SIS was positively correlated with active tubulointerstitial inflammation and therefore could help to aid therapeutic decisions in D-ATIN.","Zheng, Xi-Zi; Gu, Yang-Hui; Su, Tao; Zhou, Xu-Jie; Huang, Jun-Wen; Sun, Ping-Ping; Jia, Yan; Xu, Da-Min; Wang, Su-Xia; Liu, Gang; Yang, Li",BMC nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-020-02175-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243164/,594
68641,Ventral rectopexy with biological mesh: short-term functional results.,2018,"BACKGROUND Development of fistula-in-ano following incision and drainage (I&D) of anorectal abscesses occurs in over 30% of patients. It is associated with significant patient morbidity and societal cost. The use of antibiotics following drainage is controversial, with randomized controlled trials reporting opposing conclusions regarding their influence on the rate of fistula formation. Given the significant burden associated with their development, it is imperative to determine strategies to minimize their occurrence. The objective of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the role of antibiotics following I&D of anorectal abscesses on fistula formation. Secondary objectives include determining if antibiotics are associated with morbidity, repeat presentation to the emergency department, and requirement for reoperation. METHODS/DESIGN MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, http://apps.who.int/trialsearch , and clinicaltrials.gov will be searched to identify published and ongoing unpublished interventional and observational studies evaluating the role of antibiotics post I&D on the incidence of fistula formation. There will be no restriction on language, date, or journal. Title and abstracts as well as full texts will be screened in duplicate based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and ROBINS-I will be used to assess risk of bias in randomized and non-randomized studies, respectively. Our primary outcome is the incidence of fistula formation; secondary outcomes include morbidity, representation to ED, and reoperation. Study heterogeneity will be calculated with Cochran's Q test, P value, and I2 index. SASS (version 9.4) will be used for meta-analysis.

69375,The ABCdE score for PREdicting Lithotripsy Assistance during transcystic Bile duct Exploration by Laparoendoscopy (PRE-LABEL).,2020-10-14,"Background Chest computed tomography (CT) has been found to have high sensitivity in diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) at the early stage, giving it an advantage over nucleic acid detection during the current pandemic. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for the automatic detection of NCP, focusing particularly on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods A total of 148 confirmed NCP patients [80 male; median age, 51.5 years; interquartile range (IQR), 42.5-63.0 years] treated in 4 NCP designated hospitals between January 11, 2020 and February 23, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled as a training cohort, along with 194 confirmed IP patients (112 males; median age, 65.0 years; IQR, 55.0-78.0 years) treated in 5 hospitals from May 2015 to February 2020. An external validation set comprising 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from 8 hospitals was also enrolled. Two deep learning schemes (the Trinary scheme and the Plain scheme) were developed and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results Of the NCP lesions, 96.6% were >1 cm and 76.8% were of a density <-500 Hu, indicating them to have less consolidation than IP lesions, which had nodules ranging from 5-10 mm. The Trinary scheme accurately distinguished NCP from IP lesions, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. For patient-level classification in the external validation set, the Trinary scheme outperformed the Plain scheme (AUC: 0.87 vs. 0.71) and achieved human specialist-level performance. Conclusions Our study has potentially provided an accurate tool on chest CT for early diagnosis of NCP with high transferability and showed high efficiency in differentiating between NCP and IP; these findings could help to reduce misdiagnosis and contain the pandemic transmission.","Zhou, Min; Yang, Dexiang; Chen, Yong; Xu, Yanping; Xu, Jin-Fu; Jie, Zhijun; Yao, Weiwu; Jin, Xiaoyan; Pan, Zilai; Tan, Jingwen; Wang, Lan; Xia, Yihan; Zou, Longkuan; Xu, Xin; Wei, Jingqi; Guan, Mingxin; Yan, Fuhua; Feng, Jianxing; Zhang, Huan; Qu, Jieming",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-5328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33569413/,594
69754,Seasoned surgeons assessed in a laparoscopic surgical crisis.,2009,"BACKGROUND Neonates undergoing surgery and intensive care still carry a significant morbidity and mortality often related to hypoxic/ischemic events; some of which may go undetected by conventional monitoring. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive, continuous method of measuring regional tissue oxygen saturation, and may be used to supplement conventional monitoring to improve neonatal perioperative care. However, high costs and lack of evidence regarding improved outcomes have minimized wider perinatal use of NIRS. The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of NIRS in neonates and premature infants undergoing noncardiac surgeries. METHOD Neonates were monitored with both cerebral and renal NIRS for 24 h after induction of anesthesia and compared with systemic blood pressure (BP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), and heart rate (HR). RESULTS A total of 23 368 min of data were collected from 21 neonates. NIRS reported cerebral/renal hypoxia 2.8 (±8.3)%/19.3 (±25.4)% of the time intraoperatively and 9.6 (±17.0)%/9.9 (±18.9)% of the time postoperatively. A moderate positive correlation was found between SpO2 and NIRS (φcerebral = 0.371, φrenal = 0.542). BP showed a weaker positive correlation (φcerebral = 0.231, φrenal = 0.246), and HR no correlation (φcerebral = -0.083, φrenal = -0.029). NIRS reported hypoxia two to three times more frequently than SpO2 , and SpO2 readings were 10-15 s delayed compared to NIRS. Furthermore, NIRS appeared effective at detecting postoperative apnea. CONCLUSION Near-infrared spectroscopy is an easily applicable technique that appears effective at detecting hypoxic events and postoperative apneas in neonates. The high incidences of regional hypoxia reported by NIRS in this study imply that there is a need for a more specific regional cerebral and renal monitoring. Despite some practical and economical limitations, NIRS may be considered a useful supplement to perinatal perioperative intensive care.","Koch, Henrik W; Hansen, Tom G",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26725989/,594
70195,Psychomotor skills assessment by motion analysis in minimally invasive surgery on an animal organ.,2017,"BACKGROUND Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an uncommon autoimmune condition that impacts cartilaginous structures involving the ears, nose, respiratory tract, and joints. Its etiology is unknown; however, it may be associated with other systemic autoimmune diseases, malignancy, and rarely with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. RP has a variable pattern at presentation and may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fever and arthralgia, in addition to various auricular, ocular, respiratory, and cardiovascular manifestations. Auricular and ocular signs are the most common presenting features; however, idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome is considered a rare manifestation of the disease. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, but immunomodulatory therapy may be required for refractory cases. CASE REPORT We present a challenging case of RP in a 58-year-old woman with HIV controlled by highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and stable chronic reactive arthritis on sulfasalazine who developed unilateral auricular chondritis associated with contralateral idiopathic orbital inflammation and scleritis as well as worsening arthralgia. She was initially treated empirically with antibiotics, without clinical improvement. The infectious diseases work-up was unrevealing, and other diagnostic possibilities were meticulously excluded. Clinical suspicion for RP ultimately led to appropriate therapy with corticosteroids and subsequent immunosuppression with methotrexate, resulting in clinical improvement and allowing for gradual tapering of steroids. CONCLUSIONS RP is an uncommon multisystem disorder that can occur in the setting of other underlying chronic illnesses, as seen in our patient. It has a variable presentation and course, with no diagnostic laboratory tests; therefore, clinical suspicion is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management.","Alfraji, Nasam; Alpert, Deborah R",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.933327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580270/,594
70313,Vaginal vault drainage after complicated single-port access laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.,2017,"Cofilin is an actin filament severing protein necessary for fast actin turnover dynamics. Coronin and Aip1 promote cofilin mediated actin filament disassembly, but the mechanism is somewhat controversial. An early model proposed that the combination of cofilin, coronin, and Aip1 disassembled filaments in bursts. A subsequent study only reported severing. Here, we used electron microscopy to show that actin filaments convert directly into globular material. A monomer trap assay also shows that the combination of all three factors produces actin monomers faster than any two factors alone. We show that coronin accelerates the release of inorganic phosphate from actin filaments and promotes highly cooperative cofilin binding to actin to create long stretches of polymer with a hypertwisted morphology. Aip1 attacks these hypertwisted regions along their sides, disintegrating them into monomers or short oligomers. The results are consistent with a catastrophic mode of disassembly, not enhanced severing alone.","Tang, Vivian W; Nadkarni, Ambika V; Brieher, William M",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.015018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723865/,594
70329,Pediatric Surgery in the Time of COVID-19.,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND To improve decision making in the treatment of extreme obesity, the risks of bariatric surgical procedures require further characterization. METHODS We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of 30-day outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures at 10 clinical sites in the United States from 2005 through 2007. A composite end point of 30-day major adverse outcomes (including death; venous thromboembolism; percutaneous, endoscopic, or operative reintervention; and failure to be discharged from the hospital) was evaluated among patients undergoing first-time bariatric surgery. RESULTS There were 4776 patients who had a first-time bariatric procedure (mean age, 44.5 years; 21.1% men; 10.9% nonwhite; median body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 46.5). More than half had at least two coexisting conditions. A Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in 3412 patients (with 87.2% of the procedures performed laparoscopically), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was performed in 1198 patients; 166 patients underwent other procedures and were not included in the analysis. The 30-day rate of death among patients who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was 0.3%; a total of 4.3% of patients had at least one major adverse outcome. A history of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired functional status were each independently associated with an increased risk of the composite end point. Extreme values of body-mass index were significantly associated with an increased risk of the composite end point, whereas age, sex, race, ethnic group, and other coexisting conditions were not. CONCLUSIONS The overall risk of death and other adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery was low and varied considerably according to patient characteristics. In helping patients make appropriate choices, short-term safety should be considered in conjunction with both the long-term effects of bariatric surgery and the risks associated with being extremely obese.

70599,Female sexual function after pure transvaginal appendectomy: a cohort study.,2012,"PURPOSE Myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) with software-assisted determination of summed stress score (SSS) is of established importance for diagnosis/therapy planning in coronary artery disease. Differences in contour finding suggest algorithm-specific influence on quantification if heart axes are chosen incorrectly. Thus, this study quantified the influence of heart-axis tilt on SSS calculation using Quantitative Perfusion SPECT and 4D-MSPECT. PATIENTS AND METHODS Stress MPS of 50 men acquired on a triple-head gamma camera were correctly reoriented by experienced technologists (R0) and then tilted by 5 degrees/10 degrees/15 degrees/20 degrees/30 degrees/45 degrees along both long axes (R5-R45). SPECT images were quantified for SSS using QPS and 4D-MSPECT. SSS values for R0 and R5-R45 were analyzed using correlation analysis. Weighted kappa values (κ) were calculated to measure agreement regarding perfusion abnormality severity (4-step SSS rating: 0-3, 4-8, 9-13, and ≥14). RESULTS For QPS SSS correlation, R0 vs. tilted datasets remained very high (R > 0.97) up to 20 degrees, but degraded for higher tilts (R = 0.895/0.780 for 30 degrees/45 degrees). 4D-MSPECT showed comparable SSS correlation only up to 10 degrees (R > 0.95) and strong deterioration thereafter (R = 0.863-0.347 for 15-45 degrees). Deviation in severity class from R0 increased from 6/50 (R5; κ = 0.914) to 25/50 (R45; κ = 0.252) using QPS and from 7/50 (R5; κ = 0.899) to 33/50 (R45; κ = 0.065) using 4D-MSPECT. CONCLUSION For tilted MPS datasets, considerable differences in SSS calculation emerge using QPS and 4D-MSPECT. QPS showed more stable results than 4D-MSPECT.","Knollmann, Daniela; Raptis, Mardjan; Meyer, Philipp T; Winz, Oliver H; Krohn, Thomas; Schaefer, Wolfgang M",Clinical nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/rlu.0b013e31826a8051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23027208/,594
70718,Robot-assisted thoracoscopic resection of intralobar sequestration.,2009,"Unbalanced immune responses to pathogens can be life-threatening although the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show a hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-dependent microRNA (miR)-210 up-regulation in monocytes and macrophages upon pathogen interaction. MiR-210 knockout in the hematopoietic lineage or in monocytes/macrophages mitigated the symptoms of endotoxemia, bacteremia, sepsis, and parasitosis, limiting the cytokine storm, organ damage/dysfunction, pathogen spreading, and lethality. Similarly, pharmacologic miR-210 inhibition improved the survival of septic mice. Mechanistically, miR-210 induction in activated macrophages supported a switch toward a proinflammatory state by lessening mitochondria respiration in favor of glycolysis, partly achieved by downmodulating the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU. In humans, augmented miR-210 levels in circulating monocytes correlated with the incidence of sepsis, while serum levels of monocyte/macrophage-derived miR-210 were associated with sepsis mortality. Together, our data identify miR-210 as a fine-tuning regulator of macrophage metabolism and inflammatory responses, suggesting miR-210-based therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.","Virga, Federico; Cappellesso, Federica; Stijlemans, Benoit; Henze, Anne-Theres; Trotta, Rosa; Van Audenaerde, Jonas; Mirchandani, Ananda S; Sanchez-Garcia, Manuel A; Vandewalle, Jolien; Orso, Francesca; Riera-Domingo, Carla; Griffa, Alberto; Ivan, Cristina; Smits, Evelien; Laoui, Damya; Martelli, Fabio; Langouche, Lies; Van den Berghe, Greet; Feron, Olivier; Ghesquière, Bart; Prenen, Hans; Libert, Claude; Walmsley, Sarah R; Corbet, Cyril; Van Ginderachter, Jo A; Ivan, Mircea; Taverna, Daniela; Mazzone, Massimiliano",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abf0466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962944/,594

DESIGN Randomised controlled, adaptive, open label clinical trial. SETTING 28 hospitals in Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and US. PARTICIPANTS 465 adults admitted to hospital wards with covid-19 and increased D-dimer levels were recruited between 29 May 2020 and 12 April 2021 and were randomly assigned to therapeutic dose heparin (n=228) or prophylactic dose heparin (n=237). INTERVENTIONS Therapeutic dose or prophylactic dose heparin (low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin), to be continued until hospital discharge, day 28, or death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit, assessed up to 28 days. The secondary outcomes included all cause death, the composite of all cause death or any mechanical ventilation, and venous thromboembolism. Safety outcomes included major bleeding. Outcomes were blindly adjudicated. RESULTS The mean age of participants was 60 years; 264 (56.8%) were men and the mean body mass index was 30.3 kg/m2. At 28 days, the primary composite outcome had occurred in 37/228 patients (16.2%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 52/237 (21.9%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.10; P=0.12). Deaths occurred in four patients (1.8%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 18 patients (7.6%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.22, 0.07 to 0.65; P=0.006). The composite of all cause death or any mechanical ventilation occurred in 23 patients (10.1%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 38 (16.0%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.59, 0.34 to 1.02; P=0.06). Venous thromboembolism occurred in two patients (0.9%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and six (2.5%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.34, 0.07 to 1.71; P=0.19). Major bleeding occurred in two patients (0.9%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and four (1.7%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.52, 0.09 to 2.85; P=0.69). CONCLUSIONS In moderately ill patients with covid-19 and increased D-dimer levels admitted to hospital wards, therapeutic heparin was not significantly associated with a reduction in the primary outcome but the odds of death at 28 days was decreased. The risk of major bleeding appeared low in this trial.

This review will examine recent studies describing the impact of adenovirus, rhinovirus, hepatitis E and norovirus in the course of solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients, as well as their epidemiology and implications for infection prevention and control. RECENT FINDINGS Adenovirus transmission is poorly understood; recent studies increasingly point to reactivation of latent infection in the immunocompromised host. Rhinovirus shedding can persist for weeks after acute viral infection, complicating hospital infection control policies. Hepatitis E is increasingly recognized as a potential pathogen in the stem cell and solid organ transplant population, and should be considered in the work-up for unexplained liver function test abnormalities. Similar to rhinovirus, norovirus shedding from the gastrointestinal tract may persist for months in the immunocompromised host; infected patients are at a higher risk for transmitting norovirus compared with infected healthcare workers. SUMMARY Additional studies are needed, particularly with respect to transmission, for these community acquired viral infections, which often have devastating consequences in the immunocompromised patient population.","Kaltsas, Anna; Sepkowitz, Kent",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0b013e328355660b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766648/,594

Recent studies have demonstrated that higher viral loads were detected in the nasal cavity than the pharynx in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and otolaryngologists should carefully consider infection prevention in clinical practice for the treatment of nasal conditions. Moreover, several studies have indicated that anosmia is one of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, but the precise prevalence and mechanism remain unclear. Thus far, comorbidity of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis do not seem to be a major risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, we should develop strategies in clinical practice for treatment of nasal diseases during the pandemic.

Before and every 5 min during POEM we measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) using non-invasive finger cuff-derived pulse wave analysis. During POEM, the median MAP was higher than the median baseline MAP of 77 (67;86) mmHg. HR (median at baseline: 67 (60;72) bpm), CI (2.8 (2.5;3.2) L/min/m2), SVI (42 (34;51) mL/m2), and SVRI (1994 (1652; 2559) dyn × s × cm-5 × m-2) remained stable during POEM. Mixed model-derived 95% confidence limits of hemodynamic variables during POEM were 72 to 106 mmHg for MAP, 65 to 79 bpm for HR, 2.7 to 3.3 L/min/m2 for CI, 37 and 46 mL/m2 for SVI, and 1856 and 2954 dyn × s × cm-5 × m-2 for SVRI. POEM is a safe procedure with regard to cardiovascular dynamics as it does not markedly impair MAP, HR, CI, SVI, or SVRI.","Saugel, Bernd; Vokuhl, Christina; Pinnschmidt, Hans O; Rösch, Thomas; Petzoldt, Martin; Löser, Benjamin",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-020-00541-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32504156/,594

73350,"Extracorporeal ""Giant"" locking sliding knot in pediatric and neonatal minimally invasive surgery: indications, techniques, and outcomes.",2009,"BACKGROUND Quarantine with social distancing has reduced transmission of COVID-19; however, fear of the disease and these remedial measures cause anxiety and stress. It is not known whether these events have impacted the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and disorders of brain-gut interaction (DGBI). METHODS An online platform evaluated the prevalence of GI symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection utilized validated questionnaires and was fully anonymized. Findings were compared with identical data acquired in 2019. The association of results with stress and anxiety was analyzed. RESULTS Data were collected from 1896 subjects May - August 2019 to 980 non-identical subjects May - June 2020. GI symptoms were reported by 68.9% during the COVID-19 lockdown compared with 56.0% the previous year (p < 0.001). The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (26.3% vs. 20.0%; p < 0.001), functional dyspepsia (18.3% vs. 12.7%; p < 0.001), heartburn (31.7% vs. 26.2%, p = 0.002), and self-reported milk intolerance (43.5% vs. 37.8% p = 0.004) was higher during the pandemic. Many individuals reported multiple symptoms. Anxiety was associated with presence of all GI symptoms. High levels of stress impacted functional dyspepsia (p = 0.045) and abdominal pain (p = 0.013). The presence of DGBI (p < 0.001; OR 22.99), self-reported milk intolerance (p < 0.001; OR 2.50), and anxiety (p < 0.001; OR 2.18) was independently associated with increased GI symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of GI symptoms was significantly higher during the COVID-19 lockdown than under normal circumstances the previous year. This increase was attributable to increased numbers of patients with DGBI, an effect that was associated with anxiety.","Nakov, Radislav; Dimitrova-Yurukova, Desislava; Snegarova, Violeta; Nakov, Ventsislav; Fox, Mark; Heinrich, Henriette",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145679/,594

Many techniques were developed in radical prostatectomy operations. Robotic radical prostatectomy with the perineal approach is a new technique. CASE PRESENTATION A 66-year-old male patient presented because of lower urinary tract symptoms, a PSA value of 5.5 ng/ml was detected, prostate biopsy was performed under transrectal ultrasound guide, a Gleason 3+3 adenocarcinoma on 3/12 foci was reported at pathology. Robotic perineal radical prostatectomy (r-PRP) operation was performed in the patient who had a prostate volume of 130 cc with middle lobe and a body mass index of 32 without additional disease. The duration of operation was 140 minutes in total and the duration at the console was 95 minutes, the amount of bleeding was 85 cc and no intraoperative complication was detected. CONCLUSION r-PRP is a technique that can be applied safely without prolonging the operation period and without additional morbidity to the patient, preserving the oncologic and functional outcomes in patients with surgical history and large prostate volume.","Tugcu, Volkan; Simsek, Abdulmuttalip; Yigitbasi, Ismail; Yenice, Mustafa Gürkan; Sahin, Selcuk; Tasci, Ali Ishsan","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",https://doi.org/10.4081/aiua.2018.1.65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29633801/,594

METHODS Forty-five healthy participants accepted twirling, lifting-thrusting, and twirling plus lifting-thrusting manipulanions at right Zusanli (ST 36), respectively. The acupuncturist's and participants' Deqi sensations were collected by MGH Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS). The intensity and occurrence rate of soreness, dull pain, pressure, heaviness, fullness, numbness, sharp pain, warmth, coolness, and throbbing feelings of participants, and tightness, smooth, and tangle feelings of acupuncturist were measured. The correlation between the acupuncturist's and participant's Deqi sensations was analyzed. Surface electromyogram (EMG) were recorded before, during and after needling in 30 participants. The integrated EMG (iEMG), mean power frequency (MPF) and media frequency (MF) were analyzed. RESULT Both fullness and soreness of participants and tightness of acupuncturist were the most frequently occurred ones. A positive correlation between participants' fullness and acupuncturist's tightness was observed during the three aforementioned needling manipulations (P<0.05, OR>1). Almost all the needling sensations measured in the present study could be induced by the three needling manipulations. However, strength of Deqi sensations was exhibited as lifting-thrusting > twirling plus lifting-thrusting > twirling according to MASS index. The iEMG values were increased and MPF, MF values were decreased during needling compaired to those before needling, especially during lifting-thrusting (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The intensity and occurrence rate of the different Deqi sensations induced by different needling manipulations were basically similar. The fullness and soreness were both the most frequently induced Deqi sensations. The strongest Deqi sensation could be induced by lifting-thrusting manipulation. There is a positive correlation between participants' fullness and acupuncturist's tightness during the three needling manipulations. The myoelectricity around the acupoint is related to Deqi responses.

We aimed to investigate the immediate electrophysiological characteristics following modified ablation with 3 circular and 3 linear lesions in the thoracoscopic procedure via a unilateral approach. METHODS Between May 2015 and October 2018, 40 patients underwent the one-stage hybrid procedure for LsPAF. Isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV) and left atrium posterior wall (LAPW), excision of the left atrial appendage (LAA), and high-density endocardial mapping and individualized percutaneous catheter ablation for AF termination were performed. RESULTS The modified thoracoscopic procedure may enable successful PV and LAPW isolation and LAA removal. Endocardial electrophysiological examination showed 6 out of 40 (15%) patients with a right PV gap, 3 (7.5%) patients with incomplete roof lesions, and 8 (20%) patients with incomplete Dallas lesions. A total of 44 driving areas were mapped and ablated. Thirty-five patients achieved procedural AF termination. After a mean follow-up period of 26 months, the success rate of a single procedure was 85%. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the failure of procedural AF termination may be a risk factor in atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence. DISCUSSION Endocardial electrophysiological examination is a necessary partner to thoracoscopic ablation. Our modified thoracoscopic ablation and driving areas-based ablation contribute to high rates of procedural AF termination, which may lead to reduced recurrence rate. The hybrid procedure may be an effective strategy for the management of LsPAF.","Ma, Nan; Ding, Shiao; Zeng, Lijun; Tan, Chen; Li, Shengchao; Liu, Xingpeng; Mei, Ju",Heart and vessels,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00380-020-01760-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782749/,594

This study aimed to analyse the logistical, economic and training difficulties in MICS with a special focus on the Indian scenario. A systematic review of the current literature on MICS with an emphasis on these challenges was performed. MICS has been shown to have clear cost-benefit advantage that stems from shorter ICU and hospital stay, lesser transfusion requirements and avoidance of sternal wound complications. However, only limited reports are currently available detailing the economic and training challenges for the application of MICS in the developing world, particularly India. Though several challenges exist in widening MICS practice in India, these can be overcome through a target-oriented approach.","Ammannaya, Ganesh Kumar K; Solinas, Marco; Passino, Claudio",Archives of medical sciences.

OBJECTIVE We report 6-month clinical and radiologic follow-up data of the 20 patients prospectively enrolled in the Stent-Assisted Recanalization in acute Ischemic Stroke (SARIS) trial. METHODS Twenty patients were prospectively enrolled to receive self-expanding intra-arterial stents as first-line therapy for acute ischemic stroke treatment. Patients were scheduled for follow-up 6-months after treatment for clinical evaluation (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score obtained by a trained certified research nurse/nurse practitioner) and repeat cerebral angiography. Angiographic interpretation was performed by an independent adjudicator. RESULTS At 6 months, the mRS score was ≤3 in 60% of patients (n = 12) and was ≤2 in 55% of patients (n = 11). Mortality at the 6-month follow-up was 35% (n = 7). Follow-up angiography was performed for 85% (11 of 13) of surviving patients. All patients undergoing angiographic follow-up demonstrated Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 3 flow on digital subtraction angiography or stent patency on computed tomographic angiography. None of the patients demonstrated evidence of in-stent stenosis (≥50% vessel narrowing). CONCLUSION The midterm angiographic and clinical results following intracranial stent deployment for acute ischemic stroke are encouraging.

75285,Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy: Clinical Factors that Affect Operative Times and Techniques to Overcome Difficulties.,2017,"Lung aging is associated with structural remodeling, a decline of respiratory function and a higher susceptibility to acute and chronic lung diseases. Individual factors that modulate pulmonary aging include basic genetic configuration, environmental exposure, life-style and biography of systemic diseases. However, the actual aging of the lung takes place in pulmonary resident cells and is closely linked to aging of the immune system (immunosenescence). Therefore, this article reviews the current knowledge about the impact of aging on pulmonary cells and the immune system, without analyzing those factors that may accelerate the aging process in depth. Hallmarks of aging include alterations at molecular, cellular and cell-cell interaction levels. Because of the great variety of cell types in the lung, the consequences of aging display a broad spectrum of phenotypes. For example, aging is associated with more collagen and less elastin production by fibroblasts, thus increasing pulmonary stiffness and lowering compliance. Decreased sympathetic airway innervation may increase the constriction status of airway smooth muscle cells. Aging of resident and systemic immune cells leads to a pro-inflammatory milieu and reduced capacity of fighting infectious diseases. The current review provides an overview of cellular changes occurring with advancing age in general and in several cell types of the lung as well as of the immune system. Thereby, this survey not only aims at providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of pulmonary aging but also to identify gaps in knowledge that warrant further investigations.","Brandenberger, Christina; Mühlfeld, Christian",Cell and tissue research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-016-2511-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743206/,594

DESIGN Scoping review. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and CENTRAL), clinical trial registries, conference abstracts and professional guidelines from jurisdictions where MAID is legal, up to February 2020. Eligible report types included technical summaries, institutional policies, practice surveys, practice guidelines and clinical studies that describe MAID provision in adults who have provided informed consent for MAID. RESULTS 163 articles published between 1989 and 2020 met eligibility criteria. 75 studies described details for MAID administered by intravenous medications and 50 studies provided data on oral medications. In intravenous protocols, MAID was most commonly administered using a barbiturate (34/163) or propofol (22/163) followed by a neuromuscular blocker. Oral protocols most often used barbiturates alone (37/163) or in conjunction with an opioid medication (7/163) and often recommended using a prokinetic agent prior to lethal drug ingestion. Complications included prolonged duration of the dying process, difficulty in obtaining intravenous access and difficulty in swallowing oral agents. Most commonly, the role of physicians was prescribing (83/163) and administering medications (75/163). Nurses' roles included administering medications (17/163) and supporting the patient (16/163) or family (13/163). The role of families involved providing support to the patient (17/163) and bringing medications from the pharmacy for self-administration (4/163). CONCLUSIONS We identified several trends in MAID provision including common medications and doses for oral and parenteral administration, roles of healthcare professionals and families, and complications that may cause patient, family and provider distress. Future research should aim to identify the medications, dosages, and administration techniques and procedures that produce the most predictable outcomes and mitigate distress for those involved.","Zworth, Max; Saleh, Carol; Ball, Ian; Kalles, Gaelen; Chkaroubo, Anatoli; Kekewich, Mike; Miller, Paul Q; Dees, Marianne; Frolic, Andrea; Oczkowski, Simon",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641328/,594

Theories of antidepressant medication action traditionally have focused on the level of cell-to-cell interaction and synaptic neurotransmission. However, recent evidence suggests that modulation of synchronized electrical activity in neuronal networks is a common effect of antidepressant treatments, including not only medications, but also neuromodulatory treatments such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Synchronization of oscillatory network activity in particular frequency bands has been proposed to underlie neurodevelopmental and learning processes, and also may be important in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments. Here, we review current research on the relationship between neuroplasticity and oscillatory synchrony, which suggests that oscillatory synchrony may help mediate neuroplastic changes related to neurodevelopment, learning, and memory, as well as medication and neuromodulatory treatment for MDD. We hypothesize that medication and neuromodulation treatments may have related effects on the rate and pattern of neuronal firing, and that these effects underlie antidepressant efficacy. Elucidating the mechanisms through which oscillatory synchrony may be related to neuroplasticity could lead to enhanced treatment strategies for MDD.","Leuchter, Andrew F; Hunter, Aimee M; Krantz, David E; Cook, Ian A",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25809789/,594

In cross-sectional studies, homebound older adults have high levels of morbidity and mortality, but there is little evidence of longitudinal outcomes after becoming homebound. The aim of this research is to prospectively assess over 6 years the dynamics of homebound status, ongoing community residence, and death in a population of community-dwelling older adults who are newly homebound. DESIGN/SETTING Prospective cohort study using 2011-2018 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), an annual, nationally-representative longitudinal study of aging in the United States. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and sixty seven newly homebound older adults in 2012. MEASUREMENTS Homebound status was defined via self-report as living in the community but rarely/never leaving home in the prior month. Semi-homebound was defined as leaving the house only with difficulty or help. RESULTS One year after becoming newly homebound, 33.1% remained homebound, 22.8% were completely independent, 23.8% were semi-homebound, 2.2% were in a nursing home, and 18.0% died. Homebound status is highly dynamic; 6 years after becoming homebound, 13.5% remained homebound and 65.0% had died. Recovering from being homebound at 1 year was associated with younger age and lower baseline rates of receiving help with activities of daily living, in particular, with bathing. CONCLUSION Homebound status is a dynamic state. Even if transient, becoming homebound is strongly associated with functional decline and death. Identifying newly homebound older adults and developing interventions to mitigate associated negative consequences needs to be prioritized.","Ankuda, Claire K; Husain, Mohammed; Bollens-Lund, Evan; Leff, Bruce; Ritchie, Christine S; Liu, Shelley H; Ornstein, Katherine A",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683707/,594

Chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, also an immune-related disease, is the major etiological factor for HCC especially in Asia. As an immune regulator, which has pleiotropic activities on T cells, nature killer cells and dendritic cells and so on, the efficacy of thymalfasin on HCC patients has been proven by several pilot studies as an adjuvant therapy. Combination of thymalfasin significantly improved survival and prolonged the time to tumor recurrence in patients who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization after tumor resection. An improvement in patients' immunity has also been demonstrated. However, there is no large-scale randomized controlled study so far in resectable HCC patients. To confirm the role of thymalfasin adjuvant therapy in patients with HBV-related HCC after curative resection, a large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trial has been planned in China to investigate the effect of thymalfasin (1.6 mg twice a week for 12 months) on 2-year recurrence-free survival rate and tumor immune microenvironment.

With virions now reported reaching up to 1.5 μm in size and genomes of up to 2.5 Mb encoding components shared with cellular life forms, giant viruses exhibit a complexity similar to microbes, such as bacteria and archaea. Here, we review interactions of giant viruses with their hosts and defense strategies of giant viruses against their hosts and coinfecting microorganisms or virophages. We also searched by comparative genomics for homologies with proteins described or suspected to be involved in defense mechanisms. Our search reveals that natural immunity and apoptosis seem to be crucial components of the host defense against giant virus infection. Conversely, giant viruses possess methods of hijacking host functions to counteract cellular antiviral responses. In addition, giant viruses may encode other unique and complex pathways to manipulate the host machinery and eliminate other competing microorganisms. Notably, giant viruses have evolved defense mechanisms against their virophages and they might trigger defense systems against other viruses through sequence integration. We anticipate that comparative genomics may help identifying genes involved in defense strategies of both giant viruses and their hosts.","Chelkha, Nisrine; Levasseur, Anthony; La Scola, Bernard; Colson, Philippe",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090482/,594

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in elderly patients with HCC and to investigate cause-specific excess deaths associated with increasing number of elderly patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We enrolled 1401 naive patients with HCC who were treated initially by RFA from 1999 to 2011. Patients below 75 years of age were categorized as 'younger' and those at least 75 as 'elderly'. Differences in the demographic and laboratory data of these patients were assessed, along with Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival using the log-rank test. In addition, we assessed the causes of death, defined as liver related and liver unrelated, by competing risk analysis and risk factors for respective causes of death by a proportional subdistribution model. RESULTS Overall, 353 patients were categorized as elderly. Elderly patients were more likely to be women, infected with hepatitis C virus, and score better in the Child-Pugh classification. The mortality at 5 years was lower in the elderly than in the younger patients (47.3 vs. 37.1%; P<0.001). Competing risk analysis showed a significant difference in liver-unrelated death (P<0.001) between the two groups, whereas there were no significant differences in liver-related death (P=0.64). By the proportional subdistribution model, age was a significant risk factor only for liver-unrelated death. CONCLUSION RFA provided satisfactory 5-year survival rates in elderly patients with HCC. The elderly tended to die from liver-unrelated causes.","Fujiwara, Naoto; Tateishi, Ryosuke; Kondo, Mayuko; Minami, Tatsuya; Mikami, Shintaro; Sato, Masaya; Uchino, Koji; Enooku, Kenichiro; Masuzaki, Ryota; Nakagawa, Hayato; Kondo, Yuji; Asaoka, Yoshinari; Shiina, Shuichiro; Yoshida, Haruhiko; Koike, Kazuhiko",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000000161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051219/,594

77951,Laparoscopic posterior mesh rectopexy for rectal prolapse is a safe procedure in older patients: A prospective follow-up study.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Severe acute lower respiratory infections (SARIs) are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in young children, especially in developing countries. The present study focused on detection of risk factors for prolonged hospital stays among children with viral SARIs. METHODOLOGY A sentinel surveillance study was conducted at Cairo University Hospital (CUH) between February 2010 and May 2011. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected from all children admitted with SARIs. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS Out of 1,046 children, 380 (36%) were positive for one or more viruses; these included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.9%), adenovirus (6.2%), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs1-3) (5.1%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (4.5%), influenza A (1.4%), and influenza B (0.6%). Viral etiology was mainly detected in children under one year of age (88.9%). Prolonged length of stay was independently associated with the presence of cyanosis and underlying chronic illness (OR 7.4, CI: 1.8-30.32 [p = 0.005], OR 2.5, CI: 1.36-4.64 [p = 0.004], respectively). Virus type did not affect the length of hospital stay (p > 0.05). Oxygen therapy was required in 91% of the patients. A total of 43 patients (11.6%) required intensive care admission. Twenty-one patients (5.5%) died, and 15 of them (71.4%) had an underlying chronic illness. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated the important burden of respiratory viruses as a cause of SARI in hospitalized children in a tertiary Egyptian hospital. Cyanosis and underlying chronic illness were significantly associated with prolonged length of stay.","El Kholy, Amani A; Mostafa, Nadia A; Ali, Aliaa Adel; El-Sherbini, Seham Awad; Ismail, Reem Ibrahim; Magdy, Rania Ismail; Soliman, May Sherif; Said, Mayar M",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.4682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313605/,594

Among all kinds of device structures, conventional n-i-p SSCs with top organic hole transport layers (HTLs) show great potential since organic HTLs could be well-designed to smoothly extract holes from the Se single absorber and protect the Se surface. However, till now, the performance of Se solar cells with organic HTLs is not as good as expected. To address this issue, herein, the SSCs are first presented with organic polymers as the HTLs with the improved efficiency up to 4.3%, which is the highest one in organic HTLs-based SSCs. Additionally, comparing with perovskite solar cells, it is found that the recombination process is the key factor that influences the performance of SSCs. It is believed that the further optimization of the Se active layer and the design of new and suitable organic HTLs for SSCs should be the main focus to suppress the undesired recombination processes of Se films. Such realization would boost the efficiency of the as-fabricated SSCs.","Liu, Wenbo; Yu, Fei; Fan, Weijun; Li, Wei-Shi; Zhang, Qichun",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202101226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323356/,594

High throughput methods such as the ""-omic'' technologies generate vast amounts of data that facilitate dissection of immunological processes at ever finer resolution. Using high-resolution data-driven systems analysis, causal relationships between complex molecular processes and particular immunological phenotypes can be constructed. However, processes in tissues, organs, and the organism itself (so-called higher level processes) also control and regulate the molecular (lower level) processes. Reverse systems engineering approaches, which focus on the examination of the structure, dynamics and control of the immune system, can help to understand the construction principles of the immune system. Such integrative mechanistic models can properly describe, explain, and predict the behavior of the immune system in health and disease by combining both higher and lower level processes. Moving from molecular and cellular levels to a multiscale systems understanding requires the development of methodologies that integrate data from different biological levels into multiscale mechanistic models. In particular, 3D imaging techniques and 4D modeling of the spatiotemporal dynamics of immune processes within lymphoid tissues are central for such integrative approaches. Both dynamic and global organ imaging technologies will be instrumental in facilitating comprehensive multiscale systems immunology analyses as discussed in this review.","Ludewig, Burkhard; Stein, Jens V; Sharpe, James; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Thiel, Volker; Bocharov, Gennady",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201242508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23255008/,594

However, few studies have explored the efficacy of forced-air warming in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. AIM/OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of forced-air warming for preventing perioperative hypothermia and complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS A total of 127 participants undergoing laparoscopic thoracic or abdominal surgery were recruited between January and November 2015. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention (forced-air warming, n = 64) and control groups (passive insulation, n = 63). Oesophageal core temperature was measured during surgery, whilst tympanic core temperature was measured every 30 minutes preoperatively and in the postanaesthesia care unit. Levels of shivering and pain, amount of bleeding, and adverse cardiac events were measured before the transfer from the postanaesthesia care unit. The generalized estimating equation was used for data analysis. RESULTS The intervention group had better warming efficacy than the control group between 90 and 330 minutes during surgery. The intervention group had fewer complications than the control group in terms of intraoperative bleeding, time to rewarm to 36°C, pain levels, and shivering levels in the postanaesthesia care unit. CONCLUSION Forced-air warming can increase warming efficacy and reduce complications of perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.","Su, Shu-Fen; Nieh, Hsiao-Chi",International journal of nursing practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.12660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682865/,594

However, the intercellular signaling that drives these processes remains poorly understood. Applying a multimodal approach, we identified alveolar type 1 (AT1) epithelial cells as a distinct signaling hub. Lineage tracing demonstrates that AT1 progenitors align with receptive, force-exerting myofibroblasts in a spatial and temporal manner. Through single-cell chromatin accessibility and pathway expression (SCAPE) analysis, we demonstrate that AT1-restricted ligands are required for myofibroblasts and alveolar formation.

The effect of PVDF-PVP-TiO2-FeCl3 (PPTFe) membrane filtration-photocatalytic system on the removal of trace concentration of sulfadiazine (SD) in water was evaluated. A two-factor four-level experiment was established to optimize 16 self-made modified membranes. The optimal membrane was then characterized in seven tests (SEM, EDS, membrane pure water flux, contact angle, porosity, mean pore size, ATR-FTIR), resulting in the optimal ratio (PPTFe membrane with 1.2 wt%TiO2 and 0.8 wt%FeCl3). Compared with the original membrane, the pore number, pore size, permeability, and hydrophilicity of the PPTFe membrane were all enhanced. The removal efficiency (92.63%) of SD by PPTFe membrane filtration-photocatalysis system was investigated. The reaction rate (0.0214 min-1) of the removal SD of the system was determined according to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The removal performance of membrane type, pH, and water quality parameters (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HA) on PPTFe membrane filtration-photocatalytic system were also made a deep inquiry. The results reflected that acidic conditions (pH = 3) were beneficial to SD removal, the presence of Cl-, SO42-, and HA could inhibit SD removal, while the existence of NO3- was unaffected. Furthermore, the removal rate of SD in the actual water body was displayed well in this system. Finally, the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism was proposed.Graphical abstract.","Zhou, Anran; Wang, Yonglei; Sun, Shaohua; Xin, Xiaodong; Wang, Mingquan; Zhao, Qinghua; Zhu, Huanhuan; Jia, Ruibao",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10426-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803580/,594

As such, Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) have contributed to the advancement of primatology in both field and laboratory settings. Specifically, Japanese macaques serve as an excellent model for investigating postnatal development and seasonal breeding in primates because of their relatively prolonged juvenile period and distinct seasonal breeding activity in adulthood. Pioneering histological studies have examined the developmental associations between their reproductive states and spermatogenesis by morphological observation. However, a molecular histological atlas of Japanese macaque spermatogenesis is only in its infancy, limiting our understanding of spermatogenesis ontogeny related to their reproductive changes. Here, we performed immunofluorescence analyses of spermatogenesis in Japanese macaque testes to determine the expression of a subset of marker proteins. The present molecular histological analyses readily specified major spermatogonial subtypes as SALL4+ A spermatogonia and Ki67+/C-KIT+ B spermatogonia. The expression of DAZL, SCP1, γH2AX, VASA, and calmegin further showed sequential changes regarding the protein expression profile and chromosomal structures during spermatogenesis in a differentiation stage-specific manner. Accordingly, comparative analyses between subadults and adults identified spermatogenic deficits in differentiation and synchronization in subadult testes.

Methods The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test was evaluated vs. a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) laboratory-based assay (Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV) in nasopharyngeal swabs collected from a series of consecutive patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to the Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) over a 2-week period. Results The final study population consisted of 321 consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years and IQR, 32-56 years; 181 women, 56.4%), with 149/321 (46.4%) positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via the Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV Assay, and 109/321 (34.0%) positive with Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, respectively. The overall accuracy of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test compared to molecular testing was 86.9%, with 72.5% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. Progressive decline in performance was observed as cycle threshold (Ct) values of different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets increased. The sensitivity was found to range between 97-100% in clinical samples with Ct values <25, between 50-81% in those with Ct values between 25 and <30, but low as 12-18% in samples with Ct values between 30 and <37. Conclusions The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is excellent in nasopharyngeal swabs with Ct values <25, which makes it a reliable screening test in patients with high viral load. However, mass community screening would require the use of more sensitive techniques.","Salvagno, Gian Luca; Gianfilippi, Gianluca; Bragantini, Damiano; Henry, Brandon M; Lippi, Giuseppe",Diagnosis,https://doi.org/10.1515/dx-2020-0154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554511/,594

A new RF electrode is described to overcome this limitation. METHODS A bicomponent conformal (BCC) RFA probe providing sectorial sequential ablation followed by circumferential cutting is designed and evaluated. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis model was developed with temperature feedback-controlled simulation of RFA for electrode design and optimization. The prototype bipolar BCC probe with three embedded thermocouples was constructed and evaluated in tissue-mimicking phantoms. RESULTS Maximum tissue temperature was kept <100 ºC with power applied <15 W. A 10-min ablation time was used for each sequence and after four sequential RFA, a large ablation zone of 55 cm3 was achieved. Our experiment confirmed that lesions exceeding 3.7 cm could be ablated and separated from the surrounded tissue. CONCLUSION The new BCC probe is, thus, capable of controlled ablation followed by circumferential separation of the lesions, when required. SIGNIFICANCE The results of these experiments provide the proof of concept validation that the BCC probe has the potential to ablate by sequential heating tumors in solid organs >3.5 cm then separate them by electrosurgical cutting from the surrounding normal parenchyma. The combined RF ablation and physical separation could completely destroy the cancer cells at the ablation site, thus, avoid any local recurrence of cancer. It requires further in vivo validation studies in large animals.","Wang, Zhigang; Luo, Hongyan; Coleman, Stuart; Cuschieri, Alfred",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2016.2573043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27244716/,594

82822,Histologic and biomechanical evaluation of crosslinked and non-crosslinked biologic meshes in a porcine model of ventral incisional hernia repair.,2011,"Despite more than a century of research, the aetiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear and finding disease modifying treatments for AD presents one of the biggest medical challenges of our time. AD pathology is characterized by deposits of aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ) in amyloid plaques and aggregated tau in neurofibrillary tangles. These aggregates begin in distinct brain regions and spread throughout the brain in stereotypical patterns. Neurodegeneration, comprising loss of synapses and neurons, occurs in brain regions with high tangle pathology, and an inflammatory response of glial cells appears in brain regions with pathological aggregates. Inheriting an apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele strongly increases the risk of developing AD for reasons that are not yet entirely clear. Substantial amounts of evidence support a role for APOE in modulating the aggregation and clearance of Aβ, and data have been accumulating recently implicating APOE4 in exacerbating neurodegeneration, tau pathology and inflammation. We hypothesize that APOE4 influences all the pathological hallmarks of AD and may sit at the interface between neurodegeneration, inflammation and the spread of pathologies through the brain. Here, we conducted a systematic search of the literature and review evidence supporting a role for APOE4 in neurodegeneration and inflammation. While there is no direct evidence yet for APOE4 influencing the spread of pathology, we postulate that this may be found in future based on the literature reviewed here. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of understanding the role of APOE in multiple important pathological mechanisms in AD.","Tzioras, M; Davies, C; Newman, A; Jackson, R; Spires-Jones, T",Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/nan.12529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30394574/,594

To inform such initiatives, this paper analyses the Community Led Ebola Action (CLEA) approach implemented through the Social Mobilization Action Consortium (SMAC) during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. The SMAC initiative consisted of a network of 2466 community mobilisers, >6000 religious leaders and 42 local radio stations across all 14 districts of Sierra Leone. Community mobilisers were active in nearly 70% of all communities across the country using the CLEA approach to facilitate community analysis, trigger collective action planning and maintain community action plans over time. CLEA was complemented by interactive radio programming and intensified religious leader engagement.Community mobilisers trained in the CLEA approach used participatory methods, comprised of an initial community 'triggering' event, action plan development and weekly follow-ups to monitor progress on identified action items. Mobilisers collected operational and behavioural data on a weekly basis as part of CLEA. We conducted a retrospective analysis of >50 000 weekly reports from approximately 12 000 communities from December 2014 to September 2015. The data showed that 100% of the communities that were engaged had one or more action plans in place. Out of the 63 110 cumulative action points monitored by community mobilisers, 92% were marked as 'in-progress' (85%) or 'achieved' (7%) within 9 months. A qualitative examination of action points revealed that the in-progress status was indicative of the long-term sustainability of most action points (eg, continuous monitoring of visitors into the community) versus one-off action items that were marked as achieved (eg, initial installation of handwashing station). Analysis of behavioural outcomes of the intervention indicate an increase over time in the fraction of reported safe burials and fraction of reported cases referred for medical care within 24 hours of symptom onset in the communities that were engaged.Through CLEA, we have demonstrated how large-scale, coordinated community engagement interventions can be achieved and monitored in real-time during future Ebola epidemics and other similar epidemics. The SMAC initiative provides a practical model for the design, implementation and monitoring of community engagement, integration and coordination of community engagement interventions with other health emergency response pillars, and adaptive strategies for large-scale community-based operational data collection.","Bedson, Jamie; Jalloh, Mohamed F; Pedi, Danielle; Bah, Saiku; Owen, Katharine; Oniba, Allan; Sangarie, Musa; Fofanah, James S; Jalloh, Mohammed B; Sengeh, Paul; Skrip, Laura; Althouse, Benjamin M; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent",BMJ global health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830128/,594
83455,A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Laparoscopic Lens Defogging Techniques through Simulation Model.,2018,"Parkinson's disease is associated with α-synuclein (α-syn), a cytosolic protein enriched in presynaptic terminals. The biological function of α-syn remains elusive; however, increasing evidence suggests that the protein is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion, signifying the importance of α-syn-lipid interactions. We show that α-syn preferentially binds to GM1-rich, liquid-ordered lipid domains on cytoplasmic membranes by using unroofed cells, which encapsulates lipid complexity and cellular topology. Moreover, proteins (Rab3a, syntaxin-1A, and VAMP2) involved in exocytosis also localize with α-syn, supporting its proposed functional role in exocytosis. To investigate how these lipid/protein interactions influence α-syn at the residue level, α-syn was derivatized with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl [NBD]) at different N- and C-terminal sites. Measurements of NBD fluorescence lifetime distributions reveal that α-syn adopts a multitude of membrane-bound conformations, which were not recapitulated in simple micelle or vesicle models, indicating an exquisite sensitivity of the protein to the complex lipid environment. Interestingly, these data also suggest the participation of the C terminus in membrane localization, which is generally overlooked and thus emphasize the need to use cellularly derived and biologically relevant membranes for biophysical characterization. Collectively, our results demonstrate that α-syn is more conformationally dynamic at the membrane interface than previously appreciated, which may be important for both its physiological and pathological functions.","Kaur, Upneet; Lee, Jennifer C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006291117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719116/,594
83559,A critical review of the safety of minimally invasive surgery in the era of COVID-19.,2020-10-27,"Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus that infects the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals, including cattle, rodents, and dogs. In these nonnatural hosts, PRV always causes a severe acute and lethal neuropathy called the ""mad itch,"" which is uncommon in swine. Thus far, the pathophysiological and immunological processes leading to the development of the neuropathic itch and the death of the animal are unclear. Using a footpad inoculation model, we established that mice inoculated with PRV-Becker (virulent strain) develop a severe pruritus in the foot and become moribund at 82 h postinoculation (hpi). We found necrosis and inflammation with a massive neutrophil infiltration only in the footpad and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) by hematoxylin and eosin staining. PRV load was detected in the foot, PNS, and central nervous system tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Infected mice had elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) and chemokines (Gro-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1). Significant IL-6 and G-CSF levels were detected in several tissues at 82 hpi. High plasma levels of C-reactive protein confirmed the acute inflammatory response to PRV-Becker infection. Moreover, mice inoculated with PRV-Bartha (attenuated, live vaccine strain) did not develop pruritus at 82 hpi. PRV-Bartha also replicated in the PNS, and the infection spread further in the brain than PRV-Becker. PRV-Bartha infection did not induce the specific and lethal systemic inflammatory response seen with PRV-Becker. Overall, we demonstrated the importance of inflammation in the clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice and provide new insights into the process of PRV-induced neuroinflammation.IMPORTANCE Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus related to human pathogens such as herpes simplex virus 1 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals. In susceptible animals other than pigs, PRV infection always causes a characteristic lethal pruritus known as the ""mad itch."" The role of the immune response in the clinical outcome of PRV infection is still poorly understood. Here, we show that a systemic host inflammatory response is responsible for the severe pruritus and acute death of mice infected with virulent PRV-Becker but not mice infected with attenuated strain PRV-Bartha. In addition, we identified IL-6 and G-CSF as two main cytokines that play crucial roles in the regulation of this process. Our findings give new insights into neuroinflammatory diseases and strengthen further the similarities between VZV and PRV infections at the level of innate immunity.","Laval, K; Vernejoul, J B; Van Cleemput, J; Koyuncu, O O; Enquist, L W",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01614-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30258005/,594

84061,Differences in open versus laparoscopic gastric bypass mortality risk using the Obesity Surgery Mortality Risk Score (OS-MRS).,2015,"BACKGROUND Hearing loss in newborns and children is a public health concern, due to high prevalence and negative effects on their development. Early detection and intervention of childhood hearing loss may mitigate these negative effects. Population-based newborn hearing screening programs have been established worldwide to identify children at risk for congenital hearing loss and to follow children at risk for late onset or progressive hearing loss. This article presents the protocol for a systematic review that aims to review the risk factors associated with permanent hearing loss in children, including congenital, early, or late onset. Risk factors associated with progressive hearing loss will be investigated as a secondary aim. METHODS Scientific literature from the following databases will be investigated: MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase, and CINAHL. The primary outcome is a permanent bilateral or unilateral hearing loss with congenital onset or onset during childhood (birth to 18 years). The secondary outcome is progressive hearing loss. Studies must report data on risk factors associated with permanent hearing loss; risk factors may be present at birth or later and result in immediate or delayed hearing loss. Randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, nonrandomized comparative and non-comparative studies, and case series will be included. The risk of bias will be assessed using the Qualitative Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (McMaster University). If aggregation of data is possible for a subsection of studies, we will pool data using meta-analysis techniques. If aggregation of data is not possible, a qualitative synthesis will be presented. We will assess the quality and strength of the overall body of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. DISCUSSION The resulting information will inform the update of a provincial audiological surveillance protocol for the Ontario Infant Hearing Program and will be applicable to early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) programs worldwide.

However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Objective To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participant This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course. Exposure Cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures Detection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Results An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization. Conclusions and Relevance This case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.","Inciardi, Riccardo M; Lupi, Laura; Zaccone, Gregorio; Italia, Leonardo; Raffo, Michela; Tomasoni, Daniela; Cani, Dario S; Cerini, Manuel; Farina, Davide; Gavazzi, Emanuele; Maroldi, Roberto; Adamo, Marianna; Ammirati, Enrico; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Lombardi, Carlo M; Metra, Marco",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219357/,594
84513,Future liver remnant growth after various portal vein embolization regimens: a quantitative comparison.,2019,"Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 d after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, it is not known how long antibody responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from reinfection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 d post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 individuals with real-time quantitative PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we show seroconversion (immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgA, IgG) in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody responses when sampled beyond 8 d POS. We show that the kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response is typical of an acute viral infection, with declining neutralizing antibody titres observed after an initial peak, and that the magnitude of this peak is dependent on disease severity. Although some individuals with high peak infective dose (ID50 > 10,000) maintained neutralizing antibody titres >1,000 at >60 d POS, some with lower peak ID50 had neutralizing antibody titres approaching baseline within the follow-up period. A similar decline in neutralizing antibody titres was observed in a cohort of 31 seropositive healthcare workers. The present study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing and antibody protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, and may suggest that vaccine boosters are required to provide long-lasting protection.","Seow, Jeffrey; Graham, Carl; Merrick, Blair; Acors, Sam; Pickering, Suzanne; Steel, Kathryn J A; Hemmings, Oliver; O'Byrne, Aoife; Kouphou, Neophytos; Galao, Rui Pedro; Betancor, Gilberto; Wilson, Harry D; Signell, Adrian W; Winstone, Helena; Kerridge, Claire; Huettner, Isabella; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Lista, Maria Jose; Temperton, Nigel; Snell, Luke B; Bisnauthsing, Karen; Moore, Amelia; Green, Adrian; Martinez, Lauren; Stokes, Brielle; Honey, Johanna; Izquierdo-Barras, Alba; Arbane, Gill; Patel, Amita; Tan, Mark Kia Ik; O'Connell, Lorcan; O'Hara, Geraldine; MacMahon, Eithne; Douthwaite, Sam; Nebbia, Gaia; Batra, Rahul; Martinez-Nunez, Rocio; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Edgeworth, Jonathan D; Neil, Stuart J D; Malim, Michael H; Doores, Katie J",Nature microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-00813-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106674/,594

84854,Robotic radical anterior pelvic exenteration: the UCI experience.,2011,"BACKGROUND Hydrodynamic gene delivery has proved an efficient strategy for nonviral gene therapy in the murine liver but it has been less efficient in pigs. The reason for such inefficiency remains unclear. The present study used a surgical strategy to seal the whole pig liver in vivo. METHODS A solution of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) DNA was injected under two different venous injection conditions (anterograde and retrograde), employing flow rates of 10 and 20 ml/s in each case, with the aim of identifying the best gene transfer conditions. The gene delivery and information decoding steps were evaluated by measuring the eGFP DNA, mRNA and protein copy number 24 h after transfection. In addition, gold nanoparticles (diameters of 4 and 15 nm) were retrogradely injected (10 ml/s) to observe, by electron microscopy, the ability of the particle to access the hepatocyte. RESULTS The gene delivery level was higher with anterograde injection, whereas the efficacy of gene expression was better with retrograde injection, suggesting differences in the decoding processes. Thus, retrograde injection mediates gene transcription (mRNA copy/cell) equivalent to that of intermediate expression proteins but the mRNA translation was lower than that of rare proteins. Electron microscopy showed that nanoparticles within the hepatocyte were almost exclusively 4 nm in diameter. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the low activity of mRNA translation limits the final efficacy of the gene transfer procedure. On the other hand, the gold nanoparticles study suggests that elongated DNA conformation could offer advantages in that the access of 15-nm particles is very limited.","Sendra, Luis; Carreño, Omar; Miguel, Antonio; Montalvá, Eva; Herrero, María José; Orbis, Francisco; Noguera, Inmaculada; Barettino, Domingo; López-Andújar, Rafael; Aliño, Salvador F",The journal of gene medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgm.2777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092576/,594

The aim of this study was to determine whether Hypnotherapy (HT) is not inferior to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychotherapy, in the percentage reduction of depressive symptoms, assessed in mild to moderate Major Depression (MD). METHODS This study reports the main results of a monocentric two-armed randomized-controlled rater-blind clinical trial. A total of 152 patients with MD were randomized to either CBT or HT receiving outpatient individual psychotherapy with 16 to 20 sessions for the duration of six months. The primary outcome was the mean percentage improvement in depressive symptoms assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after treatment. RESULTS The difference in the mean percentage symptom reduction between HT and CBT was 2.8 (95% CI=-9.85 to 15.44) in the Intention-to-treat sample and 4.0 (95% CI=-9.27 to 17.27) in the Per Protocol sample (N=134). Concerning the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -16.4, both results confirm the non-inferiority of HT to CBT. The results for the follow-ups six and twelve months after the end of the treatment support the primary results. LIMITATIONS For ethical reasons the trial did not include a control group without treatment; therefore we can only indirectly conclude that both treatment conditions are effective. CONCLUSION This is the first study to demonstrate that HT was not inferior to CBT in MD, while employing rigorous methodological standards.","Fuhr, Kristina; Meisner, Christoph; Broch, Angela; Cyrny, Barbara; Hinkel, Juliane; Jaberg, Joana; Petrasch, Monika; Schweizer, Cornelie; Stiegler, Anette; Zeep, Christina; Batra, Anil",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725616/,594

This review focuses on recent literature around attempts to contain the impact of these two viral epidemics that have refined our approach for the future. RECENT FINDINGS Attempts to contain emerging epidemics at the site of origin have so far failed, in part due to resourcing of surveillance. H1N1 09 revealed major problems with rigid pandemic planning and the need for much greater flexibility. Popular attempts to prevent international spread of pandemics have minimal efficacy. Availability of rapid diagnostic tests is critical to optimally managing epidemics and was a major problem with H1N1 09. Healthcare institutions have emerged as a major source of infection. SUMMARY The experience with H1N1 09 and SARS has been very useful in informing us of the strengths and weaknesses of our current approach to emerging epidemics. Key messages are a need for improved surveillance, more flexible planning, improved diagnostic testing and retaining a focus on basic hygiene measures.","Waterer, Grant",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0b013e328343b720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21252658/,594

Right now, one of the main questions about COVID-19 is whether the second wave is less severe and deadly than the first wave. In order to answer this challenging question, we decided to evaluate the chest X-ray (CXR) severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the mechanical ventilation (MV) use, the patient outcome, and certain clinical/laboratory data during the second wave and compare them with those of the first wave. METHODS During the two COVID-19 waves two independent groups of hospitalised patients were selected. The first group consisted of the first 100 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the first wave. The second group consisted of another 100 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the second wave. We enlisted only Caucasian male patients over the age of fifty for whom the final outcome was available. For each patient, the CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the MV use, the patient outcome, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were considered. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to compare the data obtained from the two waves. RESULTS The CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality, and CRP levels were significantly higher in the first wave than in the second wave (p ≤ .041). Although not statistically significant, the frequency of MV use was higher in the first wave.

Risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) have not yet been well determined. METHODS This was a retrospective, single-centered, observational study, in which 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were consecutively enrolled from February 24 to April 5, 2020. The patients were registered from the ICU of Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze the risk factors of death in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS The study cohort included 47 adult patients with an average age of 70.55±12.52 years, and 30 (63.8%) patients were men. Totally 15 (31.9%) patients died. When compared to survivors, nonsurvivors showed a higher proportion of septic shock [6 (40%) patients vs. 3 (9.4%) patients], disseminated intravascular coagulation [3 (21.4%) vs. 0], and had higher score of APACHE II (25.07±8.03 vs. 15.56±5.95), CURB-65 {3 [2-4] vs. 2 [1-3]}, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) {7 [5-9] vs. 3 [1-6]}, higher level of D-dimer {5.74 [2.32-18] vs 2.05 [1.09-4.00]} and neutrophil count {9.4 [7.68-14.54] vs. 5.32 [3.85-9.34]}. SOFA score (OR 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.13; P=0.0042) and the lymphocyte count (OR 0.02; 95% CI: 0.00-0.86; P=0.042) on admission were independently risk factors for mortality. Patients with higher lymphocyte count (>0.63×109 /L) and lower SOFA score (≤4) on admission had a significantly better prognosis than those with lower lymphocyte count (≤0.63×109 /L) and higher SOFA score (>4) in overall survival.

86306,Biologic grafts for ventral hernia repair: a systematic review.,2013,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to show that the addition of a fundic gastropexy to a laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair (HHR) and magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) with LINX (Johnson and Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) in patients with high risk for hiatal hernia recurrence improves outcomes without altering perioperative course. METHODS An IRB approved, single institution retrospective review of patient outcomes after hiatal hernia repair with magnetic sphincter augmentation was performed. Data were obtained from the electronic health record and stored in a REDCap database. Using statistical software, the patient data were analyzed and stratified to assess the specific variables of the perioperative and postoperative course focusing on the high risk of hiatal hernia recurrence group (HRHR) and low risk hiatal hernia of recurrence group (LRHR). The HRHR group received a gastropexy and were defined using the following variables: comorbid state increasing abdominal pressure, gastric herniation > 30%, maximum transverse crural diameter > 4 cm, age 70 years or older, previous hiatal or abdominal wall hernia repair, BMI > 34, heavy weight bearing job/hobby, and/or emergent repair. RESULTS Hiatal hernia repair with magnetic sphincter augmentation was performed on 137 patients. The HRHR group (N = 86) and the LRHR group (N = 51) were compared and there was a difference observed with acute hernia recurrence, dysphagia (p value = 0.008), and number of post-op EGDs (p value = 0.005) in favor of the HRHR group. Other postoperative variables observed (i.e., length of stay and PPI use) showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Fundic gastropexy for individuals who are considered high risk for recurrence does not appear to alter the perioperative course in our sample of patients. The HRHR group has the same length of stay experience and improved postoperative outcomes with reference to postoperative EGD, dysphagia and a decreasing trend in hiatal hernia recurrence.","Allman, Robert; Speicher, James; Rogers, Austin; Ledbetter, Ethan; Oliver, Aundrea; Iannettoni, Mark; Anciano, Carlos",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07789-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681373/,594

Surgery was the treatment of choice for osteoid osteomas until percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was introduced in 1992. Although RFA is generally considered curative in the treatment of osteoid osteoma, disease recurrence after ablation has been reported. We report a case in which RFA was delayed by the presence air surrounding the ablation probe. In this case, ablation could only be performed after the probe was removed and saline was injected through the introducer needle to displace the air. Air is reported to decrease radiofrequency energy transmission; a simple measure like injecting saline through an introducer could prevent such a complication. We also suggest that partial air in the ablation bed surrounding the ablation probe could decrease the energy transmission and may be one of the causes of early recurrences. Saline injection could be helpful in providing a more reliable environment for ablation.","Kuyumcu, Gokhan; Mason, Evan Gregory; Ilaslan, Hakan",Skeletal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-017-2659-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28466103/,594

This study focuses on parent perceptions toward a vaccine for COVID-19 including their WTP decisions for their children and themselves. A mixed methods design using a cross-sectional survey was used to assess the perceptions of US parents, with children under 18, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was administered online in November 2020 and 584 final responses were collected. The questionnaire consisted of approximately 37 closed and open-ended questions regarding personal background information; awareness, knowledge, and experience of the virus; perception toward vaccines and COVID-19; and the contingent valuation of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. WTP was found to be higher for children and a direct relationship between the number of children and WTP was observed. Parents were willing to pay US$228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children. A positive impact on WTP was found with self-reported parent health status but not children. The findings of this study have important implications for policy programs which require detailed cost-benefit analyses.

METHODS systematic review, searching seven databases using a comprehensive search strategy. We included cross-sectional prospective diagnostic studies on (1) clinical features, (2) diagnostic prediction rules based on clinical features alone, (3) blood tests and (4) diagnostic prediction rules combining clinical features and blood tests. Study participants had to be community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years, in whom a physician suspected an infection. We used QUADAS-2 to assess risk of bias. We calculated measures of diagnostic accuracy and present descriptive statistics. RESULTS out of 13,757 unique articles, only six studies with a moderate to high risk of bias were included. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity across these studies. Clinical features had LR- ≥0.61 and LR+ ≤4.94. Twelve prediction rules using clinical features had LR- ≥0.30 and LR+ ≤2.78. There was evidence on four blood tests of which procalcitonin was the most often investigated: levels <0.37 ng/ml (LR- = 0.20; 95%CI 0.10-0.42) were suitable to rule out sepsis in moderately high prevalence situations. Two diagnostic prediction rules combining clinical features and procalcitonin had LR- of ≤0.12 (95%CI 0.05-0.33) and LR+ of maximum 1.39 (95%CI 1.30-1.49). CONCLUSIONS we found few studies on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical features and blood tests to detect serious infections in older people presenting to ambulatory care.

Objective To determine whether ivermectin is an efficacious treatment for mild COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants Double-blind, randomized trial conducted at a single site in Cali, Colombia. Potential study participants were identified by simple random sampling from the state's health department electronic database of patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. A total of 476 adult patients with mild disease and symptoms for 7 days or fewer (at home or hospitalized) were enrolled between July 15 and November 30, 2020, and followed up through December 21, 2020. Intervention Patients were randomized to receive ivermectin, 300 μg/kg of body weight per day for 5 days (n = 200) or placebo (n = 200). Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was time to resolution of symptoms within a 21-day follow-up period. Solicited adverse events and serious adverse events were also collected. Results Among 400 patients who were randomized in the primary analysis population (median age, 37 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 29-48]; 231 women [58%]), 398 (99.5%) completed the trial. The median time to resolution of symptoms was 10 days (IQR, 9-13) in the ivermectin group compared with 12 days (IQR, 9-13) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for resolution of symptoms, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.32]; P = .53 by log-rank test). By day 21, 82% in the ivermectin group and 79% in the placebo group had resolved symptoms. The most common solicited adverse event was headache, reported by 104 patients (52%) given ivermectin and 111 (56%) who received placebo. The most common serious adverse event was multiorgan failure, occurring in 4 patients (2 in each group). Conclusion and Relevance Among adults with mild COVID-19, a 5-day course of ivermectin, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to resolution of symptoms. The findings do not support the use of ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19, although larger trials may be needed to understand the effects of ivermectin on other clinically relevant outcomes.

We hypothesized that smoking and alcohol consumption are disease modifiers in FSHD and contribute to the variability in disease severity, because they are both associated with higher levels of oxidative stress in muscle tissue. Oxidative stress is known to influence FSHD muscle tissue. One hundred and ninety-eight genetically confirmed FSHD patients completed a questionnaire from which the number of packyears of smoking and the lifetime cumulative alcohol units consumed were calculated. Disease severity was determined by the FSDH evaluation score. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that both the number of packyears and the amount of alcohol consumption did not influence disease severity (respectively B = 0.025, ΔR2=0.006, p = 0.231; and B = 0.000, ΔR2=0.004, p = 0.406). Although smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are unhealthy habits which should be discouraged, these results show that smoking and alcohol consumption have no clinically meaningful modifying effect on disease severity in FSHD patients. However, prospective data should show whether alcohol consumption and smoking influence disease progression rate.","Vincenten, Sanne C C; Mul, Karlien; Schreuder, Tim H A; Voermans, Nicol C; Horlings, Corinne G C; van Engelen, Baziel G M",Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2021.07.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407911/,594
87122,Single incision laparoscopic myomectomy.,2011,"BACKGROUND One of the greatest challenges presented with RIRS is the potential for movement of the stone within the operative field associated with diaphragm and chest respiratory excursions due to mechanical ventilation. To overcome this challenge, we propose in this pilot study a new general anesthesia technique combining high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) with small volume mechanical ventilation (SVMV). Data regarding safety, feasibility and surgeons' impression was assessed. METHODS Patients undergoing RIRS for kidney stones from November 2017 to May 2018 were prospectively recruited to participate in the study. In each case after the beginning of general anesthesia (GA) with mechanical ventilation (MV) surgeons were asked to assess the mobility of the operative field and conditions for laser lithotripsy according to the developed questionnaire scale. The questionnaire consisted of 5 degrees of assessment of kidney mobility and each question was scored from 1 to 5, 1 being very mobile (extremely poor conditions for dusting) and 5 completely immobile (Ideal conditions for dusting). After the assessment GA was modified with combined respiratory support (CRS), reducing tidal volume and respiratory rate (small volume mechanical ventilation, SVMV) and applying in the same time transcatheter high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) inside the closed circuit. After beginning of CRS, surgeons were once again asked to assess the mobility of the operative field and the conditions for laser lithotripsy. Main ventilation parameters were recorded and compared in both regimens. RESULTS A total of 38 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 49 (range 45-53) with a mean stone size of 10 mm (range 10-14) and Hounsfield unit of 1060 (range 930-1190). All patients underwent successful RIRS and no intraoperative complications occurred throughout the duration of the study. A statistically significant difference between ventilation parameters prior to and after CRS institution was detected in all cases, however their clinical impact was negligible. Despite this, assessment via the questionnaire scale point values varied significantly before and after the application of CRS and were 2.3 (2.1; 2.6) and 3.8 (3.7; 4.0) respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The novel combined respiratory approach consisting of HFJV and SVMV appears to provide better conditions for stone dusting through reduced respiratory kidney motion and is not associated with adverse health effects or complications.

However, characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with stroke are not well known. METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study of risk factors, stroke characteristics, and short-term outcomes in a large health system in New York City. We included consecutively admitted patients with acute cerebrovascular events from March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Data were stratified by COVID-19 status, and demographic variables, medical comorbidities, stroke characteristics, imaging results, and in-hospital outcomes were examined. Among COVID-19-positive patients, we also summarized laboratory test results. RESULTS Of 277 patients with stroke, 105 (38.0%) were COVID-19-positive. Compared with COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a cryptogenic (51.8% versus 22.3%, P<0.0001) stroke cause and were more likely to suffer ischemic stroke in the temporal (P=0.02), parietal (P=0.002), occipital (P=0.002), and cerebellar (P=0.028) regions. In COVID-19-positive patients, mean coagulation markers were slightly elevated (prothrombin time 15.4±3.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 38.6±24.5 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.4±1.3). Outcomes were worse among COVID-19-positive patients, including longer length of stay (P<0.0001), greater percentage requiring intensive care unit care (P=0.017), and greater rate of neurological worsening during admission (P<0.0001); additionally, more COVID-19-positive patients suffered in-hospital death (33% versus 12.9%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Baseline characteristics in patients with stroke were similar comparing those with and without COVID-19. However, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to experience stroke in a lobar location, more commonly had a cryptogenic cause, and had worse outcomes.","Dhamoon, Mandip S; Thaler, Alison; Gururangan, Kapil; Kohli, Amit; Sisniega, Daniella; Wheelwright, Danielle; Mensching, Connor; Fifi, Johanna T; Fara, Michael G; Jette, Nathalie; Cohen, Ella; Dave, Priya; DiRisio, Aislyn C; Goldstein, Jonathan; Loebel, Emma M; Mayman, Naomi A; Sharma, Akarsh; Thomas, Daniel S; Vega Perez, Ruben D; Weingarten, Mark R; Wen, Huei Hsun; Tuhrim, Stanley; Stein, Laura K",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.031668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280551/,594
88379,COVID-19 transmission in surgical smoke during laparoscopy and open surgery: a systematic review.,2021-10-06,"The human norovirus (HuNV)-encoded nucleoside-triphosphatase (NTPase) is a multifunctional protein critically involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. Previously, we have shown that the viral NTPase is capable of forming vesicle clusters in cells, interacting with other viral proteins such as P22, and promoting cellular apoptosis. Herein, we demonstrate that NTPase-associated vesicle clusters correspond to lipid droplets (LDs) wrapped by the viral protein and show that NTPase-induced apoptosis is mediated through both caspase-8- and caspase-9-dependent pathways. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal 179-amino-acid (aa) region of NTPase encompasses two LD-targeting motifs (designated LTM-1 and LTM-2), two apoptosis-inducing motifs, and multiple regulatory regions. Interestingly, the identified LTM-1 and LTM-2, which are located from aa 1 to 50 and from aa 51 to 90, respectively, overlap with the two apoptosis-inducing motifs. Although there was no positive correlation between the extent of LD localization and the degree of cellular apoptosis for NTPase mutants, we noticed that mutant proteins defective in LD-targeting ability could not induce cellular apoptosis. In addition to LD targeting, the amphipathic LTM-1 and LTM-2 motifs could have the potential to direct fusion proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Furthermore, we found that the LTM-1 motif is a P22-interacting motif. However, P22 functionally augmented the proapoptotic activity of the LTM-2 fusion protein but not the LTM-1 fusion protein. Overall, our findings propose that NTPase may participate in multiple cellular processes through binding to LDs or to the ER via its N-terminal amphipathic helix motifs. IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (HuNVs) are the major agent of global gastroenteritis outbreaks. However, due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNV propagation, functions of the viral-encoded proteins in host cells are still poorly understood. In the current study, we present that the viral NTPase is a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein, and we identify two LD-targeting motifs, LTM-1 and LTM-2, in its N-terminal domain. In particular, the identified LTM-1 and LTM-2 motifs, which contain a hydrophobic region and an amphipathic helix, are also capable of delivering the fusion protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), promoting cellular apoptosis, and physically or functionally associating with another viral protein P22. Since LDs and the ER have been linked to several biological functions in cells, our study therefore proposes that the norovirus NTPase may utilize LDs or the ER as replication platforms to benefit viral replication and pathogenesis.","Yen, Ju-Bei; Chen, Lee-Wen; Wei, Ling-Huei; Hung, Chien-Hui; Wang, Shie-Shan; Lin, Chun-Liang; Chang, Pey-Jium",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00422-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431704/,594

METHODS The direct costs for patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy during the learning curve (group A) and after the attainment of proficiency by two colorectal surgeons performing the procedure (group B) between 2001 and 2007 were compared. The learning curve was defined as the first 40 laparoscopic colectomy cases for each surgeon. The distribution of cases for the surgeons ensured that cost-related differences were not influenced by lead time bias of cases performed during the learning curve. RESULTS The study involved 80 group A and 74 group B patients. Groups A and B were similar in terms of age (P = 0.7), gender (P = 0.5), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (P = 0.5), body mass index (P = 0.3), diagnosis (P = 0.8), previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.07), and comorbidity (P = 0.4). The two groups also were similar with regard to performance of anastomosis (P = 0.2) or resection (P = 0.6), conversion to open surgery (P = 0.7), postoperative morbidity (P = 0.6), readmission (P = 0.1), reoperation rate (P = 0.6), and hospital length of stay (P = 0.6). The operation time was significantly longer for group A (P = 0.01). The total direct costs (P = 0.7) and the operating room (P = 0.6), nursing (P = 0.7), pharmacy (P = 0.9), radiology (P = 1), and professional (P = 0.051) costs were however similar between the two groups.

However, follow-up angiography 6 months after the thrombectomy revealed severe ISS, and the patch testing showed a positive reaction for cobalt. As a result of long-term administration of oral steroids and antihistamine, progression of ISS was suppressed. It was supposed that a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to cobalt might induce refractory ISS after PED placement.","Fujii, Shoko; Fujita, Kyohei; Yamaoka, Hiroto; Miki, Kazunori; Hirai, Sakyo; Nemoto, Shigeru; Sumita, Kazutaka",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34433645/,594
90570,Implementation of a novel efficacy score to compare sealing and cutting devices in a porcine model.,2018,"Telemedicine has emerged as a vital tool for continuing to provide therapy to children with disabilities throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. While video visits have certain advantages, such as the ability to see the children in their home, they also have potential drawbacks, as some exam maneuvers and objective measurement tools cannot be performed virtually. The increased utilization of telemedicine also raises questions about access to care. Video visits can remove the transportation and time barriers that some families face. However, they raise new barriers, such as a requirement for home internet access and insurance coverage, that may negatively impact access to care for certain patients. Moving forward, a combination of clinic and video visits in pediatric rehabilitation may be the best way to harness the advantages of both modalities while minimizing their disadvantages. Our article discusses issues relating to rehabilitation therapy delivered via virtual visits, but further study is needed to examine whether video visits achieve similar outcomes to clinic visits.","Nulle, Jill; Nelson, Virginia Simson",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/prm-200759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33104052/,594

This paper presents the development of a new injector and new shape-memory alloy clip that can replace conventional suture. Engineering and surgical assessments of the injector and clips were performed. A prototype of the delivery system was tested in simulated surgical settings and compared to conventional suturing techniques for surgical time and wound strength. In various micro-surgical scenarios, the new injectable system proved to be 5 to 20-times more efficient and to have wound strengths over three-times that of conventional suturing. Further, the wounds closed by the shape-memory alloy clips could be forced to open and then recover to a watertight state, unlike conventional sutures which break upon failure. This new injector and shape-memory alloy clips proved to be quicker, stronger, and technically easier than conventional suturing. Future work is underway to test the injectable delivery system and the shape-memory alloy clips using a real-time, in vivo porcine model.","Olson, Jeffrey L; Shandas, Robin; Erlanger, Michael",Annals of biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-012-0508-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258886/,594
90990,"Randomized Multicenter Trial Comparing Glue Fixation, Self-gripping Mesh, and Suture Fixation of Mesh in Lichtenstein Hernia Repair (FinnMesh Study).",2015,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic hepatectomy has gained popularity in the management of malignant liver lesions in the past decade. Its safety and feasibility, with faster recovery and comparable long-term outcomes, have been widely published. Nonetheless, laparoscopic isolated caudate lobectomy is still rare and technically demanding. We herein present a video on laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy for caudate cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS The patient is a 61-year-old man who presented with epigastric distending discomfort. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a 4.6 × 3.9 cm tumor in the caudate lobe adjacent to the inferior vena cava, middle hepatic vein, right hepatic vein, as well as the bifurcation of the main trunk of the portal pedicle. The carbohydrate antigen was elevated to 54.58 U/ml (normal < 37 U/ml), and his liver function was normal. With the preoperative diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, laparoscopic caudate lobectomy was contemplated. RESULTS The operative time was 300 min. The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 180 ml. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day without any complications. Histopathological examination showed a 4.2 cm cholangiocarcinoma (T2N0M0) with a negative margin. He received a course of adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrence was noted upon follow-up at 6 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection for caudate lobe is a feasible and safe procedure. An experienced hepatobiliary surgeon could perform the procedure in selected cases, even with hepatic vein invasion.","Wan, Hai-Feng; Xie, Kun-Lin; Li, Jia-Xin; Ho, Kit-Man; Wu, Hong; Huang, Ji-Wei",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08577-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418077/,594
91178,Biomechanical abdominal wall model applied to hernia repair.,2015,"Background In patients with mechanical heart valves, cerebral susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, postulated to be caused by degenerative metallic abrasion, are frequently referred to as valve abrasion. It remains unclear whether valve implantation not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass or biological heart valves also shows those lesions. Methods and Results Two blinded readers rated SWI lesions and cerebral amyloid angiopathy probability according to established criteria on brain magnetic resonance imaging pre- and postinterventionally. We assessed the association between valve type/cardiopulmonary bypass use and SWI lesion count on the first postinterventional scan using multivariable logistic regression. On postinterventional magnetic resonance imaging, 57/58 (98%) patients with mechanical heart valves had at least 1 and 46/58 (79%) 3 or more SWI lesions, while 92/97 (95%) patients with biological heart valves had at least 1 and 72/97 (74%) 3 or more SWI lesions. On multivariate analysis, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass during implantation significantly increased the odds of having SWI lesions on the first postinterventional magnetic resonance imaging (β per 10 minutes 0.498; 95% CI, 0.116-0.880; P=0.011), whereas valve type showed no significant association (P=0.338). Thirty-seven of 155 (23.9%) patients fulfilled the criteria of possible/probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Conclusions SWI lesions in patients with artificial heart valves evolve around the time point of valve implantation and the majority of patients had multiple lesions. The missing association with the valve type weakens the hypothesis of degenerative metallic abrasion and highlights cardiopulmonary bypass as the main risk factor for SWI occurrence. SWI lesions associated with cardiac procedures can mimic cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Further research needs to clarify whether those lesions are associated with intracranial hemorrhage after intravenous thrombolysis or anticoagulation.","Breiding, Philipe S; Duerrenmatt, Jana T; Meinel, Felix G; Carrel, Thierry; Schönhoff, Florian; Zibold, Felix; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Gralla, Jan; Pilgrim, Thomas; Jung, Simon; Fischer, Urs; Arnold, Marcel; Meinel, Thomas R",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.012814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379252/,594

92009,Initial experience with aspirin use during robotic radical prostatectomy.,2012,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted expanded use of prone positioning for refractory hypoxemia. Clinical trials have demonstrated beneficial effects of early prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including decreased mortality. However, pregnant women were excluded from these trials. To address the need for low-cost, low-harm interventions in the face of a widespread viral syndrome wherein hypoxemia predominates, we developed an algorithm for prone positioning of both intubated and nonintubated pregnant women. This algorithm may be appropriate for a wide spectrum of hypoxemia severity among pregnant women. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is responsible for the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. This syndrome can manifest as severe pneumonia complicated by hypoxemia and ARDS. Given the current global COVID-19 pandemic, with a large number of ARDS cases, there is renewed interest in the use of prone positioning to improve oxygenation in moderate or severe hypoxemia. Among the populations who can benefit from prone positioning are pregnant women experiencing severe respiratory distress, as long as the physiologic changes and risks of pregnancy are taken into account.","Tolcher, Mary Catherine; McKinney, Jennifer R; Eppes, Catherine S; Muigai, David; Shamshirsaz, Amir; Guntupalli, Kalpalatha K; Nates, Joseph L",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516274/,594

OBJECTIVE The objective with this review is to determine if FCRs promote the core values of humanism in medicine by answering the question, ""Do FCRs promote humanistic pediatric care?"" DATA SOURCES Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Dissertation Abstracts for peer-reviewed pediatric studies through January 1, 2020. We used search terms including FCRs, communication, humanism, and the specific descriptors in the Gold Foundation's definition of humanism. STUDY SELECTION Abstracts (n = 1003) were assessed for 5 primary outcomes: empathy, enhanced communication, partnership, respect, and satisfaction and service. We evaluated 158 full-text articles for inclusion, reconciling discrepancies through an iterative process. DATA EXTRACTION Data abstraction, thematic analysis, and conceptual synthesis were conducted on 29 studies. RESULTS Pediatric family-centered rounds (FCRs) improved humanistic outcomes within all 5 identified themes. Not all studies revealed improvement within every category. The humanistic benefits of FCRs are enhanced through interventions targeted toward provider-family barriers, such as health literacy. Patients with limited English proficiency or disabilities or who were receiving intensive care gained additional benefits. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric FCRs promote humanistic outcomes including increased empathy, partnership, respect, service, and communication. Limitations included difficulty in defining humanism, variable implementation, and inconsistent reporting of humanistic outcomes. Future efforts should include highlighting FCR's humanistic benefits, universal implementation, and adapting FCRs to pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019.","Fernandes, Ashley K; Wilson, Sheria; Nalin, Ansel P; Philip, Andrew; Gruber, Laura; Kwizera, Elise; Sydelko, Bette S; Forbis, Shalini G; Lauden, Stephanie",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2020-000240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34021029/,594

93504,Learning curve of single-port laparoscopic appendectomy for noncomplicated acute appendicitis: a preliminary analysis compared with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy.,2013,"BACKGROUND The dual inhibitors of receptor interacting protein kinase-1 and -3 (RIP1 and RIP3) play an important role in cell death processes and inflammatory responses. White matter injury (WMI), a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities in preterm infants, which is characterized by extensive myelination disturbances and demyelination. Neuroinflammation, leads to the loss and differentiation-inhibition of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), represents a major barrier to myelin repair. Whether the novel RIP1/RIP3 dual inhibitor ZJU-37 can promote transplanted OPCs derived from human neural stem cells (hOPCs) survival, differentiation and myelination remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of ZJU-37 on myelination and neurobehavioral function in a neonatal rat WMI model induced by hypoxia and ischemia. METHODS In vivo, P3 rat pups were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia, and then treated with ZJU-37 or/and hOPCs, then OPCs apoptosis, myelination, glial cell and NLRP3 inflammasome activation together with cognitive outcome were evaluated at 12 weeks after transplantation. In vitro, the effect of ZJU-37 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in astrocytes induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were examined by western blot and immunofluorescence. The effect of ZJU-37 on OPCs apoptosis induced by the conditioned medium from OGD-injured astrocytes (OGD-astrocyte-CM) was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. RESULTS ZJU-37 combined with hOPCs more effectively decreased OPC apoptosis, promoted myelination in the corpus callosum and improved behavioral function compared to ZJU-37 or hOPCs treatment. In addition, the activation of glial cells and NLRP3 inflammasome was reduced by ZJU-37 or/and hOPCs treatment in the neonatal rat WMI model. In vitro, it was also confirmed that ZJU-37 can suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation in astrocytes induced by OGD. Not only that, the OGD-astrocyte-CM treated with ZJU-37 obviously attenuated OPC apoptosis and dysdifferentiation caused by the OGD-astrocyte-CM. CONCLUSIONS The novel RIP1/RIP3 dual inhibitor ZJU-37 may promote OPC survival, differentiation and myelination by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a neonatal rat model of WMI with hOPC graft.","Zhang, Chu; Guan, Qian; Shi, Hao; Cao, Lingsheng; Liu, Jing; Gao, Zixuan; Zhu, Wenxi; Yang, Yinxiang; Luan, Zuo; Yao, Ruiqin",Stem cell research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-021-02532-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407865/,594

93643,A review of available prosthetics for ventral hernia repair.,2011,"We describe a straightforward single-peptide design that self-assembles into extended and thickened nano-to-mesoscale fibers of remarkable stability and order. The basic chassis of the design is the well-understood dimeric alpha-helical coiled-coil motif. As such, the peptide has a heptad sequence repeat, abcdefg , with isoleucine and leucine residues at the a and d sites to ensure dimerization. In addition, to direct staggered assembly of peptides and to foster fibrillogenesisthat is, as opposed to blunt-ended discrete speciesthe terminal quarters of the peptide are cationic and the central half anionic with lysine and glutamate, respectively, at core-flanking e and g positions. This +,-,-,+ arrangement gives the peptide its name, MagicWand (MW). As judged by circular dichroism (CD) spectra, MW assembles to alpha-helical structures in the sub-micromolar range and above. The thermal unfolding of MW is reversible with a melting temperature >70 degrees C at 100 muM peptide concentration. Negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of MW assemblies reveals stiff, straight, fibrous rods that extended for tens of microns. Moreover, different stains highlight considerable order both perpendicular and parallel to the fiber long axis. The dimensions of these features are consistent with bundles of long, straight coiled alpha-helical coiled coils with their axes aligned parallel to the long axis of the fibers. The fiber thickening indicates inter-coiled-coil interactions. Mutagenesis of the outer surface of the peptide i.e., at the b and f positionscombined with stability and microscopy measurements, highlights the role of electrostatic and cation-pi interactions in driving fiber formation, stability and thickening. These findings are discussed in the context of the growing number of self-assembling peptide-based fibrous systems.","Gribbon, Christopher; Channon, Kevin J; Zhang, Weijie; Banwell, Eleanor F; Bromley, Elizabeth H C; Chaudhuri, Julian B; Oreffo, Richard O C; Woolfson, Derek N",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi801072s; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18767812/,594
93784,Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS): applications beyond local excision.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Transumbilical single-port surgery is a potentially less invasive approach to many types of abdominal surgeries and offers better cosmetic outcomes than conventional 3-port laparoscopic surgery. It avoids the complication of intercostal neuralgia and may reduce the risk of pulmonary complications after video-assisted thoracic surgery. This study evaluated the feasibility of transumbilical lung wedge resection. METHODS Lung resection was performed in 11 beagle dogs weighing 5.9 to 8.5 kg. A 3-cm umbilical incision and one diaphragmatic incision were made, and an endoscopic stapler was used. The diaphragmatic incisions were repaired under video guidance using a V-Loc knotless suturing device (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts). Animals were monitored daily for signs of postoperative infection. White blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and IL-6 level were measured in all animals. Animals were euthanized 14 days after surgery and underwent necropsy evaluation. RESULTS Accurate lung resection was achieved in 10 of 11 animals during a median operative time of 98 minutes (range 60-165). In 1 animal, transumbilical lung resection was not possible and was converted to thoracotomy. All animals survived without major postoperative complications. At necropsy, evidence of uneventful healing of the stapled resection margin and diaphragmatic wound were found. There was no evidence of vital organ injury or intrathoracic infection. CONCLUSION A transumbilical approach to thoracic cavity exploration and stapled lung resection is technically feasible. Primary suturing of the diaphragmatic incision is a simple and effective means of diaphragmatic wound closure. This may be an alternative to video-assisted thoracic surgery for the management of simple thoracic disease.","Yin, Shun-Ying; Yen-Chu,; Wu, Yi-Cheng; Liu, Chien-Ying; Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Yuan, Hsu-Chia; Ko, Po-Jen; Liu, Yun-Hen",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2013.00285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25848173/,594

93872,Fundus-first transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a cholangiogram: a feasibility study.,2011,"Importance The adenoid pad has long been considered a reservoir for bacteria in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME). However, bacteria more reminiscent of external auditory canal (EAC) commensals are often demonstrated within middle ear aspirates. Objective To compare the microbiota of the EAC, the middle ear with OME, and the adenoid pad to further clarify the true source of middle ear bacteria. Design, Setting, and Participants Middle ear fluid (MEF) aspirates and EAC lavages were collected from 18 children with OME undergoing ventilation tube insertion from June 1, 2014, to August 31, 2015, at Women and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, Australia. Adenoid pad and MEF samples were included from a previous study. Samples were analyzed using sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Previously collected microbiota data from the adenoid pad were collated for analysis. Main Outcome Measures Mean relative abundance of top bacterial genera for the MEF, EAC, and adenoid pad samples. Results Eighteen pediatric patients with chronic OME (6 female; 12 male; mean [SD] age, 48 [36] months) were recruited prospectively, with 34 paired MEF and EAC samples. The MEF microbiota (mean relative abundance [SD]) consisted of Alloiococcus otitidis (37.5% [40.0%]), Haemophilus (14.4% [29.1%]), Moraxella (10.0% [26.4%]), Staphylococcus (8.2% [21.9%]), and Streptococcus (3.8% [13.1%]). The mean relative abundance (SD) microbiota of the EAC demonstrated a sparsity of classic otopathogens, including Haemophilus (0.3% [0.8%]), Moraxella (0.3% [0.7%]), and Streptococcus (0.2% [0.6%]), but had a high abundance of Alloiococcus (58.0% [44.1%]), Staphylococcus (20.8% [34.0%]), and Pseudomonas (3.2% [17.1%]). In contrast, based on previously collected data, the microbiota of the adenoid pad showed a high abundance of the classic otopathogens with a sparsity of EAC genera for Alloiococcus (0.1% vs 28.9%, respectively; P < .001), Haemophilus (25.2% vs 18.2%, respectively; P = .002), Staphylococcus (0.2% vs 10.8%, respectively; P = .02), Streptococcus (12.7% vs 4.2%, respectively; P < .001), and Pseudomonas (0 vs 2.1% respectively; P < .001). The microbiota of the MEF collected during 2 consecutive years were similar (Alloiococcus, 22.7% vs 37.5%; Haemophilus, 22.5% vs 14.0%; Staphylococcus, 10.9% vs 10.7%; Moraxella, 5.0% vs 9.7%; Corynebacteria, 6.2% vs 3.1%; Streptococcus, 4.8% vs 3.7%; and Pseudomonas, 1.1% vs 3.0%; P ≥ .05). Conclusions and Relevance The EAC and the nasopharynx could serve as reservoirs for microbiota of the middle ear. Furthermore, the microbiota of the middle ear with effusion appear to be relatively stable over time and between populations with OME.","Chan, Chun Ling; Wabnitz, David; Bassiouni, Ahmed; Wormald, Peter-John; Vreugde, Sarah; Psaltis, Alkis James",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2016.3105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27812691/,594
94296,Novel approach of laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) for cholecystectomy.,2018,"The objective of our work is to demonstrate in a large cohort of patients with cricotracheal stenosis that resection of long airway segments could be performed with no increased risk of postoperative complications. A consecutive series of patients getting cervical segmental cricotracheal resection (CTR) were reviewed. The typical segmental tracheal resection technique has been modified to accommodate long segment removal. Modifications include using trachea to enable the reconstruction of the larynx itself as well as the placement of a ""laryngosternopexy"" stitch between the thyroid lamina and the sternoclavicular ligament designed to take all of the tension off the anastomosis and to prevent inadvertent head extension. Anastomosis was performed by using continuous barbed sutures that allowed gradual approximation of the proximal and distal segments even in the presence of a large segmental airway resection defect that could involve as much as half of the tracheal length. Thirty-eight patients were treated. Primary etiologies of cricotracheal stenosis were prolonged intubation and tracheostomy. All had Grade III-IV stenosis. Only one patient had postoperative revision surgery for anastomosis-based disease. All patients with tracheostomy (n = 29) were successfully decannulated. Complications occurred in five patients. These included acute airway obstruction requiring emergency tracheostomy through the anastomosis, a tracheal dehiscence, laryngeal edema with airway obstruction, superficial wound infections, neck abscesses, and transient vocal cord immobility. Modified cricotracheal resection has comparable results to traditional techniques and may offer advantages such as resection of long tracheal segments without any increase in the risk of post-anastomosis airway leak.","Atallah, Ihab; Aldkhyyal, Ahmed; Castellanos, Paul F",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-017-4753-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29063231/,594
94390,Transanal single-port microsurgery for rectal tumors: minimal invasive surgery under spinal anesthesia.,2014,"Infrared overtone spectra of the ν(C = O) stretching vibration (ν1) of gaseous hexafluoroacetone ((CF3)2C = O, HFA) were recorded in the spectral range of 7450-3300 cm-1 with a resolution of 0.1 cm-1. Experimental absolute IR intensities and vibrational band centers of the overtones 2ν1, 3ν1, 4ν1 of HFA were measured and compared with their ab initio counterparts, calculated by the second-order canonical vibrational perturbation theory (CVPT2). A hybrid potential energy surface (PES) was evaluated using the quantum-mechanical models MP2/cc-pVQZ for harmonic and MP2/cc-pVTZ for anharmonic parts. Cubic surfaces of dipole moment components were determined using the MP2/cc-pVTZ model. The predicted IR intensities for the first and second overtones reproduced the experimental values with a discrepancy of 6% and 9%, respectively. A weak Fermi resonance between the first overtone 2ν1 and combination tone ν1 + ν2 + ν8 was predicted. The appropriate model was employed for simulating the bands studied using: (i) the asymmetric-top vibration-rotational structure of the ν1 mode, (ii) the inhomogeneous band structure due to contributions of the vibrational states populated at the room temperature, and (iii) the homogeneous broadening of each vibration-rotation transition due to the intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR).

94449,Comparison of Synthetic and Biologic Mesh in Ventral Hernia Repair Using Components Separation Technique.,2016,"PURPOSE Family caregivers of a loved one with a life-limiting or terminal illness are often overwhelmed by, and underprepared for, their responsibilities. They often need help from family members and friends to provide comprehensive care. When death occurs, funerals and other death-related rituals bring family and communities together to honor the life and mourn the death of a loved one and provide needed support to family and caregivers. These collective rituals are often deeply rooted in culturally-bound values and can facilitate grief and help make sense about loss. Rituals act as bridge-building activities that allow people to organize and appraise emotions, information, and actions after a loss. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recommended restrictions to reduce infection and transmission, family members and caregivers are often faced with weighing options for honored rituals to help them grieve. Grieving during the pandemic has become disorganized. The purpose of this article is to provide case managers and other clinical staff with recommendations on guiding caregivers/families through safety precautions when a loved one dies either because of a life-limiting illness or from COVID-19 during the pandemic using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors also present information about complicated grief and ways to support coping with death and suggest safe alternatives to traditional death-related rituals and funerals in a COVID-19 era. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S) Primary practice settings include home health care, hospice, hospital discharge planning, case management, and primary care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS Precautions necessary in a COVID-19 era may add anxiety and stress to an already difficult situation of caring for loved ones at end-of-life and grieving with their loss. Utilization of CDC guidelines lessens the risk of infection while honoring loved ones' wishes and cultural traditions surrounding death and burial. Recognition of social and spiritual connections that comfort mourners must also be considered.

We report two neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 during the second trimester. CASE PRESENTATION Two pregnant women had symptomatic COVID-19 in the second trimester. Throat swabs at delivery for SARS-COV-2 RNA were negative for both women and their newborns. The first woman had positive serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 before delivery. Her newborn had negative IgM antibody to SARS-COV-2 but IgG was positive on the 7th day after birth. The second woman had negative serum IgM antibody to SARS-COV-2 but IgG was positive before delivery. Her newborn had negative serum IgM antibody to SARS-COV-2 but IgG was positive at 48 h after birth. None of the neonates developed clinical symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSION SARS-COV-2 is unlikely to be vertically transmitted in utero as evidenced by the specific antibodies in the serum of the two women and their newborns. The two women with SARS-COV-2 infection in the second trimester did not develop serious complications at delivery and outcomes of the neonates were good.","Tang, Jing-Yi; Song, Wen-Qi; Xu, Hao; Wang, Na",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2020.1798499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32721199/,594

METHODS In a 3-year period between 2006 and 2009, sixty-three boys and adolescents diagnosed in our institution as having varicocele underwent Palomo laparoscopic surgery with a two 5-mm expandable-trocar laparoscopic approach using the LigaSure technology (Valleylab Inc., Covidien, Boulder, CO) for spermatic vessels sealing. The outcome variables recorded for analysis were age at presentation, symptoms, varicocele grade based on Dubin and Amelar Classification, testicular atrophy, operative time, complications, recurrence, and reactive hydrocele formation. Mean follow-up was 1.8 years (range, 6 mo to 3 y). RESULTS Children's age at diagnosis ranged between 9 and 19 years. Mean age at operation was 14.8 ± 1.2 years. All cases were left side varicoceles and 70% had grade III varicocele. Testicular atrophy was noticed in 39.8% of cases. All boys underwent Palomo laparoscopic sealing of the spermatic vessels using bipolar vascular electrothermal device Ligasure with a 2-trocar approach. Mean operative surgery time was 21 minutes. Median hospital stay was 21 ± 8 hours. No conversion cases were registered. Nine patients developed hydrocele after laparoscopic procedure (14.2%). Three patients of these cases underwent Winkelman-Lord's hydrocelectomy (4.7% of total). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Palomo varicocele surgery for pediatric patients using Ligasure as spermatic vessels sealant and only 2 radially expandable 5-mm trocars is a safe, feasible, and time-effective technical improvement.","Méndez-Gallart, Roberto; Bautista-Casasnovas, Adolfo; Estévez-Martínez, Elina; Rodríguez-Barca, Pablo","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31823118d3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002289/,594

95855,Electrocardiography of the normal domestic pet rabbit.,2010,"BACKGROUND The proper timing of reimplantation is importation to treatment success in the two-stage exchange revision. The 2018 International Consensus Meeting suggested that a variation trend toward normalization in serum markers was useful for determining the proper timing of reimplantation. However, the opposite results were found by previous studies, and the normalization of serum markers was reported to fail to predict infection control. We investigated whether value changes and percent changes in four common serum markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and fibrinogen) can predict persistent infection. METHODS A retrospective review of 141 patients treated with the two-stage revision from 2014 to 2018 was conducted. The variation trend in serum indicators was evaluated by the percent changes (using values of serum markers pre-reimplantation divided by values pre-resection) and value changes (using values of serum markers pre-resection minus values pre-reimplantation). Treatment success was defined according to the Delphi-based consensus criteria with a minimum follow-up of 1 year, and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) was used to examine the usefulness of changes in serum markers. RESULTS Twenty-two patients (15.60%) were persistently infected. No significant difference was found in either the value change or percent change in serum markers between reinfection and non-reinfection patients. When predicting persistent infection, the area under the curves (AUC) demonstrated that both percent changes and value changes in serum markers were poor indicators. The AUC of value changes was 0.533 for the CRP, 0.504 for the IL-6, 0.508 for the ESR, and 0.586 for fibrinogen when predicted persistent PJI. In addition, the AUC indicated that percent changes in the CRP (0.464), the IL-6 (0.534), the ESR (0.527), and fibrinogen (0.586) were all poor markers. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that both value changes and percent changes in serum markers were not sufficiently rigorous to aid in persistent infection diagnosis. The proper timing of reimplantation must, therefore, take into account various clinical tests rather than the downward trend of serum markers only.","Jiang, Qiao; Fu, Jun; Chai, Wei; Hao, Li-Bo; Zhou, Yong-Gang; Xu, Chi; Chen, Ji-Ying",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-020-01923-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887615/,594

The major outcomes were stratified by the neighborhood's poverty and regression models were used to assess the associations between neighborhood conditions and their change during the pandemic and the outcomes of physical activity and mental health. The results show that low-poverty neighborhoods had more health-promoting neighborhood conditions before the outbreak and more positive changes during the outbreak. Health-promoting neighborhood conditions were associated with higher physical activity and moderate physical activity and lack of negative neighborhood conditions such as crime/violence and traffic were associated with a lower risk of mental health problems including loneliness, depression, and anxiety. Mental health problems were also significantly associated with the COVID-19 infection and death and household income level. Our findings suggest that it is plausible that the disparities of physical activity and mental health by neighborhood exacerbate due to the pandemic and people who living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods bear increasingly disproportionate burden.","Yang, Yong; Xiang, Xiaoling",Health & place,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454564/,594

Patients with MRSA bacteraemia between July 2009 and January 2012 were analysed retrospectively. All adult patients treated with vancomycin for ≥72 h without dialysis were included. The MIC was determined by Etest and broth microdilution (BMD). Initial steady-state AUC24 was estimated using a Bayesian model, and the AUC24/MIC cut-off value for differentiating treatment success and failure was calculated by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. In total, 76 patients were enrolled; vancomycin treatment failure occurred in 20 patients (26.3%). Catheter-related infection was the most frequent (35.5%), followed by surgical site infection (26.3%), whilst 25 (32.9%) had complicated infections. In univariate analysis, decreased MRSA vancomycin susceptibility (MIC≥1.5 mg/L) and vancomycin trough levels (15-20 mg/L) were not associated with treatment outcomes. In the CART analysis, low initial vancomycin AUC24/MIC (<430 by Etest; <398.5 by BMD) was associated with a higher treatment failure rate (50.0% vs. 25.0%, P=0.039 by Etest; 45.0% vs. 23.2%; P=0.065 by BMD). In multivariate analysis, low initial vancomycin AUC24/MIC was a significant risk factor for treatment failure [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=4.39, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-15.35 by Etest; aOR=3.73, 95% CI 1.10-12.61 by BMD].

DESIGN Service evaluation involving descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire. SETTING Orthodontic Departments at Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital and Burnley General Teaching Hospital. PARTICIPANTS Patients and clinicians involved in video consultations. METHODS Patient- and clinician-specific questionnaires were designed and those involved in virtual clinics were invited to complete these at the end of their consultation. The questionnaires focused on setting up and connecting to the virtual clinic, assessing if the correct types of patients were involved in the clinics and satisfaction with these types of remote consultations. RESULTS A total of 121 questionnaires (59 patient and 62 clinician) were completed. Of the patients, 93% found the instructions provided to access the consultation easy to follow and 70% of clinicians did not report any connection issues. In 90% of cases, a virtual appointment was seen to be appropriate by the clinician. Respondents showed a high level of satisfaction with 76% of patients saying a remote consultation was more convenient than face-to-face, and 66% reporting they would, if appropriate, like more appointments like this in the future.

97401,Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) using cross hand technique.,2009,"INTRODUCTION Research suggests that religiosity domains are associated with mental health constructs. Some studies have focused on the relationship between religiosity and personality disorders. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between religiosity domains and pathological traits of the borderline (BPD) and schizotypal (SZPD) personality disorders. METHODS Participants were 751 adults from the general population who answered the Multidimensional Inventory for Religious/Spiritual Well-Being (MI-RSWB-E), the Attachment to God Inventory (AGI), and factors of the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2). Pearson's correlation and regression analysis were conducted with pathological traits as independent variables and religiosity domains as dependent variables. RESULTS Correlation and regression analyses indicated slightly higher associations between religiosity domain and BPD traits in comparison to SZPD traits. BPD traits showed higher associations with the hope immanent, forgiveness and hope transcendent domains, while SZPD presented higher associations with connectedness. The SZPD-related paranormality factor presented the highest correlation observed in the study and was the best SZPD predictor of religiosity domains. The BPD-related hopelessness factor was the predictor with significant contribution to most regression models. BPD traits presented slightly higher average association with religiosity domains, whereas spiritual-related domains (e.g., connectedness) tended to show higher associations with SZPD traits. CONCLUSIONS Our findings help explain the relationship between specific pathological traits and religiosity domains.","Carvalho, Lucas de Francisco; Sagradim, Daniele Elvira Vaz; Pianowski, Giselle; Gonçalves, André Pereira",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1590/2237-6089-2019-0085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084801/,594
97423,Assessing the feasibility of full robotic interaortocaval nodal dissection for locally advanced gastric cancer.,2015,"BACKGROUND Surgery is increasingly reserved for complicated diverticulitis. The role of laparoscopy in this context is ill defined. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and outcomes associated with the application of laparoscopy to an unrestricted spectrum of diverticular pathologies, with an emphasis on complicated disease. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent elective, urgent, or emergent laparoscopic colectomy for diverticular disease from 1991 to 2007 were analyzed from a prospectively collected database. Laparoscopy was offered to all patients presenting for surgical attention, thus minimizing selection bias. Complicated cases had abscesses, perforations, fistulas, or strictures. Uncomplicated cases had chronic or recurrent diverticulitis. Summary statistics and univariate comparisons were generated. RESULTS A total of 183 patients were analyzed, including 39 complicated cases. The complicated cohort included 12 abscesses or perforations (31%), 18 fistulas (46%), and 11 strictures (28%). Intraoperative complications were comparable between the two groups (7.7 vs. 9.7%), although the complicated cases resulted in more conversions (23 vs. 4.2%; p = 0.0007). More than 79% of the complicated patients and 96% of the uncomplicated patients underwent unprotected primary anastomosis. Medical (23 vs. 1.4%; p < 0.0001) and surgical (28 vs. 14%; p = 0.035) complications were more frequent in the complicated group. Leak rates were acceptably low (6.5 vs. 2.2%; p = 0.23). There were no recorded deaths. Finally, the time until discharge from hospital was significantly longer in the complicated group by a median of 1 day. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic management of complicated diverticular disease is feasible and appears to be safe in the hands of experts. Despite a high rate of conversion to open surgery, laparoscopy was the sole operative intervention for the majority of patients with complicated diverticular disease. Further studies are needed to allow rigorous comparison with an open control group.","Martel, Guillaume; Bouchard, Alexandre; Soto, Claudia M; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Boushey, Robin P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-0951-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20186433/,594

We investigated any effect modification by laterality on stroke patients' outcomes in recent endovascular trials. Methods- Individual patient-level data were combined in this meta-analysis of all patients included in randomized trials comparing endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent retrievers with standard care in anterior circulation ischemic patients with stroke (HERMES [Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices] Collaboration). We stratified the 90-day functional outcome assessed by ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale according to the stroke side of patients treated with endovascular therapy versus standard care, adjusted for important prognostic variables. Results- The meta-analysis included 1737 patients (871 right hemispheric strokes and 866 left hemispheric) from 7 trials. Baseline median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly higher in left (20) versus right (16) hemispheric strokes ( P<0.001). Other clinical and radiological baseline characteristics were similar. The beneficial response to endovascular therapy assessed by 90-day modified Rankin Scale shift was not modified by the side of the stroke. There were no significant differences between right and left hemispheric stroke in the 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2; 40.7% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%] versus 37.6% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%]; P=0.19), median final infarct volumes (45 versus 39.5 mL, P=0.51), nor 90-day mortality (15.1% vs 16.8%, P=0.31).

METHODS Sixty Wistar rats were divided in two groups (meshed and unmeshed). Each group was, then, divided into two subgroups for evaluation at 30 and 90 days. Capsules were analyzed based on hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and picrosirius staining. RESULTS The number of fibroblasts, neutrophils and macrophages was similar among all subgroups. There was a higher lymphocyte reaction in the 30-day meshed group (p = 0.003). Giant cell reaction, granulation tissue and neoangiogenesis were similar among the subgroups. Synovial metaplasia was milder at 90-day in the unmeshed (p = 0.002) and meshed group (p < 0.001). Capsular thickness was significantly greater in the meshed samples (30-day p < 0.001 and 90-day p < 0.001). There was a similar amount of collagen types I and III in both groups. CONCLUSIONS The mesh-covered implants produced capsules similar to the microtextured ones when analyzing inflammatory variables. Synovial metaplasia was milder at 90 than at 30 days, and the capsular thickness was significantly greater in the meshed group. A similar amount of collagen types I and III was observed.

97908,[Oesophagogastric necrosis after surgery for a giant hiatal hernia].,2010,"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019, adversely affected all solid-organ transplant processes. Here we share the donor presentations evaluated in a lung transplant center during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken at every stage of transplant management, and the outcomes of our transplants. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 15 lung donors selected by the national coordination center pre - sented to our lung transplant center as of March 11, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in Turkey, and data of 5 lung transplant cases in this period were retrospectively analyzed. All donors were examined in detail for COVID-19 disease. Procurement processes for accepted donors, transplant surgeries of recipients, and postoperative follow-up and care processes of recipients were carried out with the least number of personnel, but all with appropriate personal protective equipment. RESULTS There were 15 donor organs procured by our center during a 9-month period coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of donor pre - sentations to our center between the same dates in the previous year was 78. Five of the 15 donors were accepted, and of those accepted, 4 were male and 1 was female. There was no statistically significant difference between the accepted and rejected donors in terms of the ratio of Pao2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, age, duration of endotracheal intubation (days), and smoking (pack-years). All SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests performed on bronchoalveolar lavage samples and nasopharyngeal, conjunctival, and rectal samples collected from the recipients during the follow-up period were negative. No pathological finding suggestive of COVID-19 infection was noted in the radiological evaluations. CONCLUSIONS Lung transplant can be successfully managed during the COVID-19 pandemic period, despite the high risk of infection. The major obstacle to the continuity of lung transplant in this period was the limited number of donors.","Sahin, Mehmet Furkan; Beyoglu, Muhammet Ali; Turkkan, Sinan; Tezer Tekce, Yasemin; Yazicioglu, Alkin; Yekeler, Erdal",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2020.0567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928880/,594

98431,The use of tacker and arthroscopy cannules in SILS cholecystectomy.,2010,"The airway epithelium and underlying innate immune cells comprise the first line of host defense in the lung. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using membrane-bound receptors, as well as cytosolic receptors such as inflammasomes. Inflammasomes activate inflammatory caspases, which in turn process and release the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Additionally, inflammasomes trigger a form of lytic cell death termed pyroptosis. One of the most important inflammasomes at the host-pathogen interface is the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome that responds to LPS in the cytosol. Caspase-11 is important in defense against Gram-negative pathogens, and can drive inflammatory diseases such as LPS-induced sepsis. However, pathogens can employ evasive strategies to minimize or evade host caspase-11 detection. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the function of the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome in sensing of cytosolic LPS, and its mechanism of action with particular emphasis in the role of caspase-11 in the lung. We also explore some of the strategies pathogens use to evade caspase-11.","Oh, Changhoon; Verma, Ambika; Aachoui, Youssef",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973786/,594
98721,Review of manual control methods for handheld maneuverable instruments.,2013,"BACKGROUND Prevalence rates of patients with diabetes are growing across countries, and Bangladesh is no exception. Associated costs are also increasing, driven by costs associated with the complications of diabetes including hypoglycaemia. Long-acting insulin analogues were developed to reduce hypoglycaemia as well as improve patient comfort and adherence. However, they have been appreciably more expensive reducing their affordability and use. Biosimilars offer a way forward. Consequently, there is a need to document current prescribing and dispensing rates for long-acting insulin analogues across Bangladesh, including current prices and differences, as a result of affordability and other issues. METHODS Mixed method approach including surveying prescribing practices in hospitals coupled with dispensing practices and prices among community pharmacies and drug stores across Bangladesh. This method was adopted since public hospitals only dispense insulins such as soluble insulins free-of-charge until funds run out and all long-acting insulin analogues have to be purchased from community stores. RESULTS There has been growing prescribing and dispensing of long-acting insulins in Bangladesh in recent years, accounting for over 80% of all insulins dispensed in a minority of stores. This has been helped by growing prescribing and dispensing of biosimilar insulin glargine at lower costs that the originator, with this trend likely to continue with envisaged growth in the number of patients. Consequently, Bangladesh can serve as an exemplar to other low- and middle-income countries struggling to fund long-acting insulins for their patients. CONCLUSIONS It was encouraging to see continued growth in the prescribing and dispensing of long-acting insulin analogues in Bangladesh via the increasing availability of biosimilars. This is likely to continue benefitting all key stakeholder groups.","Haque, Mainul; Islam, Salequl; Kamal, Zubair Mahmood; Akter, Farhana; Jahan, Iffat; Rahim, Md Sagir Abdur; Sultana, Nusrat; Alam, Abm Muksudul; Munzur-E-Murshid,; Khan, Ma Halim; Deeba, Farzana; Bakar, Muhammed Abu; Nahar, Shamsun; Mozaffor, Miliva; Urmi, Umme Laila; Saikat, Taohidur Rahman; Islam, Zakirul; Haque, Monami; Iqbal, Samiul; Hossain, Mohammad Monir; Naher, Nurun; Allocati, Eleonora; Godman, Brian",Hospital practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/21548331.2021.1906083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734004/,594
98752,"Initial closed trocar entry for laparoscopic surgery: Technique, umbilical cosmesis, and patient satisfaction.",2017,"Shared resource extraction among profit-seeking individuals involves a tension between individual benefit and the collective well-being represented by the persistence of the resource. Many game theoretic models explore this scenario, but these models tend to assume either best response dynamics (where individuals instantly switch to better paying strategies) or imitation dynamics (where individuals copy successful strategies from neighbours), and do not systematically compare predictions under the two assumptions. Here we propose an iterated game on a social network with payoff functions that depend on the state of the resource. Agents harvest the resource, and the strategy composition of the population evolves until an equilibrium is reached. The system is then repeatedly perturbed and allowed to re-equilibrate. We compare model predictions under best response and imitation dynamics. Compared to imitation dynamics, best response dynamics increase sustainability of the system, the persistence of cooperation while decreasing inequality and debt corresponding to the Gini index in the agents' cumulative payoffs. Additionally, for best response dynamics, the number of strategy switches before equilibrium fits a power-law distribution under a subset of the parameter space, suggesting the system is in a state of self-organized criticality. We find little variation in most mean results over different network topologies; however, there is significant variation in the distributions of the raw data, equality of payoff, clustering of like strategies and power-law fit. We suggest the primary mechanisms driving the difference in sustainability between the two strategy update rules to be the clustering of like strategies as well as the time delay imposed by an imitation processes. Given the strikingly different outcomes for best response versus imitation dynamics for common-pool resource systems, our results suggest that modellers should choose strategy update rules that best represent decision-making in their study systems.","Farahbakhsh, Isaiah; Bauch, Chris T; Anand, Madhur",Journal of theoretical biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069675/,594

Past pandemic studies have suggested that nurses working in such crises might experience a deterioration of mental health, which could persist for years beyond the initial outbreak. This study used a qualitative descriptive design to explore nurses' experiences of working in tertiary hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 17 registered nurses who had worked for at least one year prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited from a University Health System in Singapore from March to June 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews lasting at least an hour conducted over an online platform by the principal investigator. The data were analysed through Braun and Clarke's six-step thematic analysis independently by two researchers. Three main themes emerged: (i) challenging moments of COVID-19, during which the participants reported physical and psychological challenges relating to working conditions of the hospital in the initial months of the pandemic; (ii) the professional role as nurses, in where the participants dispelled their worries and demonstrated commitment to their role as nurses; and (iii) support for nurses, which originated from their family, friends and leaders from their organizations for them to persevere and overcome the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19. The nurses in this study demonstrated resilience and professionalism despite the challenges of COVID-19. The findings highlighted the importance of a robust support system for healthcare professionals.","Goh, Yong-Shian; Ow Yong, Qing Yun Jenna; Chen, Terri Hui-Min; Ho, Su Hui Cyrus; Chee, Yin Ing Cornelia; Chee, Tji Tjian",International journal of mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280242/,594

METHODS A retrospective observational case-control study was conducted on a case series of 32 consecutive knee infections, using an analysis of all the risk factors reported in the literature. A control series of 100 randomly selected patients operated in the same Department of a University General Hospital during the same period of time, with no sign of deep infection in their knee arthroplasty during follow-up. Statistical comparisons were made using Pearson for qualitative and ANOVA for quantitative variables. RESULTS The significant (p>0.05) factors found in the series were: Preoperative previous knee surgery, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, inflammatory arthritis. INTRAOPERATIVE prolonged surgical time, inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis, intraoperative fractures. Postoperative secretion of the wound longer than 10 days, deep palpable haematoma, need for a new surgery, and deep venous thrombosis in lower limbs. Distant infections cutaneous, generalized sepsis, urinary tract, pneumonia, abdominal. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of intraoperative fractures and deep venous thrombosis as significantly more frequent factors in infected TKAs. Other previously described risk factors for TKA PJI are also confirmed.","de Dios, M; Cordero-Ampuero, J",Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.recot.2014.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176114/,594

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 10 female pigs (weight 45 kg) underwent TR (n = 5) or TV (n = 5) NOTES PN. The pneumoperitoneum was created by a periumbilical 12-mm trocar, through which a laparoscope was advanced for intra-abdominal visualization. For TV-NOTES PN, a gastroscope was used to obtain TV peritoneal access. For TR-NOTES PN, a horizontal incision was made 2 cm above the dentate line, and a submucosal tunnel was created in the posterior rectal wall. The gastroscope was advanced through the submucosal tunnel and retroperitoneum to the kidney, and a peritoneal window was created. For both TR- and TV-NOTES PN, the gastroscope was exchanged for the SPIDER Surgical System. Flexible dissecting instruments and hook cautery introduced through the SPIDER Surgical System were used to mobilize the kidney. A harmonic scalpel introduced periumbilically was used to excise a portion of the lower pole. LAPRA-TY-secured sutured renorrhaphy was performed, followed by TR or TV specimen extraction. RESULTS TR- and TV-NOTES PN was successfully performed in all 10 pigs. A comparison of TR- and TV-NOTES PN revealed no significant differences in the mean access time (29.2 vs 29.6 minutes, P = .944), operative time (196.0 vs 183.0 minutes, P = .631), and estimated blood loss (59.0 vs 54.0 mL, P = .861). Necropsy did not demonstrate abdominal injuries. CONCLUSION We have demonstrated proof-of-principle for TR and TV-NOTES PN in swine, with comparable perioperative parameters. Preclinical survival studies are requisite to assess the potential of TR-NOTES as an alternative to TV-NOTES.","Bazzi, Wassim M; Stroup, Sean P; Cohen, Seth A; Sisul, David M; Liss, Michael A; Masterson, James H; Kopp, Ryan P; Gudeman, Suzanne R; Leeflang, Elisabeth; Palazzi, Kerrin L; Ramamoorthy, Sonia; Kane, Christopher J; Horgan, Santiago; Derweesh, Ithaar H",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2013.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23676357/,594

Coexpression of both glycoproteins in cells expressing one of the cellular receptors was required for autophagy induction, and LC3 punctum formation, indicative of autophagy, was mainly observed in syncytia. A similar correlation between syncytium formation and autophagy induction was also observed for other paramyxovirus glycoproteins, suggesting that membrane fusion-mediated autophagy may be common among paramyxoviruses and possibly other enveloped viruses.","Delpeut, Sébastien; Rudd, Penny A; Labonté, Patrick; von Messling, Veronika",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00807-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22647692/,594

Emphasis is placed on understanding of the differences in pathogenic mechanisms, host-microbial interactions, potential defects in innate antimicrobial immunity, and the role of biofilm formation in pediatric versus adult CRS and how these translate to different approaches toward both medical and surgical management. Pediatric CRS can be viewed as evolving from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis into an uncomplicated ""early"" stage of CRS, later evolving into a persistent stage and, in some cases, evolving into a late ""maladaptive-eosinophilic"" stage disease. Given this potential evolution toward more irreversible disease, a plea can be made for improved recognition of and more aggressive early intervention for pediatric CRS, it is hoped, to prevent these long-term consequences. For the primary care physician, this may necessitate enlisting the support of a sinus specialist before the symptoms of CRS have persisted for months or years. It may also necessitate, in some cases, the use of sinus computed tomography imaging to demonstrate that sinus abnormalities have resolved. Other arguments can be made for prompt and comprehensive management of pediatric CRS, including the need to reduce the burden of illness, reduce health care costs, avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and its attendant effects toward promoting antibiotic resistant infections and, potentially, to reduce the development of important comorbidities, e.g., asthma.","Hamilos, Daniel L",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2015.29.4238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26637579/,594

The present study evaluated sleep patterns, sleep disturbances, and associated factors in Chinese preschoolers confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. Caregivers of 1619 preschoolers (aged 4-6 years) recruited from 11 preschools in Zunyi, Guizhou province completed the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) between 17th and 19th February 2020. Data were compared to a sociodemographically similar sample of preschoolers (included in the 11 preschools) in 2018. Compared to the 2018 sample, the confined preschoolers demonstrated changes in sleep patterns characterized by later bedtimes and wake times, longer nocturnal and shorter nap sleep durations, comparable 24-hr sleep duration, and fewer caregiver-reported sleep disturbances. Moreover, behavioural practices (sleeping arrangement, reduced electronic device use, regular diet) and parenting practices (harmonious family atmosphere and increased parent-child communication) were associated with less sleep disturbances in the confined sample. The present study provides the first description of the impact of prolonged home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep patterns and sleep disturbances in preschoolers, as well as highlighting the importance of the link between sleep health and family factors. Given that disrupted and insufficient sleep has been linked to immune system dysfunction, our findings also have potential implications for resilience to infection in young children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

100833,Apps to offer telemedicine options.,2020-08-22,"BACKGROUND There has been a rapid rise in the popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) over the last decade, with growth predicted to continue. The uptake of these devices has escalated despite inconclusive evidence of their efficacy as a smoking cessation device and unknown long-term health consequences. As smoking rates continue to drop or plateau in many well-developed countries, transnational tobacco companies have transitioned into the vaping industry and are now using social media to promote their products. Evidence indicates e-cigarettes are being marketed on social media as a harm reduction alternative, with retailers and manufacturers utilizing marketing techniques historically used by the tobacco industry. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify and describe the messages presented in e-cigarette-related social media (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest) promotions and discussions and identify future directions for research, surveillance, and regulation. METHODS Data sources included MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Informit, the Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Google Scholar. Included studies were published in English between 2007 and 2017, analyzed content captured from e-cigarette-related social media promotions or discussions, and reported results for e-cigarettes separately from other forms of tobacco and nicotine delivery. Database search ceased in October 2017. Initial searches identified 536 studies. Two reviewers screened studies by title and abstract. One reviewer examined 71 full-text articles to determine eligibility and identified 25 studies for inclusion. This process was undertaken with the assistance of the Web-based screening and data extraction tool-Covidence. The review was registered with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Systematic Reviews database and followed the methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. RESULTS Several key messages are being used to promote e-cigarettes including as a safer alternative to cigarettes, efficacy as a smoking cessation aid, and for use where smoking is prohibited. Other major marketing efforts aimed at capturing a larger market involve promotion of innovative flavoring and highlighting the public performance of vaping. Discussion and promotion of these devices appear to be predominantly occurring among the general public and those with vested interests such as retailers and manufacturers. There is a noticeable silence from the public health and government sector in these discussions on social media. CONCLUSIONS The social media landscape is dominated by pro-vaping messages disseminated by the vaping industry and vaping proponents. The uncertainty surrounding e-cigarette regulation expressed within the public health field appears not to be reflected in ongoing social media dialogues and highlights the need for public health professionals to interact with the public to actively influence social media conversations and create a more balanced discussion. With the vaping industry changing so rapidly, real-time monitoring and surveillance of how these devices are discussed, promoted, and used on social media is necessary in conjunction with evidence published in academic journals.","McCausland, Kahlia; Maycock, Bruce; Leaver, Tama; Jancey, Jonine",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/11953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720440/,594

However, in other organs, primarily in the cardiovascular system, there are substantial structural changes that lead to multiple organ dysfunction and contribute to death. OBJECTIVE To analyze the thanatogenetic significance of novel coronavirus COVID-19 infection in different age and gender groups and to describe the main morphopathological manifestations in various organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS The investigators carried out a comprehensive analysis of 700 autopsies of people disease from the novel coronavirus COVID-19 infection, which included an examination of gross changes reflected in the autopsy protocols and forensic medical examination reports, as well as that of microscopic changes detected during histological examination of organs. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using mouse or rabbit antibodies to CD34, CD68, EMA, Ki67, caspase-3, and VEGF was employed in some observations. RESULTS The novel coronavirus COVID-19 infection was the primary cause of death. Acute respiratory and pulmonary heart failure and multiple organ dysfunction became the leading thanatogenetic mechanisms in COVID-19. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity were the most common diseases in patients with COVID-19. The most pronounced lung changes in COVID-19 were determined with a predominance of multiple total bilateral lesions of the lower lobes of the lungs, which was manifested by virus-induced changes in the parenchyma and stroma, as well as by microcirculation disorders. Acute dyscirculatory and ischemic changes in the parenchymal organs dominated in tissue damage caused by the virus. CONCLUSION The changes in different organs of those who have died from the new coronavirus COVID-19 infection are stereotyped and include the manifestations of virus-induced action and a systemic inflammatory response with mainly microvasculature alteration, which leads to the development of coagulopathies and, accordingly, to total hypoxia.","Rybakova, M G; Karev, V E; Kuznetsova, I A",Arkhiv patologii,https://doi.org/10.17116/patol2020820515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33054027/,594
101340,Less is more: cruroplasty alone is sufficient for revisional hiatal hernia surgery.,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND Despite the availability of several evidence-based therapies and non-pharmacological strategies to improve control of symptoms and prevent exacerbations of asthma, patients with asthma continue to be at risk for mortality and morbidity.Previous trials have demonstrated the potentially beneficial effects of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium on lung function in patients with asthma; however, a definitive conclusion on the benefit of LAMA in asthma is lacking, as is information on where in the current step-wise management strategy they would be most beneficial. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of a LAMA added to any dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) compared with the same dose of ICS alone for adults whose asthma is not well controlled. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR) from inception to April 2015, and we imposed no restriction on language of publication. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and drug company registries to identify unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials in which adults whose asthma was not well controlled by ICS alone were randomly assigned to receive LAMA add-on or placebo (both combined with ICS) for at least 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the searches and extracted data from study reports. We used Covidence for duplicate screening, extraction of study characteristics and numerical data and risk of bias ratings. Pre-specified primary outcomes included exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, quality of life and all-cause serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We identified five studies that met the inclusion criteria. All studies applied a double-blind, double-dummy design, and the population of all studies totalled 2563 adult participants. Study duration ranged from 12 weeks to 52 weeks, and risk of bias across domains in all studies was low. Trials included more women than men (33% to 47% male), and mean age of participants ranged from 41 to 48 years. Participants generally had a long history of asthma, and mean baseline predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was between 72% and 75% in three studies reporting pre-bronchodilator values.The rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) was lower in patients prescribed an LAMA add-on than in those receiving the same dose of ICS alone (odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.93; 2277 participants; four studies; I(2) = 0%; high-quality evidence), meaning that 27 fewer people per 1000 would have an exacerbation over 21 weeks requiring OCS with LAMA compared with ICS alone (95% CI 42 fewer to 6 fewer).All-cause serious adverse events (SAEs) and exacerbations requiring hospital admission were rare and the effects too imprecise to permit firm conclusions, but effects suggested that LAMA add-on may be associated with fewer of both compared with ICS alone (SAEs: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.57; 2532 participants; four studies; low-quality evidence; exacerbations requiring hospital admission: OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.47; 2562 participants; five studies; moderate-quality evidence). Additional therapy with a LAMA showed no clear benefit in terms of quality of life compared with ICS given alone; high-quality evidence showed only a small mean improvement in quality of life as measured on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), which was not statistically significant. The same was true for asthma control as measured on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), which was based on moderate-quality evidence. LAMA combined with ICS showed consistent benefit in a range of lung function measures compared with the same dose of ICS alone, and LAMA was not associated with significantly higher rates of adverse events than were reported with placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS For adults taking ICS for asthma without a long-acting beta₂-agonist (LABA), LAMA given as add-on treatment reduces the likelihood of exacerbations requiring treatment with OCS and improves lung function. The benefits of LAMA combined with ICS for hospital admissions, all-cause serious adverse events, quality of life and asthma control remain unknown.Results of this review, along with findings of related reviews conducted to assess the use of LAMA in other clinical scenarios involving asthma, can help to define the role of LAMA in the management of asthma. Trials of longer duration (up to 52 weeks) would provide a better opportunity to observe rare events such as serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospital admission.","Anderson, Debbie E; Kew, Kayleigh M; Boyter, Anne C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011397.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26301488/,594

This might be due to remodelling and fibrosis formation, mainly located in the posterior left atrial (LA) wall. Therefore, we adopted a thoracoscopic epicardial box isolation of the posterior left atrium using bipolar RF energy with intraoperative testing of conduction block. METHODS AND RESULTS Bilateral thoracoscopic box isolation was performed with a bipolar RF clamp. Entrance block was defined as absence of a conducted electrogram within the box, while exit block was confirmed by pacing at 10.0 V/2 ms. Ablation outcome was evaluated after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months with 12-lead ECGs and 24-hour Holter recordings. Twenty-five consecutive patients were included (58 ± 7 years, persistent AF duration 1.8 ± 0.9 years). Entrance block was achieved in all patients and exit block confirmed if sinus rhythm was achieved. After 17 ± 7 months, 76 % of the patients (n = 19) were free of AF recurrence. One patient died within 1 month and was considered an ablation failure. Four patients with AF recurrences regained sinus rhythm with additional catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs.

The objectives of our study were to investigate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Respiratory viral infection (RVI). Methods: Children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN) having acute respiratory infections (ARI) were considered as cases and febrile neutropenic cancer patients without ARI were considered as controls. A throat swab sample was obtained for the detection of 21-respiratory pathogens. Results: A total of 81 episodes of FN in cases and 37 episodes of FN in controls were included. Prevalence of RVI (at least 1 RV) was seen in 76.5% of cases and 48.6% of controls (p = 0.005). The mixed-respiratory viruses (co-infections of ≥2 viruses) were seen only in cases (26%) (p = 0.00). Rhinovirus (36.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus (13.6%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Median duration of fever before presentation was more in cases with RVI compared to without RVI [2 (1-5) days vs 1 (1-5) day (p = 0.012)]. The median total duration of febrile period was 4 (IQR, 3-6) days in cases with RVI and 3 (IQR, 1-4) days in cases without RVI (p = 0.005). The median duration of antibiotic days were longer in cases with RVI as compared to patients without RVI [9 (IQR, 7-17) days vs 7 (IQR, 6-10) days (p = 0.046)] respectively. Conclusion: There was high prevalence of RVI in children with cancer and FN; more in association with ARI. The RVI were associated with prolonged febrile period and days of antibiotics therapy.","Meena, Jagdish Prasad; Brijwal, Megha; Seth, Rachna; Gupta, Aditya Kumar; Jethani, Jyoti; Kapil, Arti; Jat, Kana Ram; Choudhary, Aashish; Kabra, S K; Dwivedi, S N; Dar, Lalit",Pediatric hematology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08880018.2019.1631920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512959/,594
104143,Pure transvaginal ventral hernia repair in humans.,2014,"Paediatric Menetrier disease (PMD) is a protein-losing gastropathy, presenting with generalized oedema and abdominal symptoms. PMD commonly has an acute course and may be associated with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the epidemiological and clinical data, diagnostic procedures, treatment and outcome of CMV-associated PMD. The medical charts of the patients with PMD and CMV infection diagnosed at our hospital have been reviewed. Then, a systematic literature's review of all the cases of PMD and a selection of those associated with CMV infection have been performed. Three previously healthy boys were admitted for vomiting and oedema. Endoscopy showed hypertrophic gastric folds and CMV infection was diagnosed. Albumin was administered in all cases, with clinical resolution within few weeks. In literature, PMD has been described in 150 children and the association between CMV and PMD was found in 89 cases. Clinical and laboratory data, radiological and histological exams, therapy and outcome were reviewed.Conclusions: Basing on the present experience and on the current knowledge, PMD has a benign course without long-term sequelae. Although PMD is rare in children, we recommend paediatricians to consider CMV-related PMD when facing children with vomiting and diffuse oedema. What is Known: • Paediatricians should consider Menetrier disease (MD) when facing oedematous child complaining of abdominal symptoms with hypoalbuminemia, without proteinuria and liver dysfunction. • Typical ultrasound features (hypertrophic gastric folds) suggest such condition which requires endoscopy and biopsy for definitive diagnosis. What is New: • A familial susceptibility to CMV gastric infection has been recently suggested; thus when suspecting MD, the family history of gastric diseases should be investigated. • Menetrier disease has been found associated with other unusual conditions either benign (such as gastric bezoar) or malign as neoplasms (acute lymphatic leukaemia and adenocarcinoma) even in children.","Barbati, Federica; Marrani, Edoardo; Indolfi, Giuseppe; Lionetti, Paolo; Trapani, Sandra",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03782-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803424/,594
104446,Learning curve analysis of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic hysterectomy.,2019,"AbstractTraits that are unused in a given environment are subject to processes that tend to erode them, leading to reduced fitness in other environments. Although this general tendency is clear, we know much less about why some traits are lost while others are retained and about the roles of mutation and selection in generating different responses. We addressed these issues by examining populations of a facultative anaerobe, Escherichia coli, that have evolved for >30 years in the presence of oxygen, with relaxed selection for anaerobic growth and the associated metabolic plasticity. We asked whether evolution led to the loss, improvement, or maintenance of anaerobic growth, and we analyzed gene expression and mutational data sets to understand the outcomes. We identified genomic signatures of both positive and purifying selection on aerobic-specific genes, while anaerobic-specific genes showed clear evidence of relaxed selection. We also found parallel evolution at two interacting loci that regulate anaerobic growth. We competed the ancestor and evolved clones from each population in an anoxic environment, and we found that anaerobic fitness had not decayed, despite relaxed selection. In summary, relaxed selection does not necessarily reduce an organism's fitness in other environments. Instead, the genetic architecture of the traits under relaxed selection and their correlations with traits under positive and purifying selection may sometimes determine evolutionary outcomes.","Grant, Nkrumah A; Maddamsetti, Rohan; Lenski, Richard E",The American naturalist,https://doi.org/10.1086/714530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143718/,594

We evaluated the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on extra- vs intra-cerebral blood flow and on [Formula: see text]. METHODS In 10 healthy males (age 20-54 yr), phenylephrine or ephedrine was infused for an ∼20 mm Hg increase in mean arterial pressure. Cerebral oxygenation (SavO₂) was calculated from the arterial and jugular bulb oxygen saturations. Blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICAf) and blood flow in the external carotid artery (ECAf) were assessed by duplex ultrasonography. Invos-5100c (SinvosO₂) and Foresight (SforeO₂) determined [Formula: see text] while forehead skin oxygenation (SskinO₂) was assessed. RESULTS Phenylephrine reduced SforeO₂ by 6.9% (95% confidence interval: 4.8-9.0%; P<0.0001), SinvosO₂ by 10.5 (8.2-12.9%; P<0.0001), and ECAf (6-28%; P=0.0001), but increased ICAf (5-21%; P=0.003) albeit with no consequence for SskinO₂ or SavO₂. In contrast, SforeO₂ was maintained with administration of ephedrine while SinvosO₂ and SavO₂ decreased [by 3.1 (0.7-4.5%; P=0.017) and 2.1 (0.5-3.3%; P=0.012)] as arterial carbon dioxide pressure decreased (P=0.003). ICAf was stable and ECAf increased by 11 (4-18%; P=0.005) with administration of ephedrine while SskinO₂ did not change. CONCLUSIONS The effect of phenylephrine on ScO₂ is governed by a decrease in external carotid blood flow since it increases cerebral blood flow as determined by flow in the internal carotid artery. In contrast, ScO₂ is largely maintained with administration of ephedrine because blood flow to extracerebral tissue increases.","Sørensen, H; Rasmussen, P; Sato, K; Persson, S; Olesen, N D; Nielsen, H B; Olsen, N V; Ogoh, S; Secher, N H",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aet481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508985/,594

The onset of severe COVID-19 could lead to multiple organ damage and even death. It is worth paying attention to the warning index of the onset for severe COVID-19 so that patients can be identified and monitored carefully. PATIENTS AND METHODS The report is a retrospective study that describes and analyzes the clinical features during the treatment of COVID-19. Four patients with COVID-19 were involved in this study, who were father-and-son pairs from two families. All patients were treated with the same combination of anti-microbial and anti-viral agents for 10-14 days, adjusting for the disease status. The primary outcome measure was SARS-CoV-2 detection using RT-qPCR with oropharyngeal swabs. Chest CT imaging served as a secondary outcome measure. RESULTS One of the four patients progressed to severe disease, while the remaining patients recovered with the same treatment. A persistent decrease in the lymphocyte ratio and increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) level were observed in the severe patient, along with other typical symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The cases we described indicate that blood cell and CRP tests could be useful risk warnings of severe onset of COVID-19.","Song, Y-S; Hao, Y-B; Liu, H-T; Li, L-H; Yang, Z-Z; Liu, W-W; Liu, Q; Zhang, S-S; Fan, T-L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202102_24883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629342/,594

This multi-agent MRI technology would enable a whole new class of basic science and clinical MRI experiments that simultaneously explore multiple physiologic/molecular events in vivo. Unfortunately, conventional MRI acquisition techniques are only capable of detecting and quantifying one paramagnetic MRI contrast agent at a time. Herein, the Dual Contrast - Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (DC-MRF) methodology was extended for in vivo application and evaluated by simultaneously and dynamically mapping the intra-tumoral concentration of two MRI contrast agents (Gd-BOPTA and Dy-DOTA-azide) in a mouse glioma model. Co-registered gadolinium and dysprosium concentration maps were generated with sub-millimeter spatial resolution and acquired dynamically with just over 2-minute temporal resolution. Mean tumor Gd and Dy concentration measurements from both single agent and dual agent DC-MRF studies demonstrated significant correlations with ex vivo mass spectrometry elemental analyses. This initial in vivo study demonstrates the potential for DC-MRF to provide a useful dual-agent MRI platform.","Anderson, Christian E; Johansen, Mette; Erokwu, Bernadette O; Hu, He; Gu, Yuning; Zhang, Yifan; Kavran, Michael; Vincent, Jason; Drumm, Mitchell L; Griswold, Mark A; Steinmetz, Nicole F; Li, Ming; Clark, Heather; Darrah, Rebecca J; Yu, Xin; Brady-Kalnay, Susann M; Flask, Chris A",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56531-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31882792/,594

However, endovascular treatment can be restricted by tortuous transarterial access and a transvenous approach is not always feasible. We present a Borden III DAVF treated by direct access to the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and Onyx embolization performed in a hybrid operating room-angiography suite. A middle-aged patient with pulsatile headaches was found to have left transverse sinus occlusion and DAVF with retrograde cortical venous drainage fed by multiple external carotid artery (ECA) feeders. Endovascular attempts via conventional transvenous and transarterial routes were unsuccessful, and the major MMA feeder was accessed directly after temporal craniotomy was performed under neuronavigation. Onyx embolization was performed; complete occlusion of the fistula was achieved. Three-month follow-up angiography showed no residual filling; the patient remains complication-free. A combined surgical-endovascular technique in a hybrid operating room-angiography suite can be an effective treatment for DAVFs complicated by inaccessible arterial and transvenous approaches.","Lin, Ning; Brouillard, Adam M; Mokin, Maxim; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2014-011256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903968/,594

In those procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass, increased neuroprotection may be gained by using hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion. Several techniques for cerebral perfusion exist; yet no studies have noted distinct EEG patterns associated with different techniques. In this study, we reviewed EEG records of six aortic arch procedures that used cannulation of the innominate artery to provide selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. In each case, a transient hemispheric asymmetry was noted within 2 minutes of the start of head cooling, consisting of enhanced suppression over the right compared with the left hemisphere, which was confirmed by power analysis. The EEG returned to baseline during passive-head rewarming in five cases, whereas a brief left-sided partial seizure occurred during rewarming in one case. These findings suggest that antegrade cerebral perfusion using cannulation of the innominate artery results in enhanced cooling of the right hemisphere as detected by intraoperative EEG monitoring. Characterization of this finding is necessary to prevent misinterpretation of ischemia by EEG.","Tobochnik, Steven D; Guy, T Sloane; Pai, Sheela S; Jacobson, Mercedes P; Gutierrez, Camilo A",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnp.0000000000000062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887606/,594

110073,Development of a dynamic model for ventral hernia mesh repair.,2014,"While even the most common definition of pain is under debate, pain assessment has remained the same for decades. But the paramount importance of precise pain management for successful healthcare has encouraged initiatives to improve the way pain is assessed. Recent approaches have proposed automatic pain evaluation systems using machine learning models trained with data coming from behavioural or physiological sensors. Although yielding promising results, machine learning studies for sensor-based pain recognition remain scattered and not necessarily easy to compare to each other. In particular, the important process of extracting features is usually optimised towards specific datasets. We thus introduce a comparison of feature extraction methods for pain recognition based on physiological sensors in this paper. In addition, the PainMonit Database (PMDB), a new dataset including both objective and subjective annotations for heat-induced pain in 52 subjects, is introduced. In total, five different approaches including techniques based on feature engineering and feature learning with deep learning are evaluated on the BioVid and PMDB datasets. Our studies highlight the following insights: (1) Simple feature engineering approaches can still compete with deep learning approaches in terms of performance. (2) More complex deep learning architectures do not yield better performance compared to simpler ones. (3) Subjective self-reports by subjects can be used instead of objective temperature-based annotations to build a robust pain recognition system.","Gouverneur, Philip; Li, Frédéric; Adamczyk, Wacław M; Szikszay, Tibor M; Luedtke, Kerstin; Grzegorzek, Marcin",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21144838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300578/,594

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve healthy volunteers were examined on two visits with an inversion recovery snapshot fast low angle shot sequence on a 1.5 T system. Coronal slices were obtained breathing room air as well as 100% oxygen with a flow rate of 15 L/min. For oxygen delivery a standard nontight face mask and a full closed air-cushion face mask were used. T1 relaxation times and the oxygen transfer function (OTF) were calculated. RESULTS The mean T1 values did not change significantly between the two visits (P > 0.05). The T1 values breathing 100% oxygen obtained using the full closed mask were significantly lower (1093 ± 38 msec; P < 0.05) compared to the standard mask (1157 ± 52 msec). Accordingly, the OTF was significantly higher for the full closed mask (P < 0.05). The OTF changed significantly on the second visit using the standard mask (P < 0.05). The full closed mask showed lower interindividual variation for both the T1 values (3.5% vs. 4.5%) as well as the OTF (12.4% vs. 22.0%) and no difference of the OTF on the second visit (P > 0.05).

111222,Intraoperative surgical margin re-resection for colorectal liver metastasis: is it worth the effort?,2015,"BACKGROUND The type 1 interferons (INF-alpha and INF-beta) are potent antiviral agents. Albumin-INF-alpha and albumin-INF-beta are novel recombinant proteins consisting of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta genetically fused to human albumin. METHODS The in vitro antiviral activity of albumin-IFN-alpha was evaluated against representative bioterrorism viral agents and the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. Antiviral activity was assessed using inhibition of cytopathic effect and neutral red staining. RESULTS EC(50) values for albumin-IFN-alpha ranged from <0.1 ng/ml for Punta Toro virus to 65 ng/ml for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in the neutral red assay. Albumin-IFN-beta showed 75- and 360-fold greater in vitro activity than albumin-IFN-alpha against Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome, respectively. CONCLUSION Further evaluation of these long-acting albumin-IFN fusion proteins as prophylactic or therapeutic agents against these viral agents of bioterrorism in relevant primate models is warranted.","Subramanian, G Mani; Moore, Paul A; Gowen, Brian B; Olsen, Aaron L; Barnard, Dale L; Paragas, Jason; Hogan, Robert J; Sidwell, Robert W",Chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1159/000140361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18560223/,594

Objectives To explore the elderlys healthcare experiences during the lockdown and the problems that may have arisen regarding accessibility to the healthcare system and emerging adaptations to medical care. Methods We coded the data using Atlas.ti 8 software and then triangled the analysis among researchers from different backgrounds. Finally, concept maps were developed and themes arising from these were described. Results Thirty-nine participants were interviewed from the metropolitan area in Buenos Aires from April to July of 2020. The main emerging themes were: 1) access to regularly scheduled consults, 2) access to chronic medication, 3) emergency consultations, and 4) the role of information and communication technologies. Accessibility to the healthcare system was compromised due to reduced outpatient consultations, affecting health checkups, diagnosis, and treatment. However, participants tried to keep their immunizations up to date. Information and communication technologies were used to fill digital prescriptions and online medical consultations. While this was a solution to many, others did not have access to these technologies or had trouble using them. Conclusions The global pandemic caused a reduction in outpatient medical consultations. Emerging needs originated new ways of carrying out medical consultations, mainly through information and communication technologies, which was a solution for many but led to the exclusion of others because of the preexisting technology gap.","Loza, Candela Agustina; Baez, German; Valverdi, Rodrigo; Pisula, Pedro; Salas Apaza, Julieta; Discacciati, Vilda; Granero, Mariano; Pizzorno, Ximena Salomé; Franco, Juan Víctor Ariel",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.04.8192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086668/,594

It affects the immune system of swine and causes huge epidemic losses every year. In our previous study, we provided evidence that DNA plasmid bearing porcine IL-15 (pVAX-pIL-15) might serve as an immune enhancer for DNA plasmid encoding porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus GP5 gene. In this study, PCV2 open reading frame (ORF)2 gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pVAX, resulting in the plasmid pVAX-PCV2-ORF2. Transient expression of the plasmid in BHK-21 cells could be detected using immunofluorescence assay. Experimental mice were divided into 5 groups and immunized with PBS, pVAX, pVAX-pIL-15, pVAX-PCV2-ORF2 or pVAX-pIL-15 plus pVAX-PCV2-ORF2. The results showed that the mice co-inoculated with pVAX-PCV2-ORF2 plus pVAX-pIL-15 had higher humoral and cellular immune responses than the others. In addition, DNA plasmid bearing PCV2 ORF2 gene had a protective effect against challenge with PCV2 in mice which could be promoted with the utilization of pIL-15.","Dong, Bo; Feng, Jing; Lin, Hai; Li, Lanxiang; Su, Dingding; Tu, Di; Zhu, Weijuan; Yang, Qing; Ren, Xiaofeng",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.09.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24091312/,594

We treated two patients with difficult ventilation caused by distal migration of a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) during robotic thymectomy. In the first case, migration of the DLT during one-lung ventilation (OLV) occurred after CO2 insufflation to the bilateral thoraxes was started. Oxygenation rapidly deteriorated because dependent lung expansion was restricted by CO2 insufflation. In the second case, migration of the DLT during OLV occurred while CO2 insufflation to a unilateral thorax and mediastinum was performed. In both cases, once migration of the DLT during OLV occurred with CO2 insufflation, readjusting the DLT became very difficult because our manipulation of bronchofiberscopy was prevented by the robot arms located above the patient's head and because deformation of the trachea/bronchus induced by CO2 insufflation caused a poor image of the bronchofiberscopic view. Thus, during robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with CO2 insufflation, since there is a potential risk of difficult ventilation with a DLT and since readjustment of the DLT is very difficult, discontinuing CO2 insufflation and switching to double-lung ventilation are needed in such a situation.","Sugiyama, Yuki; Mitsuzawa, Kunihiro; Yoshiyama, Yuki; Shimizu, Fumiko; Fuseya, Satoshi; Ichino, Takashi; Agatsuma, Hiroyuki; Shiina, Takayuki; Ito, Ken-Ichi; Kawamata, Mikito",Case reports in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3403045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28529813/,594

Although specific guidance was not available, the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) Best Practices and the ISO 20387 document have been utilized to deal with the pandemic disaster. The ISO experts and best practice experts in ISBER teamed up to share the available information and learn the experiences of biobanks concerning COVID-19 through organizing webinars, surveys, and town hall meetings. Four ISBER regional ambassadors (RAs) from the Indo-Pacific Rim (IPR) region were also actively involved at one of the town hall meetings. These RAs, who are from Australia, India, Indonesia, and Japan, and the Director-at-Large of the region, have summarized their experiences in this article. Materials and Methods: The ISBER Standards Committee COVID-19 Task Force has kindly provided the survey results. The extracted glossary from the results was categorized into 10 factors: (1) crisis management; (2) sample-related issues; (3) logistics-related issues; (4) equipment-related issues; (5) ethical, legal, and social implication-related issues; (6) operation-related issues; (7) personnel-related issues; (8) management-related issues; (9) infection-related issues; and (10) research-related issues. Each IPR RA has provided a case considering these 10 factors. Results and Discussion: Two key points have emerged from the scenarios, which are as follows: (1) impacts of the biobanks in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are similar to those in high-income countries (HICs) and (2) tolerance of the biobanks in LMICs is not so robust as those in HICs. Furthermore, communication strategies with internal and external stakeholders are critical for a biobank to manage this crisis. This article summarizes the impacts, indicates the opportunities that COVID-19 has brought to the biobank community, and highlights the usefulness of the network beyond biobank services. Lastly, the biobanks need to turn the challenges into opportunities to overcome the crisis.","Yadav, Birendra Kumar; Ng, Wayne; Fachiroh, Jajah; Tsuruyama, Tatsuaki; Furuta, Koh",Biopreservation and biobanking,https://doi.org/10.1089/bio.2020.0078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118846/,594

The aim of this study was to investigate what kind of precautions Turkish dentists take in dental clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study population consisted of dentists in Turkey. An online questionnaire (23 questions-57 items) was sent to a sample of Turkish dentists from March 16 to March 20, 2020. The questionnaire comprised a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics, their concerns, and the measures taken in dental clinics against COVID-19. This study included a total of 1,958 Turkish dentists. A total of 1,274 (65.1%) were general dentists, and 684 (34.9%) were specialists. Five hundred twenty-two (26.7%) dentists attended an informational meeting on COVID-19. Of these dentists, 69.8% were aware of COVID-19 according to their self-assessed knowledge scores. More than 90% of the dentists were concerned about themselves and their families. Only 12% of the dentists wore an N95 mask. Although Turkish dentists took some precautionary measures, they did not take enough precautions to protect themselves, the dental staff, and other patients from COVID-19. As the number of COVID-19 cases increased, the measures taken slightly increased in dental clinics as well. Dentists are strongly recommended to take maximum precautions in the clinical setting.

Today, septic abortion is an uncommon event in the United States. The most critical treatment of septic abortion remains the prompt removal of infected tissue. Antibiotic administration and fluid resuscitation provide necessary secondary levels of treatment. Most young physicians have never treated septic abortion. Many obstetrician-gynecologists experience, or plan to experience, global health activities and will likely care for women with septic abortion. Thus, updated knowledge of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, microbes, and proper treatment is needed to optimally treat this emergency condition when it exists. The pathophysiology of septic abortion involves infection of the placenta, especially the maternal villous space that leads to a high frequency of bacteremia. Symptoms and signs range from mild to severe. The microbes involved are usually common vaginal bacteria, including anaerobes, but occasionally potentially very serious and lethal infection is caused by bacteria that produce toxins. The primary treatment is early curettage to remove infected and devitalized tissue even in the face of continued fetal heart tones. Important secondary treatments are the administration of fluids and antibiotics. Updated references of sepsis and septic shock are reviewed.","Eschenbach, David A",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000000795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25932831/,594

The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize existing research on community- and home-based interventions designed to improve parenting and reduce risk of maltreatment for families with SENs, applying a program logic framework. The review includes studies that used preexperimental, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs. Twelve interventions were identified. Of the nine studies that used more rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs, five showed positive effects on at least one parenting or child maltreatment outcome, although some studies showed high risk of bias. Full coherence among the intended participants, theory of change, and program components was observed for only two interventions.

115547,Surface initiated polymerizations from silica nanoparticles.,2006-04-18,"Anaerobic digestion technology has been widely used because it has a unique advantage of producing biogas as a renewable energy source. Therefore, several methods were studied to facilitate anaerobic methane production process. Coupling direct voltage and single conductive particles was an effective method to improve anaerobic wastewater treatment efficiency and methane production. However, the enhancement method was limited in this process due to the current of direct voltage or the toxicity of nanoparticles. Therefore, the granular activated carbon loaded with nanoscale zero valent iron (GAC-NZVI) particles prepared by co-precipitation method were added to the anaerobic synthetic wastewater system with direct voltage (0.10 V) to improve the treatment efficiency in this study. GAC-NZVI particles were added into anaerobic system with 0.10 V direct voltage to enhance CH4 production process. The COD removal and total CH4 production were enhanced by 4.22 % and 10.83 % with GAC-NZVI particles. The measurement results of EPS and Fe concentration showed that GAC-NZVI particles promoted the secretion of EPS by microorganisms, which could improve the floc strength of granular sludge. The measurements of conductivity and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that particles accelerated the metabolism of microorganism and promoted the electron transfer process. The increasing of Methanothrix and Methanobacterium could strengthen the methanogenesis. The abundances of bacteria and archaea using indirect interspecies electron exchange form (such as H2 or formate transfer microorganisms) were decreased after adding the particles. The results indicated that anaerobic treatment efficiency could be enhanced under the combined action of direct voltage and particles.","Sun, Muchen; Jiang, Hongxuan; Zhang, Zhaohan; Lv, Miao; Liu, Guohong; Feng, Yujie",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399267/,594

This article reviews the underlying physical principles of these devices in addition to examining both animal and human comparative studies in an effort to allow clinicians to make informed decisions when selecting a device to measure cardiac output. DATA SOURCES Peer-reviewed manuscripts indexed in PubMed. STUDY SELECTION A systematic search of the PubMed database for articles describing the use of cardiac output monitors yielded 1,526 sources that were included in the analysis. DATA EXTRACTION From all published cardiac output monitoring studies reviewed, the animal model, number of independent measurements, and correlation between techniques was extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS Comparative studies in animals and humans between devices designed for measurement of cardiac output and experimental reference standards indicate thermodilution and Doppler-based techniques to have acceptable accuracy across a wide range of hemodynamic conditions, with bioimpedance techniques being less accurate. Thermodilution devices are marginally more accurate than Doppler-based devices but suffer from slower response time, increased invasiveness, and require stable core temperatures, good operator technique, and a competent tricuspid valve. Doppler-based techniques are less invasive and offer beat-to-beat measurements and excellent trending ability, but are dependent on accurate beam alignment and knowledge of aortic cross-sectional area. Studies of newer devices, such as pulse contour analysis, partial rebreathing, and pulse wave velocity, are far less in number and are primarily based on comparisons with thermodilution-based cardiac output measurements. Studies show widely ranging results. CONCLUSION Thermodilution is relatively accurate for cardiac output measurements in both animals and humans when compared to experimental reference standards. Doppler-based techniques appear to have similar accuracy as thermodilution pulmonary artery catheters. Bioimpedance, pulse contour, partial rebreathing, and pulse wave velocity-based devices have not been studied as rigorously; however, the majority of studies included in this analysis point towards decreased accuracy.","Thiele, Robert H; Bartels, Karsten; Gan, Tong J",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25251758/,594
115673,Thoracoscopic traction technique in long gap esophageal atresia: entering a new era.,2015,"BACKGROUND ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and Ang 1-7 (angiotensin 1-7) are endogenous negative regulators of the renin-angiotensin system exerting cardioprotective effects in models of heart failure. Recombinant human ACE2 markedly increased plasma Ang 1-7 and lowered Ang II levels in phase II clinical trials. We hypothesize that the dynamic state of this renin-angiotensin system protective arm could influence long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure. METHODS One hundred ten patients with heart failure were prospectively enrolled from our outpatient clinic and the emergency department. Comprehensive circulating and equilibrium levels of plasma angiotensin peptide profiles were assessed using novel liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectroscopy techniques. Plasma aldosterone, B-type natriuretic peptide, active renin concentration, and clinical profiles were captured at baseline. During a median follow-up of 5.1 years (interquartile range, 4.7-5.7 years), composite clinical outcomes were assessed using all-cause in-patient hospitalizations and mortality. RESULTS Circulating and equilibrium angiotensin peptide levels strongly correlated in our patient cohort. Adjusting for covariates, elevated equilibrium (hazard ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.18-0.81] P=0.012), and circulating (hazard ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.18-0.80] P=0.011) Ang 1-7/Ang II ratios were associated with improved survival. Lower hospitalization duration was also associated with elevated equilibrium (P<0.001) and circulating (P=0.023) Ang 1-7/Ang II ratios. Importantly, individual Ang 1-7 and Ang II peptide levels failed to predict all-cause mortality or hospitalization duration in our patient cohort. CONCLUSIONS We extensively profiled plasma angiotensin peptides in patients with heart failure and identified elevated Ang 1-7/Ang II ratio, as an independent and incremental predictor of beneficial outcomes, higher survival rate, and decreased hospitalization duration. These findings provide important clinical evidence supporting strategies aiming to promote the beneficial Ang 1-7/Mas axis concurrent with renin-angiotensin system blockade therapies inhibiting the detrimental Ang II/AT1 receptor axis.","Wang, Kaiming; Basu, Ratnadeep; Poglitsch, Marko; Bakal, Jeffrey A; Oudit, Gavin Y",Circulation.

OBJECTIVE To present 5-yr follow-up for patients treated in the Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms clinical trial. METHODS In our prospective, multicenter trial, 109 complex internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms in 107 subjects were treated with the PED. Patients were followed per a standardized protocol at 180 d and 1, 3, and 5 yr. Aneurysm occlusion, in-stent stenosis, modified Rankin Scale scores, and complications were recorded. RESULTS The primary endpoint of complete aneurysm occlusion at 180 d (73.6%) was previously reported. Aneurysm occlusion for those patients with angiographic follow-up progressively increased over time to 86.8% (79/91), 93.4% (71/76), and 95.2% (60/63) at 1, 3, and 5 yr, respectively. Six aneurysms (5.7%) were retreated. New serious device-related events at 1, 3, and 5 yr were noted in 1% (1/96), 3.5% (3/85), and 0% (0/81) of subjects. There were 4 (3.7%) reported deaths in our trial. Seventy-eight (96.3%) of 81 patients with 5-yr clinical follow-up had modified Rankin Scale scores ≤2. No delayed neurological deaths or hemorrhagic or ischemic cerebrovascular events were reported beyond 6 mo. No recanalization of a previously occluded aneurysm was observed. CONCLUSION Our 5-yr findings demonstrate that PED is a safe and effective treatment for large and giant wide-necked aneurysms of the intracranial ICA, with high rates of complete occlusion and low rates of delayed adverse events.","Becske, Tibor; Brinjikji, Waleed; Potts, Matthew B; Kallmes, David F; Shapiro, Maksim; Moran, Christopher J; Levy, Elad I; McDougall, Cameron G; Szikora, István; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Woo, Henry H; Lopes, Demetrius K; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Fiorella, David J; Saatci, Isil; Cekirge, Saruhan H; Berez, Aaron L; Cher, Daniel J; Berentei, Zsolt; Marosfoi, Miklós; Nelson, Peter K",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyw014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362885/,594

Although the cause remains unknown, discussion sections highlight new insights into the epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, pathology, natural history, and long-term outcomes. Prompt diagnosis is essential, and an updated algorithm defines supplemental information to be used to assist the diagnosis when classic clinical criteria are incomplete. Although intravenous immune globulin is the mainstay of initial treatment, the role for additional primary therapy in selected patients is discussed. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients do not respond to initial intravenous immune globulin, and recommendations for additional therapies are provided. Careful initial management of evolving coronary artery abnormalities is essential, necessitating an increased frequency of assessments and escalation of thromboprophylaxis. Risk stratification for long-term management is based primarily on maximal coronary artery luminal dimensions, normalized as Z scores, and is calibrated to both past and current involvement. Patients with aneurysms require life-long and uninterrupted cardiology follow-up. CONCLUSIONS These recommendations provide updated and best evidence-based guidance to healthcare providers who diagnose and manage Kawasaki disease, but clinical decision making should be individualized to specific patient circumstances.","McCrindle, Brian W; Rowley, Anne H; Newburger, Jane W; Burns, Jane C; Bolger, Anne F; Gewitz, Michael; Baker, Annette L; Jackson, Mary Anne; Takahashi, Masato; Shah, Pinak B; Kobayashi, Tohru; Wu, Mei-Hwan; Saji, Tsutomu T; Pahl, Elfriede",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28356445/,594

This carburized SKD11 punch was employed for upsetting the pure titanium wire with the diameter of 1.00 mm up to the reduction of thickness by 70% in a single shot. Its contact interface to titanium work was analyzed to describe the anti-galling behavior in this forging. Little trace of titanium proved that the galling process was suppressed by the in situ solid lubrication. The isolated free carbon agglomerates are wrought as a solid lubricant to sustain the galling-free forging process. This anti-galling upsetting reduced the residual strains in the forged wires. A long titanium wire with a length of 45 mm was incrementally upset to yield the titanium ribbon with a thickness of 0.3 mm, the width of 2.3 mm, and the length of 50 mm. The grain size of original pure titanium was much reduced to 2 μm on average. A micro-pillared microtexture was imprinted onto this forged titanium ribbon.","Aizawa, Tatsuhiko; Yoshino, Tomoaki; Suzuki, Yohei; Shiratori, Tomomi",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14102536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068328/,594
117080,Routine cholangiography during rigid-hybrid transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic cholecystectomy.,2014,"OBJECTIVES Nerve-sparing techniques to avoid bladder dysfunction in abdominal radical hysterectomy have been established during the past two decades, and they have been applied to radical trachelectomy. Although trachelectomy retains the uterine corpus, no report mentions the preservation of uterine branches of pelvic nerves. The aim of the present study was to introduce and discuss our unique concept for preserving them. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS Four cases with FIGO stage Ia2-Ib1 cervical cancer, in which preservation of uterine branches of the pelvic nerves was attempted, are presented. Operative procedures basically followed the previously reported standard approaches for nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy or trachelectomy, except for some points. Before resection of the sacrouterine ligament, the hypogastric nerve was first identified and translocated laterally. Subsequently, the uterine branches of the pelvic nerve were identified as a continuation of the hypogastric nerve and could be scooped with forceps by detachment of the surrounding connective tissues. Further detachment toward the uterine corpus enabled them to be completely separated from the cervix. This separation was extended up to the level of the junction of the upper and lower branches of the uterine artery. Thereafter, standard resection of the parametrium and paracolpium was performed, followed by cervical resection when it was confirmed that the isolated uterine branches of the pelvic nerves were safely translocated and preserved. There were no recurrences of cancer in these patients. CONCLUSIONS Uterine branches of autonomic nerves can be safely preserved, and the procedure may be considered one of the nerve-sparing techniques for radical abdominal trachelectomy, which may hopefully improve the reproductive outcomes of this operation, although it needs to be evaluated with more patients.","Kyo, Satoru; Mizumoto, Yasunari; Takakura, Masahiro; Nakamura, Mitsuhiro; Sato, Emi; Katagiri, Hiroshi; Ishikawa, Masako; Nakayama, Kentaro; Fujiwara, Hiroshi","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2015.06.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26196656/,594

Especially the neoliberal myth as the only way of human progress, and technological development as the essence of social progress and main reason for scientific research. Among the significant revelations is the dismantling of the Welfare state and public health services, which render the population's vulnerability in the face of pandemics. Planetary devastation favors its emergence, and the correlation between the despondency of human activities and the (fleeting) improvement of planetary life, which denotes the radical incompatibility between the permanence of neoliberal capitalism that degrades everything and preservation and care of life in its infinite diversity, including human life! Another notion of human progress is proposed: the rise of values involved in the coexistence, and the spiritual, intellectual, and moral growth of the human condition in harmony with the planetary ecosystem. Regarding the deep reasons for the catastrophe, it is argued that it is humanity itself by its way of being, thinking, acting, living together and relating to the planet. Therefore, the conclusion reached is the urgent need to undertake an alternative path in the search for another possible world, hospitable and dignifying for all forms of life.","Viniegra-Velázquez, Leonardo",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662983/,594
117230,Mesh fixation in laparoscopic incisional hernia repair: glue fixation provides attachment strength similar to absorbable tacks but differs substantially in different meshes.,2011,"BACKGROUND A single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was developed to improve outcomes as compared with the four-port classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). Any potential benefits associated with a SILC have been suggested by previous studies reporting few patients with different surgical techniques. The aim of this study was to describe the experience with a standardized SILC as compared with CLC. METHODS From June 2010 to January 2012, 40 patients underwent a SILC [median age: 47.5 years (25-92)] and operative and peri-operative data were prospectively collected. Over the same period, 37 patients underwent a CLC. A 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for qualitative data. The costs of SILC and CLC were also compared. RESULTS For those patients undergoing a SILC the median operating time was 70 min (24-110). There were no conversions. An additional trocar was necessary in 16 patients. Four patients developed post-operative complications. The median immediate post-operative pain score was 5 (0-10). The median quality of life and cosmetic satisfaction at the initial post-operative visit were 10 (6-10) and 10 (5-10), respectively (VAS). Although the surgical results of both groups were similar, post-operative complications were exclusively reported in the SILC group (two incisional hernias). CONCLUSION Standardization of SILC is possible but associated with an important rate of additional trocar placement and a disturbing rate of incisional hernias.","Tranchart, Hadrien; Ketoff, Serge; Lainas, Panagiotis; Pourcher, Guillaume; Di Giuro, Giuseppe; Tzanis, Dimitrios; Ferretti, Stefano; Dautruche, Antoine; Devaquet, Niaz; Dagher, Ibrahim",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-2574.2012.00612.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23659566/,594

Many efforts have been made to validate different methods of identifying asthma-COPD overlap cases based on symptoms, spirometry and medical history in epidemiological studies using healthcare databases. There are various coding algorithm strategies that can be used and selection depends on targeted validation. The primary objectives of this systematic review are to identify validated methods (or algorithms) that identify patients with ACO from healthcare databases and summarise the reported validity measures of these methods. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE databases and the Web of Science will be systematically searched by using appropriate search strategies that are able to identify studies containing validated codes and algorithms for the diagnosis of ACO in healthcare databases published, in English, before October 2018. For each selected study, we require the presence of at least one test measure (eg, sensitivity, specificity etc). We will also include studies, in which the validated algorithm is compared with an external reference standard such as questionnaires completed by patients or physicians, medical charts review, manual review or an independent second database. For all selected studies, a uniform table will be created to summarise the following vital information: name of author, publication year, country, data source, population, clinical outcome, algorithms, reference standard method of validation and characteristics of the test measure used to determine validity.

However, the effect of hemodialysis on cerebral blood flow is poorly studied and confounding factors like blood pressure and ultrafiltration as well as temperature changes have rarely been accounted for. The aim of our study was to use state-of-the-art technology to evaluate the effect of a single dialysis session on cerebral perfusion as well as on vascular stiffness. METHODS Chronic hemodialysis patients (7 male/3 female, mean age 58 years) were recruited. Cerebral blood flow and arterial pulse wave velocity were measured before and immediately after a hemodialysis session. To exclude effects of volume changes we kept ultrafiltration to a minimum, allowing no change in body weight. Isothermic conditions were maintained by using the GENIUS single-pass batch-dialysis system with a high-flux polysulfone dialyser. Cerebral blood flow was measured by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Pulse wave velocity was measured using the SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, USA) device by a single operator. RESULTS This study shows for the first time that isovolemic, isothermic hemodialysis neither affected blood pressure or heart rate, nor total or regional cerebral perfusion. There was also no change in pulse wave velocity. CONCLUSIONS Mechanisms other than the dialysis procedure itself might be causative for the high incidence of ischemic strokes in this patient population. Moreover, the sole removal of uremic toxins does not lead to short-term effects on vascular stiffness, underlying the importance of volume control in this patient population.","Reising, Ansgar; Sambale, Saskia; Donnerstag, Frank; Schmidt, Julius J; Hafer, Carsten; Schmidt, Bernhard M W; Kielstein, Jan T",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23451044/,594

RESULTS The percentages of children in poverty, severe housing problems, and people not proficient in the English language were significant predictors associated with increases in case, hospitalization, and death rates. Diabetic prevalence was significantly associated with increases in the hospitalization and death rates; in contrast, the percentages of people with excessive drinking and female were inversely associated with hospitalization and death rates. Other independent variables showing an association with death rate included the percentages of people reporting fair or poor health and American Indian/Alaska Native.

While the virus normally causes mild to moderate disease, hospitalization and death can occur in many cases. There are several methodologies that are used for detection; however problems such as decreased sensitivity and high rates of false-negative results may arise. There is a crucial need for an effective sample preparation technology that concentrates viruses at low abundance while excluding resident analytes that may interfere with detection. Nanotrap particles are hydrogel particles that are coupled to chemical dye affinity baits that bind a broad range of proteins and virions. Within minutes (<30 minutes), Nanotrap particles concentrate low abundant proteins and viruses from clinically complex matrices. Nanotrap particles with reactive red baits concentrated numerous respiratory viruses including various strains and subtypes of Influenza virus, Coronavirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus from saliva, nasal fluid swab specimens, and nasal aspirates. Detection was enhanced more than 10-fold when coupled to plaque assays and qRT-PCR. Importantly, Nanotrap particle can efficiently capture and concentrate multiple viral pathogens during a coinfection scenario. These results collectively demonstrate that Nanotrap particles are an important tool that can easily be integrated into various detection methodologies.","Shafagati, Nazly; Fite, Katherine; Patanarut, Alexis; Baer, Alan; Pinkham, Chelsea; An, Soyeon; Foote, Benjamin; Lepene, Benjamin; Kehn-Hall, Kylene",Virulence,https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2016.1185585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27145085/,594

METHODS The participants were 217 PLWH with confirmed diagnoses of HIV and undergoing antiretroviral treatment. They assessed their NA and rumination for five consecutive days each evening via an online survey. RESULTS Results showed that inertia in NA is negatively related to inertia in rumination. Both innovations were unrelated. However, the individuals with relatively higher overall NA were also more reactive to external factors and/or had more variability in their daily lives, to which they respond with NA. Finally, the autoregressive effects were revealed to be important for spillover effects in a direction that is coherent with a given inertia. Thus, the direction of the cascade between daily NA and rumination depends on the area of major regulatory weakness. CONCLUSION The results support the view that intensity, inertia, and innovation are distinct dimensions in spite of the common assumption that higher overall intensity of emotions and coping should be strongly related or even synonymous to their perseveration.","Rzeszutek, Marcin; Gruszczyńska, Ewa","Anxiety, stress, and coping",https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1887481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594920/,594

METHODS An owner-based questionnaire was used to grade dogs based on their respiratory signs before surgery and at least six weeks after surgery. Epidemiological data and results from presurgical pharyngeal and laryngeal examination and CT scan findings for 75 dogs undergoing airway surgery were collected from the medical records. RESULTS 70.7 per cent of dogs showed an improvement in respiratory signs following rhinoplasty and palatoplasty. This improvement was associated with the severity of inspiratory efforts and the Poncet score on presentation, but not with any other clinical sign or anatomical abnormality found during BOAS assessment, nor by the degree of craniofacial shortening as determined by CT-scan. Presurgical snoring was positively associated with the degree of narrowing of pharyngeal dimensions. CONCLUSIONS Dogs presenting with clinical signs of BOAS benefit from rhinoplasty and palatoplasty alone. The degree of narrowing of pharyngeal dimensions appears to be associated with severity of snoring while soft palate length alone was not.","Seneviratne, Maheeka; Kaye, Benjamin Marcus; Ter Haar, Gert",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.105624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764033/,594
120338,"'Let us help you with testing,' say vet labs.",2020-04-18,"Much of our understanding of actin-driven phenotypes in eukaryotes has come from the ""yeast-to-human"" opisthokont lineage and the related amoebozoa. Outside of these groups lies the genus Naegleria, which shared a common ancestor with humans >1 billion years ago and includes the ""brain-eating amoeba."" Unlike nearly all other known eukaryotic cells, Naegleria amoebae lack interphase microtubules; this suggests that actin alone drives phenotypes like cell crawling and phagocytosis. Naegleria therefore represents a powerful system to probe actin-driven functions in the absence of microtubules, yet surprisingly little is known about its actin cytoskeleton. Using genomic analysis, microscopy, and molecular perturbations, we show that Naegleria encodes conserved actin nucleators and builds Arp2/3-dependent lamellar protrusions. These protrusions correlate with the capacity to migrate and eat bacteria. Because human cells also use Arp2/3-dependent lamellar protrusions for motility and phagocytosis, this work supports an evolutionarily ancient origin for these processes and establishes Naegleria as a natural model system for studying microtubule-independent cytoskeletal phenotypes.","Velle, Katrina B; Fritz-Laylin, Lillian K",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202007158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960946/,594

The aim of this consensus was to provide guidance on the appropriate use of CE in clinical practice. METHODS A systematic literature search identified studies on the use of CE in patients with Crohn's disease, celiac disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS The consensus includes 21 statements focused on the use of small-bowel CE and colon capsule endoscopy. CE was recommended for patients with suspected, known, or relapsed Crohn's disease when ileocolonoscopy and imaging studies were negative if it was imperative to know whether active Crohn's disease was present in the small bowel. It was not recommended in patients with chronic abdominal pain or diarrhea, in whom there was no evidence of abnormal biomarkers typically associated with Crohn's disease. CE was recommended to assess patients with celiac disease who have unexplained symptoms despite appropriate treatment, but not to make the diagnosis. In patients with overt gastrointestinal bleeding, and negative findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, CE should be performed as soon as possible. CE was recommended only in selected patients with unexplained, mild, chronic iron-deficiency anemia. CE was suggested for surveillance in patients with polyposis syndromes or other small-bowel cancers, who required small-bowel studies. Colon capsule endoscopy should not be substituted routinely for colonoscopy. Patients should be made aware of the potential risks of CE including a failed procedure, capsule retention, or a missed lesion. Finally, standardized criteria for training and reporting in CE should be defined. CONCLUSIONS CE generally should be considered a complementary test in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, Crohn's disease, or celiac disease, who have had negative or inconclusive endoscopic or imaging studies.","Enns, Robert A; Hookey, Lawrence; Armstrong, David; Bernstein, Charles N; Heitman, Steven J; Teshima, Christopher; Leontiadis, Grigorios I; Tse, Frances; Sadowski, Daniel",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2016.12.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28063287/,594

No significant differences in recurrence-free survival or cancer-specific survival were observed; however, the DM group had worse overall survival (OS). The DM group had a higher number of deaths from other diseases than the non-DM group, and these patients had significantly higher postoperative hemoglobin A1c levels than patients with cancer-related death. CONCLUSION The presence and control status of preoperative DM are useful predictors of both postoperative complications and OS in operable NSCLC patients. Concomitant diabetes-related complications have a negative effect on long-term survival in diabetic NSCLC patients, and long-term glycemic control is important to prolong OS.","Kaseda, Kaoru; Hishida, Tomoyuki; Masai, Kyohei; Asakura, Keisuke; Hayashi, Yuichiro; Asamura, Hisao",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33002203/,594

121743,Single-port splenectomy: Current update and controversies.,2011,"PURPOSE Although obesity is considered as a risk factor for postoperative morbidity in abdominal surgery, its effect on the outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted colectomy (LAC) is still unclear. The technical difficulty and risk factor for postoperative complication in LAC are thought to be influenced by visceral obesity. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of visceral fat on the surgical outcomes of LAC. METHODS Between April 2005 and December 2010, consecutive patients with preoperatively diagnosed colon cancer, excluding medium and low rectal cancer, who underwent LAC, were enrolled. Their visceral fat area (VFA) and body mass index (BMI) were prospectively collected. The VFA was assessed by Fat Scan software. The patients were classified into two groups as follows: VFA nonobese with VFA <100 cm(2) (VNO) and VFA obese with VFA ≧100 cm(2) (VO). The predictive factors for surgical complications of LAC were evaluated by univariate and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS A total of 338 consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. Of the 338 patients, 194 (57.4 %) and 138 (42.6 %) were classified into the VNO and VO groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that high BMI (≧25 kg/m(2)) and VO independently predicted the incidence of overall postoperative complications (p = 0.040 and 0.007, respectively). VO was more highly related to the incidence of overall postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage (p = 0.021), and surgical site infection (SSI) (p = 0.013) than high BMI. CONCLUSIONS VFA is a more useful parameter than BMI in predicting surgical outcomes after LAC.","Watanabe, Jun; Tatsumi, Kenji; Ota, Mitsuyoshi; Suwa, Yusuke; Suzuki, Shinsuke; Watanabe, Akira; Ishibe, Atsushi; Watanabe, Kazuteru; Akiyama, Hirotoshi; Ichikawa, Yasushi; Morita, Satoshi; Endo, Itaru",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-013-1803-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24297037/,594

In the search for the best CCK-2R binding peptides, we have synthesized, evaluated and compared the CCK8 peptide (Asp-Tyr-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH(2) ) and two gastrin analogs commonly referred to as MG0 (DGlu-Glu(5)-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH(2) ) and MG11 (DGlu(1)-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH(2) ). The N-terminal portion of the three peptide sequences was derivatized by introducing the DTPAGlu or DOTA chelators to allow radiolobeling with (111) In(III) and (68) Ga(III), respectively. Saturation binding and cellular internalization experiments were performed on A431 cells overexpressing CCK2R (A431-CCK2R). All compounds showed Kd values in the nM range and were internalized with similar rates in CCK2 receptor overexpressing cells. Biodistribution experiments showed higher specific uptake of both MG0-based compounds compared to conjugates containing the CCK8 and MG11 peptide sequences. The higher retention levels of MG0-based peptides were associated with markedly elevated and undesired kidney uptake compared to the other compounds. Current indications suggest that the 5 Glu N-terminal residues while improving peptide stability and receptor-mediated tumor uptake cause unacceptably high kidney retention. Although displaying lower absolute tumor uptake values, the DOTA-coupled CCK8 peptide provided the best tumor to kidney uptake ratio and appears more suitable as lead compound for improvement of radiopharmaceutical properties.","Tornesello, Anna Lucia; Aurilio, Michela; Accardo, Antonella; Tarallo, Laura; Barbieri, Antonio; Arra, Claudio; Tesauro, Diego; Morelli, Giancarlo; Aloj, Luigi",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/psc.1327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21351319/,594

122386,Robotic-assisted laparoscopy vs conventional laparoscopy for the treatment of advanced stage endometriosis.,2015,"During triage of possibly irradiated individuals after a criticality accident or nuclear weapon event, it is necessary to decide whether a patient has experienced a clinically significant dose (> 2 Gy) that would require referral for additional evaluation and medical treatment. This is a binary decision: yes or no. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an appropriate decision parameter, is simple to obtain in field operations, and is recognized in clinical medicine as an independent marker of systemic inflammation. NLR is evaluated for usefulness in triage using data from the Radiation Accident Registry at the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS). A criticality accident data set has been prepared using historic complete blood counts from 12 criticality events with 33 patients. In addition, a cohort of 125 normal controls has been assembled for comparison with the radiation accident data. In the control set, NLR is found to be 2.1 ± 0.06 (mean ± SEM) and distributed consistent with a Gaussian distribution. A patient from the 1958 Y-12 criticality accident is presented as an example of the time dependence of NLR after an event. In this case, NLR is statistically elevated above controls from <4 h until ~20 d post-event, and for times >20 d post-event, NLR is less than the control value, returning to baseline > ~40 d. The latter result has been confirmed using late hematological data taken from patients at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and this appears to be a general finding. Since triage is a binary decision, analyzing NLR with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics is appropriate. Maximizing the Youden J statistic (sensitivity + specificity -1) determines an appropriate decision point. For this data set, the decision point for NLR is found to be 3.33, with area under the curve (AUC) 0.865, sensitivity 0.67, specificity 0.97, positive predictive value (PPV) 0.85, and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.92. Therefore, when a known criticality accident or nuclear weapon event has occurred and if the patient's NLR is greater than 3.33 early post-event, then that person should be referred for further health physics and medical evaluation.","Goans, Ronald E; Iddins, Carol J",Health physics,https://doi.org/10.1097/hp.0000000000001342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229945/,594

However, from the viewpoint of decision makers, due to lower external validity, practical results of efficacy research are often not in line with the huge investments made over decades. METHOD We conducted a narrative review. With a special focus on homeopathy, we give an overview on cohort, comparative cohort, case-control and cross-sectional study designs and explain guidelines and tools that help to improve the quality of observational studies, such as the STROBE Statement, RECORD, GRACE and ENCePP Guide. RESULTS Within the conventional medical research field, two types of arguments have been employed in favor of observational studies. First, observational studies allow for a more generalizable and robust estimation of effects in clinical practice, and if cohorts are large enough, there is no over-estimation of effect sizes, as is often feared. We argue that observational research is needed to balance the current over-emphasis on internal validity at the expense of external validity. Thus, observational research can be considered an important research tool to describe ""real-world"" care settings and can assist with the design and inform the results of randomised controlled trails. CONCLUSIONS We present recommendations for designing, conducting and reporting observational studies in homeopathy and provide recommendations to complement the STROBE Statement for homeopathic observational studies.","Teut, Michael; Walach, Harald; Varanasi, Roja; Manchanda, Raj K; Oberai, Praveen; Thompson, Elizabeth; Ulbrich-Zürni, Susanne",Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1708045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408374/,594
122531,Quality of Life after Complex Abdominal Wall Reconstruction.,2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION The advent of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has led to significantly improved disease outcome in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), but response of ALK/EGFR-positive tumors to immune therapy is limited. The underlying immune biology is incompletely understood. METHODS We performed comparative mRNA expression profiling of 31 ALK-positive, 40 EGFR-positive and 43 ALK/EGFR-negative lung ADC focused on immune gene expression. The presence and levels of tumor infiltration lymphocytes (TILs) as well as fourteen specific immune cell populations were estimated from the gene expression profiles. RESULTS While total TILs were not lower in ALK-positive and EGFR-positive tumors compared to ALK/EGFR-negative tumors, specific immunosuppressive characteristics were detected in both subgroups: In ALK-positive tumors, regulatory T cells were significantly higher compared to EGFR-positive (fold change: FC = 1.9, p = 0.0013) and ALK/EGFR-negative tumors (FC = 2.1, p = 0.00047). In EGFR-positive tumors, cytotoxic cells were significantly lower compared to ALK-positive (FC = - 1.7, p = 0.016) and to ALK/EGFR-negative tumors (FC = - 2.1, p = 2.0E-05). A total number of 289 genes, 40 part of cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling, were differentially expressed between the three subgroups. Among the latter, five genes were differently expressed in both ALK-positive and EGFR-positive tumors, while twelve genes showed differential expression solely in ALK-positive tumors and eleven genes solely in EGFR-positive tumors. CONCLUSION Targeted gene expression profiling is a promising tool to read out tumor microenvironment characteristics from routine diagnostic lung cancer biopsies. Significant immune reactivity including specific immunosuppressive characteristics in ALK- and EGFR-positive lung ADC, but not a total absence of immune infiltration supports further clinical evaluation of immune-modulators as partners of ICB in such tumors.","Budczies, Jan; Kirchner, Martina; Kluck, Klaus; Kazdal, Daniel; Glade, Julia; Allgäuer, Michael; Kriegsmann, Mark; Heußel, Claus-Peter; Herth, Felix J; Winter, Hauke; Meister, Michael; Muley, Thomas; Goldmann, Torsten; Fröhling, Stefan; Wermke, Martin; Waller, Cornelius F; Tufman, Amanda; Reck, Martin; Peters, Solange; Schirmacher, Peter; Thomas, Michael; Christopoulos, Petros; Stenzinger, Albrecht","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-021-02981-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125345/,594

Beyond the historical benefits and effects of ketamine, newer developments have occurred worthy of an update. This review will discuss common uses and indications for ketamine in the perioperative setting, as well as highlight newer indications in recent years. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple studies have examined the use of ketamine in a variety of environments, as ketamine has become more popular in emergency rooms and ICUs. Ketamine may be particularly beneficial in management of burn patients, who often require multiple procedures over the course of their treatment. Ketamine's role in the ongoing opioid crisis has been of particular interest, with multiple studies evaluating its potential role in managing both acute and chronic pain conditions. Ongoing studies examining the role of ketamine in treatment of depressions show promise as well. SUMMARY Ketamine is regaining popularity in the field of anesthesia and beyond. New studies provide insight on the many indications and use that anesthesia providers may encounter during their perioperative care of patients. Ongoing research is needed to further elucidate ketamine's effects on the management of psychiatric conditions and potential indications for ketamine metabolites.","Barrett, William; Buxhoeveden, Michael; Dhillon, Sabrina",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826629/,594

The current study sought to determine the influence of R&S beliefs on treatment decision making among patients and providers in the context of cancer care. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the literature using web-based search engines and discipline-specific databases. Search terms included a combination of the following Medical Subject Headings and key terms: ""cancer,""""spirituality,""""religion,"" and ""decision making."" We used Covidence to screen relevant studies and extracted data into Microsoft Excel. RESULTS Among 311 screened studies, 32 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Most studies evaluated the patient perspective (n = 29), while 2 studies evaluated the provider perspective and 1 study examined both. In assessing patient R&S relative to treatment decision making, we thematically characterized articles according to decision-making contexts, including general (n = 11), end-of-life/advance care planning (n = 13), and other: specific (n = 8). Specific contexts included, but were not limited to, clinical trial participation (n = 2) and use of complementary and alternative medicine (n = 4). Within end-of-life/advance care planning, there was a discrepancy regarding how R&S influenced treatment decision making. The influence of R&S on general treatment decision making was both active and passive, with some patients wanting more direct integration of their R&S beliefs in treatment decision making. In contrast, other patients were less aware of indirect R&S influences. Patient perception of the impact of R&S on treatment decision making varied relative to race/ethnicity, being more pronounced among Black patients. CONCLUSION Most articles focused on R&S relative to treatment decision making at the end of life, even though R&S appeared important across the care continuum. To improve patient-centered cancer care, providers need to be more aware of the impact of R&S on treatment decision making.","Kelly, Elizabeth Palmer; Myers, Brian; Henderson, Brent; Sprik, Petra; White, Kelsey B; Pawlik, Timothy M",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211022246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196249/,594
123033,Correlations between intra-abdominal pressure and obesity-related co-morbidities.,2009,"The interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are a family of antiviral proteins conserved throughout all vertebrates. IFIT1 binds tightly to non-self RNA, particularly capped transcripts lacking methylation on the first cap-proximal nucleotide, and inhibits their translation by out-competing the cellular translation initiation apparatus. This exerts immense selection pressure on cytoplasmic RNA viruses to maintain mechanisms that protect their messenger RNA from IFIT1 recognition. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that protein-protein interactions are necessary for optimal IFIT function. Recently, IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 have been shown to form a functional complex in which IFIT3 serves as a central scaffold to regulate and/or enhance the antiviral functions of the other two components. Moreover, IFITs interact with other cellular proteins to expand their contribution to regulation of the host antiviral response by modulating innate immune signalling and apoptosis. Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the IFIT complex and review how this impacts on the greater role of IFIT proteins in the innate antiviral response.","Mears, Harriet V; Sweeney, Trevor R",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30234477/,594

It has been proposed that this virus originated in bats, possibly transmitted to humans by an intermediate host, making bats a group of great interest during this outbreak. Almost 10% of the world's bat species inhabit Mexico, and 14 previous novel CoVs have been recorded in Mexican bats. However, the phylogenetic relationships between these viruses and the novel coronavirus are unknown. The aim of this communication was therefore to describe the phylogenetic relationships between Mexican bat-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2. We showed that Mexican bat-CoVs sequences are grouped into two genera, Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, and the new coronavirus is an independent clade within Betacoronavirus. Due to the diversity of CoVs in Mexican bats, the propensity of CoVs to shift hosts, the invasion mechanisms described for this new virus, and previous reports of animals infected by SARS-CoV-2, the risk of a possible infection from humans to Mexican bats should not be discarded and warrants further analyses. To avoid future zoonotic infectious diseases and to limit persecution of bats, we urge researchers and the general population to take extreme precautions and avoid manipulation of bats during the current and future similar outbreaks.","Pablo, Colunga-Salas; Giovani, Hernández-Canchola",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725795/,594

RESULTS The absolute and relative (i.e., normalized to the static stretching start value) GAS shear elastic modulus relaxation varied across stretching intensities. The absolute passive torque relaxation varied across intensities (p < 0.05) but not when normalized to the stretching start value. No significant changes were observed in GAS fascicle length during the stretching (p = 0.93). After stretching, passive torque at a given angle was significantly decreased for R60 [-0.99 ± 0.59 Nm (-6.5 ± 3.8 %), p < 0.001] and R80 [-1.05 ± 1.12 Nm (-6.8 ± 6.3 %), p = 0.004], and GAS shear elastic modulus decreased only for the R80 [-9.3 ± 7.2 kPa (-14.1 %), p = 0.003]. No significant correlations were found between the magnitude of relaxation during stretching and post-stretching effect in the GAS shear elastic modulus or ankle passive torque variables. No significant relation was found between the shear elastic modulus and the ankle passive torque responses during and after stretching. CONCLUSION The effects of stretching on joint passive torque do not reflect changes in the medial gastrocnemius shear elastic modulus, and these responses to stretching depend on its intensity.","Freitas, Sandro R; Andrade, Ricardo J; Larcoupaille, Lilian; Mil-homens, Pedro; Nordez, Antoine",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-015-3104-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25585964/,594

Due to the nature of the disease, ILIs can have a significant impact on the operation of a corporation in terms of loss of productivity and reduced work performance. The present study was undertaken to determine the health and economic impacts of ILIs under different environmental conditions on the working population of a large corporation. METHOD Over 2,000 employees of a large corporation in the travelling and tourism industry were studied with three different types of working environment (confined, typical office and well ventilated) by two structured questionnaires. RESULTS The most affected group in terms of productivity and health was the group working in a confined area, whilst those working in a well-ventilated area were least affected. However, symptoms of the confined area group seemed to disappear faster. The infection rate appeared to vary according to work environment for the studied population. CONCLUSION Policies on preventive measures and early treatment are important for a corporation to reduce loss in productivity due to ILIs.","Lee, Kenneth K C; Li, Shu Chuen; Kwong, Kai Sun; Chan, Thomas Y K; Lee, Vivian W Y; Lau, Joseph T F",Journal of medical economics,https://doi.org/10.3111/13696990802533179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19450073/,594
123968,Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy: a simplified approach.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES To evaluate the feasibility of a minimally invasive approach for hysterectomy for benign disease at a university teaching hospital. METHODS Five hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent hysterectomy for benign disease at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in 2010. No cases were excluded. Minimally invasive approaches included total vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy. All surgeries were completed with the resident as the primary surgeon or first assistant. RESULTS The median age was 45 years, the median body mass index was 30 kg/m2, the median estimated uterine size was 11 cm, and 22% of patients had a prior cesarean section. Of the 537 hysterectomies, 526 (98%) were started with a minimally invasive approach and 517 (96%) were completed in that fashion; thus only 9 conversions (2%) were required. Of the cases in which a minimally invasive approach was used, 16% were vaginal and 84% were laparoscopic. The median operative time was 86 minutes, the median blood loss was 95 mL, the median hospital stay was 1 day, and the median uterine weight was 199 g. For the minimally invasive hysterectomies, there was a 5% major complication rate. CONCLUSION Our residency training institution completed 96% of 537 hysterectomies using a minimally invasive approach while maintaining an acceptable operative time, amount of blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate. Thus our study supports that a minimally invasive approach for hysterectomy for benign disease at an academic resident teaching facility is feasible.","Mitri, Michael; Fanning, James; Davies, Matthew; Kesterson, Joshua; Ural, Serdar; Kunselman, Allen; Harkins, Gerald",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392620/,594
124095,Early postoperative outcomes and medication cost savings after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes.,2011,"OBJECTIVES The transcription factor c-Fos controls the differentiation of osteoclasts and is expressed in periodontal ligament cells after mechanical stimulation in vitro. However, it is unclear how c-Fos regulates orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) in vivo. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse OTM in transgenic mice with overexpression of c-Fos. MATERIALS AND METHODS We employed c-Fos transgenic mice (c-Fos tg) and wild-type littermates (WT) in a model of OTM induced by Nitinol tension springs that were bonded between the left first maxillary molars and the upper incisors. The unstimulated contralateral side served as an internal control. Mice were analysed by contact radiography, micro-computed tomography, decalcified histology and histochemistry. RESULTS Our analysis of the unstimulated side revealed that alveolar bone and root morphology were similar between c-Fos tg and control mice. However, we observed more osteoclasts in the alveolar bone of c-Fos tg mice as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells were increased by 40%. After 12 days of OTM, c-Fos tg mice exhibited 62% increased tooth movement as compared with WT mice. Despite the faster tooth movement, c-Fos tg and WT mice displayed the same amount of root resorption. Importantly, we did not observe orthodontically induced tissue necrosis (i.e. hyalinization) in c-Fos tg mice, while this was a common finding in WT mice. CONCLUSION Overexpression of c-Fos accelerates tooth movement without causing more root resorption. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Accelerated tooth movement must not result in more root resorption as higher tissue turnover may decrease the amount of mechanically induced tissue necrosis.","Decker, Maximilian G; Nottmeier, Cita; Luther, Julia; Baranowsky, Anke; Kahl-Nieke, Bärbel; Amling, Michael; Schinke, Thorsten; David, Jean-Pierre; Koehne, Till",Clinical oral investigations,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-020-03503-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803442/,594

124782,Incision-less reversal of Hartmann's procedure.,2014,"Damage in COVID-19 results from both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its triggered overactive host immune responses. Therapeutic agents that focus solely on reducing viral load or hyperinflammation fail to provide satisfying outcomes in all cases. Although viral and cellular factors have been extensively profiled to identify potential anti-COVID-19 targets, new drugs with significant efficacy remain to be developed. Here, we report the potent preclinical efficacy of ALD-R491, a vimentin-targeting small molecule compound, in treating COVID-19 through its host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions. We found that by altering the physical properties of vimentin filaments, ALD-491 affected general cellular processes as well as specific cellular functions relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, ALD-R491 reduced endocytosis, endosomal trafficking, and exosomal release, thus impeding the entry and egress of the virus; increased the microcidal capacity of macrophages, thus facilitating the pathogen clearance; and enhanced the activity of regulatory T cells, therefore suppressing the overactive immune responses. In cultured cells, ALD-R491 potently inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2-mediated pseudoviral infection. In aged mice with ongoing, productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, ALD-R491 reduced disease symptoms as well as lung damage. In rats, ALD-R491 also reduced bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. Our results indicate a unique mechanism and significant therapeutic potential for ALD-R491 against COVID-19. We anticipate that ALD-R491, an oral, fast-acting, and non-cytotoxic agent targeting the cellular protein with multipart actions, will be convenient, safe, and broadly effective, regardless of viral mutations, for patients with early- or late-stage disease, post-COVID-19 complications, and other related diseases. IMPORTANCE With the Delta variant currently fueling a resurgence of new infections in the fully vaccinated population, developing an effective therapeutic drug is especially critical and urgent in fighting COVID-19. In contrast to the many efforts to repurpose existing drugs or address only one aspect of COVID-19, we are developing a novel agent with first-in-class mechanisms of action that address both the viral infection and the overactive immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease. Unlike virus-directed therapeutics that may lose efficacy due to viral mutations, and immunosuppressants that require ideal timing to be effective, this agent, with its unique host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, can work against all variants of the virus, be effective during all stages of the disease, and even resolve post-disease damage and complications. Further development of the compound will provide an important tool in the fight against COVID-19 and its complications, as well as future outbreaks of new viruses.","Li, Zhizhen; Wu, Jianping; Zhou, Ji; Yuan, Baoshi; Chen, Jiqiao; Wu, Wanchen; Mo, Lian; Qu, Zhipeng; Zhou, Fei; Dong, Yingying; Huang, Kai; Liu, Zhiwei; Wang, Tao; Symmes, Deebie; Gu, Jingliang; Sho, Eiketsu; Zhang, Jingping; Chen, Ruihuan; Xu, Ying",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02542-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634931/,594

The anastomosis site (neck skin defect or tracheal wall defect) was prepared via the dissection of the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, in which 3.5× loupe magnification was used for anastomosis as we use on human cases in real life. This procedure demonstrates a new training method using a reliable learning model and provides a detailed anatomy in a live scenario. We focused on the ischemia time, harvesting, vessel anastomosis, and designing the flap to fit the defect site. This model improves tissue handling and with the use of proper instruments can be repeated many times so that the surgeon is fully confident before starting the surgery on humans.","Alessa, Mohammad Ali; Kwak, Sang Hyun; Lee, Young Woo; Kang, Mi-Lan; Sung, Hak-Joon; Ahn, Soon Hyun; Choi, Eun Chang; Kim, Won Shik",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/58104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320742/,594

The conversion rate to open surgery remains fairly constant but is associated with increased morbidity. A new approach to the surgical excision of rectal cancer is transanal total mesorectal excision (TME), in which the rectum is mobilized peranally using endoscopic instruments. This feasibility study describes initial results with transanal TME. METHODS Between June and August 2012, five consecutive unselected patients with rectal carcinoma underwent surgical excision of rectal tumours by means of transanal TME. RESULTS Transanal endoscopic dissection of the complete rectum was possible in all patients. Histopathological examination confirmed clear surgical margins and an intact mesorectal fascia in all patients. One patient developed a presacral abscess. Median duration of operation was 175 (range 160-194) min. CONCLUSION Transanal TME using the down-to-up principle is feasible. Whether the oncological and clinical results are comparable with those of standard laparoscopic or open TME has yet to be proven.","Velthuis, S; van den Boezem, P B; van der Peet, D L; Cuesta, M A; Sietses, C",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440708/,594

Despite theoretical benefits of sodium-bicarbonate (SB), current evidence remains controversial. We investigated SB-related effects on outcomes in ICU patients with metabolic acidosis. DESIGN Retrospective analysis. SETTING Academic medical center. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS 971 ICU patients with metabolic acidosis defined as arterial pH<7.3 and CO2<45mmHg treated between 2012 and 2016. A propensity score (PS) was estimated using logistic regression. Patients were matched in pairs using the PS. INTERVENTIONS 441 patients were treated with SB 8.4% (SB-group) and n=530 patients were not (control group). MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at ICU-discharge. Average Treatment Effect (ATE), Average Treatment effect in Treated (ATT), and estimated relative survival effects at 20 days were computed. RESULTS In the full cohort, we observed considerable differences in pH, base excess, additional acidosis-related indices, and ICU mortality (controls 31% vs. SB-group 56%, p<.001) at baseline between the two groups. After PS-matching (n=174 in each group), no significant difference in ICU mortality was observed (controls 32% vs. SB-group 41%; p=.07). Odds ratios (OR) for ATE and ATT showed no association with ICU mortality (OR ATE: 1.08, 95%-CI 0.99-1.17; p=.08; OR ATT 1.09; 95%-CI 0.99-1.2; p=.09). Hazard ratios at 20-days (multivariable HR, matched sample n=348: 1.16, 95%-CI 0.86-1.56, p=.33) showed similar survival in the two study groups.

125714,"Response to ""Algorithm for management of ventral hernia in morbidly obese patients"".",2013,"The major antioxidant enzyme catalase is downregulated and the enzyme activity is compromised in various disease conditions such as malarial and cancer. Hence, the restoration and protection of catalase is a promising therapeutic strategy in disease management. In the present study, for the first time we have demonstrated the protective role of well-known anti-malarial drug Artemisinin (ART) on the time and temperature-induced degradation of bovine liver catalase (BLC) activity. The findings at different time intervals and at higher temperature showed the protective role of ART on BLC activity. Molecular docking studies suggested specific binding of ART on BLC through heme group interface which was further supported by cyclic voltammetry and dynamic light scattering study. The stabilization of BLC in presence of ART was mediated through forming a BLC-ART complex with reduced and shifted electrochemical peak and increased hydrodynamic diameter. ART substantially prevents the temperature-induced reduction in α-helical content with simultaneous increment in other secondary structures like antiparallel, parallel, β-turn and random coils. Nevertheless, the protective role of ART was accepted from the enhanced thermal stability and increased Tm value of BLC in presence of ART at higher temperatures. Our results uncover the mechanism of interaction between ART with BLC and suggest the protective role of ART towards spatiotemporal alteration of BLC by preventing the structural and molecular change in BLC. Thus, the findings advocate ART as a potential therapeutic drug for diseases associated with reduced catalase activity.","Samal, Rashmi R; Kumari, Kanchan; Sahoo, Yashaswinee; Mishra, Sandip K; Subudhi, Umakanta",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460658/,594

This association was most notable in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis (an indirect, vascular-targeted mechanism of lung injury) and persisted in patients who lacked epithelial expression of the A antigen, suggesting an endothelial mechanism of A1-associated ARDS susceptibility. Critically-ill patients with blood type A had increased circulating concentrations of endothelial-derived glycoproteins von Willebrand Factor and soluble thrombomodulin, and marginal lungs from blood type A donors were less likely to recover function during ex vivo perfusion.

The occurrence of spike waves, sharp waves, and focal slowing was recorded and assessed with a continuation ratio logit model for polytomous responses. This model showed that there was a relationship between sex and the incidence of these waveforms, such that the odds of female subjects having sharp waves was increased by a factor of 2.53 (P = 0.05) when compared with male subjects and controlled for both age and dose. Similarly, female subjects were 2.45 (P = 0.09) times more likely than males to have focal slowing on EEG. Overall, 19.8% (39/197) of this representative population was found to have abnormal, asymptomatic EEG findings.

It is worth stressing, however, that there is a great need to maintain coherence when implementing organizational and financial changes affecting the fluidity and effectiveness of the actions taken by PHC personnel, and thus their working conditions, when implementing future responses to public health emergencies. Such changes should be based on an analysis of the solutions introduced since the beginning of the pandemic in Poland: these include organizational changes such as housing conditions, organization of work and workplaces, flow of information and way of supplying the patient, and financial changes involving mobilization of additional financial resources. The article presents a list of future research questions that merit consideration when setting problems and priorities: these can be used to guide the introduction of permanent modifications to the functioning of PHC in Poland and to facilitate possible future adaptation in times of emergency.

Samples were collected at different workplaces of waste sorting cycle i.e.: waste press, reloading area, loading of conveyor belt, sorting cabin, sorting hall, and control room. A quantitative analysis of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was supplemented by qualitative analysis of anaerobic biota with the use of culture-based methods and biochemical tests. In addition, inhalable dust concentrations were also evaluated. To confirm the presence of Clostridium genus, the PCR reaction with specific primers (Chis150f and ClostIr) was performed. The average concentration of total bacteria in waste sorting plant was 4347 CFU m-3 (SD = 2439), of which 66% were anaerobic strains (2852 CFU m-3; SD = 2127). It was found that about 24% of anaerobic bacteria belonged to Clostridium genus (682 CFU m-3; SD = 633). The highest contamination with anaerobic bacteria was observed near the waste reloading plant (3740 CFU m-3), and the lowest in the control room (850 CFU m-3). The average concentration of inhalable dust in the waste sorting plant was 0.81 mg m-3 (SD = 0.59). The correlation analysis showed that the presence of anaerobic bacteria, including clostridia was significantly determined by the microclimate parameters. Qualitative analysis showed the presence of 16 anaerobic species belonging to 9 genera, of which Actinomyces, Clostridium and Gemella were present at all workplaces. The molecular analysis confirmed the presence of Clostridium genus in both bioaerosol and settled dust samples.ImplicationsThe study showed that anaerobic bacteria should be taken into account as an important component of this microbiota when assessing the exposure of waste sorting workers to biological agents. However, future studies should investigate more precisely how the composition of sorted waste as well as the season can affect the diversity of anaerobic bacteria in this working environment. More attention should be paid to regular cleaning of equipment surfaces in the plant, as deposited organic dust is an important reservoir of anaerobic bacteria, including those of a potentially pathogenic nature.","Cyprowski, Marcin; Ławniczek-Wałczyk, Anna; Górny, Rafał L",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2021.1934185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029169/,594

One effective intervention to reduce overdose deaths is to distribute the opioid antagonist naloxone directly to persons actively using opioids (ie, ""take-home naloxone""), especially at touchpoints with the potential for significant impact such as emergency departments and jails. A number of hospital emergency departments have recently sought to implement individual take-home naloxone programs; however, programmatic success has been inconsistent due primarily to the inability to secure reliable funding for a naloxone supply. In this commentary, we establish the argument for a publicly funded naloxone supply to support take-home naloxone distribution in emergency department settings. We posit that the complex billing and reimbursement system for medication dispensing is impossibly burdensome during emergency care for an acute opioid overdose, and that the mounting death toll from this public health crisis demands a strong commitment to harm reduction. A publicly financed naloxone supply would demonstrate this commitment and make a measurable impact in saving lives. Ultimately, provision of naloxone should be coupled with other comprehensive treatment services and medications for opioid use disorder to meaningfully reduce harms associated with opioid use.","Kim, Howard S; Aks, Steven E",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534277/,594

This study was conducted to assess the Iranian citizens' attitude about some principles and criteria for allocation of ventilators in the current COVID-19 epidemic.Materials and Methods: An electronic self-administered questionnaire was publicly distributed through social networks of Telegram and WhatsApp to perform this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 statements about the selection and prioritization of patients for the use of a ventilator.Results: 1262 persons, including 767 citizens and 495 health care providers participated in this study. More than 95% of participants agreed upon the necessity to avoid discrimination and avoid prioritization according to patients' gender, economic and political status. While 40.9% of citizens and 49.6% of healthcare workers believed that a ventilator can be disconnected from a patient with a poor prognosis to help another patient who has a better prognosis (P-value = 0.13), 34.3% of people and 29.6% of healthcare workers believed that the earlier admitted patients have the right to receive the device even if the likeliness of his/her survival is less than the next patient (P-value = 0.009).Conclusions: Maximizing health benefits as a measure of ventilator allocation in the pandemic of COVID-19 is an accepted criterion.

The specificity of the BKD-LAMP assay was demonstrated by the absence of any cross reaction with other bacterial strains, followed by restriction digestion of the amplified products. Detections of BKD-LAMP amplicons by visual inspection, agrose gel electrophoresis, and real-time monitoring using a turbidimeter were equivalently sensitive. The BKD-LAMP assay has the sensitivity of the nested PCR method, and 10 times the sensitivity of one-round PCR assay. The lower detection limit of BKD-LAMP and nested PCR is 1 pg genomic R. salmoninarum DNA, compared to 10 pg genomic R. salmoninarum DNA for one-round PCR assay.

130212,Spindle-like abdominal wall-lifting device in gasless laparoscopic surgery in animal experiments.,2014,"BACKGROUND Venous leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg which can be slow to heal, and are both painful and costly. The point prevalence of open venous leg ulcers in the UK is about 3 cases per 10,000 people, and many people experience recurrent episodes of prolonged ulceration. First-line treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy, but a wide range of dressings and topical treatments are also used. This diversity of treatments makes evidence-based decision-making challenging, and a clear and current overview of all the evidence is required. This review is a network meta-analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of (1) dressings and (2) topical agents for healing venous leg ulcers in any care setting and to rank treatments in order of effectiveness, with assessment of uncertainty and evidence quality. SEARCH METHODS In March 2017 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, guidelines and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We updated this search in March 2018; as a result several studies are awaiting classification. SELECTION CRITERIA We included published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled adults with venous leg ulcers and compared the effects of at least one of the following interventions with any other intervention in the treatment of venous leg ulcers: any dressing, or any topical agent applied directly to an open venous leg ulcer and left in situ. We excluded from this review dressings attached to external devices such as negative pressure wound therapies, skin grafts, growth factors and other biological agents, larval therapy and treatments such as laser, heat or ultrasound. Studies were required to report complete wound healing to be eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We conducted this NMA using frequentist meta-regression methods for the efficacy outcome; the probability of complete healing. We assumed that treatment effects were similar within dressings classes (e.g. hydrocolloid, foam). We present estimates of effect with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for individual treatments focusing on comparisons with widely used dressing classes, and we report ranking probabilities for each intervention (probability of being the best, second best, etc treatment). We assessed the certainty (quality) of the body of evidence using GRADE for each network comparison and for the network as whole. MAIN RESULTS We included 78 RCTs (7014 participants) in this review. Of these, 59 studies (5156 participants, 25 different interventions) were included in the NMA; resulting in 40 direct contrasts which informed 300 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the network as a whole was of low certainty. This judgement was based on the sparsity of the network leading to imprecision and the general high risk of bias in the included studies. Sensitivity analyses also demonstrated instability in key aspects of the network and results are reported for the extended sensitivity analysis. Evidence for individual contrasts was mainly judged to be low or very low certainty.The uncertainty was perpetuated when the results were considered by ranking the treatments in terms of the probability that they were the most effective for ulcer healing, with many treatments having similar, low, probabilities of being the best treatment. The two most highly-ranked treatments both had more than 50% probability of being the best (sucralfate and silver dressings). However, the data for sucralfate was from one small study, which means that this finding should be interpreted with caution. When exploring the data for silver and sucralfate compared with widely-used dressing classes, there was some evidence that silver dressings may increase the probability of venous leg ulcer healing, compared with nonadherent dressings: RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.74 (moderate-certainty evidence in the context of a low-certainty network). For all other combinations of these five interventions it was unclear whether the intervention increased the probability of healing; in each case this was low- or very low-certainty evidence as a consequence of one or more of imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS More research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of venous leg ulcers. However, the NMA is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, largely because of the low certainty of the whole network and of individual comparisons.The results of this NMA focus exclusively on complete healing; whilst this is of key importance to people living with venous leg ulcers, clinicians may wish to take into account other patient-important outcomes and factors such as patient preference and cost.","Norman, Gill; Westby, Maggie J; Rithalia, Amber D; Stubbs, Nikki; Soares, Marta O; Dumville, Jo C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012583.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29906322/,594

131718,Preoperative imaging for resectable periampullary cancer: clinicopathologic implications of reported radiographic findings.,2013,"IMPORTANCE Tracheotomy is a common procedure. Postoperative care is usually managed by nonexpert clinicians. Prolonged decannulation is associated with a high incidence of complications. At present, no clinical protocol exists to guide clinicians through decannulation. To address this deficiency, we developed a low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of our low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway on the time to decannulation and to determine its safety and sustainability by assessing the incidence of adverse events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Our study combined retrospective and prospective cohorts from July 1, 2008, through January 31, 2012. Low-risk adult patients undergoing tracheotomy at a tertiary care hospital constituted the study population. A baseline cohort of 26 patients underwent retrospective assessment. After development of the pathway, a pilot group of 34 consecutive patients underwent evaluation; of these, 13 were ineligible because of high-risk factors, which included potential upper airway obstruction, unfavorable neck anatomy, or medical factors such as coagulopathy. To assess the sustainability of the pathway, a follow-up cohort underwent assessment. Of 107 consecutive patients, 39 met the low-risk criteria. Length of follow-up was 30 days after decannulation. INTERVENTION The low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway, which provides a stepwise approach to decannulation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total time to decannulation (in days). We hypothesized that the pathway would reduce the total time to decannulation. The secondary outcome constituted adverse events. All hypotheses were formulated before data collection. RESULTS Mean (SD) total time to decannulation in the baseline cohort was 15.50 (12.08) days. After implementation of the pathway in the pilot cohort, mean (SD) total time to decannulation decreased to 5.74 (2.79) days (P < .001). In the follow-up cohort, mean (SD) total time to decannulation was 8.13 (7.09) days (P = .003). We found no association between adverse events and use of the pathway. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway is associated with a sustainable decrease in total time to decannulation without any associated increase in adverse events. We therefore believe that this pathway is a safe and effective tool to guide clinicians in the management of tracheotomy.","Smith, Kristine A; Matthews, T Wayne; Dubé, Mirette; Spence, Gerald; Dort, Joseph C",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2014.921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24921407/,594
131941,The Effect of Minimally Invasive Surfactant Therapy on Diaphragmatic Activity.,2018,"INTRODUCTION In 2005, the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) collaboration identified guidance and decision coaching as important dimensions of patient decision aids (PtDAs) and developed a set of quality criteria. We sought to update definitions, theoretical rationale, and evidence for guidance and/or decision coaching used within or alongside PtDAs for the IPDAS update 2.0. METHODS We conducted 2 scoping reviews on guidance and decision coaching, including systematic searches and a hand search of the Cochrane Review on PtDAs. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on guidance or decision coaching used with/alongside PtDAs. Data, including conceptual models, were summarized narratively and with meta-analyses when appropriate. RESULTS Of 1022 citations, we found no RCTs that evaluated guidance in PtDAs. The 2013 definition for guidance was endorsed, and we made minimal changes to the description of guidance. Of 3039 citations, we identified 21 RCTs on decision coaching informed by 5 conceptual models stating that people exposed to decision coaching are more likely to progress in making informed decisions consistent with their values. Compared to usual care, decision coaching with PtDAs led to improved knowledge mean difference [MD], 19.5/100; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0-29.0; 5 RCTs). Compared to decision coaching alone, PtDAs led to a small improvement in knowledge (MD, 3.6/100; 95% CI, 1.0-6.3; 3 RCTs). There were variable effects on other outcomes. We simplified the decision coaching definition slightly and defined minimal decision coaching elements. CONCLUSION We found no evidence on which to propose changes in guidance in IPDAS. Decision coaching is continuing to be used alongside PtDAs, but there is inadequate evidence on the added effectiveness compared to PtDAs alone. The decision coaching definition was updated with minimal elements.","Rahn, Anne Christin; Jull, Janet; Boland, Laura; Finderup, Jeanette; Loiselle, Marie-Chantal; Smith, Maureen; Köpke, Sascha; Stacey, Dawn",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x21997330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759626/,594

Social workers require critical leadership skills to effectively support, treat and advocate for the complex needs of those most vulnerable. Despite an increasing focus on social work leadership within the last decade, there has been a paucity of research on social work leadership competencies within the realm of health and mental health service provision. To bridge this gap, this scoping review will synthesise and map the current literature on social work leadership competencies in health and mental healthcare. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework for scoping reviews will guide our search of six academic databases including: PsycINFO, OVID Social Work Abstracts, OVID Medline, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts and CINAHL Plus with Full Text. Selected articles that meet inclusion criteria will then be reviewed and charted. Recurrent themes will be reviewed through a qualitative thematic analysis, and reported in both text and figures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Findings will highlight key social work leadership competencies as they relate to social work practice, team dynamics, and client outcomes within health and mental healthcare. Material retrieved in this scoping review was selected from publicly available sources, and thus as an obtrusive research method, this review does not warrant ethics approval.

With the onset of social distancing due to COVID-19, the field of pediatric neuropsychology is encouraged to consider the utility of non-traditional, tele-neuropsychological assessments. In order to accommodate ongoing service needs for medically and neurodevelopmentally complex children, a novel three-tiered telehealth service model of care was developed and implemented in a large pediatric outpatient neuro/psychological clinic within an academic medical center. METHOD In this article, we provide case examples that illustrate the clinical implementation of this three-tiered telehealth service model of care for serving children during this uncertain time. CONCLUSION The primary aim of this article is to provide examples outlining how clinical service decisions were made in the application of this three-tiered model for children with complex medical and neurodevelopmental histories.

Resilience and moral distress were not correlated; furthermore, moral distress did not mediate a relationship between resilience and workplace engagement. Resilience was higher with greater job satisfaction, increased age, and longer tenure as a nurse. Workplace engagement increased with higher job satisfaction and less time seeking other employment. Moral distress scores were higher in nurses reporting lower job satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis revealed that resilience, job satisfaction, and moral distress were independent predictors of workplace engagement.

133984,Executive control circuitry differentiates degree of success in weight loss following gastric-bypass surgery.,2013,"The TMC genes encode a set of homologous transmembrane proteins, whose functions are not well understood. Biallelic mutations in either TMC6 or TMC8 are detected in more than half of cases of the pre-malignant skin disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). It is controversial whether EV induced by mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 originates from keratinocyte or lymphocyte defects. Quantification of TMC6 and TMC8 RNA levels in various organs revealed that lymphoid tissues have the highest levels of expression of both genes, and custom antibodies confirmed protein expression in mouse lymphocytes. To study the function of these proteins we generated mice with targeted deletion mutant alleles of Tmc6 or Tmc8. Either TMC6 or TMC8 deficiency induced a reduction in apparent molecular weight and/or amount of the other TMC molecule. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TMC6 and TMC8 formed a protein complex in mouse and human T cells. Mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 additionally interacted with the CIB1 protein to form TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 trimers. We demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 regulated CIB1 levels by protecting CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Reciprocally, CIB1 was needed for stabilizing TMC6 and TMC8 levels. These results suggest why inactivating mutations in any of the three human genes lead to similar clinical presentations. We also demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 levels are drastically lower and the proteins are less active in regulating CIB1 in keratinocytes than in T cells. Our study suggests that defects in lymphocytes may contribute to etiology and pathogenesis of EV.","Wu, Chuan-Jin; Li, Xing; Sommers, Connie L; Kurima, Kiyoto; Huh, Sunmee; Bugos, Grace; Dong, Lijin; Li, Wenmei; Griffith, Andrew J; Samelson, Lawrence E",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.013045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917726/,594
134080,Repair of complex parastomal hernias.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Percutaneous image-guided treatments (PIGT) are performed by interventional radiologists with a minimally invasive approach. Currently, very little published data on their outcomes are available and conclusions regarding their application are cautious. The aim of the present study was to review our experience in PIGT of bone metastases from thyroid cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional databases were reviewed to identify patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and bone metastases who received PIGT between October 2001 and April 2014. Complications, local evolution of the treated lesions, and overall survival (OS) were investigated. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (12 male, 13 female) underwent 49 PIGT sessions consisting of cementoplasty (77.5%), cryoablation (14.3%) or radiofrequency ablation (8.2%). Most of the treated lesions (50/54, 92.6%) were symptomatic at the time of PIGT. Median follow-up after PIGT was 4.6 years. Local complete remission rate was 55.6%. Two complications (one major and one minor) were noted, but none of these were consistent with fractures or nervous system injuries. OS after PIGT was 71.6%, 66.8% and 60.1% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. A difference in survival was observed between patients with metastatic bone involvement only at the time of first PIGT compared to those with multi-organ involvement (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Patients with bone metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer may benefit from PIGT. Although patients are usually referred for PIGT due to their symptomatic status, a more relevant ""curative"" role may exist for PIGT. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm this perception.","Cazzato, R L; Bonichon, F; Buy, X; Godbert, Y; de Figuereido, B H; Pointillart, V; Palussière, J",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejso.2015.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26136221/,594
134262,Total vaginal and single-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy for uterine benign diseases.,2016,"IMPORTANCE Most acute kidney injury observed in the hospital is defined by sudden mild or moderate increases in the serum creatinine concentration, which may persist for several days. Such acute kidney injury is associated with lower long-term kidney function. However, it has not been demonstrated that an intervention that reduces the risk of such acute kidney injury better preserves long-term kidney function. OBJECTIVES To characterize the risk of acute kidney injury with an intervention in a randomized clinical trial and to determine if there is a difference between the 2 treatment groups in kidney function 1 year later. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery Off- or On-pump Revascularisation Study (CORONARY) enrolled 4752 patients undergoing first isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at 79 sites in 19 countries. Patients were randomized to receive CABG surgery either with a beating-heart technique (off-pump) or with cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump). From January 2010 to November 2011, 2932 patients (from 63 sites in 16 countries) from CORONARY were enrolled into a kidney function substudy to record serum creatinine concentrations during the postoperative period and at 1 year. The last 1-year serum creatinine concentration was recorded on January 18, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Acute kidney injury within 30 days of surgery (≥50% increase in serum creatinine concentration from prerandomization concentration) and loss of kidney function at 1 year (≥20% loss in estimated glomerular filtration rate from prerandomization level). RESULTS Off-pump (n = 1472) vs on-pump (n = 1460) CABG surgery reduced the risk of acute kidney injury (17.5% vs 20.8%, respectively; relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72-0.97], P = .01); however, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the loss of kidney function at 1 year (17.1% vs 15.3%, respectively; relative risk, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.95-1.29], P = .23). Results were consistent with multiple alternate continuous and categorical definitions of acute kidney injury or kidney function loss, and in the subgroup with baseline chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of off-pump compared with on-pump CABG surgery reduced the risk of postoperative acute kidney injury, without evidence of better preserved kidney function with off-pump CABG surgery at 1 year. In this setting, an intervention that reduced the risk of mild to moderate acute kidney injury did not alter longer-term kidney function.

It exploits the COMPARE algorithm, a public program from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to sort drugs according to their patterns of growth inhibitory profiles from a diverse panel of human cancer cell lines. The data repository of the NCI includes the growth inhibitory patterns of more than 55,000 molecules. When candidate drug molecules with ostensible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were used as seeds (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, and dexamethasone) in COMPARE, the analysis uncovered several molecules with fingerprints similar to the seeded drugs. Interestingly, despite the fact that the uncovered drugs were from various pharmacological classes (antiarrhythmic, nucleosides, antipsychotic, alkaloids, antibiotics, and vitamins), they were all reportedly known from published literature to exert antiviral activities via different modes, confirming that COMPARE analysis is efficient for predicting antiviral activities of drugs from various pharmacological classes. Noticeably, several of the uncovered drugs can be readily tested, like didanosine, methotrexate, vitamin A, nicotinamide, valproic acid, uridine, and flucloxacillin. Unlike pure in silico methods, this approach is biologically more relevant and able to pharmacologically correlate compounds regardless of their chemical structures. This is an untapped resource, reliable and readily exploitable for drug repurposing against current and future viral outbreaks.","Naasani, Imad",SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,https://doi.org/10.1177/2472555220975672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267713/,594

This study evaluates the effects of several factors within the palm oil supply chain on the levels of sphingolipid-based organochlorine, which in turn may influence the formation of 3-MCPD esters during refining. These factors include application of inorganic chlorinated fertiliser in the oil palm plantation, bruising and degradation of oil palm fruits after harvest, recycling of steriliser condensate as water for dilution of crude oil during oil palm milling, water washing of palm oil and different refining conditions. It was observed that bruised and degraded oil palm fruits showed higher content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine than control. In addition, recycling steriliser condensate during milling resulted in elevated content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine in palm oil. However, the content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine compounds was reduced by neutralisation, degumming and bleaching steps during refining. Although water washing of crude palm oils (CPO) prior to refining did not reduce the content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine, it did reduce the formation of 3-MCPD esters through the removal of water-soluble chlorinated compounds. It was found that the use of inorganic chlorinated fertiliser in plantations did not increase the content of chlorinated compounds in oil palm fruits and extracted oil, and hence chlorinated fertiliser does not seem to play a role in the formation of 3-MCPD esters in palm oil. Overall, this study concluded that lack of freshness and damage to the fruits during transport to mills, combined with water and oil recycling in mills are the major contributors of chlorinated precursor for 3-MCPD esters formation in palm oil.","Tiong, Soon Huat; Nair, Anusha; Abd Wahid, Siti Aishah; Saparin, Norliza; Ab Karim, Nur Azwani; Ahmad Sabri, Maizatul Putri; Md Zain, Mohd Zairey; Teh, Huey Fang; Adni, Ahmad Sarwani; Ping Tan, Chin; Lai, Oi Ming; Cheah, See Siang; Appleton, David Ross","Food additives & contaminants.

In this preliminary report, we evaluated the use of concurrent SPECT/PET-CT imaging to monitor the egress of HER-2/neu specific T-cells in a breast cancer patient with extensive bone-only metastatic disease. FINDINGS Indium (In-111) labeled T-cells demonstrated similar or greater viability than unlabeled T-cells at either a low or high dose of In-111 over a 24-h incubation period in vitro. The function of labeled or unlabeled T-cells was not significantly different (p > 0.05) at either dose. T-cells trafficked to all sites of metastatic disease and infiltrated the tumor as assessed by SPECT imaging. In-111 uptake at 24 h after infusion varied from 3.8 (right proximal humerus) to 6.3 (right sacrum) background corrected counts per pixel and remained elevated at 48 h. Concurrent PET-CT imaging demonstrated a fluorodeoxyglucose flare, measured by increase in tumor site uptake as high as 32 % and at most sites of disease at 48 h. This flare was associated with focal pain after T-cell infusion at metastatic sites. The patient had stable disease for 18 months after completion of T-cell therapy. CONCLUSION Concurrent SPECT/PET-CT imaging, over a 48-h period after T-cell infusion, provided evidence of T-cell homing to all disease sites as well as a tumor metabolism flare response. This technique may be useful for monitoring T-cell trafficking after autologous as well as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell infusion.

Lung protective ventilation strategies are recommended in order to minimize ventilator induced lung injury. Whether patients with COVID-19 have the same risk for complications including barotrauma is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated barotrauma in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring prolonged MV. METHODS All patients meeting diagnosis criteria for ARDS according to the Berlin Definition, with PCR positive SARS-CoV2 infection and prolonged mechanical ventilation, defined as ≥2 days, treated at our ARDS referral center between March and April 2020 were included in a retrospective registry analysis. Complications were detected by manual review of all patient data including respiratory data, imaging studies, and patient files. RESULTS A total of 20 patients with severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure (Overall characteristics: median age: 61 years, female gender 6, median duration of MV 22 days) were analyzed. Eight patients (40%) developed severe barotrauma during MV (after median 18 days, range: 1-32) including pneumothorax (5/20), pneumomediastinum (5/20), pneumopericard (1/20), and extended subcutaneous emphysema (5/20). Median respirator settings 24 hours before barotrauma were: Peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) 29 cm H2O (range: 27-35), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 14 cm H2O (range: 5-24), tidal volume (VT) 5.4ml/kg predicted body weight (range 0.4-8.6), plateau pressure (Pplateau) 27 cm H2O (range: 19-30). Mechanical ventilation was significantly more invasive on several occasions in patients without barotrauma. CONCLUSION Barotrauma in COVID-19 induced respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was found in 40% of patients included in this registry. Our data suggest that barotrauma in COVID-19 may occur even when following recommendations for lung protective MV.","Udi, Josefina; Lang, Corinna N; Zotzmann, Viviane; Krueger, Kirsten; Fluegle, Annabelle; Bamberg, Fabian; Bode, Christoph; Duerschmied, Daniel; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Staudacher, Dawid L",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620954364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959730/,594

Cardiac stimulation nowadays aims to correct the electrophysiologic roots of mechanical inefficiency in different structural heart diseases. AREAS COVERED Clinical experience, as per available literature, has led to awareness of the concealed risks of customary cardiac pacing, that can inadvertently cause atrio-ventricular and inter/intra-ventricular dyssynchrony. New pacing modalities have emerged, leading to a new concept of what truly represents ""physiologic pacing"" beyond maintenance of atrio-ventricular coupling. In this article we will analyze the emerging evidence in favor of the available strategies to achieve an individualized physiologic setting in bradycardia pacing, and the hints of future developments. EXPERT OPINION : ""physiologic stimulation"" technologies should evolve to enable an effective and widespread adoption. In one way new guiding catheters and the adoption of electrophysiologic guidance and non-fluoroscopic lead implantation are needed to to make His-Purkinje pacing successful and effective at long term in a shorter procedure time; in the other way leadless stimulation needs to upgrade to a superior physiologic setting to mimic customary DDD pacing and possibly His-Purkinje pacing.","Biffi, Mauro; Capobianco, Claudio; Spadotto, Alberto; Bartoli, Lorenzo; Sorrentino, Sergio; Minguzzi, Alessandro; Piemontese, Giuseppe Pio; Angeletti, Andrea; Toniolo, Sebastiano; Statuto, Giovanni",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2021.1866543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336616/,594

PRG4 has been shown previously to be down-regulated after traumatic joint injury such as a meniscal tear. Preliminary evidence suggests that intra-articular injection of PRG4 after injury will reduce cartilage damage in rat models of surgically induced posttraumatic osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of intra-articular injection of full-length recombinant human lubricin (rhPRG4) for reducing cartilage damage after medial meniscal destabilization (DMM) in a preclinical large animal model. STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. METHODS Unilateral DMM was performed in 29 Yucatan minipigs. One week after DMM, animals received 3 weekly intra-articular injections (3 mL per injection): (1) rhPRG4 (1.3 mg/mL; n = 10); (2) rhPRG4+hyaluronan (1.3 mg/mL rhPRG4 and 3 mg/mL hyaluronan [~950 kDA]; n = 10); and (3) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; n = 9). Hindlimbs were harvested 26 weeks after surgery. Cartilage integrity was evaluated by use of macroscopic (India ink) and microscopic (safranin O-fast green and hematoxylin and eosin) scoring systems. Secondary outcomes evaluated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) included PRG4 levels in synovial fluid, carboxy-terminal telepeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) concentrations in urine and serum, and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) levels in synovial fluid and serum. RESULTS The rhPRG4 group had significantly less macroscopic cartilage damage in the medial tibial plateau compared with the PBS group ( P = .002). No difference was found between the rhPRG4+hyaluronan and PBS groups ( P = .23). However, no differences in microscopic damage scores were observed between the 3 groups ( P = .70). PRG4 production was elevated in the rhPRG4 group synovial fluid compared with the PBS group ( P = .033). The rhPRG4 group presented significantly lower urinary CTX-II levels, but not serum levels, when compared with the PBS ( P = .013) and rhPRG4+hyaluronan ( P = .011) groups. In serum and synovial fluid, both rhPRG4 ( P = .006; P = .017) and rhPRG4+hyaluronan groups ( P = .009; P = .03) presented decreased IL-1β levels. CONCLUSION All groups exhibited significant cartilage degeneration after DMM surgery. However, animals treated with rhPRG4 had the least amount of cartilage damage and less inflammation, providing evidence that intra-articular injections of rhPRG4 may slow the progression of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Patients with meniscal trauma are at high risk for posttraumatic osteoarthritis. This study demonstrates that an intra-articular injection regimen of rhPRG4 may attenuate cartilage damage after meniscal injury.","Waller, Kimberly A; Chin, Kaitlyn E; Jay, Gregory D; Zhang, Ling X; Teeple, Erin; McAllister, Scott; Badger, Gary J; Schmidt, Tannin A; Fleming, Braden C",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516686965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28129516/,594

137500,Intraperitoneal behaviour of a new composite mesh (Parietex™ Composite Ventral Patch) designed for umbilical or epigastric hernia repair.,2014,"RATIONALE The six-question disability set from the American Community Survey serves as the national standard for measuring disability across all surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These questions are intended to identify people who experience a long-term disability, and data from these questions are frequently interpreted as capturing discrete groups of individuals. Recent research has shown that a significant proportion of individuals respond to these questions inconsistently over time, possibly indicating that the six-question set also identifies transitory disability. However, it is unclear if these inconsistent responses are associated with changes in health status. We begin to test the validity of these observations by exploring how changes in health related quality of life correspond to changes in disability status. METHODS We recruited 525 participants to complete a longitudinal paper and pencil survey four times over 18 months that included the six disability questions, measures of health related quality of life, and mobility equipment use. We computed within person changes in health related quality of life variables to investigate how changes in disability status are associated with changes in health status. RESULTS Among respondents who reported disability, half or less consistently reported the same disability. Additionally, respondents who changed disability responses also reported changes in health related quality of life. For example, when individuals transition into walking disability, their health-related quality of life index decreases by, on average, 0.18 s.d. (p<0.05), and when individuals transition out of walking disability their health-related quality of life index increases by, on average, 0.27 s.d. (p<0.001).

This suggests that observed transitions in disability reflect real changes in perceived health and impairment.","Myers, Andrew; Ward, Bryce; Wong, Jennifer; Ravesloot, Craig",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689565/,594
137664,"Northern Ireland disease surveillance report, July to September 2015.",2015,"BACKGROUND Hand-sewn intestinal anastomoses are a fundamental procedure in both open and laparoscopic intestinal surgery. Self-retaining barbed suture devices have been tested for a variety of surgical applications. With the exception of clinical reports and various experimental studies on enterotomy, little has been published so far on the use of barbed suture for end-to-end intestinal anastomoses. The aim of the study was to compare two different barbed suture materials for end-to-end jejuno-jejunal anastomosis in pigs. End-to-end jejuno-jejunal anastomosis were performed with unidirectional barbed (A group), bidirectional barbed (B group) or normal (C group) sutures in each animal. A comparison was then made between the groups based on adhesions scoring, suturing time, bursting pressure and histopathology. RESULTS Mean construction times in the A group (518 ± 40 s) and in the B group (487 ± 45 s) were significantly lower than in the C group (587 ± 63 s) but were not different between A and B group (P = 0.10). Mean bursting pressures were significantly higher in the intact intestine (197 ± 13 mmHg) than in any other group (group A 150 ± 16 mmHg, group B 145 ± 22 mmHg, group C 145 ± 24 mmHg). Among anastomotic techniques, the bursting pressures were not significantly different. Histologically no difference could be detected in the grade of inflammation, collagen deposition and neovascularization at the anastomotic sites. CONCLUSIONS Barbed sutures can be effectively used for handsewn end-to-end jejunojejunal anastomosis in pigs. They are comparable to normal suture but could provide a shorter surgical time.","Giusto, Gessica; Iussich, Selina; Tursi, Massimiliano; Perona, Giovanni; Gandini, Marco",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-018-0437-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611301/,594

Alternative staining methods, including 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to stain live tissue, have been reported. Despite providing superior detection of damaged tissue relative to the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method, the MTT method possesses a number of drawbacks, most notably that it must be carried out on live tissue samples. Herein, we report the development of a novel staining method, ""antigen destruction immunohistochemistry"" (ADI), which can be carried out on paraffin-embedded tissue. The ADI method takes advantage of epitope loss to define the area of tissue damage and provides many of the benefits of live tissue MTT staining without the drawbacks inherent to that method. In addition, the authors provide data to support the use of antibodies directed at a number of gene products for use in animal tissue for which there are no species-specific antibodies commercially available, as well as an example of a species-specific direct antibody. Data are provided that support the use of this method in many tissue models, as well as evidence that ADI is comparable to the live tissue MTT method.","Onul, Abdullah; Colvard, Michael D; Paradise, William A; Elseth, Kim M; Vesper, Benjamin J; Gouvas, Eftychia; Deliu, Zane; Garcia, Kelly D; Pestle, William J; Radosevich, James A",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,https://doi.org/10.1369/0022155412452146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723525/,594

Since February 20, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has been increased very slowly in the countries of East Asia, including Japan, South Korea, and China, when compared with those in the Western countries. This chapter begins with an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers and public health facilities, followed by immediate global actions and research in response to the newly emerged pandemic. It includes an evaluation of the potential influence of culture on the implementation of different protective measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time offering suggestions that will make it easier for all populations to adapt protective steps against COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases. Finally, the chapter provides a detailed discussion of lessons we have learned from the pandemic, leading to the conclusion that the transition from individualism to collaborative efforts is the treatment of universal pandemics.","Paulo, Linda Simon; Bwire, George M; Pan, Xingchen; Gao, Tianyue; Saghazadeh, Amene; Pan, Chungen",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_49; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973217/,594

Each step of the cycle, Co+ + N2O and CoO+ + CO was studied individually for unambiguous interpretation of the results. The rate constant of CoO+ + CO is 1.5 ± 0.4 x 10-10 *(T/300 K)-0.7±0.2 cm3s-1 is in disagreement with a previously reported upper limit of 10-13 cm3 s-1, with the discrepancy likely due to the earlier report having studied the reactions in tandem. The reaction of Co+ + N2O produces CoO+ with a much smaller rate constant of 1.4 ±0.4 x10-12 cm3s-1 at 300 K. The association product, Co(N2O)+, was also produced with a rate constant of 1.6 x10-28 cm6s-1. While the rate constant for termolecular association decreased with temperature in accordance with a decreasing timescale for stabilization, the production of CoO+ increased with temperature in a manner that is not well described by simple functional forms. Statistical modeling of calculated reaction coordinates was employed and the experimental data reproduced only by assuming an intersystem crossing to yield ground state CoO+ occurring competitively with the spin-allowed formation of excited state CoO+.","McDonald, David C; Sweeny, Brendan C; Viggiano, Albert A; Shuman, Nicholas S; Ard, Shaun G",The journal of physical chemistry.

Together these are termed the La-module that, in the prototypical nuclear La protein and LARP7, mediates binding to the UUU-3'OH termination motif of nascent RNA polymerase III transcripts. We briefly review La and LARP7 activities for RNA 3' end binding and protection from exonucleases before moving to the more recently uncovered poly(A)-related activities of LARP1 and LARP4. Two features shared by LARP1 and LARP4 are direct binding to poly(A) and to the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP, also known as PABPC1). LARP1, LARP4 and other proteins involved in mRNA translation, deadenylation, and decay, contain PAM2 motifs with variable affinities for the MLLE domain of PABP. We discuss a model in which these PABP-interacting activities contribute to poly(A) pruning of active mRNPs. Evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus targets PABP, LARP1, LARP 4 and LARP 4B to control mRNP activity is also briefly reviewed. Recent data suggests that LARP4 opposes deadenylation by stabilizing PABP on mRNA poly(A) tails. Other data suggest that LARP1 can protect mRNA from deadenylation. This is dependent on a PAM2 motif with unique characteristics present in its La-module. Thus, while nuclear La and LARP7 stabilize small RNAs with 3' oligo(U) from decay, LARP1 and LARP4 bind and protect mRNA 3' poly(A) tails from deadenylases through close contact with PABP.

We aimed to determine the efficacy and harms of interventions to treat CL in children. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials and cohort studies, assessing treatments of CL in children (≤12 years old). We performed structured searches in PubMed, CENTRAL, LILACS, SciELO, Scopus, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar. No restrictions regarding ethnicity, country, sex or year of publication were applied. Languages were limited to English, Spanish and Portuguese. Two reviewers screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. A qualitative summary of the included studies was performed. RESULTS We identified 1092 records, and included 8 manuscripts (6 Randomized Clinical Trials [RCT] and 2 non-randomized studies). Most of the articles excluded in full-text review did not report outcomes separately for children. In American CL (ACL), 5 studies evaluated miltefosine and/or meglumine antimoniate (MA). Their efficacy varied from 68-83% and 17-69%, respectively. In Old-World CL (OWCL), two studies evaluated systemic therapies: rifampicin and MA; and one study assessed efficacy of cryotherapy (42%, Per Protocol [PP]) vs intralesional MA (72%, PP). Few studies (4) provided information on adverse events (AEs) for children, and no serious AEs were reported in participants. Risk of bias was generally low to unclear in ACL studies, and unclear to high in OWCL studies. CONCLUSION Information on efficacy of treatment for CL in children is scarce. There is an unmet need to develop specific formulations, surveillance of AEs, and guidelines both for the management of CL and clinical trials involving the pediatric population.

139284,Long-Term Complications of Appendectomy: A Systematic Review.,2018,"Since December 2019, an increasing number of cases associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019‑nCoV) have emerged in Wuhan, China, which has resulted in a rapid outbreak in China and worldwide. The present study aimed to describe the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 2019‑nCoV pneumonia (NCP) in Zhejiang province, outside of Wuhan. A total of 74 patients with 2019‑nCoV were continuously enrolled between January 22 and March 2, 2020 at Zhejiang Hospital. Diagnosis was confirmed at Zhejiang Hospital by reverse transcription‑PCR (RT‑PCR), which was approved by the Chinese government. Subsequently, the clinical features between positive‑ and negative‑NCP patients in Zhejiang were compared. Among the 74 hospitalized patients with suspected 2019‑NCP, six patients (one male and five female patients) were confirmed to be infected with 2019‑nCoV by RT‑PCR. The average age of the confirmed patients was 40±13 years. There were three family clusters among the confirmed cases, one patient from each of these families had travel history or contact with patients from Wuhan within 2 weeks. Compared with non‑NCP patients, the most common symptoms at onset for patients with NCP were fever (5/6; 83.3%) and cough (5/6; 83.3%), followed by dyspnea/pharyngalgia (2/6; 33.3%), whereas myalgia (1/6; 16.7%) and fatigue (1/6; 16.7%) were less common. All 74 patients with suspected NCP exhibited abnormal computerized tomography (CT) images. In total, 2/6 (33.3%) patients with confirmed NCP presented with bilateral pneumonia, and 21/68 (30.9%) non‑NCP patients exhibited bilateral pneumonia, with bilateral distribution of patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. The present study revealed that epidemiological history was critical to the diagnosis of 2019‑nCoV in low epidemic regions outside Hubei province. It was also identified that chest CT could not replace nucleic acid testing due to similar radiological manifestations.","Chen, Ling; Jin, Qiuhong; Zhou, Ying; Yang, Jiao; Wang, Zhehua; Ge, Ke; Yang, Jiangle; Wang, Hong",Molecular medicine reports,https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2020.11329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32705222/,594

It is also a health inequality concern as it can expose some of the most vulnerable in society to unnecessary medications and adverse drug-related events. Care for most patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy occurs in primary care. Safe deprescribing interventions can reduce exposure to inappropriate polypharmacy. However, these are not fully accepted or routinely implemented. AIM To identify barriers and facilitators to safe deprescribing interventions for adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy in primary care. DESIGN & SETTING A systematic review of studies published from 2000, examining safe deprescribing interventions for adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. METHOD A search of electronic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), Cochrane, and Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC) from inception to 26 Feb 2019, using an agreed search strategy. This was supplemented by handsearching of relevant journals, and screening of reference lists and citations of included studies. RESULTS In total, 40 studies from 14 countries were identified. Cultural and organisational barriers included: a culture of diagnosing and prescribing; evidence-based guidance focused on single diseases; a lack of evidence-based guidance for the care of older people with multimorbidities; and a lack of shared communication, decision-making systems, tools, and resources. Interpersonal and individual-level barriers included: professional etiquette; fragmented care; prescribers' and patients' uncertainties; and gaps in tailored support. Facilitators included: prudent prescribing; greater availability and acceptability of non-pharmacological alternatives; resources; improved communication, collaboration, knowledge, and understanding; patient-centred care; and shared decision-making. CONCLUSION A whole systems, patient-centred approach to safe deprescribing interventions is required, involving key decision-makers, healthcare professionals, patients, and carers.","Doherty, Alison Jayne; Boland, Paul; Reed, Janet; Clegg, Andrew J; Stephani, Anne-Marie; Williams, Nefyn Howard; Shaw, Beth; Hedgecoe, Lynn; Hill, Ruaraidh; Walker, Lauren",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpopen20x101096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723784/,594

The most common symptom is intermittent pain that worsens at night and is at least partially relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of computed tomography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation in patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Twenty patients with osteoid osteoma (15 men and 5 women) with a mean age of 20.7 years (range, 4-61 years; 12 patients aged 20 years or younger) underwent computed tomography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation. Lesion sites were the femur (n=9), tibia (n=7), pelvis (n=1), talus (n=1), cuneiform bone (n=1), and humerus (n=1). Mean follow-up was 44 months (range, 3-106 months). Pain relief was significant in 95% of patients; it disappeared within 24 hours in 14 patients, within 3 days in 4, and within 7 days in 1. The patient with persistent symptoms underwent another percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation procedure that was successful. The difference between pre- and postoperative pain was significant (P ≤ .01). No recurrences occurred. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation is a safe, minimally invasive, and economical procedure with high technical and clinical success rates, and it effectively and durably enhances quality of life.","de Palma, Luigi; Candelari, Roberto; Antico, Ettore; Politano, Rocco; Luniew, Eugenio; Giordanengo, Maurizio; Di Giansante, Silvio; Marinelli, Mario; Paci, Enrico",Orthopedics,https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20130426-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23672909/,594

The aim of this rapid review was to identify how this 'digital divide' was manifest during the first wave of the pandemic and highlight any areas which might be usefully addressed for the remainder of the pandemic and beyond. DESIGN Rapid review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES The major medical databases including PubMed and Embase and Google Scholar were searched alongside a hand search of bibliographies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Original research papers available in English which described studies conducted during wave 1 of the COVID pandemic and reported between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2021. RESULTS The search was described using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and identified nine studies. The results are presented within a refined framework describing the three key domains of the digital divide: (1) digital access, within which one study described continuing issues with internet connectivity among vulnerable patients in the UK; (2) digital literacy, where seven studies described how ethnic minorities and the elderly were less likely to use digital technologies in accessing care; (3) digital assimilation, where one study described how video technologies can reduce feelings of isolation and another how elderly black males were the most likely group to share information about COVID-19 on social media platforms. CONCLUSIONS During the early phase of the pandemic in the developed world, familiar difficulties in utilisation of digital healthcare among the elderly and ethnic minorities continued to be observed. This is a further reminder that the digital divide is a persistent challenge that needs to be urgently addressed when considering the likelihood that in many instances these digital technologies are likely to remain at the centre of healthcare delivery.","Litchfield, Ian; Shukla, David; Greenfield, Sheila",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642200/,594

To synthesize expert opinions on a group level reproducibly, classical Delphi method elements were combined with an item weight and performance weight decision-maker. This newly developed information synthesis method was applied to the sample dataset to examine method applicability. Method descriptions and flow diagrams were generated. Applicability was then tested by creating a synthesis of individual questionnaires. An estimate of the level of medication safety in an Austrian level II hospital was, thus, generated. Over the past two decades, initiatives regarding patient safety, in general, and medication safety, in particular, have been gaining momentum. Questionnaires are state of the art for assessing medication practice in healthcare facilities. Acquiring consistent data about medication in the complex setting of a hospital, however, has not been standardized. There are no publicly available benchmark datasets and, in particular, there is no published method to reliably synthesize expertise regarding medication safety on an expert group level. The group-level information synthesis method developed in this study has the potential to synthesize information about the level of medication safety in a hospital setting more reliably than unstructured approaches. A medication safety level estimate for a representative Austrian level II hospital was generated. Further studies are needed to establish convergence characteristics and benchmarks for medication safety on a larger scale.","Böhmdorfer-McNair, Birgit; Huf, Wolfgang; Strametz, Reinhard; Nebosis, Michael; Pichler, Florian; Janowitz, Susanne Melitta; Ettl, Brigitte",Frontiers in public health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.630398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604148/,594

BACKGROUND Peer-reviewed studies published in the 15 years before COVID-19 indicate that Baby-Boomer nurses' retirement will increase the global nursing shortage. However, three international trends have affected Baby-Boomer nurses' decision to delay their retirement. EVALUATION This review observed the scoping review framework. KEY ISSUES COVID-19 further disrupts the current understanding of Baby-Boomer nurses' retirement as they recognize COVID-19's impact on health care systems and younger nurses. Technological advancements and the changing needs of health care delivery have made telecommuting a practical possibility. CONCLUSION Baby-Boomer nurses can leverage alternative work arrangements to meet their needs and to contribute to clinical practice through telecommuting. This approach extends Baby-Boomer nurses' careers and creates a resource for bedside nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT Clinical experience matters at the bedside. Telecommuting maximizes the retention of Baby-boomer nurses' clinical expertise to benefit patients and to socialize bedside nurses. Baby-Boomer nurses can contribute to patient monitoring as well as patient education and counseling through telehealth. They can also provide asynchronous and synchronous telementoring to bedside nurses.","Gan, Ivan",Journal of nursing management,https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786163/,594
141315,Reasons and outcomes of laparoscopic revisional surgery after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding for morbid obesity.,2010,"OBJECTIVE Outcomes after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) have improved in the last decade. It is unknown whether this has resulted in a reduction of postoperative bowel ischemia (BI). The primary objective was to determine BI prevalence after RAAA repair. Secondary objectives were to determine its major sequelae and differences between open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). METHODS This systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017055920) followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. MEDLINE and Embase were searched for studies published from 2005 until 2018. The methodologic quality of observational studies was assessed with the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool. The quality of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. BI prevalence and rates of BI as cause of death, reoperation, and bowel resection were estimated with meta-analyses with a random-effects model. Differences between OR and EVAR were estimated with pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Changes over time were assessed with Spearman rank test (ρ). Publication bias was assessed with a funnel plot analysis. RESULTS A total of 101 studies with 52,670 patients were included; 72 studies were retrospective cohort studies, 14 studies were prospective cohort studies, 12 studies were retrospective administrative database studies, and 3 studies were RCTs. The overall methodologic quality of the RCTs was high, but that of observational studies was low. The pooled prevalence of BI ranged from of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.07-0.09) in database studies to 0.10 (95% CI, 0.08-0.12) in cohort studies. The risk of BI was higher after OR than after EVAR (risk ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.25-2.57). The pooled rate of BI as cause of death was 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.05), and that of BI as cause of reoperation and bowel resection ranged between 0.05 and 0.07. BI prevalence did not change over time (ρ, -0.01; P = .93). The funnel plot analysis was highly suggestive of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of clinically relevant BI after RAAA repair is approximately 10%. Approximately 5% of patients undergoing RAAA repair suffer from severe consequences of BI. BI is less prevalent after EVAR than after OR.","Jalalzadeh, Hamid; van Leeuwen, Carlijn F; Indrakusuma, Reza; Balm, Ron; Koelemay, Mark J W",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2018.05.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146037/,594

Despite more than 85 million reported cases and 1.8 million known deaths, millions worldwide say they may not accept it. This study assesses the associations of age, gender, and level of education with vaccine acceptance, from a random sample of 13,426 participants selected from 19 high-COVID-19 burden countries in June 2020. Based on univariable and multivariable logistic regression, several noteworthy trends emerged: women in France, Germany, Russia, and Sweden were significantly more likely to accept a vaccine than men in these countries. Older (≥50) people in Canada, Poland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the UK were significantly more favorably disposed to vaccination than younger respondents, but the reverse trend held in China. Highly educated individuals in Ecuador, France, Germany, India, and the US reported that they will accept a vaccine, but higher education levels were associated with lower vaccination acceptance in Canada, Spain, and the UK. Heterogeneity by demographic factors in the respondents' willingness to accept a vaccine if recommended by employers were substantial when comparing responses from Brazil, Ecuador, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, and the US.

While a bacterial invader may initially act as a parasite or pathogen, a subsequent mutualistic relationship can emerge in which the endosymbiotic bacteria and their host share metabolites. While the environment of the host cell provides improved stability when compared to an extracellular environment, the endosymbiont population must still cope with changing conditions, including variable nutrient concentrations, the host cell cycle, host developmental programs, and host genetic variation. Furthermore, the eukaryotic host can deploy mechanisms actively preventing a bacterial return to a pathogenic state. Many endosymbionts are likely to use two-component systems (TCSs) to sense their surroundings, and expanded genomic studies of endosymbionts should reveal how TCSs may promote bacterial integration with a host cell. We suggest that studying TCS maintenance or loss may be informative about the evolutionary pathway taken toward endosymbiosis, or even toward endosymbiont-to-organelle conversion.","Dunn, Cory D; Somborac, Tamara; Akpınar, Bala Anı",Results and problems in cell differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51849-3_6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263872/,594

Globalisation affects health directly and indirectly and creates economic and health disparities within and across countries. The political response to address these disparities, exemplified by the Millennium Development Goals, has put pressure on the global community to redress massive inequities in health and other determinants of human capability across countries. This, in turn, has accelerated a transformation in the architecture of global health governance. The entrance of new actors, such as private foundations and multi-stakeholder initiatives, contributed to a doubling of funds for global health between 2000 and 2010. Today the governance of public health is in flux, with diminished leadership from multilateral institutions, such as the WHO, and poor coherence in policy and programming that undermines the potential for sustainable health gains. These trends pose new challenges and opportunities for global public health, which is centrally concerned with identifying and addressing threats to the health of vulnerable populations worldwide.","Kruk, Margaret E",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2012.689313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22621678/,594
143516,Hormonal responses and test meal intake among obese teenagers before and after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.,2013,"BACKGROUND Enterovirus G (EV-G) causes subclinical infections and is occasionally associated with diarrhea in pigs. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of EV-G in pigs from 73 pig farms in 20 provinces of Thailand from December 2014 to January 2018. RESULTS Our results showed a high occurrence of EV-Gs which 71.6 % of fecal and intestinal samples (556/777) and 71.2 % of pig farms (52/73) were positive for EV-G by RT-PCR specific to the 5'UTR. EV-Gs could be detected in all age pig groups, and the percentage positivity was highest in the fattening group (89.7 %), followed by the nursery group (89.4 %). To characterize the viruses, 34 EV-G representatives were characterized by VP1 gene sequencing. Pairwise sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that Thai-EV-Gs belonged to the EV-G1, EV-G3, EV-G4, EV-G8, EV-G9 and EV-G10 genotypes, among which the EV-G3 was the predominant genotype in Thailand. Co-infection with different EV-G genotypes or with EV-Gs and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) or porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) on the same pig farms was observed. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirmed that EV-G infection is endemic in Thailand, with a high genetic diversity of different genotypes.

143535,"Cross-linked sodium hyaluronate, an anti-adhesion barrier gel in gynaecological endoscopic surgery.",2013,"By 2 y of age, children possess expectations about several different moral principles. Building on these results, we asked whether children who observed a wrongdoer violate a principle would draw negative inferences from this violation about how the wrongdoer was likely to behave in other contexts. In four experiments, 25-mo-old toddlers (n = 152) first saw a wrongdoer harm a protagonist. When toddlers judged the wrongdoer's behavior to violate the principle of ingroup support or harm avoidance, they did not find it unexpected if the wrongdoer next violated the principle of fairness by dividing resources unfairly between two other protagonists (Exps. 2 and 3), but they did find it unexpected if the wrongdoer next acted generously by giving another protagonist most of a resource to be shared between them (Exp. 4). When toddlers did not construe the wrongdoer's harmful behavior as a moral violation, these responses reversed: They found it unexpected if the wrongdoer next acted unfairly (Exp. 1) but not if the wrongdoer next acted generously (Exp. 4). Detecting a moral violation thus lowered toddlers' assessment of the wrongdoer's moral character and brought down their expectations concerning the likelihood that the wrongdoer would perform: 1) obligatory actions required by other principles and 2) supererogatory or virtuous actions not required by the principles. Together, these findings expand our understanding of how young children evaluate others' moral characters, and they reveal how these evaluations, in turn, enable children to form sophisticated expectations about others' behavior in new contexts.","Ting, Fransisca; Baillargeon, Renée",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2109045118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34544874/,594

143641,[Use of a self-adhesive mesh in inguinal herniorrhaphy by a trans-abdominal-peritoneal endoscopic approach].,2012,"By binding to its chemokine receptor CXCR4 on osteoclast precursor cells (OCPs), it is well known that stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) promotes the chemotactic recruitment of circulating OCPs to the homeostatic bone remodeling site. However, the engagement of circulating OCPs in pathogenic bone resorption remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated a possible chemoattractant role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), another ligand for C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), in the recruitment of circulating OCPs to the bone lytic lesion. To accomplish this, we used Csf1r-eGFP-knock-in (KI) mice to establish an animal model of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particle-induced calvarial osteolysis. In the circulating Csf1r-eGFP+ cells of healthy Csf1r-eGFP-KI mice, Csf1r+/CD11b+ cells showed a greater degree of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis compared to a subset of Csf1r+/RANK+ cells in vitro. Therefore, Csf1r-eGFP+/CD11b+ cells were targeted as functionally relevant OCPs in the present study. Although expression of the two cognate receptors for MIF, CXCR2 and CXCR4, was elevated on Csf1r+/CD11b+ cells, transmigration of OCPs toward recombinant MIF in vitro was facilitated by ligation with CXCR4, but not CXCR2. Meanwhile, the level of PMMA-induced bone resorption in calvaria was markedly greater in wild-type (WT) mice compared to that detected in MIF-knockout (KO) mice. Interestingly, in contrast to the elevated MIF, diminished SDF-1 was detected in a particle-induced bone lytic lesion of WT mice in conjunction with an increased number of infiltrating CXCR4+ OCPs. However, such diminished SDF-1 was not found in the PMMA-injected calvaria of MIF-KO mice. Furthermore, stimulation of osteoblasts with MIF in vitro suppressed their production of SDF-1, suggesting that MIF can downmodulate SDF-1 production in bone tissue. Systemically administered anti-MIF neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibited the homing of CXCR4+ OCPs, as well as bone resorption, in the PMMA-injected calvaria, while increasing locally produced SDF-1. Collectively, these data suggest that locally produced MIF in the inflammatory bone lytic site is engaged in the chemoattraction of circulating CXCR4+ OCPs. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","Movila, Alexandru; Ishii, Takenobu; Albassam, Abdullah; Wisitrasameewong, Wichaya; Howait, Mohammed; Yamaguchi, Tsuguno; Ruiz-Torruella, Montserrat; Bahammam, Laila; Nishimura, Kazuaki; Van Dyke, Thomas; Kawai, Toshihisa",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.2854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27082509/,594
144128,Quantitative membrane loading of polymer vesicles.,2006-10-17,"IMPORTANCE Laparoscopic repair of paraesophageal hernia (PEH) has been shown to result in excellent relief of symptoms and improved quality of life (QOL) despite a relatively high radiographically identified recurrence rate. OBJECTIVE To assess potential risk factors for recurrence and long-term change in QOL after laparoscopic repair of PEH. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective study of 111 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic repair of type III PEH with biological mesh buttressed over a primary cruroplasty from April 3, 2009, through July 31, 2014, at the Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. We administered a modified version of a validated gastroesophageal reflux disease-specific QOL tool to patients before and at 2, 12, and 36 months after the procedure. Higher QOL scores represent greater severity of symptoms. An upper gastrointestinal tract barium-contrast radiographic examination was performed at 1 year to assess for recurrence. Demographic factors, comorbidities, and preoperative radiographic findings were analyzed as possible indicators for recurrence using logistic regression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quality of life, measured by the gastroesophageal reflux disease-specific QOL tool, and recurrence, defined as a PEH of greater than 2 cm. RESULTS Median patient age was 61 years, 63.1% of patients were women, and 81.1% of patients were white. Four patients required reoperation, of which only 1 was for symptomatic recurrent PEH. The mean follow-up time for the 36-month QOL assessment was 43.5 months. The overall preoperative and 2-, 12-, and 36-month QOL scores were 28.50, 10.18, 9.74, and 10.58, respectively (P < .001). Recurrences were found in 19 of the 70 patients (27%) who completed the 1-year radiographic examination. Compared with baseline, all individual symptoms improved significantly except for early satiety (mean [SD] score, 3.18 [1.88] at baseline vs 2.07 [1.70] at the 36-month follow-up; P = .07), nausea (1.69 [1.63] vs 0.77 [1.25]; P = .08), pain with swallowing (1.06 [1.50] vs 0.53 [0.90]; P = .73), and bloating/gas (3.28 [1.71] vs 2.23 [1.72]; P = .05) at the 36-month QOL assessment. Although not statistically significant, preoperative hernias containing most of the stomach were more likely to recur after repair when compared with those involving gastric cardia and fundus (odds ratio, 3.74 [95% CI, 0.93-15.14]; P = .06). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overall, laparoscopic repair of PEH with biological mesh results in excellent long-term QOL. The cause of recurrence is likely multifactorial and individualized to each patient. Further evaluation of novel techniques and unidentified patient factors is needed.","Lidor, Anne O; Steele, Kimberley E; Stem, Miloslawa; Fleming, Richard M; Schweitzer, Michael A; Marohn, Michael R",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2015.25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25785415/,594

Thus, children typically have multiple surgeries to replace outgrown valves. In this study, we present the in vivo function and growth potential of our tissue-engineered pediatric tubular valve. The valves were fabricated by sewing two decellularized engineered tissue tubes together in a prescribed pattern using degradable sutures and subsequently implanted into the main pulmonary artery of growing lambs. Valve function was monitored using periodic ultrasounds after implantation throughout the duration of the study. The valves functioned well up to 8 weeks, 4 weeks beyond the suture strength half-life, after which their insufficiency index worsened. Histology from the explanted valves revealed extensive host cell invasion within the engineered root and commencing from the leaflet surfaces. These cells expressed multiple phenotypes, including endothelial, and deposited elastin and collagen IV. Although the tubes fused together along the degradable suture line as designed, the leaflets shortened compared to their original height. This shortening is hypothesized to result from inadequate fusion at the commissures prior to suture degradation. With appropriate commissure reinforcement, this novel heart valve may provide the somatic growth potential desired for a pediatric valve replacement.","Reimer, Jay; Syedain, Zeeshan; Haynie, Bee; Lahti, Matthew; Berry, James; Tranquillo, Robert",Annals of biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-016-1605-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27066787/,594
144475,Significant losses due to fasciolosis in Scottish sheep flocks.,2010,"The link between status and self-esteem remains theoretically and empirically controversial. To help clarify it, we proposed an integrated account of status and self-esteem, and tested several hypotheses derived from it. We distinguished between two types of status: socioeconomic status (SES; education, income, occupation) and sociometric status (SMS; respect, admiration, importance). We then examined how they related to one another and to self-esteem across five studies (N = 2,018). As hypothesized, in Studies 1-2 (cross-sectional), SES and SMS correlated positively with one another, and both correlated positively with self-esteem, yet SMS predicted self-esteem more strongly than SES did. Moreover, SMS mediated the link between SES and self-esteem, and this statistical model fit the data better than an alternative model where SMS and SES reversed roles. Studies 3-5 demonstrated causal links experimentally. In Study 3, manipulating SES to be higher (vs. lower) led to higher (vs. lower) SMS and state self-esteem, with SMS again statistically mediating the impact of SES on state self-esteem. In Study 4, manipulating SMS to be higher (vs. lower) led to higher (vs. lower) state self-esteem. Finally, in Study 5, manipulating SMS showed that it causally mediated the link between SES and state self-esteem. Our findings persisted across multiple measurement formats and after controlling for the Big Five personality traits. They point to SMS being a more powerful and proximate predictor of self-esteem than SES, thereby illuminating the link between status and self-esteem, and adding to a growing literature on the psychology of status.

It is well known that reactive hyperemia occurs following a period of ischemia. However, increased blood flow does not necessarily mean increased oxygen tension in the tissue. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that tissue reactive hyperoxia occurs following release of hind-limb tourniquet occlusions. Rats were injected with bilateral hind-limb biosensors and were simultaneously subjected to a unilateral femoral vessel ligation. After approximately one and three months, the rats underwent a series of oxygenation challenges, including transient hind-limb tourniquet occlusion. Along with the biosensors, near infrared spectroscopy was used to measure percent oxyhemoglobin in capillaries and laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure blood flow. Post-occlusion reactive hyperemia was observed. It was accompanied by tissue reactive hyperoxia, affirming that the post-occlusion oxygen supply must have exceeded the expected increased oxygen consumption. The measurement of the physiologic phenomenon of reactive hyperoxia could prove clinically beneficial for both diagnosis and optimizing therapy.","Chien, Jennifer S; Mohammed, Mahmoud; Eldik, Hysem; Ibrahim, Mohamed M; Martinez, Jeremy; Nichols, Scott P; Wisniewski, Natalie; Klitzman, Bruce",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-08490-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28811566/,594

Since the emergence of COVID-19, a number of confirmed cases reported autoimmune manifestations. Herein, we reviewed the reported COVID-19 cases with associated autoimmune manifestations. METHODS We searched PubMed database using all available keyword for COVID-19. All related studies between January 1st, 2020 to May 22nd, 2020 were reviewed. Only studies published in English language were considered. Articles were screened based on titles and abstract. All reports of confirmed COVID-19 patients who have associated clinical evidence of autoimmune disease were selected. RESULTS Among 10006 articles, searches yielded, Thirty-two relevant articles for full-text assessment. Twenty studies meet the eligibility criteria. The twenty eligible articles reported 33 cases of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who developed an autoimmune disease after the onset of covid-19 symptoms. Ages of patients varied from a 6 months old infant to 89 years old female (Mean=53.9 years of 28 cases); five cases had no information regarding their age. The time between symptoms of viral illness and onset of autoimmune symptoms ranged from 2 days to 33 days (Mean of the 33 cases=9.8 days). Autoimmune diseases were one case of subacute thyroiditis (3%), two cases of Kawasaki Disease (6.1%), three cases of coagulopathy and antiphospholipid syndrome (9.1%), three cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (9.1%), eight cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (24.2%), and sixteen cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (48.5%).

Despite their importance, the study of membrane proteins has been significantly limited by the difficulties inherent to their successful expression, purification, and stabilization once they have been extracted from the cell membrane. In addition, expression of human membrane proteins commonly requires the use of expensive and/or time-consuming eukaryotic systems, hence their successful expression in bacteria will be obviously beneficial for experimental research. Furthermore, since lipids can have critical effects on the activity of membrane proteins and given the composition similarities between the inner mitochondrial membrane and the bacterial plasma membrane, production of mitochondrial membrane proteins in E. coli represents a logical choice. Here, we present a novel protocol to produce a human mitochondrial ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter in E. coli. The function of the three known human mitochondrial ABC transporters is not fully understood, but X-ray crystallography models of ABCB10 produced in insect cells are available. We have successfully expressed and purified ABCB10 from E. coli. The yield is close to that of another bacterial ABC transporter routinely produced in our laboratory under similar conditions. In addition, we can efficiently reconstitute detergent purified ABCB10 into lipid nanodiscs. Measurements of ATPase activity of ABCB10 produced in E. coli show an ATP hydrolysis rate similar to other human ABC transporters. This novel protocol facilitates the production of this human mitochondrial transporter for biochemical, structural, and functional analysis, and can likely be adjusted for production of other mitochondrial transporters.","Saxberg, Alexandra D; Martinez, Melissa; Fendley, Gregory A; Zoghbi, Maria E",Protein expression and purification,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2020.105778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069825/,594

Animal models played vital roles in understanding the mechanism of human diseases. However, the use of these models has been a subject of heated debate, particularly due to ethical matters and the inevitable pathophysiological differences between animals and humans. Current in vitro models lack the sufficient functionality and predictivity of human pharmacokinetics and toxicity, therefore, are not capable to fully replace animal models. The recent development of micro-physiological systems has shown great potential as indispensable tools for recapitulating key physiological parameters of humans and providing in vitro methods for predicting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans.

Precise descriptions of the relations of city size and growth with population health metrics have not been systematically described. Describing these relationships can provide clues regarding the factors driving differences in health across cities. OBJECTIVE The goal of this scoping review is to map the existing evidence regarding the scaling properties of health outcomes, with a special emphasis on city size and growth. METHOD AND ANALYSIS We will conduct this scoping review based on a structured search of a combination of keywords for the exposures that aim to capture the population growth and size of cities along with degree of urbanisation, for health-related outcomes regardless of their type (incidence or prevalence of diseases and injuries and mortality). We will search the MEDLINE and Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature databases from inception for studies in English, Spanish or Portuguese and perform manual searches of references and citations in the included studies. The search will be conducted from April 2019 to September 2019. We will report results using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. This review aims to inform future research on the role of increasing levels of urbanisation on health outcomes, provide clues into what city level factors may drive patterns of urban health and lead to the design and implementation of policies that promote sustainable growth and improved health.

In addition, with the advent of disease-agnostic target-directed FDA approvals an ever-broadening number of therapeutic options are available for clinicians and patients. However, to date, complete remissions are rare, the average durations of response are relatively modest, and toxicities are common. These factors accentuate the need for further understanding of the mechanisms of resistance that result in treatment failures, the development of biomarkers that can improve patient selection for treatment earlier the disease process, and the continued need for new therapeutic strategies.

As personal contact is greatly reduced, they also create a shared informational landscape, allowing for a shared threat response. This is a difficult task, since truthfulness of content that leads to actionable knowledge is impossible to consistently validate. So, not only that curation of information is rarely congruent with pressing health issues, but digital spaces may also become fertile ground for misinformation and disinformation, contributing to the devastating effects of an infodemic. Digital intermediaries are useful exactly because their representation of reality is not a true construct, but a result of purposely curated information. However, they are active, dynamic epistemological agents with their own logic and aim. In dealing with a pandemic, we should reconsider the ways how our digital informational landscapes are created and sustained. This urges us to consider ethical governance of digital data curation and dissemination, alongside forms of control of the truthfulness and reach of its content. Some of the most fundamental issues in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the newly available vaccines are reliant on digital information and data sharing among experts, and the role of informing the general public. The need to create a reproducible, valid and truthful informational landscape is paramount, while allowing for free and rational, behavioral individual choices oriented toward preserving and promoting healthy behavior. These are issues at the heart of dealing with any pandemic, as well as a well-organized health care policy.","Marko, Ćurković; Andro, Košec; Roje Marina, Bedeković; Vladimir, Bedeković",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571677/,594

This deletion is similar to that observed in porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) when compared to transmissible gastroenteritis virus, which correlates with reduced virulence. By analogy to PRCoV, we expected that the pathogenicity of C3663 may be attenuated in cats. However, two of four cats inoculated with C3663 died of FIP, and a third C3663-inoculated cat showed FIP lesions at 91 days after challenge. These results indicate that the 5'-terminal region of the S gene is not essential for the development of FIP.","Terada, Yutaka; Shiozaki, Yuto; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Mahmoud, Hassan Youssef Abdel Hamid; Noguchi, Keita; Nagao, Yumiko; Shimojima, Masayuki; Iwata, Hiroyuki; Mizuno, Takuya; Okuda, Masaru; Morimoto, Masahiro; Hayashi, Toshiharu; Tanaka, Yoshikazu; Mochizuki, Masami; Maeda, Ken",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.043992-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22718568/,594

This study tested the mediating roles of resilience and meaning in life between COVID-19 worry and mental health disorders. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We recruited 284 Arabic speaking young adults (60.6% females; mean age = 26.25±7.57 years) to complete the COVID-19 Worry Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, Meaning in Life Measure, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS Results showed that COVID-19 worry negatively predicted resilience and meaning in life and positively predicted mental health disorders. Furthermore, indirect effect of COVID-19 worry on mental health disorders via resilience and meaning in life was significant. CONCLUSION These results will contribute to find effective measures to prevent mental health disorders and promote reduced mental health disorders from the perspective of mitigating COVID-19 worry and increasing resilience and meaning in life.","Yıldırım, Murat; Arslan, Gökmen; Aziz, Izaddin Ahmad",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370760/,594

147558,Robotic-assisted laparoscopic stage II restorative proctectomy for toxic ulcerative colitis.,2012,"Exercise has been demonstrated to have considerable effects upon haemostasis, with activation dependent upon the duration and intensity of the exercise bout. In addition, markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis have been shown to possess circadian rhythms, peaking within the morning (0600-1200 h). Therefore, the time of day in which exercise is performed may influence the activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. This study aimed to examine coagulation and fibrinolytic responses to short-duration high-intensity exercise when completed at different times of the day. Fifteen male cyclists (VO2max: 60.3 ± 8.1 ml kg-1 min-1) completed a 4-km cycling time trial (TT) on five separate occasions at 0830, 1130, 1430, 1730 and 2030. Venous blood samples were obtained pre- and immediately post-exercise, and analysed for tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thrombin-anti-thrombin complexes (TAT) and D-Dimer. Exercise significantly increased plasma concentrations of TF (p < .0005), TFPI (p < .0006), TAT complexes (p < .0012) and D-Dimer (p < .0003). There was a time-of-day effect in pre-exercise TF (p = .004) and TFPI (p = .031), with 0830 greater than 1730 (p .001), while 1730 was less than 2030 h (p = .008), respectively. There was no significant effect of time of day for TAT (p = .364) and D-Dimer (p = .228). Power output, TT time and heart rate were not significantly different between TTs (p > .05); however, percentage VO2max was greater at 1730 when compared to 2030 (p = .04). Due to a time-of-day effect present within TF, peaking at 0830, caution should be applied when prescribing short-duration high-intensity exercise bout within the morning in populations predisposed to hypercoagulability.","Zadow, Emma Kate; Kitic, Cecilia Marie; Wu, Sam Shi Xuan; Fell, James William; Adams, Murray John",European journal of sport science,https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2017.1420237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29320303/,594
147916,"Comparison between RYGB, DS, and VSG effect on glucose homeostasis.",2012,"With the end of the Cold War in 1991, U.S. Government (USG) investments in radiation science and medical preparedness were phased out; however, the events of September 11th , which involved a terroristic attack on American soil, led to the re-establishment of funding for both radiation preparedness and development of approaches to address injuries. Similar activities have also been instituted worldwide, as the global threat of a radiological or nuclear incident continues to be a concern. Much of the USG's efforts to plan for the unthinkable has centered on establishing clear lines of communication between agencies with responsibility for triage and medical response, and external stakeholders. There have also been strong connections made between those parts of the government that establish policies, fund research, oversee regulatory approval, and purchase and stockpile necessary medical supplies. Progress made in advancing preparedness has involved a number of subject matter meetings and tabletop exercises, publication of guidance documents, assessment of available resources, clear establishment of anticipated concepts of operation for multiple radiation and nuclear scenarios, and identification/mobilization of resources. From a scientific perspective, there were clear research gaps that needed to be addressed, which included the need to identify accurate biomarkers and design biodosimetry devices to triage large numbers of civilians, develop decorporation agents that are more amenable for mass casualty use, and advance candidate products to address injuries caused by radiation exposure and thereby improve survival. Central to all these activities was the development of several different animal constructs, since efficacy testing of these approaches requires extensive work in research models that accurately simulate what would be expected in humans. Recent experiences with COVID-19 have provided an opportunity to revisit aspects of radiation preparedness, and leverage those lessons learned to enhance readiness for a possible future radiation public health emergency.","DiCarlo, Andrea Lynn; Homer, Mary J; Coleman, C Norman",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6498/ac0d3f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153947/,594

Additionally, the study evaluated a dynamic risk stratification (DRS) system to validate its usefulness for familial-type thyroid carcinoma. METHODS After individual risk factor-matching, 286 patients remained in the FNMTC group, and 858 patients were assigned to the SNMTC group consisting of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The prognostic outcomes were compared between the two groups in a matched cohort. RESULTS During the mean follow-up period of 142 months, recurrences were experienced by 64 patients in the sporadic group (7.5%) and 29 patients in the familial group (10.1%). In the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for recurrence were primary tumor size (p = 0.033), gross extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001). The independent risk factors did not include family history alone (p = 1.101) or the number of affected family members (p = 0.122 for 2 members and p = 0.625 for ≥ 3 members). In this matched-cohort study, the DRS system was well adjusted in the FNMTC and SNMTC groups. Moreover, the proportion of DRS categories and the recurrence rate in each DRS category were similar between the familial and sporadic groups. CONCLUSIONS Family history did not present a statistically significant association with a poor prognosis for PTC patients. With a family history of PTC alone, less aggressive treatment could be considered. In this matched cohort, DRS was adjusted well and could be useful in predicting prognosis, even for PTC patients with a family history of PTC.","Lee, Yu-Mi; Jeon, Min Ji; Kim, Won Woong; Chung, Ki-Wook; Baek, Jung Hwan; Shong, Young Kee; Sung, Tae-Yon; Hong, Suck Joon",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-09025-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803550/,594

149314,How I Do It: Hybrid Laparoscopic and Robotic Pancreaticoduodenectomy.,2016,"PURPOSE The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) is a routine first-line treatment option for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). The Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (Pipeline Shield) is an updated version of the PED which has been modified to include a surface phosphorylcholine biocompatible polymer. Its early technical success and safety have been reported previously. Here, we assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of the Pipeline Shield for the treatment of IAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (PFLEX) study was a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study for the treatment of unruptured IAs using the Pipeline Shield. The primary endpoint was a major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death at 1-year post-procedure. Angiographic outcomes were also assessed by an independent radiology laboratory at 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS Fifty patients (mean age, 53 years; 82% female) with 50 unruptured IAs were treated. Mean aneurysm diameter was 8.82±6.15 mm. Of the target aneurysms, 38/50 (76%) were small (<10 mm), 11/50 (22%) were large (≥10 and<25 mm), and 1/50 (2%) was giant (≥25 mm). Forty-seven (94%) were located in the internal carotid artery and three (6%) in the vertebral artery. At 1-year post-procedure, no major strokes or neurologic deaths were reported, and complete occlusion was achieved in 27/33 (81.8%). There were no instances of aneurysm recurrence or retreatment.

149481,Colloidal hard spheres: cooking and looking.,2006-09-19,"BACKGROUND In view of the growth of published papers, there is an increasing need for studies that summarise scientific research. An increasingly common review is a ""methodology scoping review"", which provides a summary of existing analytical methods, techniques and software, proposed or applied in research articles, which address an analytical problem or further an analytical approach. However, guidelines for their design, implementation and reporting are limited. METHODS Drawing on the experiences of the authors, which were consolidated through a series of face-to-face workshops, we summarise the challenges inherent in conducting a methodology scoping review and offer suggestions of best practice to promote future guideline development. RESULTS We identified three challenges of conducting a methodology scoping review. First, identification of search terms; one cannot usually define the search terms a priori and the language used for a particular method can vary across the literature. Second, the scope of the review requires careful consideration since new methodology is often not described (in full) within abstracts. Third, many new methods are motivated by a specific clinical question, where the methodology may only be documented in supplementary materials. We formulated several recommendations that build upon existing review guidelines. These recommendations ranged from an iterative approach to defining search terms through to screening and data extraction processes. CONCLUSION Although methodology scoping reviews are an important aspect of research, there is currently a lack of guidelines to standardise their design, implementation and reporting. We recommend a wider discussion on this topic.","Martin, Glen P; Jenkins, David A; Bull, Lucy; Sisk, Rose; Lin, Lijing; Hulme, William; Wilson, Anthony; Wang, Wenjuan; Barrowman, Michael; Sammut-Powell, Camilla; Pate, Alexander; Sperrin, Matthew; Peek, Niels",Journal of clinical epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726605/,594

Our study evaluated histologic identification of cilia-associated bacteria as a method for diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia. Cases of fatal bronchopneumonia were studied retrospectively, excluding neonates and cases of aspiration pneumonia, minor lung lesions, or autolysis. The study population comprised 36 canine and 31 feline cases of bronchopneumonia. B. bronchiseptica was identified in 8 of 36 canine and 14 of 31 feline cases based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) using serum from a rabbit hyperimmunized with pertactin, PCR testing (Fla2/Fla12), and/or bacterial culture data when available. Of these, IHC was positive in 4 canine and 7 feline cases, PCR was positive in 8 canine and 14 feline cases, and B. bronchiseptica was isolated in 2 of 5 canine and 3 of 9 feline cases tested. Examination of histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed bronchial cilia-associated bacteria in 4 of 36 canine and 5 of 31 feline cases; these were all positive by IHC and PCR. The presence of cilia-associated bacteria had been noted in the pathology report for only 2 of these 9 cases. Thus, the presence of cilia-associated bacteria seems frequently overlooked by pathologists, but is a diagnostically significant feature of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia. A specific diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia is important because it suggests primary or opportunistic bacterial pneumonia rather than aspiration pneumonia, and because of the risk of animal-to-animal transmission of B. bronchiseptica, the availability of vaccines for disease prevention, and the potential zoonotic risk to immunocompromised pet owners.","Taha-Abdelaziz, Khaled; Bassel, Laura L; Harness, Melanie L; Clark, Mary Ellen; Register, Karen B; Caswell, Jeff L","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638716646806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27178716/,594

High concentrations of SO2 can induce a series of defensive responses in Arabidopsis plants. However, the role of photosynthesis in the plant response to SO2 stress is not clear. Here, we report the photosynthetic responses of Arabidopsis plants to SO2 stress. Exposure to 30 mg/m3 SO2 decreased stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr) but increased photosynthetic pigments and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). The contents of carbohydrates and sucrose were not altered. The transcript levels of most genes related to photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6/f (Cytb6f), photosystem I (PSI) and carbon fixation were upregulated, revealing one important regulatory circuit for the maintenance of chloroplast homeostasis under SO2 stress. Exposure to SO2 triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, accompanied by increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the contents of cysteine (Cys), glutathione (GSH) and non-protein thiol (NPT), which maintained cellular redox homeostasis. Together, our results indicated that chloroplast photosynthesis was involved in the plant response to SO2 stress. The photosynthetic responses were related to photosynthetic pigments, photosynthesis gene expression and redox regulation.","Li, Lijuan; Yi, Huilan",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888606/,594

We thus evaluate the effectiveness of the surgical mask, the N95 respirator mask, and its equivalent (KF94 mask) in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection were instructed to cough five times each while wearing (1) no mask, (2) surgical mask, (3) KF94 mask, and (4) N95 mask. The coughs were separated by 20-second intervals, and the patients were rested for at least 5 min between each setting. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in patient samples (i.e. nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva), petri dishes placed in front of the patients during coughing, and swabs from the outer and inner surfaces of the masks were analysed with PCR. RESULTS A total of 7 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection participated in the mask test. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the petri dishes after coughing in 3 out of 7 cases with the surgical mask or no mask. Viral particles were not found in the petri dishes after coughing while wearing the N95 mask or the KF94 mask. While viral particles were detected in both the inner and outer surfaces of the surgical masks, those were detected only in the inner surfaces of the N95 and K94 masks. CONCLUSION Surgical masks were less effective in filtering viral particles from coughing patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. N95 masks and its equivalents efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 particles from coughing patients.","Kim, Min-Chul; Bae, Seongman; Kim, Ji Yeun; Park, Se Yoon; Lim, Joon Seo; Sung, Minki; Kim, Sung-Han",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2020.1810858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32845196/,594

In addition to standard multiple-choice and short-answer questions, Top Hat has several unique question types and methods of displaying the responses given. These include displaying free-text responses in a word cloud format and a ""click-on-target"" question type that allows students to indicate their response by clicking on a location within an image. Responses for this latter question type are displayed in a heat map format. A discussion tool is also available, which allows students to respond, read other students' responses in real time, and then reply again if warranted. This feature also supports drawing-based responses. The variety of question types was very useful in keeping students engaged during teaching sessions, giving this application several advantages over systems that are limited to multiple-choice questions only. In addition, the application allowed rapid identification of areas of student knowledge and misunderstandings, which facilitated the direction of further discussion and clarification of important learning issues.","Mariani, Christopher L; Roe, Simon C",Journal of veterinary medical education,https://doi.org/10.3138/jvme.1117-171r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594956/,594
152175,Foaming properties of a peptide designed to form stimuli-responsive interfacial films.,2006-11-15,"In this commentary, we reflect on Rinaldi and Bekker's scoping review of the literature on populist radical right (PRR) parties and welfare policies. We argue that their review provides political scientists and healthcare scholars with a firm basis to further explore the relationships between populism and welfare policies in different political systems. In line with the authors, we furthermore (re)emphasize the need for additional empirical inquiries into the relationship between populism and healthcare. But instead of expanding the research agenda suggested - for instance by adding categories or niches in which this relationship can be observed - we would like to challenge some of the premises of the studies conducted and reviewed thus far. We do so by identifying two concerns and by illustrating these concerns with two examples from the Netherlands.","Felder, Martijn; Wallenburg, Iris; Kuijper, Syb; Bal, Roland",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32979896/,594
152244,Cost analysis of leak after sleeve gastrectomy.,2017,"In this work, anaerobic digestion of pig slurry and successive composting of the digestate after centrifugation were studied by means of chemical analysis, FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy as excitation-emission matrix (EEM). Chemical analysis highlighted the organic matter transformation occurring during the processes. A decrease of volatile solids and total organic carbon were observed in the digestate with respect to the fresh pig slurry as a consequence of the consumption of sugars, proteins, amino acids and fatty acids used by microorganisms as a C source. Water Extractable Organic Matter (WEOM) was obtained for all samples and fractionated into a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic fraction. The highest WEOM value was found in the pig slurry indicating a high content of labile organic C. The digestate centrifuged and the digestate composted showed lower hydrophilic and higher hydrophobic contents because of the decrease of labile C. Total phenolic content was lower in the digestate with respect to fresh pig slurry sample (36.7%) as a consequence of phenolic compounds degradation. The strong decrease of total reducing sugars in the digestate (76.6%) as compared to pig slurry confirmed that anaerobic process proceed mainly through consumption of sugars which represent a readily available energy source for microbial activity. FTIR spectra of pig slurry showed bands indicative of proteins and carbohydrates. A drop of aliphatic structures and a decrease of polysaccharides was observed after the anaerobic process along with the increase of the peak in the aromatic region. The composted substrate showed an increase of aromatic and a relative decrease of polysaccharides. EEM spectra provided tryptophan:fulvic-like fluorescence ratios which increased from fresh substrate to digestate because of the OM decompostion. Composted substrate presented the lowest ratio due to the humification process.","Provenzano, Maria Rosaria; Malerba, Anna D; Pezzolla, Daniela; Gigliotti, Giovanni",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411986/,594
152335,Single-port laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair.,2010,"BACKGROUND The purpose of the study was to review the efficacy, safety, and outcomes of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) in elderly patients with acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), high comorbidity, and COVID-19. METHODS The hospital registry data were examined of patients aged >65 years who were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and who underwent PC treatment in the interventional radiology unit. RESULTS A total of 18 patients were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19, then underwent PC. The patients comprised 14 (78%) males and 4 (22%) females with an average age of 73.4 years (range, 67-81 years). In 17 (94%) patients, symptoms associated with acute cholecystitis decreased within 48-72 h of the PC treatment and a clinical improvement was determined. The success rate of PC was 100% and no complications. In 3 (16.6%) patients followed up with intubation in intensive care after the procedure, mortality developed due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 15 (83.4%) patients were discharged with an elective cholecystectomy plan. CONCLUSION COVID-19 infection can be fatal especially in patients over 65 years of age due to additional comorbidities. PC treatment, which can be performed under local anesthesia as a minimally invasive procedure, is an alternative treatment option in this patient group. PC can also act as a bridge in transition to elective surgery in this process management.","Çakır, Çağlayan; Kabuli, Hamit Ahmet",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,https://doi.org/10.14744/tjtes.2020.23255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884595/,594
152349,Laparoscopic caecodivision ACE (antegrade continence enema) procedure.,2008,"BACKGROUND Specialist sexual assault services, which collect forensic evidence and offer holistic healthcare to people following sexual assault, have been established internationally. In England, these services are called sexual assault referral centres (SARCs). Mental health and substance misuse problems are common among SARC attendees, but little is known about how SARCs should address these needs. This review aims to seek and synthesise evidence regarding approaches to identification and support for mental health and substance misuse problems in SARCs and corresponding services internationally; empirical evidence regarding effective service models; and stakeholders' views and policy recommendations about optimal SARC practice. METHODS A systematic review was undertaken. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, IBSS and CINAHL were searched from 1975 to August 2018. A web-based search up to December 2018 was also conducted to identify government and expert guidelines on SARCs. Quality assessment and narrative synthesis were conducted. RESULTS We included 107 papers. We found that identification based on clinical judgement, supportive counselling and referral to other services without active follow-up were the most common approaches. Evaluations of interventions for post-rape psychopathology in attendees of sexual assault services provided mixed evidence of moderate quality. Very little evidence was found regarding interventions or support for substance misuse. Stakeholders emphasised the importance of accessibility, flexibility, continuity of care, in-house psychological support, staff trained in mental health as well as specialist support for LGBT groups and people with learning difficulties. Guidelines suggested that SARCs should assess for mental health and substance misuse and provide in-house emotional support, but the extent and nature of support were not clarified. Both stakeholders and guidelines recommended close partnership between sexual assault services and local counselling services. CONCLUSIONS This review suggests that there is big variation in the mental health and substance misuse provision both across and within different sexual assault service models. We found no robust evidence about how sexual assault services can achieve good mental health and substance misuse outcomes for service users. Clearer guidance for service planners and commissioners, informed by robust evidence about optimal service organisations and pathways, is required.

Besides, depending on the circumstances, international or inter-regional travel may be restricted. However, the African continent comprises mostly of developing countries with poor healthcare systems and low health literacy. As a result, it is highly likely that Africa could suffer greater damage than any other region once an outbreak occurs.

152665,The Band Must Not Be Abandoned.,2017,"BACKGROUND Worldwide, different traditions of symbolic statements in graveyards can be found. However, studies on sub-Saharan Africa are rare. For BaKongo cemeteries, it is only known that they traditionally do not exhibit plants for decoration purposes. Our study wanted to inspect the influence of Portuguese culture due to the long shared colonial past. METHODS During 2015 and 2019, plant use in 87 graveyards in 13 municipalities of the province Uíge was documented. Five expert interviews with the village eldest in five municipalities completed the data collection. RESULTS While 24% of the graveyards didn´t have any planting, 27 plant species were found in the remaining ones, including a high percentage of alien species (59%), mainly from the Americas. The most abundant plant species are Euphorbia tirucalli (23%) and Agave sisalana (22%). With increasing distance from the city Uíge (especially towards the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the utilization of living plants in cemeteries is decreasing except along the road. In most of the cases, just one plant species per gravesite was found. CONCLUSIONS This unexpected high number of plants might be interpreted as a strong evidence of outside influence. Cultural symbols of the BaKongo cosmology and Christianism appear to coexist or coalesce. Furthermore, plants are used as a marker for graveyards. Modern influences like the use of concrete in proximity to urban areas indicate a certain wealth.","Lautenschläger, Thea; Mandombe, José Lau; Mawunu, Monizi; Neinhuis, Christoph",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804984/,594

In this paper we analyze the polarization build-up in detail and show that in this case DNP is due to the cross-effect (CE) and that the build-up rate can be quantitatively interpreted as the rate of the triple spin flips responsible for the CE. Thus this build-up rate presents a direct measurement of this triple spin flip rate.","Wenckebach, W Th; Capozzi, A; Patel, S; Ardenkjær-Larsen, J H",Journal of magnetic resonance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2021.106982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932911/,594

153158,A Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Surgical Approaches to Proctectomy.,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori (H.P.) eradication has led to a significant decline in peptic ulcer prevalence; however, the number of patients requiring surgical intervention remains relatively unchanged. Laparoscopy suture repair is the most commonly used procedure for perforated peptic ulcer (PPU). Whether omental patch adds any benefit than simple closure alone is not answered. METHODS From July 2007 to August 2010, patients received emergency surgeries for PPU in our department were enrolled in this study. The demographic data, disease pattern, surgical outcomes were retrospectively collected. Patients who had previous multiple operations, with profound shock, and complicated ulcers were excluded. RESULTS Totally 73 patients were enrolled. 26 of them received simple closure and the other 47 received simple closure plus an omental patch. There were no difference in age, gender, ASA, Boey risk score, and incidence of co-morbidities. The Mannheim Peritonitis index, median operation time and length of stay were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS In terms of leakage rate and surgical outcome, the maneuver to cover an omental patch on the repaired PPU did not show additional advantages compared to simple closure alone. Further prospective randomized study is required to clarify the safety and feasibility of simple closure alone without buttressing an omentum patch.","Lo, Hung-Chieh; Wu, Shih-Chi; Huang, Hung-Chang; Yeh, Chun-Chieh; Huang, Jui-Chien; Hsieh, Chi-Hsun",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1106-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21533964/,594
153768,Gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass surgery: nuisance or catastrophe?,2010,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic liver resection has been increasingly adopted worldwide as a result of the rapid advancement in surgical techniques and equipment. This study aims to determine the factors associated with and outcomes of open conversion after laparoscopic minor hepatectomy (LMH) based on a single center multi-surgeon experience. METHODS This is a retrospective review of the first 147 consecutive LMH performed between 2006 and April 2014 at a single institution. Data on patient demographics, pathology results, perioperative outcomes, and operative results were collected. Factors associated with open conversion were analyzed via univariate analysis and a P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS LMH was performed for malignancy in 114 (77.6%) patients of which hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 82) and colorectal metastases (n = 16) were the most common pathologies. Forty-one (27.9%) patients had cirrhotic livers and 18 (15.7%) had fibrotic livers. Fifty patients (44%) had concomitant surgery in addition to LMH. Twenty (13.6%) procedures required open conversion and the most common reason was for bleeding (n = 12). Twenty-five patients (17%) experienced postoperative complications. Univariate analyses demonstrated that only individual surgeon volume (n ≤ 10 cases) [15 (24.2%) vs 5 (5.9%), P = .001] and institution volume (n ≤ 25 cases) [8 (32%) vs 12 (9.8%), P = .003] were factors associated with open conversion. Open conversion was significantly associated with increased intra-operative blood loss, increased intra-operative blood transfusion, increased postoperative morbidity, and longer postoperative stay. CONCLUSIONS Individual surgeon and institution volumes were important factors associated with open conversion after LMH. Open conversion after LMH resulted in poorer outcomes compared to procedures that were successfully completed laparoscopically.","Goh, Brian K P; Chan, Chung-Yip; Wong, Jen-San; Lee, Ser-Yee; Lee, Victor T W; Cheow, Peng-Chung; Chow, Pierce K H; Ooi, London L P J; Chung, Alexander Y F",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3981-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427418/,594
154091,Tension-Free Mesh Repair for Incarcerated Groin Hernia: A Comparative Study.,2020-01-29,"BACKGROUND This study examined the associations between components of psychological resilience and mental health at different levels of exposure to COVID-19 stressors. METHODS A population-representative sample of 4,021 respondents were recruited and assessed between February 25th and March 19th, 2020. Respondents reported current anxiety symptoms (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]), cognitive components (perceived ability to adapt to change, tendency to bounce back after adversities) and behavioral components (regularity of primary and secondary daily routines) of resilience, worry about COVID-19 infection, and sociodemographics. RESULTS Logistic regression revealed that cognitive and behavioral components of resilience were not correlated with probable anxiety (GAD-7≥10) among those reporting no worry. Among respondents who were worried, all resilient components were inversely associated with probable anxiety. Specifically, propensity to bounce back and regular primary routines were more strongly related to lower odds of probable anxiety among those reporting lower levels of worry. LIMITATIONS The cross-sectional design limits causal inference. Second, other resilient components and some key daily routines that could be related to better mental health were not assessed. Third, generalizability of the findings to other similar major cities is uncertain because cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in Hong Kong have been comparatively lower. CONCLUSIONS To foster mental health, cultivation of confidence in one's ability to adapt to change and a propensity to bounce back from hardship should be coupled with sustainment of regular daily routines. Such assessment and intervention protocols could be more relevant to those who suffer heightened levels of exposure to COVID-19 stressors.","Hou, Wai Kai; Tong, Horace; Liang, Li; Li, Tsz Wai; Liu, Huinan; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Goodwin, Robin; Lee, Tatia Mei-Chun",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445081/,594
154105,Total Robotic Myomectomy in a Complex Case: Extending the Limits.,2020,"BACKGROUND Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for revascularization of the internal carotid artery (ICA). CAS from the femoral approach may be problematic due to peripheral vascular disease, anatomical variations of the aortic arch, and access site complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the right radial approach (RRA) for CAS. METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients who had undergone transradial (TR) CAS at two centers was performed. Demographics, the technique used to deploy the sheath in the common carotid, procedural details, results, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS CAS was attempted from TR in 382 patients (mean age 68, 70% male). CAS was successful in 347/382 (91%) patients; 201/216 (93%) right CA, 14/16 (88%) bovine left CA, 132/150 (88%) left CA. The specific technique varied with the anatomy. Seven different carotid artery stents (51% Xact) and seven different distal embolic protection devices were used. Adverse events included two major strokes (0.6%) one of whom died, three minor strokes (1%), and no myocardial infarction at 30 days. No bleeding complications occurred although 23 (6%) of patients had asymptomatic postprocedure radial occlusion. Inadequate catheter support at the origin of the CCA was the technical cause of failure in the unsuccessful cases which were then completed from femoral access as part of the same procedure. CONCLUSION The transradial approach is an alternative for CAS in the presence of factors that increase the risk or difficulty of femoral access.","Etxegoien, Nicholena; Rhyne, Diana; Kedev, Sasko; Sachar, Ravish; Mann, Tift",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.24503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22639455/,594

We aimed to evaluate the outcome and potential harmful cardiac effects of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin compared to hydroxychloroquine alone for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and World Health Organization clinical trial registry were searched using appropriate keywords and identified six studies using PRISMA guidelines. The quantitative synthesis was performed using fixed or random effects for the pooling of studies based on heterogeneities. RESULTS The risk of mortality (RR=1.16; CI: 0.92-1.46) and adverse cardiac events (OR=1.06; CI: 0.82-1.37) demonstrated a small increment though of no significance. There were no increased odds of mechanical ventilation (OR=0.84; CI: 0.33-2.15) and significant QTc prolongation (OR=0.84, CI: 0.59-1.21). Neither the critical QTc threshold (OR=1.92, CI: 0.81-4.56) nor absolute ?QTc ?60ms (OR=1.95, CI:0.55-6.96) increased to the level of statistical significance among hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin arm compared to hydroxychloroquine alone, but the slightly increased odds need to be considered in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin leads to small increased odds of mortality and cardiac events compared to hydroxychloroquine alone. The use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin led to increased odds of QT prolongation, although not statistically significant.","Budhathoki, Pravash; Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Khadka, Sitaram; Rawal, Era",Journal of Nepal Health Research Council,https://doi.org/10.33314/jnhrc.v19i1.3270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934125/,594

Chronic and uncontrolled neuroinflammation triggers neuronal injury and neuronal death resulting in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, fine tuning of the immune response in the nervous system is now extensively considered as a potential therapeutic intervention for those diseases. The immune cells of the nervous system express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) together with myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) to protect against the pathogens. Over the last 10 years, antagonists targeting the functional domains of MD-2 have become attractive pharmacological intervention strategies in pre-clinical studies into neuroinflammation and its associated brain pathologies.

The median tenure of family medicine PDs is 4.5 years, and factors relating to length of tenure and reasons for departure are not well known. This exploratory study examined why family medicine PDs leave their position. METHODS We conducted in-depth interviews with family medicine PDs who recently left their director position. Semistructured and structured questions asked about their PD experience and factors contributing to stepping away from the PD role. We analyzed answers quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS When comparing cases with longer (>6 years) and shorter tenures (≤6 years), 25 PDs described differing pathways but few major differences in why they left the position. The two groups were distinguished more by their similarities than their differences. The majority left voluntarily due to a combination of factors, not a single factor. Most PDs left the position because of their desire and opportunities to move up, move over, or move on, and not because of dissatisfaction with the job. Succession plans helped with PD decisions to leave the position, knowing that the program was in good hands. CONCLUSIONS Family medicine PDs left the position due to multiple factors primarily related to career pathway choices and not solely due to demands of the job. Additional research with PDs of very short tenures and long tenures may yield further details about sustaining PDs in residency education to successfully train the next generation of family physicians.","Fernald, Douglas; Hester, Christina M; Brown, Steven R",Family medicine,https://doi.org/10.22454/fammed.2021.746153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019680/,594

155557,"Revisional Surgery After Failed Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: Retrospective Analysis of Causes, Results, and Technical Considerations.",2017,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Although eosinophil count is the standard used to monitor disease activity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), there are often disparities between patient-reported symptoms and eosinophil counts. We examined the prevalence of epithelial alterations, namely basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and spongiosis, among patients with inactive EoE (eosinophil counts below 15 following therapy) and aimed to determine whether maintenance of these changes in epithelial morphology are associated with persistent clinical findings. METHODS Esophageal biopsies of 243 patients (mean age, 16.9 years) undergoing routine endoscopy at the University of Pennsylvania were evaluated for epithelial BCH and spongiosis. Univariable analysis was used to calculate the association between epithelial changes and symptoms as well as endoscopic findings and peak eosinophil count. We validated our findings using data from a cohort of patients at the University of North Carolina. RESULTS The discovery and validation cohorts each included patients with inactive EoE, based on histologic factors, but ongoing BCH and spongiosis. Ongoing BCH, but not spongiosis, in patients with inactive EoE was associated with symptoms (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.03-4.42; P=.041) and endoscopic findings (odds ratio, 7.10; 95% CI, 3.12-16.18; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with EoE, the presence of BCH might indicate ongoing disease activity, independent of eosinophil count. This might account for the persistent symptoms in patients who are considered to be in remission based on histologic factors.","Whelan, Kelly A; Godwin, Bridget C; Wilkins, Benjamin; Elci, Okan U; Benitez, Alain; DeMarshall, Maureen; Sharma, Medha; Gross, Jonathan; Klein-Szanto, Andres J; Liacouras, Chris A; Dellon, Evan S; Spergel, Jonathan M; Falk, Gary W; Muir, Amanda B; Nakagawa, Hiroshi",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2019.08.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499251/,594

We aimed to investigate how prone position effects regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) in preterm neonates during noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Methods: Preterm neonates < 37 weeks gestational age (GA) stable on NIV were enrolled. NIV was defined as nasal continues positive airway pressure or intermittent positive pressure ventilation via binasal prongs. Near infrared spectroscopy was used to measure rScO2. Monitoring was started when the infant was lying supine for at least 1 h and continued at the same body position at least for 1 h. Later the infant was changed to prone position and monitored for additional 3 h. Arterial oxygen saturation (SO2) was also continuously monitored and FOE was calculated from rScO2 and SO2. Results: Mean GA and birth weight of the cohort (n = 32) were 30.63 ± 3.09 weeks and 1459 ± 581 g, respectively. There were 14 females and 18 males. Both SO2 (95 ± 2.2% versus 96.2 ± 1.9%, p = .001) and rScO2 (79.2 ± 3.4% versus 82.1 ± 3.2%, p < .001) were higher in prone position compared to supine position. Cerebral FOE (16.6 ± 0.8% versus 14.7 ± 0.8%, p < .001) and respiratory rate (57.3 ± 5.5 versus 55.6 ± 9.2, p = .003) were lower in prone position. Conclusion: In preterm newborns, receiving nasal NIV for mild to moderate respiratory distress, arterial and cerebral oxygenations were better in prone position.","Barsan Kaya, Tugba; Aydemir, Ozge; Tekin, Ayşe Neslihan","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1678133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615310/,594

METHODS Twenty-six trained runners (16 female; mean ± SD, age 19 ± 1 years, V̇O2max F: 52.6 ± 6.9 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1, M: 64.6 ± 2.4 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1) performed a running heat tolerance test (30 min, 9 km⋅h-1/2% gradient, 40 °C/40%RH; HTT) and temperate (18 °C) exercise tests (maximal aerobic capacity [V̇O2max] and lactate profile) pre and post 3 weeks of normal exercise training plus 29 ± 1 min post-exercise sauna bathing (101-108 °C) 3 ± 1 times per week. RESULTS Females and males exhibited similar reductions (interactions p > 0.05) in peak rectal temperature (- 0.3 °C; p < 0.001), skin temperature (- 0.9 °C; p < 0.001) and heart rate (- 9 beats·min-1; p = 0.001) during the HTT at post- vs pre-intervention. Only females exhibited an increase in active sweat glands on the forearm (measured via modified iodine technique; F: + 57%, p < 0.001; M: + 1%, p = 0.47). Conversely, only males increased forearm blood flow (measured via venous occlusion plethysmography; F: + 31%, p = 0.61; M: + 123%; p < 0.001). Females and males showed similar (interactions p > 0.05) improvements in V̇O2max (+ 5%; p = 0.02) and running speed at 4 mmol·L-1 blood lactate concentration (+ 0.4 km·h-1; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Three weeks of post-exercise sauna bathing effectively induces heat acclimation in females and males, though possibly amid different thermoeffector adaptations. Post-exercise sauna bathing is also an effective ergogenic aid for both sexes.","Kirby, Nathalie V; Lucas, Samuel J E; Cable, Thomas G; Armstrong, Oliver J; Weaver, Samuel R; Lucas, Rebekah A I",Sports medicine - open,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40798-021-00342-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34297227/,594

Although the Chinese central government implemented significant measures to control the epidemic from January 20 within China, the crisis had already escalated dramatically.Between December 1, 2019, and January 20, 2020, a total of 51 days passed before the Chinese central government took full control. Several major factors combined to cause what had been in retrospect a clear break in the governmental information chain between December 1 and January 20. The management of this epidemic also illustrated key organizational limitations of the current Chinese health system, in particular provincial-level senior officials' lack of knowledge and awareness of potential public health risks and insufficient emergency medical material storage and logistics arrangements.We review the specific disease control actions that the Chinese central government took between January 20 and January 27, the major reasons why the governmental information chain had broken before January 20, and key structural health system limitations highlighted as the epidemic expanded.

There is well recorded overuse of MRI in this scenario which goes against evidence-based practice and adds to rising healthcare costs. METHODS The study was a retrospective review of lumbar spine MRI scans performed within a community-based setting over an 18-month period. The review took a randomised purposive sample of patients (n = 450); looking at adherence to, and relevance of, guidelines in managing lower back conditions. Data extracted provided information on demographics and prevalence of clinical presentation and report observations. RESULTS There is variation in practice and utlisation of MRI with this patient group which warrants further exploration. Results support inappropriate use, lacking adherence to guidelines and pathways, leading to unnecessary imaging. 46% of referrals were considered clinically justified with 38% of report findings considered abnormal and of clinical relevance. Chi-square and binomial logistic regression were used to assess the significance and relationship of any factors on referral justification and report outcome. No difference was found between type of referrer, with patient age and leg symptoms being significant factors. CONCLUSION The study highlights the opportunity to integrate better referral criteria to improve referral quality, its suitability and the relevance of final reports. In the current climate this would help manage appropriate use of imaging resources during the post COVID-19 pandemic recovery phase, as well as support recommendations regarding diagnostic reform and a move towards more community-based diagnostics.","Hudson, Darren; Knapp, Karen; Benwell, Martin",Musculoskeletal care,https://doi.org/10.1002/msc.1529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278329/,594
157328,Development of a novel training system for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.,2018,"AIMS Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) occurs frequently in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), especially in high-risk patients. The role of rapid-rate NSVT (RR-NSVT) documented by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in DCM patients has not been fully explored. This study aimed to determine the relationship between RR-NSVT and the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTAs) in DCM patients with ICD. METHODS From December 2000 to December 2017, 136 DCM patients received ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation for primary or secondary prevention of VTAs. Based on the occurrence of documented RR-NSVT, patients were classified into RR-NSVT (-) or RR-NSVT (+) groups. RESULT During the median follow-up of 4.5 years, 50.0% (68/136) of patients experienced ≥ 1 episode, and 25.0% (34/136) of patients experienced ≥ 3 episodes of RR-NSVT. Event-free survival for VTAs was significantly higher in the RR-NSVT (-) group whereas those for heart failure admission and cardiovascular mortality were comparable between groups. In the multivariate cox regression analysis, any RR-NSVT showed a positive association with the occurrence of VTAs (HR: 5.087; 95% CI: 2.374-10.900; p<0.001). In RR-NSVT (+) patients, a cluster (≥ 3 times/6 months) and frequent pattern (≥ 3 runs/day) of RR-NSVT were observed in 42.6% (29/68) and 30.9% (21/68) of patients, respectively, who showed further increased incidence of VTAs. CONCLUSION In DCM patients with ICD/CRT-D, 50.0% experienced at least 1 episode of RR-NSVT. RR-NSVT documentation showed a positive association with subsequent occurrence of VTAs, suggesting the importance of constructive arrhythmia management for patients with RR-NSVT.

157696,Video: laparoscopic right hepatectomy and partial resection of the diaphragm for liver metastases.,2011,"There is an emerging demand for the use of molecular profiling to facilitate biomarker identification and development, and to stratify patients for more efficient treatment decisions with reduced adverse effects. In the past decade, great strides have been made to advance genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to address these demands. While there has been much progress with these large scale approaches, profiling at the protein level still faces challenges due to limitations in clinical sample size, poor reproducibility, unreliable quantitation, and lack of assay robustness. A novel automated capillary nano-immunoassay (CNIA) technology has been developed. This technology offers precise and accurate measurement of proteins and their post-translational modifications using either charge-based or size-based separation formats. The system not only uses ultralow nanogram levels of protein but also allows multi-analyte analysis using a parallel single-analyte format for increased sensitivity and specificity. The high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility of this technology make it particularly powerful for analysis of clinical samples. Furthermore, the system can distinguish and detect specific protein post-translational modifications that conventional Western blot and other immunoassays cannot easily capture. This review will summarize and evaluate the latest progress to optimize the CNIA system for comprehensive, quantitative protein and signaling event characterization. It will also discuss how the technology has been successfully applied in both discovery research and clinical studies, for signaling pathway dissection, proteomic biomarker assessment, targeted treatment evaluation and quantitative proteomic analysis. Lastly, a comparison of this novel system with other conventional immuno-assay platforms is performed.","Chen, Jin-Qiu; Wakefield, Lalage M; Goldstein, David J",Journal of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-015-0537-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26048678/,594

Surgery is not a cure and most patients develop recurrent Crohn's disease and require additional intestinal resections. There are a number of medications that have been investigated for preventing and treating recurrence. Risk factors for postoperative disease recurrence help guide the physician in determining the appropriate treatment strategy after Crohn's disease surgery. The approach to Crohn's disease treatment has evolved over the years. No longer should surgery be considered a failure of treatment, rather an important intervention to correct irreversible disease. In combination with a better understanding of postoperative medication strategies, patients with Crohn's disease may achieve longer term remission than previously realized.

Mounting epidemiological evidence has indicated that COF exposure is significantly associated with an increased risk of various health effects including lung cancer, but toxicological studies are very limited. OBJECTIVES We conduct a systematic study to provide toxicological evidence of COF exposure on the lungs, to examine the underlying toxicological mechanism, and to suggest intervention measures to mitigate this toxicity. METHODS A total 96 female rats were randomly divided into control groups, COF exposure groups (0.2, 2, 20 mg/kg) and vitamin E protection groups, receiving appropriate treatment for 30 days. First we measured airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) followed by a lung histological analysis to investigate the toxicological effects of COF. We next analyzed the biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis to examine the underlying toxicological mechanism, and finally we investigated the protective effects of vitamin E against the toxicity of COF. RESULTS AHR measurement indicated that the airway resistance increased with the COF dose and the lung histological assay showed narrowing of the airway lumen, which provided evidence of the toxicological effects of COF. The biomarkers of oxidative stress (ROS and MDA), pro-inflammation (TNF-α and IL-1β), and apoptosis (NF-κB and Caspase-3) were all significantly increased with COF dose. We observed that above toxicological effects and biomarker levels induced by COF were significantly ameliorated after administration of VE. CONCLUSION The toxicity of cooking oil fumes on the lungs is clear from the evidence and mechanism, and can be ameliorated by vitamin E. We suggested that oxidative stress may be primarily responsible for the observed cooking oil fumes-induced toxicity.","Ma, Yongsheng; Deng, Linjing; Ma, Ping; Wu, Yang; Yang, Xu; Xiao, Fang; Deng, Qihong",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683156/,594

DESIGN retrospective study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS for each vaccine recipient, demographic information and history of HPV vaccine uptake from the digital FVG Vaccination Registry updated as of 31.12.2018 were extracted. Numerator data comprised all doses allocated to FVG residents. Age-specific denominators were derived from the FVG census in each examined year. Coverage estimates for the year 2018 were also provided by number of doses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES coverage for a full course of HPV vaccine, defined as 2 doses in girls and boys younger than age 15 years but 3 doses in less young women. RESULTS In FVG 52,217 females had received >=1 dose since 2008 and 12,152 males since 2015. >=2-dose coverage in girls at 15 increased from 42% in 2009 to 76% in 2015 and slightly declined afterwards (69% in 2018). In 2008, 3-dose coverage was 65%, 74%, and 59% in females aged 16-17, 18-19, and 20-26 years, respectively. In the same year, 2-dose coverage in boys at 13 years was 54%, similar to the coverage in girls at 13 years (57%). CONCLUSIONS this paper shows the achievements of routine and catch-up HPV vaccination in FVG. While coverage in girls at 15 years of age peaked in 2015 and slightly diminished in subsequent years, the coverage in boys at 13 in 2018 had already approached the coverage in same-age girls (57%). On account of the signs of weakening in girls' coverage, campaigns in support to HPV vaccination must be repeated, especially in favour of the most cost-effective group, i.e., girls before 15 years of age. The heavy burden posed by the COVID-19 emergency on other prevention-related activities makes a better targeted use of HPV vaccination even more necessary.","Franceschi, Silvia; Gallo, Tolinda; Panato, Chiara; Gongolo, Francesco; Franzo, Antonella",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.p378.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706490/,594

Studies demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell therapy protected blood-brain barrier disruption from several cerebrovascular diseases. However, the underlying mechanism was largely unknown. We therefore hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cells reduced blood-brain barrier destruction by inhibiting matrixmetallo-proteinase-9 and it was related to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). METHODS Adult ICR male mice (n = 118) underwent 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion and received 2 × 105 mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. Neurobehavioral outcome, infarct volume, and blood-brain barrier permeability were measured after ischemia. The relationship between myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and ICAM-1 release was further determined. RESULTS We found that intracranial injection of mesenchymal stem cells reduced infarct volume and improved behavioral function in experimental stroke models (p < 0.05). IgG leakage, tight junction protein loss, and inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α reduced in mesenchymal stem cell-treated mice compared to the control group following ischemia (p < 0.05). After transplantation, MMP-9 was decreased in protein and activity levels as compared with controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, myeloperoxidase-positive cells and myeloperoxidase activity were decreased in mesenchymal stem cell-treated mice (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The results showed that mesenchymal stem cell therapy attenuated blood-brain barrier disruption in mice after ischemia. Mesenchymal stem cells attenuated the upward trend of MMP-9 and potentially via downregulating ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway may influence MMP-9 expression of neutrophils and resident cells, and ICAM-1 acted as a key factor in the paracrine actions of mesenchymal stem cell.","Cheng, Zhuo; Wang, Liping; Qu, Meijie; Liang, Huaibin; Li, Wanlu; Li, Yongfang; Deng, Lidong; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1153-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29724240/,594
159105,Analysis of standard multiport versus single-site access for laparoscopic skills training.,2011,"Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are antiviral GTPases induced by type I interferons (IFNs). In chickens, a single Mx protein variant, S631N, has been suggested to possess antiviral activity. However, the impact of this variant on chicken Mx (chMx) protein structure and conformation has not been investigated. Hence, in this study, we applied computational methods such as molecular modeling, molecular dynamic simulation, inter domain motion and residue networks to examine the structure and dynamic behavior of wild-type and mutant chMx. At first, we built 3-dimensional structural models for both wild-type and mutant chMx proteins, which revealed that the structural organization of chMx was similar to that of human Mx proteins. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that angle variation around the hinge1 region led to the different stalk domain conformations between the wild-type and mutant chMx proteins. Domain motion analysis further suggested that the conformational differences in the loop region surrounded by the mutant residue may lead to an inclined stalk domain conformation in the mutant compared to the wild-type protein. In addition, we performed betweenness centrality analysis from residue interaction networks, to identify the crucial residues for intramolecular signal flow in chMx. The results of this study provided information on the differences in structure and dynamics between wild-type and mutant chMx, which may aid in understanding the structural features of the S631N mutant, that may be associated with chMx protein antiviral activity.

Guidelines promote the safe handling of antineoplastic drugs, but no safe exposure limit was determined. Regular surface sampling contributes to ensuring workers safety. METHODS A cross-sectional monitoring is conducted once a year with voluntary Canadian centers, since 2010. Twelve standardized sampling sites were sampled. Samples were analyzed by high performance mass coupled liquid chromatography. The limits of detection (in ng/cm2) were: 0.001 for cyclophosphamide and gemcitabine; 0.3 for docetaxel and ifosfamide; 0.04 for 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel; 0.003 for irinotecan; 0.002 for methotrexate; 0.01 for vinorelbine. RESULTS The surfaces from 109 centers were sampled between 01/01/2020-18/06/2020. Twenty-six centers delayed their participation because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1217 samples were analyzed. Surfaces were frequently contaminated with cyclophosphamide (34% positive, 75th percentile 0.00165 ng/cm2) and gemcitabine (16% and <0.001 ng/cm2). The armrest of patient treatment chairs (84% to at least one drug), the front grille inside the biological safety cabinet (BSC) (73%) and the floor in front of the BSC (55%) were frequently contaminated. Centers that prepared ≥5000 antineoplastic drugs annually had higher concentration of cyclophosphamide on their surfaces (p < 0.0001). Contamination measured on the surfaces was reduced from 2010 to 2020. CONCLUSIONS This large-scale study showed reproducible long term follow up of the contamination of standardized sites of Canadian centers and a reduction in surface contamination from 2010 to 2020. Periodic surface sampling help centers meet their continuous improvements goals to reduce exposure as much as possible. The COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on the program.","Chabut, Claire; Tanguay, Cynthia; Gagné, Sébastien; Caron, Nicolas; Bussières, Jean-François",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155221992103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567975/,594

Preventative strategies for virus-induced AHR remain limited. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been suggested as a therapeutic target because of their central role in triggering antiviral immune responses. Previous studies showed that concurrent treatment with TLR2/6 and TLR9 agonists reduced lethality and the microbial burden in murine models of bacterial and viral pneumonia. This study investigated the effects of TLR2/6 and TLR9 agonist pretreatment on parainfluenza virus pneumonia and virus-induced AHR in guinea pigs in vivo. Synthetic TLR2/6 lipopeptide agonist Pam₂CSK₄ and Class C oligodeoxynucleotide TLR9 agonist ODN2395, administered in combination 24 hours before virus infection, significantly reduced viral replication in the lung. Despite a fivefold reduction in viral titers, concurrent TLR2/6 and TLR9 agonist pretreatment did not prevent virus-induced AHR or virus-induced inhibitory M2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction. Interestingly, the TLR agonists independently caused non-M2-dependent AHR.

The teams who pulled together put aside their differences and became stronger, putting their patients first and then each other. Those teams grew stronger, but some teams completely fell apart. They spent their days nitpicking, complaining, and arguing-making decisions based on what was best for themselves, not patients or their coworkers. The common denominator in determining how well teams performed was the leader. Employees looked to their leaders to successfully lead them through crisis, whether it was on a small or global scale. Depending on leader behaviors, the leader strengthened or weakened the team; trust was built or broken. That is a heavy burden to carry knowing that employees were so dependent on them and how they showed up every day.

161336,The role of a computed tomography-based image registered navigation system for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery: a comparative study in a porcine model.,2010,"Membrane-associated RING-CH8 (MARCH8) impairs the cell surface expression of envelope glycoproteins from different viruses, reducing their incorporation into virions. Using stable cell lines with inducible MARCH8 expression, we show that MARCH8 did not alter susceptibility to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, but virions released from infected cells were markedly less infectious. Knockdown of endogenous MARCH8 confirmed its effect on IAV infectivity. The expression of MARCH8 impaired the infectivity of both H3N2 and H1N1 strains and was dependent on its E3 ligase activity. Although virions released in the presence of MARCH8 expressed smaller amounts of viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, there was no impact on levels of the viral HA, NA, or matrix 2 (M2) proteins detected on the surface of infected cells. Moreover, mutation of lysine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of HA, NA, and/or M2, or in the viral M1 protein, did not abrogate MARCH8-mediated restriction. While MARCH1 and -8 target similar immunological ligands and both restrict HIV-1, only MARCH8 inhibited IAV infectivity. Deletion of the N-terminal cytoplasmic (N-CT) domain of MARCH8 confirmed it to be a critical determinant of IAV inhibition. Of interest, deletion of the MARCH1 N-CT or its replacement with the MARCH8 N-CT resulted in acquisition of IAV restriction. Together, these data demonstrate that MARCH8 restricts a late stage in IAV replication by a mechanism distinct to its reported activity against other viruses. Moreover, we show that the N-CT of MARCH8 is essential for anti-IAV activity, whereas the MARCH1 N-CT inhibits its ability to restrict IAV. IMPORTANCE The antiviral activity of MARCH8 has been associated with the downregulation of envelope glycoproteins from a range of different viruses, resulting in reduced incorporation into nascent virions. Here, we show that MARCH8 restricts IAV at a late stage in virus replication, but this was not associated with reduced expression of IAV envelope glycoproteins on the surface of infected cells, pointing to a distinct mechanism of antiviral activity. Our studies also demonstrate the differential ability of MARCH1 and -8 to restrict IAV infectivity, highlighting the critical role of the N-CT domain of each protein in modulating IAV restriction. Overall, these studies provide novel insights regarding the mechanisms by which MARCH proteins contribute to cell-intrinsic immunity against IAV.","Villalón-Letelier, Fernando; Brooks, Andrew G; Londrigan, Sarah L; Reading, Patrick C",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01484-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517760/,594

183570,Restriction endonuclease analysis of feline herpesvirus 1 DNA isolated from wild felids.,1999,"Introduction Approval for the use of COVID-19 vaccines has been granted in a number of countries but there are concerns that vaccine uptake may be low amongst certain groups. Methods This study used a mixed methods approach based on online survey and an embedded quantitative/qualitative design to explore perceptions and attitudes that were associated with intention to either accept or refuse offers of vaccination in different demographic groups during the early stages of the UK's mass COVID-19 vaccination programme (December 2020). Analysis used multivariate logistic regression, structural text modelling and anthropological assessments. Results Of 4,535 respondents, 85% (n=3,859) were willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine. The rapidity of vaccine development and uncertainties about safety were common reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. There was no evidence for the widespread influence of mis-information, although broader vaccine hesitancy was associated with intentions to refuse COVID-19 vaccines (OR 20.60, 95% CI 14.20-30.30, p<0.001). Low levels of trust in the decision-making (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08, 2.48, p=0.021) and truthfulness (OR 8.76, 95% CI 4.15-19.90, p<0.001) of the UK government were independently associated with higher odds of refusing COVID-19 vaccines. Compared to political centrists, conservatives and liberals were respectively more (OR 2.05, 95%CI 1.51-2.80, p<0.001) and less (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22-0.41, p<0.001) likely to refuse offered vaccines. Those who were willing to be vaccinated cited both personal and public protection as reasons, with some alluding to having a sense of collective responsibility. Conclusion Dominant narratives of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are misconceived as primarily being driven by misinformation. Key indicators of UK vaccine acceptance include prior behaviours, transparency of the scientific process of vaccine development, mistrust in science and leadership and individual political views. Vaccine programmes should leverage the sense of altruism, citizenship and collective responsibility that motivated many participants to get vaccinated.","Roberts, C. h.; Brindle, H.; Rogers, N.

185720,Laparoscopic castration in a cryptorchid pygmy goat.,2009,"Anemia in salmonid aquaculture is a recognized blood disorder resulting from the reduction of hemoglobin concentration and/or erythrocyte count. Because of sub-optimal oxygen supply to the tissues, as a negative impact of anemia fish will experience reduced growth and poor health. This health challenge may be linked with several factors including anthropogenic changes in the marine environment, infectious etiology (viral, bacterial, and parasitic), nutritional deficiencies, or hemorrhaging. From the mid-late summer of 2017 to 2019, Scottish salmon farming companies began to report the occurrence of anemic events in open-net marine sites. At that time, the industry had little understanding of the pathogenesis and possible mechanisms of anemia and limited the ability to formulate effective mitigation strategies. Clinical examination of fish raised suspicion of anemia and this was confirmed by generating a packed cell volume value by centrifugation of a microhematocrit tube of whole anticoagulated blood. Company health team members, including vets and biologists, reported discoloration of gills and local hemorrhages. This paper reviews various commercially significant cases and lesser-known cases of anemia in cultured salmonid species induced by various biological factors. The current methods available to assess hematology are addressed and some future methods that could be adopted in modern day fish farming are identified. An account of the most recent anemic event in Scottish farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is presented and discussed as a case study from information provided by two major Scottish salmon producers. The percent of total marine sites (n = 80) included in this case study, that reported with suspected or clinical anemia covering the period mid-late summer 2017 to 2019, was between 1 and 13%. The findings from this case study suggest that anemia experienced in most cases was regenerative and most likely linked to blood loss from the gills. • Anemia outbreaks identified in 1–13% of Scottish Atlantic salmon farms surveyed mid-late summer 2017 to 2019. • In most cases, anemia was regenerative and likely linked to blood loss via the gills. • Anemia is most likely associated with microhemorrhages identified on the gills and liver. • Routine hematology required for fish health monitoring and the development of automated analyzers is required.

187369,Consensus statement of the consortium for LESS cholecystectomy.,2012,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The common cold is a clinical syndrome triggered by a variety of viral pathogens, but rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause. Complications of such infections include sinusitis, otitis media, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. There is growing interest in host innate defence responses that may regulate the severity of viral responses. We will review recent evidence that nitric oxide is an important contributor to the host response during colds. RECENT FINDINGS Infection of human airway epithelial cells with human rhinovirus has been shown to lead to the increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase both in vitro and in vivo. This increase in epithelial inducible nitric oxide synthase correlates with increased levels of nitric oxide in exhaled air. Importantly, nitric oxide can inhibit human rhinovirus-induced epithelial expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and can inhibit viral replication in epithelial cells in vitro. Moreover, nitric oxide can modulate several signal transduction pathways that are associated with cytokine generation. Nitric oxide can also nitrosylate viral proteases and can interact with the immune system. Consistent with these observations, pilot studies have indicated that the increased generation of nitric oxide during rhinovirus infections is associated with fewer symptoms and more rapid viral clearance. SUMMARY Further studies are warranted to evaluate the role of nitric oxide in colds and to determine whether the administration of nitric oxide donor compounds could be a viable therapeutic approach for viral exacerbations of airway diseases.","Proud, David",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643342/,594
187519,A simple technique for knot tying in single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS).,2010,"BACKGROUND Leakage from the staple line is the most serious complication encountered after sleeve gastrectomy, occurring in 2.4% of surgeries. The use of inappropriately sized staplers, because of variability in stomach wall thickness, is a major cause of leakage. OBJECTIVES To measure stomach wall thickness across different stomach zones to identify variables correlating with thickness. METHODS The study comprised 100 patients (52 females). Stomach wall thickness was measured immediately after surgery using a digital caliper at the antrum, body, and fundus. Results were correlated with body mass index (BMI), age, gender, and pre-surgical diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. RESULTS Stomach thickness was found to be 5.1 ± 0.6 mm at the antrum, 4.1 ± 0.6 mm at the body, and 2. 6 ± 0.5 mm at the fundus. No correlation was found between stomach wall thickness and BMI, gender, or co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS Stomach wall thickness increases gradually from the fundus toward the antrum. Application of the correct staple height during sleeve gastrectomy is important and may, theoretically, prevent leaks. Staplers should be chosen according to the thickness of the tissue.","Susmallian, Sergio; Goitein, David; Barnea, Royi; Raziel, Asnat",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28647931/,594

New early warning systems leveraging timely electronic data are emerging, but the public health value of such systems is still largely unknown. Objective To assess the timeliness and accuracy of pharmacy sales data for both respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and to determine its utility in supporting the surveillance of gastrointestinal illness. Methods To assess timeliness, a prospective and retrospective analysis of data feeds was used to compare the chronological characteristics of each data stream. To assess accuracy, Ontario antiviral prescriptions were compared to confirmed cases of influenza and cases of influenza-like-illness (ILI) from August 2009 to January 2015 and Nova Scotia sales of respiratory over-the-counter products (OTC) were compared to laboratory reports of respiratory pathogen detections from January 2014 to March 2015. Enteric outbreak data (2011-2014) from Nova Scotia were compared to sales of gastrointestinal products for the same time period. To assess utility, pharmacy sales of gastrointestinal products were monitored across Canada to detect unusual increases and reports were disseminated to the provinces and territories once a week between December 2014 and March 2015 and then a follow-up evaluation survey of stakeholders was conducted. Results Ontario prescriptions of antivirals between 2009 and 2015 correlated closely with the onset dates and magnitude of confirmed influenza cases. Nova Scotia sales of respiratory OTC products correlated with increases in non-influenza respiratory pathogens in the community. There were no definitive correlations identified between the occurrence of enteric outbreaks and the sales of gastrointestinal OTCs in Nova Scotia. Evaluation of national monitoring showed no significant increases in sales of gastrointestinal products that could be linked to outbreaks that included more than one province or territory. Conclusion Monitoring of pharmacy-based drug prescriptions and OTC sales can provide a timely and accurate complement to traditional respiratory public health surveillance activities but initial evaluation did not show that tracking gastrointestinal-related OTCs were of value in identifying an enteric disease outbreak in more than one province or territory during the study period.","Muchaal, P K; Parker, S; Meganath, K; Landry, L; Aramini, J",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769953/,594

The 3'CSE and the adjoining poly(A) tail of the SIN genome are thought to act as viral promoters for negative-sense RNA synthesis and genome replication. Eight different SIN isolates that carry altered 3'CSEs were studied in detail to evaluate the role of the 3'CSE in genome replication. The salient findings of this study as it applies to SIN infection of BHK cells are as follows: i) the classical 19-nt 3'CSE of the SIN genome is not essential for genome replication, long-term stability, or packaging; ii) compensatory amino acid or nucleotide changes within the SIN genomes are not required to counteract base changes in the 3' terminal motifs of the SIN genome; iii) the 5' 1-kb regions of all SIN genomes, regardless of the differences in 3' terminal motifs, do not undergo any base changes even after 18 passages; iv) although extensive addition of AU-rich motifs occurs in the SIN genomes carrying defective 3'CSE, these are not essential for genome viability or function; and v) the newly added AU-rich motifs are composed predominantly of RSEs. These findings are consistent with the idea that the 3' terminal AU-rich motifs of the SIN genomes do not bind directly to the viral polymerase and that cellular proteins with broad AU-rich binding specificity may mediate this interaction. In addition to the classical 3'CSE, other RNA motifs located elsewhere in the SIN genome must play a major role in template selection by the SIN RNA polymerase.","George, J; Raju, R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11000254/,594

Infected people had shown symptoms resembling pneumonia, but about 50% of patients were asymptomatic. Objective The study intended to examine the data from studies on nCoV-19. Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. The sources of data included bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, Embase, PsychINFO, WanFang Data and PubMed. The search terms were novel Corona Virus, and nCoV-19 structure. Setting The study took place in the main library of the University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan. Results The study identified 22 studies that had reported and confirmed over 2000 cases of nCoV-19 by January 26, 2020. The studies found that the virus was transmitted through respiratory droplets.

190390,Virtual roadshow brings CPD to cattle practitioners.,2020-05-02,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the top three leading causes of death in both men and women. However, screening can help detect and prevent CRC. Multiple guidelines recommend CRC screening using stool-based screening and direct visualization via colonoscopy. Anatomically, women have a longer total colonic length, especially in the transverse colon, which makes it redundant; thus it is more difficult to perform complete endoscopy in women. Women also have a higher risk of developing right-sided colon cancer of the flat and depressed type, which is harder to detect than the other types. Moreover, women are less likely to undergo colonoscopy due to embarrassment, especially when the procedure is performed by male gastroenterologists, and the lack of available female gastroenterologists further complicates the problem. The current COVID-19 pandemic also decreases patients' willingness to undergo screening due to the fear of contracting the COVID-19. Delay in diagnosis leads to more advanced tumors upon detection and ultimately decreases the survival rate, especially in women, as they have lower 1-year survival rate when CRC is detected in its later stages than in men. Innovative options for CRC screening have recently emerged, including colon capsule endoscopy, which can be performed in a clinic and may reduce the need for colonoscopy. However, sex-specific CRC screening guidelines and tools are not available.

191304,Physician mobility in Canada.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND MR CLEAN was the first randomized trial to demonstrate the short-term clinical effectiveness of endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. Several other trials confirmed that endovascular treatment improves clinical outcome at three months. However, limited data are available on long-term clinical outcome. We aimed to estimate the effect of endovascular treatment on functional outcome at two-year follow-up in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Secondly, we aimed to assess the effect of endovascular treatment on major vascular events and mortality during two years of follow-up. METHODS MR CLEAN is a multicenter clinical trial with randomized treatment allocation, open-label treatment, and blinded endpoint evaluation. Patients included were 18 years or older with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proven anterior proximal artery occlusion who could be treated within six hours after stroke onset. The intervention contrast was endovascular treatment and usual care versus no endovascular treatment and usual care. The current study extended the follow-up duration from three months to two years. The primary outcome is the score on the modified Rankin scale at two years. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality and the occurrence of major vascular events within two years of follow-up. DISCUSSION The results of our study provide information on the long-term clinical effectiveness of endovascular treatment, which may have implications for individual treatment decisions and estimates of cost-effectiveness.

192518,Effects of journey and lairage time on steers transported to slaughter in Chile.,2003,"We have cloned, sequenced and expressed the spike (S) gene of canine coronavirus (CCV; strain K378). Its deduced amino acid sequence has revealed features in common with other coronavirus S proteins: a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the amino terminus (the putative signal sequence), another hydrophobic region at the carboxy terminus (the membrane anchor), heptad repeats preceding the anchor, and a cysteine-rich region located just downstream from it. Like other representatives of the same antigenic cluster (CCV-Insavc-1 strain, feline infectious peritonitis and enteric coronaviruses, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and respiratory coronaviruses, and the human coronavirus HCV 229E), the CCV S polypeptide lacks a proteolytic cleavage site present in many other coronavirus S proteins. Pairwise comparisons of the S amino acid sequences within the antigenic cluster demonstrated that the two CCV strains (K378 and Insavc-1) are 93.3% identical, about as similar to each other as they are to the two feline coronaviruses. The porcine sequences are clearly more divergent mainly due to the large differences in the amino-terminal (residues 1 to 300) domains of the proteins; when only the carboxy-terminal parts (residues 301 and on) are considered the homologies between the canine, feline and porcine S polypeptides are generally quite high, with identities ranging from 90.8% to 96.8% . The human coronavirus is less related to the other members of the antigenic group. A phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of the S sequences showed that the two CCVs are evolutionarily more related to the feline than to the porcine viruses. Expression of the CCV S gene using the vaccinia virus T7 RNA polymerase system yielded a protein of the expected M(r) (approximately 200K) which could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus polyclonal serum and which was indistinguishable from the S protein synthesized in CCV-infected cells.","Wesseling, J G; Vennema, H; Godeke, G J; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8021609/,594
192993,Robotic Inguinal Hernia Repair: Technique and Early Experience.,2016,"Proteases are involved in the regulation of many biological functions. This study describes a novel method for detecting protease activity by fluorescent zymogram in-gel protease assays, using SDS polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with a peptide-MCA (4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide) substrate. This method allows simultaneous determination of protease cleavage specificity and molecular weight. Trypsin was electrophoresed in SDS polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA, the gel was then incubated in assay buffer, and trypsin cleavage of the peptide-MCA substrate generated fluorescent AMC (7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin), which was subsequently detected under UV transillumination. Chymotrypsin activity was detected in gels copolymerized with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA substrate. Selective detection of these proteases was demonstrated by the absence of trypsin activity in gels containing the chymotrypsin substrate, and the lack of chymotrypsin activity in gels containing the trypsin substrate. Detection of proteolytic activity from secretory vesicles of adrenal medulla (chromaffin granules) was observed with the trypsin substrate, Z-Phe-Arg-MCA, but not with the chymotrypsin substrate. Overall, this sensitive fluorescent zymogram in-gel protease assay method can be used for rapid determination of protease cleavage specificity and enzyme molecular weight in biological samples. This assay should be useful for many research disciplines investigating the role of the many proteases that control cellular functions.","Yasothornsrikul, S; Hook, V Y",BioTechniques,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10868282/,594

194548,The response across Canada: Highlights of the National COVID-19 Survey.,2020-09-01,"Recombination is increasingly seen as an important means of shaping genetic diversity in RNA viruses. However, observed recombination frequencies vary widely among those viruses studied to date, with only sporadic occurrences reported in RNA viruses with negative-sense genomes. To determine the extent of homologous recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses, phylogenetic analyses of 79 gene sequence alignments from 35 negative-sense RNA viruses (a total of 2154 sequences) were carried out. Powerful evidence was found for recombination, in the form of incongruent phylogenetic trees between different gene regions, in only five sequences from Hantaan virus, Mumps virus and Newcastle disease virus. This is the first report of recombination in these viruses. More tentative evidence for recombination, where conflicting phylogenetic trees were observed (but were without strong bootstrap support) and/or where putative recombinant regions were very short, was found in three alignments from La Crosse virus and Puumala virus. Finally, patterns of sequence variation compatible with the action of recombination, but not definitive evidence for this process, were observed in a further ten viruses: Canine distemper virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, Influenza C virus, Lassa virus, Pirital virus, Rabies virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus. The possibility of recombination in these viruses should be investigated further. Overall, this study reveals that rates of homologous recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses are very much lower than those of mutation, with many viruses seemingly clonal on current data. Consequently, recombination rate is unlikely to be a trait that is set by natural selection to create advantageous or purge deleterious mutations.","Chare, Elizabeth R; Gould, Ernest A; Holmes, Edward C",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13679603/,594

This duty reflects the value system of many doctors and the type of typical dedication to their craft that has long been expected and given. The modern doctor, however, may have other additional roles -- such as those of parent, researcher, business person and many others. What about the duties that accompany these other activities and what if these duties come into conflict with the duty to care for patients? How does a doctor decide how far the duty to care for patients extends?

We aim to present the results of the screening program implied after outbreak of COVID-19 in a referral hemodialysis ward. METHODS We started clinical screening and obligatory mask wearing for dialysis patients and personnel on 20-Feb-2020. However 11 symptomatic COVID-19 patients emerged till day +36. On days +39 and +40 a screening program was implied including measurement of SARS-COV-2 PCR and immunoglobulin G and M (IgG/IgM) and chest computerized tomography (CCT) scan. The results of CCT scan, classified according to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) classification; as with very low (grade 1-normal), low, indeterminate, high, and very high likelihood of COVID-19 (grades 2, 3, 4, and 5; respectively), were used for compartmentalization of patients. RESULTS Among 178 patients (68.2% male, mean age = 58.7 ± 16.6 years), 11 got COVID-19 before screening, two of whom died. CCT scans were normal in 71.3% and grade 2, 3, 4, and 5 in 7.9%, 4.5%, 5.6%, and 10.7%; respectively. PCR and IgG and/or IgM were positive in 27 and 32 patients. Eighty-three patients had evidence of COVID-19 infection, who were significantly older (62.2 ± 16.6 vs. 56.1 ± 16.02, P < .05). There was no difference in the rate of infection considering gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and different blood groups. CONCLUSION Asymptomatic SARS- COV 2 infection may affect a large number of dialysis patients. We highly recommend a screening strategy whenever the number of patients is increasing.","Ossareh, Shahrzad; Bagheri, Morteza; Abbasi, Mohsen; Abolfathi, Sara; Bohlooli, Azam",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32943594/,594
196597,Identification of APMV-1 associated with high mortality of collared doves (Streptoelia decaocto) in Italy.,2012,"SP-A and SP-D contribute to host defense against respiratory viral infection. The most extensive body of evidence relates to influenza A viruses (IAV), and evidence from gene-deleted mice also indicate a role for surfactant collectins in defense against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. Some important respiratory pathogens including rhinovirus and metapneumovirus have not yet been examined. Viral pathogens that enter the body via the respiratory tract (e.g., Ebola virus), replicate in the lung (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus or HIV) or infect the lung in immuno-compromised hosts (e.g., herpes simplex virus or HSV) are inhibited by collectins. SP-A and SP-D are expressed in other mucosal surfaces (e.g., the eye or genitourinary tract) where they may play roles in antiviral defense. In addition to direct antiviral activities, the SP-A and SP-D modulate innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation associated with infection. The relative importance of antiviral vs anti-inflammatory effects of SP-A and SP-D in viral infections and the potential use of these collectins as therapeutics for viral infections are under investigation.","Hartshorn, Kevan L",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036966/,594

The statement was met with significant backlash and Mr Morrison promptly rescinded the statement focusing instead on his desire to reach high levels of voluntary vaccine coverage. Nevertheless, interesting legal questions about the possibility of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination arose. This article explores the possible legal frameworks for implementing a mandatory vaccination scheme in Australia as well as the associated ethical dilemmas. Furthermore, it argues that a mandatory vaccination scheme, while possible and arguably ethical, would have undesirable implications resulting in popular opposition and decreased compliance with other voluntary vaccines such as childhood vaccination and seasonal influenza. Consequently, a voluntary scheme based on incentives and transparent provision of information is much more likely to achieve the desired uptake.","Fisher, Madeline Rohini",Journal of law and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369126/,594

MHC I are recognised by two families of receptors: clonotypic T cell receptors expressed on the surface of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and monomorphic receptors expressed by both natural killer cells and CTLs. The production of MHC I molecules within the cells is a sequential process performed with the help of interacting proteins: proteases, chaperones, transporters and so on. Although largely homologous in their structure, organisation and function, the human and mouse MHC I antigen processing and presentation machineries show fine differences. Transgenesis and 'knockout' or 'knock-in' technologies permit the addition of relevant human genes or the replacement of mouse genes by their human orthologues in order to produce immunologically humanised mice. Such experimental animals are especially relevant for the comparative evaluation of immunotherapies and for the characterisation of MHC I peptide epitopes. This review presents the similarities and differences between mouse and human MHC I antigen processing machinery, and describes the development and utilisation of improving mouse models of human cytotoxic T cell immunity.","Pascolo, Steve",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16018738/,594

A mobile phone app records proximity events between app users, and when a user tests positive for COVID-19, their recent contacts can be notified instantly.

Here we investigate the impact of the National Health Service (NHS) COVID-19 app for England and Wales, from its launch on 24 September 2020 to the end of December 2020. It was used regularly by approximately 16.5 million users (28% of the total population), and sent approximately 1.7 million exposure notifications: 4.2 per index case consenting to contact tracing. We estimated that the fraction of individuals notified by the app who subsequently showed symptoms and tested positive (the secondary attack rate (SAR)) was 6%, similar to the SAR for manually traced close contacts. We estimated the number of cases averted by the app using two complementary approaches: modelling based on the notifications and SAR gave an estimate of 284,000 (central 95% range of sensitivity analyses 108,000-450,000), and statistical comparison of matched neighbouring local authorities gave an estimate of 594,000 (95% confidence interval 317,000-914,000). Approximately one case was averted for each case consenting to notification of their contacts. We estimated that for every percentage point increase in app uptake, the number of cases could be reduced by 0.8% (using modelling) or 2.3% (using statistical analysis). These findings support the continued development and deployment of such apps in populations that are awaiting full protection from vaccines.","Wymant, Chris; Ferretti, Luca; Tsallis, Daphne; Charalambides, Marcos; Abeler-Dörner, Lucie; Bonsall, David; Hinch, Robert; Kendall, Michelle; Milsom, Luke; Ayres, Matthew; Holmes, Chris; Briers, Mark; Fraser, Christophe",Nature,,594

The primary aim of the study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on clinical demands including burnout among gastroenterologists within the region. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for burnout and determine regional stressors. METHODS: This was a mixed-methods study. Gastroenterologists were surveyed electronically between September 1 and December 7, 2020, via gastroenterology and endoscopy societies of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) was used to detect burnout. Quantitative data were non-parametric; non-parametric methods were used for statistical comparisons. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for burnout. Content analysis method was used to analyze qualitative data. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 73.0% reported that they were still significantly affected by the pandemic. Of these, 40.5% reported increased workload and 59.5% decreased workload. Statistically significant differences in weekly working hours, endoscopy, and inpatient volumes were present. No differences were observed in outpatient volumes, likely because of telemedicine. Burnout was common; however, 50.1% of gastroenterologists were unaware of or did not have access to mental health support. This, as well as depression, being a trainee, and public sector work, increased burnout risk significantly. CONCLUSION: The effects of the pandemic are multifaceted, and burnout is common among Southeast Asian gastroenterologists.

This study aimed to analyze Twitter content related to the event to determine (1) characteristics of the Twitter users who authored these tweets, (2) the proportion of tweets expressing pro-vaccine compared to anti-vaccine sentiment, and (3) the content of these tweets. METHODS: Data were collected using Twitter's Filtered Streams Interface, and included all publicly available tweets with the ""#DoctorsSpeakUp"" hashtag on March 5, 2020, the day of the event. Two independent coders assessed a 5% subsample of original tweets (n = 966) using a thematic content analysis approach. Cohen's &#954; ranged 0.71-1.00 for all categories. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine associations between tweet sentiment, type of account, and tweet content (personal narrative and/or statement about research or science). Accounts were analyzed for likelihood of being a bot (i.e. automated account) using Botometer. RESULTS: Of 847 (87.7%) relevant tweets, 244 (28.8%) were authored by a Twitter user that identified as a parent and 68 (8.0%) by a user that identified as a health professional. With regard to sentiment, 167 (19.7%) were coded as pro-vaccine and 668 (78.9%) were coded as anti-vaccine. Tweet sentiment was significantly associated with type of account (p < 0.001) and tweet content (p = 0.001). Of the 575 unique users in our dataset, 31 (5.4%) were classified as bots using Botometer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a highly coordinated response of devoted anti-vaccine antagonists in response to the #DoctorsSpeakUp event. These findings can be used to help vaccine advocates leverage social media more effectively to promote vaccines. Specifically, it would be valuable to ensure that pro-vaccine messages consider hashtag use and pre-develop messages that can be launched and promoted by pro-vaccine advocates.","Hoffman, Beth L; Colditz, Jason B; Shensa, Ariel; Wolynn, Riley; Taneja, Sanya Bathla; Felter, Elizabeth M; Wolynn, Todd; Sidani, Jaime E",Vaccine,,594

300612,Age-dependent association between SARS-CoV-2 cases reported by passive surveillance and viral load in wastewater,2021,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many aspects of traditional clinical trials have been affected worldwide. Recruitment of patients and on-site visits have been challenging when not compromised. Many groups have turned to the possibility of replacing their randomized standard of care (SOC) arm with a real-world (RW) external control arm (ECA). Unlike randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have international guidelines, the use of an ECA is not subject to any consensus. Objectives: The aim of this study is to guide the design of an ECA (when it is justified or recommended) from different context and data sources. Methods: We propose to summarize the evidence into a decisional matrix. We crossed popular data sources (RW data collected prospectively, RW data obtained from retrospective chart review, administrative or insurance data, and clinical trial data) with situations where the use of an ECA could be justified or beneficial (regulatory submission, health economics and outcomes research [HEOR] investigation, hypothesis generation). Our reflection was influenced by our consulting practice at Evidera and by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines on the use of RW data. We developed a framework that should help researchers to build a quality ECA. Building an ECA should be based on a clear research question that will inform: (1) design and data source(s) to be used;(2) selection of control that will limit biases;and (3) adjustment methods that allow fair comparison with the treated arm. Results: Good ECAs would have a clear and accepted SOC treatment (limited changes in medical practice), standardized variables and definitions, similar outcome evaluations, and validity of the variables. Conclusions: When it comes to ECA, there is no one size fits all solution. The ECA should not replace RCTs but be considered as a complement tool to provide additional evidence to medical research.","Ladouceur, M.; Colby, C.; Okala, S.; Yue, B.",Value in Health,,594

A comprehensive search was started in June up to 18 July, 2020 in many databases, including PubMed, Embase, and others. Of 432 studies found, only six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, which includes: clinical trials, age more than 12 years with nonsevere COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine is the intervention beyond the usual care. Data extraction and bias risk assessment were done by two independent authors. Both fixed-effect and random-effect models were utilized for pooling data using risk difference as a summary measure. The primary outcomes are clinical and radiological COVID-19 progression, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 clearance in the pharyngeal swab, and mortality. The secondary outcomes are the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine. Among 609 COVID-19 confirmed patients obtained from pooling six studies, 294 patients received hydroxychloroquine and 315 patients served as a control. Hydroxychloroquine significantly prevents early radiological progression relative to control with risk difference and 95% confidence interval of -0.2 (-0.36 to -0.03). On the other hand, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent clinical COVID-19 progression, reduce 5-day mortality, or enhance viral clearance on days 5, 6, and 7. Moreover, many adverse effects were reported with hydroxychloroquine therapy. Failure of hydroxychloroquine to show viral clearance or clinical benefits with additional adverse effects outweigh its protective effect from radiological progression in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. Benefit-risk balance should determine the hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19.","Elsawah, Hozaifa Khalil; Elsokary, Mohamed Ahmed; Elrazzaz, Mahmoud Gamal; Elshafie, Ahmed Hanei",J. med. virol,,594

AIMS OF THE STUDY: The aims were to outline changes in neurologists' experience when providing care for patients with epilepsy (PWE) and to investigate how neurologists perceive telehealth and vaccination. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey among members of the Lithuanian Association of Neurology. RESULTS: We received 104 completed forms by adult (74, 71.15%) and pediatric neurologists (30, 28.85%). A decrease in epilepsy consultations was noted by 76 (73.1%) specialists, and up to 26 (25.0%) could not provide diagnostic tests at a usual rate. Most respondents (99, 95.2%) would recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for patients at risk. Telehealth was valued as a useful tool in epilepsy care, especially if combined with timely diagnostic and treatment options (Kruskal-Wallis chi-square = 10.392, p = .034 and F[4,99] = 3.125, p = .018, respectively). According to 85 (81.7%) respondents, video calls could substitute in-person visits in at least half of all consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite disrupted epilepsy care, neurologists may benefit from telehealth when providing services for PWE and become vaccination advocates to mitigate the spread of preventable infections.","Puteikis, Kristijonas; Mameniskiene, Ruta",Acta Neurol Scand,,594

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims. COVID-19 has already provided examples of both clearly planned event cancellations such as the Umrah suspension in KSA, and where outbreaks and events were continued.","Ebrahim, Shahul H; Memish, Ziad A",Travel Med Infect Dis,,594

We loaded hNPs with a 7-mer peptide nucleic acid (PNA) previously considered for its ability to modulate the post-transcriptional regulation of the CFTR gene. We also investigated the in vitro release kinetics of hNPs and their efficacy in PNA delivery across the human epithelial airway barrier using an ex vivo model based on human primary nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) from CF patients. Confocal analyses and hNPs transport assay demonstrated the ability of hNPs to overcome the mucus barrier and release their PNA cargo within the cytoplasm, where it can exert its biological function.","Comegna, Marika; Conte, Gemma; Falanga, Andrea Patrizia; Marzano, Maria; Cernera, Gustavo; Di Lullo, Antonella Miriam; Amato, Felice; Borbone, Nicola; D039,; Errico, Stefano; Ungaro, Francesca; d039,; Angelo, Ivana; Oliviero, Giorgia; Castaldo, Giuseppe",Sci Rep,,594

Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients. Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV. After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation. However, having all the information about the outbreakof the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19. A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 in different tissues . In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system have been discussed. It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19. In conclusion, this review may provide useful information in developing some promising strategies to end up with a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We have identified clinical or biological characteristics to help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other RVs. METHODS: We used a prospective cohort including all consecutive patients admitted through the emergency department's (ED) and presenting respiratory symptoms from November 2019 to April 2020. Patients were tested for RV using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: 203/508 patients were positive for an RV during the non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period (November to February), and 268/596 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (March to April). Younger age, male gender, fever, absence of expectoration and absence of chronic lung disease were statistically associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection. Combining these variables allowed for the distinguishing of SARS-CoV-2 infections with 83, 65, 75 and 76% sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients' characteristics associated with a positive PCR are common between SARS-CoV-2 and other RVs, but a simple discrimination of strong SARS-CoV-2 suspicion with a limited set of clinical features seems possible. Such scoring could be useful but has to be prospectively evaluated and will not eliminate the need for rapid PCR assays.","Bouzid, Donia; Mullaert, Jimmy; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Laurent, Odile; Duval, Xavier; Lescure, Xavier; Timsit, Jean-François; Descamps, Diane; Montravers, Philippe; Choquet, Christophe; Lucet, Jean-Christophe; Casalino, Enrique; Visseaux, Benoit",PLoS One,,594

Further study is necessary to better diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. CASE REPORT We describe the case of an 8-year-old boy admitted with status epilepticus, who also tested positive for COVID-19, while afebrile, with no initial respiratory symptoms. Benzodiazepines were given per treatment guidelines, abating the seizure activity. He subsequently developed respiratory distress and desaturation requiring temporary emergent intubation. All clinical symptoms resolved within a few hours. Results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain were within normal limits. Results of a 24-h electroencephalogram (EEG) were abnormal, indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction. As a result of intubation and findings of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, a COVID-19 test was administered and the result was positive.

In the control group, eggs were incubated in minimal broth. The number of L1 larvae was ascertained. Each treatment consisted of four repetitions and the experiment was repeated five times. It was observed that the effect of FE and MCE of P. lilacinum and T. virens on egg hatchability differed from that of the control group. MCE of T. virens and P. lilacinum showed higher ovicidal activity than FE over both periods and at 48 hours of exposure, respectively. From the percentage reductions in hatchability of the eggs, MCE was shown to be superior to FE for both fungi.

Despite the great efforts that have been made in this field since the appearance of COVID-19 (2019), the field still suffers from two drawbacks. First, the number of available X-ray scans labeled as COVID-19-infected is relatively small. Second, all the works that have been carried out in the field are separate; there are no unified data, classes, and evaluation protocols. In this work, based on public and newly collected data, we propose two X-ray COVID-19 databases, which are three-class COVID-19 and five-class COVID-19 datasets. For both databases, we evaluate different deep learning architectures. Moreover, we propose an Ensemble-CNNs approach which outperforms the deep learning architectures and shows promising results in both databases. In other words, our proposed Ensemble-CNNs achieved a high performance in the recognition of COVID-19 infection, resulting in accuracies of 100% and 98.1% in the three-class and five-class scenarios, respectively. In addition, our approach achieved promising results in the overall recognition accuracy of 75.23% and 81.0% for the three-class and five-class scenarios, respectively.

450465,Structure and stability of DPPE planar bilayers,2007,"Oculo-centric factors may provide a key to understanding invasion success by SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious, potentially lethal, virus with ocular tropism. Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis. The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact. The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.","Coroneo, Minas Theodore",Ocular surf,,594

The safety of abortion provision using telehealth has been established in several contexts including the United States and Australia. The importance of hotlines and other support systems that use technology to provide information and support to clients through their abortion is also highlighted in the literature. Several countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, and Pakistan are now allowing the use of technology for abortion/post-abortion care in light of the pandemic; however, India's telemedicine guidelines do not include abortion. In a country where the majority of abortions take place outside the health system, allowing the use of telemedicine for abortion can help bring legality to users, and expand access to those facing additional barriers in accessing the care they deserve.

However, its long-term effects on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes are unknown. METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 5734 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes in a 1:1 ratio to receive finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, and diabetic retinopathy, or they had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of 25 to less than 75 ml per minute per 1.73 m2. All the patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer's label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary composite outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was kidney failure, a sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes. The key secondary composite outcome, also assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, a primary outcome event occurred in 504 of 2833 patients (17.8%) in the finerenone group and 600 of 2841 patients (21.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.93; P = 0.001). A key secondary outcome event occurred in 367 patients (13.0%) and 420 patients (14.8%) in the respective groups (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03). Overall, the frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia-related discontinuation of the trial regimen was higher with finerenone than with placebo (2.3% and 0.9%, respectively).

In this note, we investigate how socioeconomic and demographic factors affected individuals awareness on the methods for controlling/preventing the spread of COVID-19 in some parts of Africa at the onset of the pandemic. RESULTS: Based on regression modelling, we find that having full awareness does not depend on religious affiliation. Men, urban dwelling, holding bachelors or higher degrees, operating multiple social media accounts or being employed are associated with having full awareness of the recommended practices for the prevention and control of COVID-19 at the early stage of the pandemic. No occupation, business or older people are associated with not having full awareness.

598703,VAPiD: a lightweight cross platform viral annotation pipeline and identification tool to facilitate virus genome submissions to NCBI GenBank,2018-09-18,"Eye tracking is a useful tool for studying human cognition, both in the laboratory and in real-world applications. However, there are cases in which eye tracking is not possible, such as in high-security environments where recording devices cannot be introduced. After facing this challenge in our own work, we sought to test the effectiveness of using artificial foveation as an alternative to eye tracking for studying visual search performance. Two groups of participants completed the same list comparison task, which was a computer-based task designed to mimic an inventory verification process that is commonly performed by international nuclear safeguards inspectors. We manipulated the way in which the items on the inventory list were ordered and color coded. For the eye tracking group, an eye tracker was used to assess the order in which participants viewed the items and the number of fixations per trial in each list condition. For the artificial foveation group, the items were covered with a blurry mask except when participants moused over them. We tracked the order in which participants viewed the items by moving their mouse and the number of items viewed per trial in each list condition. We observed the same overall pattern of performance for the various list display conditions, regardless of the method. However, participants were much slower to complete the task when using artificial foveation and had more variability in their accuracy. Our results indicate that the artificial foveation method can reveal the same pattern of differences across conditions as eye tracking, but it can also impact participants’ task performance.

610966,Sunlight ultraviolet radiation dose is negatively correlated with the percent positive of SARS-CoV-2 and four others common human coronaviruses in the U.S.,2020-08-19,"Cystoisosporosis is a leading diarrheal disease in suckling piglets. With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health. In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth. Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369. In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively. BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40 nM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (>95%) at 200 nM. Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200 nM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10 mg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains. The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7 μM during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug. Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis. For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies.","Shrestha, Aruna; Ojo, Kayode K.; Koston, Florian; Ruttkowski, Bärbel; Vidadala, Rama S.R.; Dorr, Carlie S.; Navaluna, Edelmar D.; Whitman, Grant R.; Barrett, Kayleigh F.; Barrett, Lynn K.; Hulverson, Matthew A.; Choi, Ryan; Michaels, Samantha A.; Maly, Dustin J.; Hemphill, Andrew; Van Voorhis, Wesley C.; Joachim, Anja",Int J Parasitol Drugs Drug Resist,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211320719300454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959327/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211320719300454; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2019.03.004,594

Nevertheless, there is still much to know. Understanding its mechanisms and its potential usefulness in airway infections and its prevention, asthma both Th2 and non Th2 type, bronchiectasis, as adjuvant in vaccination and in allergen immunotherapy still remains to clearly unveil. The aim of this paper was to provide a useful updated review of the role of the main available immunostimulants, giving particular focus on Pidotimod use and its potentials utility in respiratory diseases. Pidotimod showed its usefulness in reducing need for antibiotics in airway infections, increasing the level of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) and T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+) endowed with immunomodulatory activity that affect both innate and adaptive immune responses. Higher expression of TLR2 and of HLA-DR molecules, induction of dendritic cell maturation and release of pro-inflammatory molecules, stimulation of T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation toward a Th1 phenotype, as well as an increase of the phagocytosis have been demonstrated to be associated with Pidotimod in in vitro studies. All these activities are potentially useful for several respiratory conditions such as asthma, COPD, and recurrent respiratory tract infections.","Puggioni, Francesca; Alves-Correia, Magna; Mohamed, Manar-Farouk; Stomeo, Niccolò; Mager, Riccardo; Marinoni, Massimiliano; Racca, Francesca; Paoletti, Giovanni; Varricchi, Gilda; Giorgis, Veronica; Melioli, Giovanni; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Heffler, Enrico",Multidiscip Respir Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31700623/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40248-019-0195-2,594

632437,Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Repair of Post-Hysterectomy Vesicovaginal Fistula Using Omental Interposition Flap,2020-12-31,"Toscana phlebovirus (TOSV) and Sicilian phlebovirus (SFSV) are endemic in the Mediterranean area where they are transmitted to humans by infected sandflies. Vertebrates of several species have been postulated to act as reservoirs of these viruses, but convincing evidence is still awaited. Among them, bats have been suggested, however documented evidence is lacking. Here we tested a total of 329 bats belonging to eight species collected from twelve localities in southern Spain for the presence of neutralizing antibodies specific to TOSV and SFSV. Positive sera were detected in Schreiber’s long-fingered bat (Miniopterus schreibersii), mouse-eared Myotis (Myotis myotis), European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis), and common serotine (Eptesicus serotinus) with the latter showing the highest prevalence rates for SFSV (22.6%) and TOSV (10%). There was no difference between females and males. Results suggest that bats are not likely to play a major role in the natural cycle of these two sandfly-borne phleboviruses. However, large breeding colonies of bats can be used as sentinels for surveillance of the presence of such viruses in a given locality. In addition, capture–recapture studies should be initiated in order to understand better the dynamics of TOSV and SFSV in bat populations.","Ayhan, Nazli; López-Roig, Marc; Monastiri, Abir; Charrel, Remi N.; Serra-Cobo, Jordi",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13010088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440618/,594

These restrictions, however, may have negative psychological consequences as people are restricted in their social and leisure activities and facing daily life stressors. Investigating the relationship between how people are remembering pandemic events and thinking about their futures is important in order to begin to examine the psychological consequences – cognitive and emotional – of the Covid-19 pandemic. The present study examined how characteristics of past and future thinking relate to psychological wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic. In an online questionnaire study, 904 participants in Germany and the USA recalled and predicted negative and positive events related to the pandemic. Participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring cognitions and psychological symptoms. Participants’ current psychological wellbeing related to how they remembered events and thought of their future. Participants reported a greater sense of reliving for past compared to future events. However, future events were more rehearsed than past events. Additionally, the emotional impact of positive and negative events differed for the past and the future. Participants seem to be strongly future oriented during the Covid-19 pandemic, but have a negative view of future events.","Niziurski, Julie A.; Schaper, Marie Luisa",Curr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01969-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149267/,594
688812,Preoperative Predictive Score of Ovarian Torsion in Pregnancy,2020-12-31,"COVID-19, a viral infection originated from Wuhan, China has spread across the world and it has currently affected over 115 million people. Although vaccination process has already started, reaching sufficient availability will take time. Considering the impact of this widespread disease, many research attempts have been made by the computer scientists to screen the COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays (CXRs) or Computed Tomography (CT) scans. To this end, we have proposed GraphCovidNet, a Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN) based model which is used to detect COVID-19 from CT-scans and CXRs of the affected patients. Our proposed model only accepts input data in the form of graph as we follow a GIN based architecture. Initially, pre-processing is performed to convert an image data into an undirected graph to consider only the edges instead of the whole image. Our proposed GraphCovidNet model is evaluated on four standard datasets: SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan dataset, COVID-CT dataset, combination of covid-chestxray-dataset, Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset and CMSC-678-ML-Project dataset. The model shows an impressive accuracy of 99% for all the datasets and its prediction capability becomes 100% accurate for the binary classification problem of detecting COVID-19 scans.
