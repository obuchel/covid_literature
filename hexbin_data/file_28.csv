34,34,34,The 'polysemous' codon--a codon with multiple amino acid assignment caused by dual specificity of tRNA identity.,11.904846,3.4622447,1997-03-03,"In some Candida species, the universal CUG leucine codon is translated as serine. However, in most cases, the serine tRNAs responsible for this non-universal decoding (tRNA(Ser)CAG) accept in vitro not only serine, but also, to some extent, leucine. Nucleotide replacement experiments indicated that m1G37 is critical for leucylation activity. This finding was supported by the fact that the tRNA(Ser)CAGs possessing the leucylation activity always have m1G37, whereas that of Candida cylindracea, which possesses no leucylation activity, has A37. Quantification of defined aminoacetylated tRNAs in cells demonstrated that 3% of the tRNA(Ser)CAGs possessing m1G37 were, in fact, charged with leucine in vivo. A genetic approach using an auxotroph mutant of C.maltosa possessing this type of tRNA(Ser)CAG also suggested that the URA3 gene inactivated due to the translation of CUG as serine was rescued by a slight incorporation of leucine into the polypeptide, which demonstrated that the tRNA charged with multiple amino acids could participate in the translation. These findings provide the first evidence that two distinct amino acids are assigned by a single codon, which occurs naturally in the translation process of certain Candida species. We term this novel type of codon a 'polysemous codon'.","Suzuki, T; Ueda, T; Watanabe, K",EMBO J,28,1
611,611,611,The Failure of R (0),12.373307,3.1578856,2011-08-16,"The basic reproductive ratio, R (0), is one of the fundamental concepts in mathematical biology. It is a threshold parameter, intended to quantify the spread of disease by estimating the average number of secondary infections in a wholly susceptible population, giving an indication of the invasion strength of an epidemic: if R (0) < 1, the disease dies out, whereas if R (0) > 1, the disease persists. R (0) has been widely used as a measure of disease strength to estimate the effectiveness of control measures and to form the backbone of disease-management policy. However, in almost every aspect that matters, R (0) is flawed. Diseases can persist with R (0) < 1, while diseases with R (0) > 1 can die out. We show that the same model of malaria gives many different values of R (0), depending on the method used, with the sole common property that they have a threshold at 1. We also survey estimated values of R (0) for a variety of diseases, and examine some of the alternatives that have been proposed. If R (0) is to be used, it must be accompanied by caveats about the method of calculation, underlying model assumptions and evidence that it is actually a threshold. Otherwise, the concept is meaningless.","Li, Jing; Blakeley, Daniel; Smith?, Robert J.",Comput Math Methods Med,28,22
3288,3288,3288,A Note on the Risk of Infections Invading Unaffected Regions,12.226891,3.149603,2018-07-04,"We present two probabilistic models to estimate the risk of introducing infectious diseases into previously unaffected countries/regions by infective travellers. We analyse two distinct situations, one dealing with a directly transmitted infection (measles in Italy in 2017) and one dealing with a vector-borne infection (Zika virus in Rio de Janeiro, which may happen in the future). To calculate the risk in the first scenario, we used a simple, nonhomogeneous birth process. The second model proposed in this paper provides a way to calculate the probability that local mosquitoes become infected by the arrival of a single infective traveller during his/her infectiousness period. The result of the risk of measles invasion of Italy was of 93% and the result of the risk of Zika virus invasion of Rio de Janeiro was of 22%.","Amaku, Marcos; Coutinho, Francisco Antonio Bezerra; Armstrong, Margaret; Massad, Eduardo",Comput Math Methods Med,28,22
3829,3829,3829,Weekly ILI patient ratio change prediction using news articles with support vector machine,12.391989,3.39871,2019-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Influenza continues to pose a serious threat to human health worldwide. For this reason, detecting influenza infection patterns is critical. However, as the epidemic spread of influenza occurs sporadically and rapidly, it is not easy to estimate the future variance of influenza virus infection. Furthermore, accumulating influenza related data is not easy, because the type of data that is associated with influenza is very limited. For these reasons, identifying useful data and building a prediction model with these data are necessary steps toward predicting if the number of patients will increase or decrease. On the Internet, numerous press releases are published every day that reflect currently pending issues. RESULTS: In this research, we collected Internet articles related to infectious diseases from the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), which is maintained the by Hong Kong Department of Health, to see if news text data could be used to predict the spread of influenza. In total, 7769 articles related to infectious diseases published from 2004 January to 2018 January were collected. We evaluated the predictive ability of article text data from the period of 2013–2018 for each of the weekly time horizons. The support vector machine (SVM) model was used for prediction in order to examine the use of information embedded in the web articles and detect the pattern of influenza spread variance. The prediction result using news text data with SVM exhibited a mean accuracy of 86.7 % on predicting whether weekly ILI patient ratio would increase or decrease, and a root mean square error of 0.611 on estimating the weekly ILI patient ratio. CONCLUSIONS: In order to remedy the problems of conventional data, using news articles can be a suitable choice, because they can help estimate if ILI patient ratio will increase or decrease as well as how many patients will be affected, as shown in the result of research. Thus, advancements in research on using news articles for influenza prediction should continue to be pursed, as the result showed acceptable performance as compared to existing influenza prediction researches.","Kim, Juhyeon; Ahn, Insung",BMC Bioinformatics,28,1
4064,4064,4064,Development of a Single Leg Knee Exoskeleton and Sensing Knee Center of Rotation Change for Intention Detection,12.153342,3.0563776,2019-09-13,"In this study, we developed a single leg knee joint assistance robot. Commonly used exoskeletons have a left-right pair, but when only one leg of the wearer is uncomfortable, it is effective to wear the exoskeleton on only the uncomfortable leg. The designed exoskeleton uses a lightweight material and uses a wire-driven actuator, which reduces the weight of the driving section that is attached on the knee directly. Therefore, proposed exoskeleton reduces the force of inertia that the wearer experiences. In addition, the lower frame length of the exoskeleton can be changed to align with the complex movement of the knee. Furthermore, the length between the knee center of rotation and the ankle (LBKA) is measured by using this structure, and the LBKA values are used as the data for intention detection. These value helps to detect the intention because it changes faster than a motor encoder value. A neural network was trained using the motor encoder values, and LBKA values. Neural network detects the intention of three motions (stair ascending, stair descending, and walking), Training results showed that intention detection was good in various environments.","Moon, Dae-Hoon; Kim, Donghan; Hong, Young-Dae",Sensors (Basel),28,1

In viral diseases for which specific treatment is available, real-time PCR assays are reliable diagnostic tools for timely initiation of appropriate therapy and for rapid assessment of the efficacy of antiviral treatment strategies. A retrospective review of samples from a group of seven adult cord blood stem cell recipients was made. Serum samples taken up to 180 days after transplantation were examined with quantitative real-time PCR for measurement of viral load (CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was detected in samples taken from four patients (57%) in the period of 20–80 days after transplantation. Products of amplification of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA were found in samples taken between days 25 and 37 following UCBT from only one patient (14%). On the other hand, the majority of patients (n = 6, 86%) had HHV-7 DNA detected in the period 15–58 days after transplantation. Co-infection with HHV-7 was demonstrated at onset of all episodes of microbiologically confirmed CMV or HHV-6 infection. Our observations indicate that real-time PCR is not only useful for monitoring herpesviral infections in transplant recipients, but is also a powerful method for clarifying the relationships between the viral load and clinical symptoms. Further investigation with a much larger group of patients will be needed to confirm these observations and translate them into a clinical approach.","Dzieciątkowski, Tomasz; Przybylski, Maciej; Basak, Grzegorz Władysław; Torosian, Tigran; Tomaszewska, Agnieszka; Jędrzejczak, Wiesław Wiktor; Młynarczyk, Grażyna",Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),28,1

While Indian estimates are not available, western PICUs report incidence of 6–8%. The common nosocomial infections in PICU are bloodstream infections (20–30% of all infections), lower respiratory tract infections (20–35%), and urinary tract infections (15–20%); there may be some differences in their incidence in different PICUs. The risk of nosocomial infections depends on the host characteristics, the number of interventions, invasive procedures, asepsis of techniques, the duration of stay in the PICU and inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Most often the child had endogenous flora, which may be altered because of hospitalization, are responsible for the infections. The common pathogens involved areStaphylococcus aureus, coagulase negativestaphylococci, E. coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, enterococci, andCandida. Nosocomial pneumonias predominantly occur in mechanically ventilated children. There is no consensus on the optimal approach for their diagnosis. Bloodstream infections are usually attributable to the use of central venous lines; use of TPN and use of femoral site for insertion increase the risk. Urinary tract infections occur mostly after catheterization and can lead to secondary bacteremia. The diagnostic criteria have been discussed in the review. With proper preventive strategies, the nosocomial infection rates can be reduced by up to 50%; handwashing, judicious use of interventions, and proper asepsis during procedures remain the most important practices.","Lodha, Rakesh; Chandra, Uma; Natchu, Mouli; Nanda, Mrinal; Kabra, S.

Gerontologic investigations can be compromised when the differences observed when comparing young and old animals are actually differences between normal and disease states. It is of critical interest to know the pathology of the animals being studied and to understand the impact of these disease processes on the parameters being measured. The incidence and average age of occurrence for lesions have been characterized and are reported here for one inbred (Brown Norway) and two hybrid strains (Brown Norway × Fischer 344 and Fischer 344 × Brown Norway) of rat. Total lesion incidence functions as a biomarker of aging for all of the strains examined (p ≤ .00001). These three genotypes have significantly lower incidence of several major pathologic processes (including glomerulonephritis, retinal atrophy, and leukemia) than do the Fischer 344 and the Wistar rats, two commonly utilized strains. Additionally, the BN and F344 × BN F(1) hybrid attain 50% mortality at 130 and 146 weeks of age, respectively, which is significantly greater than the 103 weeks for the F344 rat.

In this study, we investigated the effects of extracts of Broussonetia papyrifera root bark (PRE) and its bioactive components on inflammation and insulin sensitivity. PRE inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in the NF-κB luciferase assay and pro-inflammatory genes’ expression by blocking phosphorylation of IκB and NF-κB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were mediated by activating AMPK. Ten-week-high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL6 male mice treated with PRE had improved glucose intolerance and decreased inflammation in adipose tissue, as indicated by reductions in NF-κB phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory genes’ expression. Furthermore, PRE activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduced lipogenic genes’ expression in both adipose tissue and liver. Finally, we identified broussoflavonol B (BF) and kazinol J (KJ) as bioactive constituents to suppress pro-inflammatory responses via activating AMPK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, these results indicate the therapeutic potential of PRE, especially BF or KJ, in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.","Lee, Jae Min; Choi, Sun Sil; Park, Mi Hyeon; Jang, Hyunduk; Lee, Yo Han; Khim, Keon Woo; Oh, Sei Ryang; Park, Jiyoung; Ryu, Hyung Won; Choi, Jang Hyun",Nutrients,28,22

We consider the case in which the nodes in the network change their links due to social mixing dynamics as well as in response to the disease. The model shows the behavior that, as we increase social mixing, disease spread is inhibited in certain cases, while in other cases it is enhanced. We also extend this dynamic network model to take into account the case of hidden infection. Here we find that, as expected, the disease spreads more readily if there is a time period after contracting the disease during which an individual is infective but is not known to have the disease.","Chauhan, Sanjeev Kumar",Phys Rev E,28,1

In this model of time-varying networks, each node is described by two variables: activity and attractiveness. The first describes the propensity to form connections, while the second defines the propensity to attract them. We derive analytically the epidemic threshold considering the time scale driving the evolution of contacts and the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the contagion process. In particular, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between activity and attractiveness hamper the spreading. The results presented contribute to the understanding of the dynamical properties of time-varying networks and their effects on contagion phenomena unfolding on their fabric.","Pozzana, Iacopo; Sun, Kaiyuan; Perra, Nicola",Phys Rev E,28,1

PFI was categorised as low (PFI < 1.0), intermediate (1.0 ≤ PFI ≤ 2.5), or high (PFI > 2.5). The correlation between SpO(2) and SaO(2) was studied using Pearson’s correlation. The Bland–Altman plot was used to analyse the agreement between SpO(2) and SaO(2). Furthermore, the correlation between the (SpO(2)–SaO(2)) difference and PFI was assessed. The level of (dis)agreement was calculated for the three PFI categories separately. Overall, 281 patients and 1281 data points were analysed. There was a significant correlation between SaO(2) and SpO(2) (r = 0.69, p < 0.01). The Bland–Altman analysis revealed a mean difference between SaO(2) and SpO(2) of 0.2% with limits of agreement of ± 6% (SD ± 2%). The correlation between the PFI and the (SpO(2)–SaO(2)) difference was low; the (SpO(2)–SaO(2)) difference improved only marginally with higher PFI values. The accuracy of pulse oximetry for estimating arterial oxygenation was moderate and improved little with increasing PFI values. Thus, the additive value of PFI in clinical decision making is limited.

In this study, we used the model Saccharomyces cerevisiae to unravel new elements accounting for oleandrin toxicity. Using cells expressing the Ca(2+)-sensitive photoprotein aequorin, we found that oleandrin exposure resulted in Ca(2+) influx into the cytosol and that failing to pump Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the vacuole increased oleandrin toxicity. We also found that oleandrin exposure induced Mn(2+) accumulation by yeast cells via the plasma membrane Smf1 and that mutants with defects in Mn(2+) homeostasis are oleandrin-hypersensitive.

Using a statistically validated predictive model that was built on a representative sample of 717 laboratory-confirmed cases of DENV infection, direct costs, due to care-related expenditures, were estimated by applying the predictive equation to national data. However, indirect costs, which are due to productivity loss, were estimated using the human capital model based on gross domestic product adjusted for invalidity duration. Further, under-reporting was adjusted by using an expansion factor EF = 3. We observed highest estimated costs in 2016 with over US$168.5 Million total costs, including direct (US$29.0 Million) and indirect (US$139.5 Million) costs, for a total 4415 confirmed cases.

Upon virus entry, HA is triggered by low pH and undergoes large structural rearrangements from a prefusion state to a postfusion state. While structures of prefusion state and postfusion state of HA have been reported, the intermediate structures remain elusive. Here, we report two distinct low pH intermediate conformations of the influenza virus HA using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results show that a decrease in pH from 7.8 to 5.2 triggers the release of fusion peptides from the binding pockets and then causes a dramatic conformational change in the central helices, in which the membrane-proximal ends of the central helices unwind to an extended form. Accompanying the conformational changes of the central helices, the stem region of the HA undergoes an anticlockwise rotation of 9.5 degrees and a shift of 15 Å. The HA head, after being stabilized by an antibody, remains unchanged compared to the neutral pH state. Thus, the conformational change of the HA stem region observed in our research is likely to be independent of the HA head. These results provide new insights into the structural transition of HA during virus entry.","Gao, Jingjing; Gui, Miao; Xiang, Ye",PLoS Pathog,28,1

It is hoped that the integration of EO applications in this work can be used to consider EO for future clinical applications.","Aljaafari, Mariam Nasser; AlAli, Asma Obaid; Baqais, Laila; Alqubaisy, Maream; AlAli, Mudhi; Molouki, Aidin; Ong-Abdullah, Janna; Abushelaibi, Aisha; Lai, Kok-Song; Lim, Swee-Hua Erin",Molecules,28,1

However, data of proper quality and of adequate quantity, modeling both good operational conditions as well as abnormal situations throughout the operational lifecycle, are required. Nevertheless, this is difficult to acquire in a non-destructive approach. In this context, this study investigates an approach to enable a transition from preventive maintenance activities, that are scheduled at predetermined time intervals, into predictive ones. In order to enable such approaches in a cyber-physical production system, a deep learning algorithm is used, allowing for maintenance activities to be planned according to the actual operational status of the machine and not in advance. An autoencoder-based methodology is employed for classifying real-world machine and sensor data, into a set of condition-related labels. Real-world data collected from manufacturing operations are used for training and testing a prototype implementation of Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders for estimating the remaining useful life of the monitored equipment. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated in a use case related to a steel industry production process.","Bampoula, Xanthi; Siaterlis, Georgios; Nikolakis, Nikolaos; Alexopoulos, Kosmas",Sensors (Basel),28,1

We analyzed PJP risk stratified by sex, age, comorbidities, and medications using Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: We enrolled 103,117 patients with ARD. PJP risk significantly increased in patients with any ARD and with each individual ARD like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren’s syndrome (SjS), polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and systemic vasculitis. Patients with PM/DM showed prominent risk with incidence rate of 12.47/100,000 patient year (95% confidence interval (CI), 32.16–86.70). In a time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model with comorbidities and medications as covariates, PM/DM, SSc, SLE, and SjS significantly increased adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 5.40, 5.12, 4.09, and 3.64, respectively (95% CI of 2.82–10.35, 2.16–12.13, 2.41–6.95, and 2.06–6.42, respectively). AHR after adjusting for male sex, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), and interstitial lung disease also significantly increased. Use of daily oral steroid dose of >10 mg conferred the highest risk followed by mycophenolate. Use of injected steroids, cyclophosphamide, biological agents, methotrexate, and cyclosporine conferred a significantly higher risk. CONCLUSION: Underlying ARD significantly predisposes patients to PJP, with PM/DM posing the highest threat. In addition to underlying disease, comorbidities and concomitant immunosuppressants are major risks. The strongest risk is recent daily steroid dose of >10 mg. Mycophenolate seems to be a more prominent risk factor than cyclophosphamide.","Hsu, Hui-Ching; Chang, Yu-Sheng; Hou, Tsung-Yun; Chen, Lung-Fang; Hu, Li-Fang; Lin, Tzu-Min; Chiou, Chi-Sheng; Tsai, Kai-Len; Lin, Sheng-Hong; Kuo, Pei-I; Chen, Wei-Sheng; Lin, Yi-Chun; Chen, Jin-Hua; Chang, Chi-Ching",Clin Rheumatol,28,1

This review aimed to summarize the previous data and to address the relative use of ECMO and CPB during lung transplantation. METHODS: The database was searched in PubMed (Medline) using the following keywords: lung transplantation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and cardiopulmonary bypass, for all relevant reports which were written in English and were published between 2000 and 2020. REVIEW: Several reports have revealed that intraoperative use of ECMO is associated with lower blood product transfusion requirements, shorter ventilator support, and shorter length of hospital stay. During recent years, preoperative ECMO has also been used with favorable outcomes as a bridge to lung transplantation in critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ECMO during lung transplantation seems to reduce postoperative complications and improve short-term outcomes, relative to CPB. However, additional data should be collected through large multicenter randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, preoperative ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation appears to provide favorable outcomes, although additional data are also needed from experienced transplant centers.","Ohsumi, Akihiro; Date, Hiroshi",Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,28,1

The osseodensification is a drilling technique that has been proposed to improve the local bone quality and implant stability in poor density alveolar ridges. This technique determines an expansion of the implant site by increasing the density of the adjacent bone. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of the osseodensification technique for implant site preparation through a literature review and meta-analysis. The database electronic research was performed on PubMed (Medline) database for the screening of the scientific papers. A total of 16 articles have been identified suitable for the review and qualitative analysis—11 clinical studies (eight on animals, three on human subjects), four literature reviews, and one case report. The meta-analysis was performed to compare the bone-to-implant contact % (BIC), bone area fraction occupied % (BAFO), and insertion torque of clockwise and counter-clockwise osseodensification procedure in animal studies. The included articles reported a significant increase in the insertion torque of the implants positioned through the osseodensification protocol compared to the conventional drilling technique. Advantages of this new technique are important above all when the patient has a strong missing and/or low quantity of bone tissue. The data collected until the drafting of this paper detect an improvement when the osseodensification has been adopted if compared to the conventional technique. A significant difference in BIC and insertion torque between the clockwise and counter-clockwise osseodensification procedure was reported, with no difference in BAFO measurements between the two approaches. The effectiveness of the present study demonstrated that the osseodensification drilling protocol is a useful technique to obtain increased implant insertion torque and bone to implant contact (BIC) in vivo. Further randomized clinical studies are required to confirm these pieces of evidence in human studies.","Inchingolo, Alessio Danilo; Inchingolo, Angelo Michele; Bordea, Ioana Roxana; Xhajanka, Edit; Romeo, Donato Mario; Romeo, Mario; Zappone, Carlo Maria Felice; Malcangi, Giuseppina; Scarano, Antonio; Lorusso, Felice; Isacco, Ciro Gargiulo; Marinelli, Grazia; Contaldo, Maria; Ballini, Andrea; Inchingolo, Francesco; Dipalma, Gianna",Materials (Basel),28,1

This is a six-year-old girl who presented with shortness of breath and fever and was found to be in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to septic shock secondary to group A streptococcus. The patient was managed using an esophageal balloon manometry for positive end-expiratory pressure titration. She was liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation on day 7 of hospital course. Esophageal balloon manometry guided positive end-expiratory pressure for 103 out of 155 hours of ventilation with no obvious sequelae. Our case shows the feasibility of transpulmonary pressure measurements in pediatric patients.

This study proposed a computerized process of classifying skin disease through deep learning based MobileNet V2 and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The MobileNet V2 model proved to be efficient with a better accuracy that can work on lightweight computational devices. The proposed model is efficient in maintaining stateful information for precise predictions. A grey-level co-occurrence matrix is used for assessing the progress of diseased growth. The performance has been compared against other state-of-the-art models such as Fine-Tuned Neural Networks (FTNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition developed by Visual Geometry Group (VGG), and convolutional neural network architecture that expanded with few changes. The HAM10000 dataset is used and the proposed method has outperformed other methods with more than 85% accuracy. Its robustness in recognizing the affected region much faster with almost 2× lesser computations than the conventional MobileNet model results in minimal computational efforts. Furthermore, a mobile application is designed for instant and proper action. It helps the patient and dermatologists identify the type of disease from the affected region’s image at the initial stage of the skin disease. These findings suggest that the proposed system can help general practitioners efficiently and effectively diagnose skin conditions, thereby reducing further complications and morbidity.","Srinivasu, Parvathaneni Naga; SivaSai, Jalluri Gnana; Ijaz, Muhammad Fazal; Bhoi, Akash Kumar; Kim, Wonjoon; Kang, James Jin",Sensors (Basel),28,1

Although heat sensitivity is a recognized clinical feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, few studies have examined the implications of climate change for patients with this disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals with MS ages 18–64 years in a nationwide United States patient-level commercial and Medicare Advantage claims database from 2003 to 2017. We defined anomalously warm weather as any month in which local average temperatures exceeded the long-term average by ≥1.5°C. We estimated the association between anomalously warm weather and MS-related inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits using generalized log-linear models. From 75,395,334 individuals, we identified 106,225 with MS. The majority were women (76.6%) aged 36–55 years (59.0%). Anomalously warm weather was associated with increased risk for emergency department visits (risk ratio [RR] = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.025–1.063) and inpatient visits (RR = 1.032, 95% CI: 1.010–1.054). There was limited evidence of an association between anomalously warm weather and MS-related outpatient visits (RR = 1.010, 95% CI: 1.005–1.015). Estimates were similar for men and women, strongest among older individuals, and exhibited substantial variation by season, region, and climate zone. Limitations of the present study include the absence of key individual-level measures of socioeconomic position (i.e., race/ethnicity, occupational status, and housing quality) that may determine where individuals live—and therefore the extent of their exposure to anomalously warm weather—as well as their propensity to seek treatment for neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that as global temperatures rise, individuals with MS may represent a particularly susceptible subpopulation, a finding with implications for both healthcare providers and systems.","Elser, Holly; Parks, Robbie M.; Moghavem, Nuriel; Kiang, Mathew V.; Bozinov, Nina; Henderson, Victor W.; Rehkopf, David H.; Casey, Joan A.",PLoS Med,28,1

Although PBVs are mostly found in faecal samples, their detection in blood and respiratory tract samples raises questions concerning their tropism and pathogenicity. We report here PBV detection in wild deer and cattle from southeastern Australia. Through metagenomics, the presence of PBV genogroups I (GI) and II (GII) were detected in deer serum and plasma. Molecular epidemiology studies targeting the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene were performed in a wide range of specimens (serum, faeces, spleen, lung, nasal swabs, and trachea) collected from wild deer and cattle, with PCR amplification obtained in all specimen types except lung and spleen. Our results reveal the predominance of GI and concomitant detection of both genogroups in wild deer and cattle. In concordance with other studies, the detected GI sequences displayed high genetic diversity, however in contrast, GII sequences clustered into three distinct clades. Detection of both genogroups in the upper respiratory tract (trachea and nasal swab) of deer in the present study gives more evidence about the respiratory tract tropism of PBV. Although much remains unknown about the epidemiology and tropism of PBVs, our study suggests a wide distribution of these viruses in southeastern Australia.","Huaman, Jose L.; Pacioni, Carlo; Sarker, Subir; Doyle, Mark; Forsyth, David M.; Pople, Anthony; Hampton, Jordan O.; Carvalho, Teresa G.; Helbig, Karla J.",Viruses,28,1

Married nurses were found to have shorter sleep duration and sleep latency compared to single nurses, and high job stress not only hinders their family life but also causes sleep problems. Depression is a classic negative emotion experienced by married working women who must manage both work and family. This study aims to examine WFC in married female nurses and investigate its predictors, namely depression and sleep quality. A total of 229 married female nurses completed a Google questionnaire link consisting of the Work–Family Conflict Scale, Sleep-Quality Scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, LSD post hoc test, Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and multiple regression using the SPSS/WIN 26.0 program. The average WFC score was 4.84 ± 1.12 (range 1–7); WFC showed a statistical difference according to a stage of the lifecycle (F = 7.12, p = 0.001) and perceived health (F = 12.01, p < 0.001). WFC was low among those in the non-parenthood stage of the lifecycle (β = −0.26, p < 0.001), those with good (β = −0.18, p = 0.011) or moderate perceived health (β = −0.15, p = 0.023), and those without turnover intention (β = −0.13, p = 0.016). On the other hand, WFC was high among those who were extremely dissatisfied with their job (β = 0.16, p = 0.008) and those who had a high level of depression (β = 0.22, p = 0.002); these variables explained 20.2% of WFC (F = 7.663, p < 0.001). Based on these results, subsequent studies should develop and implement coping programs that help reduce WFC and improve depression and sleep quality in married female nurses.","Hwang, Eunhee; Yu, Yeongbin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,28,1

Recent interest in infrequent mutations, in genes that reside in the “long tail” of the mutational distribution, uncovered new genes with significant implications in cancer development. The study of cancer-relevant genes often requires integrative approaches pooling together multiple types of biological data. Network propagation methods demonstrate high efficacy in achieving this integration. Yet, the majority of these methods focus their assessment on detecting known cancer genes or identifying altered subnetworks. In this paper, we introduce a network propagation approach that entirely focuses on prioritizing long tail genes with potential functional impact on cancer development. RESULTS: We identify sets of often overlooked, rarely to moderately mutated genes whose biological interactions significantly propel their mutation-frequency-based rank upwards during propagation in 17 cancer types. We call these sets “upward mobility genes” and hypothesize that their significant rank improvement indicates functional importance. We report new cancer-pathway associations based on upward mobility genes that are not previously identified using driver genes alone, validate their role in cancer cell survival in vitro using extensive genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR data repositories, and further conduct in vitro functional screenings resulting in the validation of 18 previously unreported genes.

The crucial pathophysiology is an excessive hypoxia-mediated rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) leading to increased microvascular hydrostatic pressures despite normal left atrial pressure. The resultant hydrostatic stress can cause both dynamic changes in the permeability of the alveolar capillary barrier and mechanical damage leading to leakage of large proteins and erythrocytes into the alveolar space in the absence of inflammation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and pulmonary artery (PA) and microvascular pressure measurements in humans confirm that high capillary pressure induces a high-permeability non-inflammatory-type lung edema; a concept termed “capillary stress failure.” Measurements of endothelin and nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air, NO metabolites in BAL fluid, and NO-dependent endothelial function in the systemic circulation all point to reduced NO availability and increased endothelin in hypoxia as a major cause of the excessive hypoxic PA pressure rise in HAPE-susceptible individuals. Other hypoxia-dependent differences in ventilatory control, sympathetic nervous system activation, endothelial function, and alveolar epithelial sodium and water reabsorption likely contribute additionally to the phenotype of HAPE susceptibility. Recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging in humans strongly suggest nonuniform regional hypoxic arteriolar vasoconstriction as an explanation for how HPV occurring predominantly at the arteriolar level can cause leakage. This compelling but not yet fully proven mechanism predicts that in areas of high blood flow due to lesser vasoconstriction edema will develop owing to pressures that exceed the structural and dynamic capacity of the alveolar capillary barrier to maintain normal alveolar fluid balance. Numerous strategies aimed at lowering HPV and possibly enhancing active alveolar fluid reabsorption are effective in preventing and treating HAPE. Much has been learned about HAPE in the past four decades such that what was once a mysterious alpine malady is now a well-characterized and preventable lung disease. This chapter will relate the history, pathophysiology, and treatment of HAPE, using it not only to illuminate the condition, but also for the broader lessons it offers in understanding pulmonary vascular regulation and lung fluid balance.","Swenson, Erik R.",Textbook of Pulmonary Vascular Disease,28,1

The chapter concludes that, in order to be useful, a definition of food safety risks should include multiple contextual issues and stakeholders along the food supply chain. It is important to keep in mind what national food safety governance actors perceive the risks to be, and how their definitions fit into the broader picture of food safety in general. Food safety governance regulatory processes should take into consideration local realities, local food supply chains and local food safety threats to ensure the appropriateness and sustainability of any and all disease control measures instituted.

The microbiological quality of laboratory animals is a direct result of colony management practices, and monitoring provides an after-the-fact assessment of the adequacy of those practices. In the case of immunocompromised animals or in infection experiments, however, monitoring for a comprehensive list of micro-organisms is reasonable. The testing of animals usually starts with necropsy and blood sampling for serology, followed by microscopic examination for parasites and sampling of organs for bacteriology, pathology, and, in rare cases, virological examinations. Biological materials represent a high risk, if they originate from or have been propagated in animals. In particular, tumors, viruses, or parasites that are serially passaged in animals often pick up pathogens, and therefore a high percentage of these are contaminated. It has been shown in mice and rats that all preimplantational stages can be revitalized successfully upon freezethaw procedures. For long-term storage, eight-cell stages have been recommended in the chapter, while two-cell stages were considered to be less suitable. One embryo batch (inbred strain) derived from a single pedigree donor pair may be regarded as a prospective breeding nucleus, if one fertile breeding pair is obtained upon revitalization. Assuming an average revitalization rate of 20% (fertile breeders), one embryo batch should contain a minimum number of 10 embryos to obtain at least one breeding pair with a 50% chance of revitalization.","Mossmann, H; Nicklas, W; Hedrich, Hj",,28,1

Microarrays are used for a wide range of applications including gene annotation, investigation of gene-gene interactions, elucidation of gene regulatory networks and gene-expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungal organisms. Academic researchers and both the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries have an enormous interest in developing microarrays both as diagnostic tools and for use in basic research into how pathogens, such as fungi, interact with their host. Microarray experiments generate vast quantities of raw gene expression data, therefore good experimental design and statistical analysis is required for the extraction of accurate and useful information regarding the expression of genes. In this review we firstly provide an overview of the arrival and development of microarray technology. We then focus on the issues surrounding experimental design and the processing of microarray images, followed by a discussion on methods for cleaning and normalizing raw gene expression data and a final discussion of the importance statistical analysis plays in identifying differentially expressed genes.","Wilson, Claire H.; Tsykin, Anna; Wilkinson, Christopher R.; Abbott, Catherine A.",,28,1

Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes that degrade proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids derived from intracellular (through autophagy) and extracellular (through heterophagy) sources. Lysosomal degradation regulates several physiological cell functions. These include turnover of cellular organelles and extracellular constituents; amino acid and glucose homeostasis; processing of proteins; lipid metabolism; cell growth, differentiation, and involution; host defenses against microorganisms and other pathogens; and removal of necrotic and foreign material from the circulation and from tissues. Lysosomal degradation also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic cell injury, inflammation and repair, and tumor growth and metastasis. The participation of the lysosomes in the specific types of cell injury we have discussed is due to altered regulation of one or more of the following processes: turnover of cellular organelles by autophagic degradation; levels and activities of lysosomal hydrolases; levels of intracellular and extracellular lysosomal hydrolase inhibitors; transport of degradation products from the lysosomal matrix to the cytosol; permeability of the lysosomal membrane to hydrolases; lysosomal vacuolar acidification; transport of degradable substrates and of pathogens to the lysosomes; transport and processing of secretory proteins and lysosomal hydrolases during biogenesis; traffic and fusion of lysosomal vacuoles and vesicles; secretion of lysosomal hydrolases; and accumulation of metals, particularly iron, acidotropic agents, and undegraded and/or undegradable materials in lysosomes.","Marzella, Louis; Lee, Hsiang-Kuang",,28,1

Highly virulent strains of Psa biovar3 (Psa3) have spread rapidly to kiwifruit production areas worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop critical management strategies for bacterial canker based on dissecting the interactions between Psa and kiwifruit. Here, we developed a rapid and reliable flood-inoculation method using kiwifruit seedlings grown on Murashige and Skoog medium. This method has several advantages over inoculation of conventional soil-grown plants. We demonstrated the utility of a kiwifruit seedling assay to study the virulence of Psa biovars and Psa3 virulence factors, including the type III secretion system (T3SS). Kiwifruit seedlings inoculated with Psa3 developed severe necrosis within 1 week, whereas those inoculated with a T3SS-deficient hrcN mutant of Psa3 did not. This method was also useful for analyzing expression profiles of genes involved in Psa3 virulence during infection, and revealed that the expression of genes encoding the T3SS and type III secreted effectors were strongly induced in planta. Our results indicate that the T3SS has an important role in Psa3 virulence, and the flood-inoculation assay using kiwifruit seedling is suitable for analyzing Psa and kiwifruit interactions.

However, we remained intrigued by the fact that Blass and Gurevich used partial-order runs of distributed ASMs to explain runs of sequential recursive algorithms.

The pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the “missing link” in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. Our predation of wild fauna and the reduction in their habitats have thus ended up creating new interfaces that favour the transmission of pathogens (mainly viruses) to humans. Domesticated animals and wild fauna thus constitute a reservoir for almost 80% of emerging human diseases (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola). These diseases are all zoonotic in origin. As if out of a Chinese fairy tale, the bat and the pangolin have taught us a lesson: within an increasingly interdependent world, environmental crises will become ever more intertwined with health crises. Questions relating to public health will no longer be confined to the secrecy of the physician’s consulting room or the sanitised environment of the hospital. They are now being played out in the arena of international trade, ports and airports and distribution networks. Simply put, all human activity creates new interfaces that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from an animal reservoir to humans. This pluri-disciplinary article highlights that environmental changes, such as the reduction in habitats for wild fauna and the intemperate trade in fauna, are the biggest causes of the emergence of new diseases. Against this background, it reviews the different measures taken to control, eradicate and prevent the emergence of animal diseases in a globalised world.","DE SADELEER, Nicolas; GODFROID, Jacques",,28,1

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming prevalent in software products. The use of AI entices consumer inquisitiveness, promising software products that can make our lives easier, productive, and in some mission-critical applications safer. Similar reasoning can be applied to systems exploring Internet of Things, cloud services, and mobile technologies. However, there is a trust deficit when it comes to accepting AI as well as the other above-mentioned features, as a reliable technology platform. This paper argues that the more critical the domain is, the less consumers seem to trust software to make decisions on their behalf or even to be used. Aspects such as safety, privacy, and ethics challenges the perception of trustworthy computing. In the past two decades, several works have suggested that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) may play an essential role in creating a trust paradigm between customers and businesses promoting loyalty, customer retention and thus enhancing customer trust and increasing corporate profit. We believe that the software industry will need soon rather than later to encourage trust in their embedded software. A promising approach lies in adapting principles associated with CSR to guide the software development processes. Such an approach could help to achieve two goals: Deliver trustworthy software and, if desired, deliver socially responsible software. We believe that Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) will play a crucial role in this endeavor. This paper highlights a first approach to establishing a basic set of NFRs that should always be carefully considered when developing software, as to aim socially responsible software.","Cysneiros, Luiz Marcio; do Prado Leite, Julio Cesar Sampaio","Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling",28,1

Through existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we have implemented a tool that addresses these two topics separately. We further use them jointly in a pipeline. Thus, our goal is to understand how these modules can help each other. For QG, our methodology employs a detailed analysis of the relevant content of a sentence through Part-of-speech (POS) tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER). Ensuring loose coupling with the QA task, in the latter we use Information Retrieval to rank sentences that might contain relevant information regarding a certain question, together with Open Information Retrieval to analyse the sentences. In its current version, the QG tool takes a sentence to formulate a simple question. By connecting QG with the QA component, we provide a means to effortlessly generate a test set for QA. While our current QA approach shows promising results, when enhancing the QG component we will, in the future, provide questions for which a more elaborated QA will be needed. The generated QA datasets contribute to QA evaluation, while QA proves to be an important technique for assessing the ambiguity of the questions.","Azevedo, Pedro; Leite, Bernardo; Cardoso, Henrique Lopes; Silva, Daniel Castro; Reis, Luís Paulo",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,28,1

The problem is basically the fluid dynamics of a transient turbulent jet/puff with buoyancy, laden with evaporating droplets carrying the pathogen. A turbulent flow of this nature does not lend itself to reliable estimates through modeling approaches such as RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations) or other droplet-based models. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of what may be called “cough/sneeze flows” can play an important role in understanding the spread of the contagion. The objective of this work is to develop a DNS code for studying cough/sneeze flows by a suitable combination of the DNS codes available with the authors (developed to study cumulus cloud flows including thermodynamics of phase change and the dynamics of small water droplets) and to generate useful data on these flows. Recent results from the cumulus cloud simulations are included to highlight the effect of turbulent entrainment (which is one of the key processes in determining the spread of the expiratory flows) on the distribution of liquid water content in a moist plume. Furthermore, preliminary results on the temperature distribution in a “dry cough” (i.e., without inclusion of liquid droplets) are reported to illustrate the large spatial extent and time duration over which the cough flow can persist after the coughing has stopped. We believe that simulations of this kind can help to devise more accurate guidelines for separation distances between neighbors in a group, design better masks, and minimize the spread of respiratory diseases of the COVID-19 type.","Diwan, Sourabh S.; Ravichandran, S.; Govindarajan, Rama; Narasimha, Roddam",Trans Indian Natl,28,1

A common practice is to utilize fault tolerance methods like Replication and Erasure Coding for maximizing data availability. However, while erasure codes provide better fault tolerance compared to replication with a more affordable storage overhead, they frequently suffer from high reconstruction cost as they require to access all available nodes when a data block needs to be repaired, and also can repair up to a limited number of unavailable data blocks, depending on the number of the code’s parity block capabilities. Furthermore, storing and placing the encoded data in the federated storage system also remains a challenge. In this paper we present Fed-DIC, a framework which combines Diagonally Interleaved Coding on client devices at the edge of the network with organized storage of encoded data in a federated cloud system comprised of multiple independent storage clusters. The erasure coding operations are performed on client devices at the edge while they interact with the federated cloud to store the encoded data. We describe how our solution integrates the functionality of federated clouds alongside erasure coding implemented on edge devices for maximizing data availability and we evaluate the working and benefits of our approach in terms of read access cost, data availability, storage overhead, load balancing and network bandwidth rate compared to popular Replication and Erasure Coding schemes.","Tzouros, Giannis; Kalogeraki, Vana",Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems,28,1

Previous studies showed that the loss of ECA results in Salmonella attenuation, indicating its usefulness as a vaccine candidate for Salmonella infection, but no studies have shown whether the mutation resulting from the deletion of the ECA operon in conjunction with other mutations could be used as an antigen vehicle for heterologous protein antigen delivery. RESULTS: In this study, we introduced a nonpolar, defined ECA operon deletion into wild-type S. Typhimurium χ3761 and an attenuated vaccine strain χ9241, obtaining two isogenic ECA operon mutants, namely, χ12357 and χ12358, respectively. A number of in vitro and in vivo properties of the mutants were analyzed. We found that the loss of ECA did not affect the growth, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production and motility of S. Typhimurium wild type strain χ3761 and its attenuated vaccine strain χ9241 but significantly affected the virulence when administered orally to BALB/c mice. Furthermore, the effects of the ECA mutation on the immunogenicity of a recombinant S. Typhimurium vaccine strain χ9241 when delivering the pneumococcal antigen PspA were determined. The result showed that the total anti-PspA IgG level of χ12358 (pYA4088) was slightly lower than that of χ9241 (pYA4088), but the protection rate was not compromised. CONCLUSIONS: ECA affects virulence and benefits the Th2 immunity of Salmonella Typhimurium, therefore, it is feasible to use a reversible ECA mutant mode to design future Salmonella vaccine strains for heterologous protective antigens.","Liu, Qing; Shen, Xuegang; Bian, Xiaoping; Kong, Qingke",BMC Microbiol,28,1

On the other hand, inadequate and asynchronous spontaneous breathing has the potential to aggravate lung injury. During use of airway-pressure-release-ventilation (APRV), the assisted breaths are difficult to measure. We developed an algorithm to differentiate the breaths in a setting of lung injury in spontaneously breathing ewes. We hypothesized that differentiation of breaths into spontaneous, mechanical and assisted is feasible using a specially developed for this purpose algorithm. Ventilation parameters were recorded by software that integrated ventilator output variables. The flow signal, measured by the EVITA® XL (Lübeck, Germany), was measured every 2 ms by a custom Java-based computerized algorithm (Breath-Sep). By integrating the flow signal, tidal volume (V(T)) of each breath was calculated. By using the flow curve the algorithm separated the different breaths and numbered them for each time point. Breaths were separated into mechanical, assisted and spontaneous. Bland Altman analysis was used to compare parameters. Comparing the values calculated by Breath-Sep with the data from the EVITA® using Bland–Altman analyses showed a mean bias of − 2.85% and 95% limits of agreement from − 25.76 to 20.06% for MV(total). For respiratory rate (RR) RR(set) a bias of 0.84% with a SD of 1.21% and 95% limits of agreement from − 1.53 to 3.21% were found. In the cluster analysis of the 25th highest breaths of each group RR(total) was higher using the EVITA®. In the mechanical subgroup the values for RR(spont) and MV(spont) the EVITA® showed higher values compared to Breath-Sep. We developed a computerized method for respiratory flow-curve based differentiation of breathing cycle components during mechanical ventilation with superimposed spontaneous breathing. Further studies in humans and optimizing of this technique is necessary to allow for real-time use at the bedside.

These small genetic factors have been widely studied mostly in commensal Escherichia coli strains, whereas the role of TASs in the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is still elusive. Here, the physiological role of chromosomally encoded type II TASs in EcN was examined. We showed that gene pair ECOLIN_00240-ECOLIN_00245 and ECOLIN_08365-ECOLIN_08370 were two functional TASs encoding CcdAB and HipAB, respectively. The homologs of CcdAB and HipAB were more conserved in E. coli species belonging to pathogenic groups, suggesting their important roles in EcN. CRISPRi-mediated repression of ccdAB and hipAB significantly reduced the biofilm formation of EcN in the stationary phase. Moreover, ccdAB and hipAB were shown to be responsible for the persister formation in EcN. Biofilm and persister formation of EcN controlled by the ccdAB and hipAB were associated with the expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis, SOS response, and stringent response. Besides, CRISPRi was proposed to be an efficient tool in annotating multiple TASs simultaneously. Collectively, our results advance knowledge and understanding of the role of TASs in EcN, which will enhance the utility of EcN in probiotic therapy. Key points • Two TASs in EcN were identified as hipAB and ccdAB. • Knockdown of HipAB and CcdAB resulted in decreased biofilm formation of EcN. • Transcriptional silencing of hipAB and ccdAB affected the persister formation of EcN. • An attractive link between TASs and stress response was unraveled in EcN. • CRISPRi afforded a fast and in situ annotation of multiple TASs simultaneously.

Online interviews with six demographically diverse participants were conducted and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The overarching theme was 'the balancing act of online learners', which consisted of three major themes (and respective subthemes): (1) 'identity as an online learner' ('in today's world, we're all very busy'), (2) 'access to resources' ('importance of location' and 'comparing online to on-campus teaching and learning'), and (3) 'changing nature of social interactions' ('tutors as a crutch' and 'peer-to-peer interactions'). A number of facilitators and barriers related to these themes were identified, which are applicable to the COM-B model.

The solver employs Generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion to (a) quantify the uncertainties associated with the fluid flow simulations, and (b) study the non-linear propagation of these uncertainties. The aim is to accurately estimate the uncertainty in the result of a CFD simulation at a lower computational cost than the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method. The gPC approach is based on the spectral decomposition of the random variables in terms of basis polynomials containing randomness and the unknown deterministic expansion coefficients. As opposed to the mostly used non-intrusive approach, in this work, we use the intrusive variant of the gPC method in the sense that the deterministic equations are modified to directly solve for the (coupled) expansion coefficients. To this end, we have tested the intrusive gPC implementation for both the laminar and the turbulent flow problems in CFD. The results are in accordance with the analytical and the non-intrusive approaches. The stochastic solver thus developed, can serve as an alternative to perform uncertainty quantification, especially when the non-intrusive methods are significantly expensive, which is mostly true for a lot of stochastic CFD problems.","Parekh, Jigar; Verstappen, Roel",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,28,1

We use data from a network of low-cost Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor packages deployed throughout Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with data from Environmental Protection Agency regulatory monitors. The RAMP locations were divided into four site groups based on land use. Concentrations of PM(2.5), CO, and NO(2) following the COVID-related closures at each site group were compared to measurements from “business-as-usual” periods. Overall, PM(2.5) concentrations decreased across the domain by ∼3 μg/m(3). The morning rush-hour-induced CO and NO(2) concentrations at the high-traffic sites were both reduced by ∼50%, which is consistent with observed reductions in commuter traffic (∼50%). The morning rush-hour PM(2.5) enhancement from traffic emissions was reduced nearly 100%, from 1.4 to ∼0 μg/m(3) across all site groups. There was no significant change in the industry-related intraday variability of CO and PM(2.5) at the industrial sites following the COVID-related closures. If PM(2.5) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are tightened, this natural experiment sheds light on the extent to which reductions in traffic-related emissions can aid in meeting more stringent regulations.","Tanzer-Gruener, Rebecca; Li, Jiayu; Eilenberg, S.

I explain the complex nature of informality, some of the reasons for its persistence and its interdependency with the formal economy, especially in the manufacturing sector, through global value chains (GVCs). Large firms (whether MNEs or domestic firms) sub-contract considerable activity to informal enterprises, but this is precarious in character. I suggest the crisis provides the circumstances for greater active engagement with informal actors, by placing informal enterprises on a par with formal firms within industrial policy. I propose integration and registration, as opposed to formalisation, and the provision of state support without taxation. The role of the state is also crucial in matchmaking, creating incentives for GVCs to engage with informal actors systematically, and to reduce the transaction costs for informal actors in such engagement.

Emerging evidence suggests that stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) mediates egression of EPCs from bone marrow, while the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional system regulates SDF-1α expression. Our study aimed to investigate the time course of circulating CD133+/CD34+ EPCs and its correlation with the expression of HIF-1α protein and SDF-1α in postoperative laparoscopic abdominal septic patients. METHODS: Postoperative patients were divided in control (C group) and septic group (S group) operated immediately after the diagnosis of sepsis/septic shock. Blood samples were collected at baseline (0), 1, 3 and 7 postoperative days for CD133+/CD34+ EPCs count expressing or not the HIF-1α and SDF-1α analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients in S group and 39 in C group were analyzed. In C group CD133+/CD34+ EPCs count remained stable throughout the study period, increasing on day 7 (173 [0–421] /μl vs baseline: P = 0.04; vs day 1: P = 0.002). In S group CD133+/CD34+ EPCs count levels were higher on day 3 (vs day 1: P = 0.006 and day 7: P = 0.026). HIF-1α expressing CD133+/CD34+ EPCs count decreased on day 1 as compared with the other days in C group (day 0 vs 1: P = 0.003, days 3 and 7 vs 1: P = 0.008), while it was 321 [0–1418] /μl on day 3 (vs day 1; P = 0.004), and 400 [0–587] /μl on day 7 in S group. SDF-1α levels were higher not only on baseline but also on postoperative day 1 in S vs C group (219 [124–337] pg/ml vs 35 [27–325] pg/ml, respectively; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that sepsis in abdominal laparoscopic patients might constitute an additional trigger of the EPCs mobilization as compared with non-septic surgical patients. A larger mobilization of CD133+/CD34+ EPCs, preceded by enhanced plasmatic SDF-1α, occurs in septic surgical patients regardless of HIF-1α expression therein.

Community detection algorithm based on three-way decisions (TWD) forms a multi-layered community structure by hierarchical clustering and then selects a suitable layer as the community detection result. However, this layer usually contains overlapping communities. Based on the idea of TWD, we define the overlapping part in the communities as boundary region (BND), and the non-overlapping part as positive region (POS) or negative region (NEG). How to correctly divide the nodes in the BND into the POS or NEG is a challenge for three-way decisions community detection. The general methods to deal with boundary region are modularity increment and similarity calculation. But these methods only take advantage of the local features of the network, without considering the information of the divided communities and the similarity of the global structure. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method for three-way decisions community detection based on weighted graph representation (WGR-TWD). The weighted graph representation (WGR) can well transform the global structure into vector representation and make the two nodes in the boundary region more similar by using frequency of appearing in the same community as the weight. Firstly, the multi-layered community structure is constructed by hierarchical clustering. The target layer is selected according to the extended modularity value of each layer. Secondly, all nodes are converted into vectors by WGR. Finally, the nodes in the BND are divided into the POS or NEG based on cosine similarity. Experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that WGR-TWD is effective for community detection in networks compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.","Chen, Jie; Li, Yang; Zhao, Shu; Wang, Xiangyang; Zhang, Yanping",Rough Sets,28,1

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of patient-ventilator interaction comparing NAVA with pressure support ventilation (PSV) in patients difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation after moderate pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). METHODS: In this physiological crossover study, 12 patients admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with moderate PARDS failing up to 3 spontaneous breathing trials in less than 7 days, were enrolled. Patients underwent three study conditions lasting 1 h each: PSV1, NAVA and PSV2. RESULTS: The Asynchrony Index (AI) was significantly reduced during the NAVA trial compared to both the PSV1 and PSV2 trials (p = 0.001). During the NAVA trial, the inspiratory and expiratory trigger delays were significantly shorter compared to those obtained during PSV1 and PSV2 trials (Delay(trinsp)p < 0.001, Delay(trexp)p = 0.013). These results explain the significantly longer Time(sync) observed during the NAVA trial (p < 0.001). In terms of gas exchanges, PaO(2) value significantly improved in the NAVA trial with respect to the PSV trials (p < 0.02). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio showed a significant improvement during the NAVA trial compared to both the PSV1 and PSV2 trials (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this specific PICU population, presenting difficulty in weaning after PARDS, NAVA was associated with a reduction of the AI and a significant improvement in oxygenation compared to PSV mode.

Applications of object detection and classification include a diverse range of fields such as surveillance, autonomous cars and robotic vision. Many intelligent systems are built by researchers to achieve the accuracy of human perception but could not quite achieve it yet. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Learning architectures are used to achieve human like perception for object detection and scene identification. We are proposing a novel method by combining previously used techniques. We are proposing a model which takes multi-spectral images, fuses them together, drops the useless images and then provides semantic segmentation for each object (person) present in the image. In our proposed methodology we are using CNN for fusion of Visible and thermal images and Deep Learning architectures for classification and localization. Fusion of visible and thermal images is carried out to combine informative features of both images into one image. For fusion we are using Encoder-decoder architecture. Fused image is then fed into Resnet-152 architecture for classification of images. Images obtained from Resnet-152 are then fed into Mask-RCNN for localization of persons. Mask-RCNN uses Resnet-101 architecture for localization of objects. From the results it can be clearly seen that Fused model for object localization outperforms the Visible model and gives promising results for person detection for surveillance purposes.

In order to characterize the place of financial incentives, we investigated resource utilization and cost associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAI) and assessed the relative financial burden for hospital and insurer according to reimbursement policies. METHODS: We conducted a prospective matched case-control study over 18 months in a tertiary university medical center. Patients with central-line associated blood-stream infections (CLABSI), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) or surgical site infections (SSI) were each matched to three control patients. Resource utilization, costs and reimbursement (per diem for CLABSI and CDI, diagnosis related group (DRG) reimbursement for SSI) were compared between patients and controls, from both the hospital and insurer perspective. RESULTS: HAIs were associated with increased resource consumption (more blood tests, imaging, antibiotic days, hospital days etc.). Direct costs were higher for cases vs. controls (CLABSI: $6400 vs. $2376 (p < 0.001), CDI: $1357 vs $733 (p = 0.047) and SSI: $6761 vs. $5860 (p < 0.001)). However as admissions were longer following CLABSI and CDI, costs per-day were non-significantly different (USD/day, cases vs. controls: CLABSI, 601 vs. 719, (p = 0.63); CDI, 101 vs. 93 (p = 0.5)). For CLABSI and CDI, reimbursement was per-diem and thus the financial burden ($14,608 and $5430 respectively) rested on the insurer, not the hospital. For SSI, as reimbursement was per procedure, costs rested primarily on the hospital rather than the insurer. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial infections are associated with both increased resource utilization and increased length of stay. Reimbursement strategy (per diem vs DRG) is the principal parameter affecting financial incentives to prevent hospital acquired infections and depends on the payer perspective. In the Israeli health care system, financial incentives are unlikely to represent a significant consideration in the prevention of CLABSI and CDI.","Benenson, Shmuel; Cohen, Matan J.; Schwartz, Carmela; Revva, Michael; Moses, Allon E.; Levin, Phillip D.",BMC Health Serv Res,28,1

Prevention of lung atelectasis, carbon dioxide retention, and chest infection would improve the quality of medical care and decrease hospital stay and costs. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure-controlled volume-guaranteed ventilation (PCVG) on postoperative lung atelectasis using lung ultrasound (LUS) following upper abdominal laparotomies. RESULTS: Sixty patients (male and female) scheduled for upper abdominal laparotomies. They were randomly allocated into two equal groups: Group A (n = 30): received intraoperative volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) mode and group (n = 30): received intraoperative pressure-controlled ventilation volume-guaranteed (PCV-VG) mode. Arterial blood samples were obtained immediately after extubation, and 30, 120, 240, and 360 min postextubation. Lung ultrasound was done intraoperatively at 30 min from induction, immediate, and 120 and after 360 min postoperatively. There was difference between two groups favoring PCV-VG group but that difference failed to be statically significant regarding arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCo(2)) between the two groups in preoperative, immediate postoperative, and 120, 240, and 360 min postoperative. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) was significantly lower among patients in the VCV group immediate postextubation compared with patients in group PCV-VG (p value = 0.009*). Although signs of atelectasis were low in group B, 36.7% of the patients showed normal lung ultrasound, 63.3% showed various abnormalities, 46.7% showed the presence of lung pulse (vertical rhythmic movement synchronous with cardiac pulsation through motionless lung), and 46.7% showed B lines (vertical lines indicate abnormal lung aeration), while 30% of the patients showed the absence of A-lines (indicates the absence of lung sliding and abnormal lung aeration). Also, some patients demonstrated more than one sign. However, there was no a significant difference between the two groups both showed atelectasis immediate, 2 h and 6 h postoperatively. CONCLUSION: PCV-VG offered no significant advantage over VCV regarding the occurrence of the postoperative atelectasis. However, we prefer to use PCV-VG as postoperative hypoxia and atelectasis was much less in that mode. Further, large-scale studies are required to confirm these findings and to establish a definite conclusion.","Hassan, Bahaa El-din Ewees; El-Shaer, Ahmed Nagah; Elbeialy, Marwa Ahmed Khairy; Ismail, Shimaa Ahmed Mohamed",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,28,1

Applications use these DSLs to customize system policies and add new functionality. For performance, the kernel executes them via just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The correctness of these JITs is crucial for the security of the kernel: bugs in in-kernel JITs have led to numerous critical issues and patches. This paper presents JitSynth, the first tool for synthesizing verified JITs for in-kernel DSLs. JitSynth takes as input interpreters for the source DSL and the target instruction set architecture. Given these interpreters, and a mapping from source to target states, JitSynth synthesizes a verified JIT compiler from the source to the target. Our key idea is to formulate this synthesis problem as one of synthesizing a per-instruction compiler for abstract register machines. Our core technical contribution is a new compiler metasketch that enables JitSynth to efficiently explore the resulting synthesis search space. To evaluate JitSynth, we use it to synthesize a JIT from eBPF to RISC-V and compare to a recently developed Linux JIT. The synthesized JIT avoids all known bugs in the Linux JIT, with an average slowdown of [Formula: see text] in the performance of the generated code. We also use JitSynth to synthesize JITs for two additional source-target pairs. The results show that JitSynth offers a promising new way to develop verified JITs for in-kernel DSLs.","Van Geffen, Jacob; Nelson, Luke; Dillig, Isil; Wang, Xi; Torlak, Emina",Computer Aided Verification,28,1

The crux of NNV is a collection of reachability algorithms that make use of a variety of set representations, such as polyhedra, star sets, zonotopes, and abstract-domain representations. NNV supports both exact (sound and complete) and over-approximate (sound) reachability algorithms for verifying safety and robustness properties of feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) with various activation functions. For learning-enabled CPS, such as closed-loop control systems incorporating neural networks, NNV provides exact and over-approximate reachability analysis schemes for linear plant models and FFNN controllers with piecewise-linear activation functions, such as ReLUs. For similar neural network control systems (NNCS) that instead have nonlinear plant models, NNV supports over-approximate analysis by combining the star set analysis used for FFNN controllers with zonotope-based analysis for nonlinear plant dynamics building on CORA. We evaluate NNV using two real-world case studies: the first is safety verification of ACAS Xu networks, and the second deals with the safety verification of a deep learning-based adaptive cruise control system.","Tran, Hoang-Dung; Yang, Xiaodong; Manzanas Lopez, Diego; Musau, Patrick; Nguyen, Luan Viet; Xiang, Weiming; Bak, Stanley; Johnson, Taylor T.",Computer Aided Verification,28,13

The pace at which the disease spread in the last 4 months, since it was first recognized from China, is unprecedented. This review of the epidemiology of COVID-19 summarizes the burden of infection, transmission dynamics, and other related epidemiological features. While countries such as China, Italy, and the United States have particularly high-rates of infection, the disease is gradually spreading in India as well, threatening the health and economy of the country. Transmission in asymptomatic cases, early symptomatic phase, as well as limited access to testing in different settings are factors that have led to the rapid spread of infection. A large case series from China revealed that 81% of cases had mild symptoms, 14% had severe disease, and 5% were afflicted with critical illness. While the mortality in China was reported as 2.3%, Italy, with a high-proportion of elderly, reported a case fatality report of 7.2% due to higher infection and mortality rates among the elderly. Being a highly infectious disease, with a basic reproduction number between 2 to 3, COVID-19 is affecting a large number of healthcare workers, as evidenced by the fact that a sizeable portion of reported infections in the US included healthcare workers.

METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 70 nurses working in two Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Mashhad, Iran. The nurses were trained in the application of observational pain assessment tools by lectures or through a social networking app. Before and after the intervention, the nurses’ performance was evaluated in both groups using a checklist based on Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). RESULTS: In the pre-intervention phase, the nurses’ performance scores in the domains of pain diagnosis and pain management were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05).

Education, which in recent years increasingly tied itself to notions of global culture and markets, is deeply threatened by these changes to the natural environment. This paper makes the case that the relationship between nature and culture in education requires a deep level analysis of the biological and physical substrate of human learning. Only with a sufficiently fundamental level of analysis can society reorganise its systems of learning and scientific inquiry to this rapidly changing environment. Drawing on evolutionary biology, we argue that institutional and individual structures and processes are recapitulations of evolutionary cellular development. Understanding the impact of Covid-19 on cells presents an invitation to consider the larger-scale cultural recapitulations of similar mechanisms and structures, and this has implications for the ways education might most effectively deploy technology. Whilst universities seek to maintain their existing structures, practices and business models, a cellular evolutionary approach points to the necessity for fundamental rethinking of intellectual life and learning. We consider the parameters of effective educational organisation in a post-Covid-19 world.

As case numbers have increased worldwide, gastro-intestinal symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and vomiting have been increased, these symptoms associated with positive laboratory results including abnormal liver function tests, renal function tests, and D-Dimer levels. Although there are multiple articles evaluated the imaging findings in HRCT of COVID-19 patients that helped in understanding the disease course and potential complications in the chest, yet there are—to our knowledge—limited data about the abdominal imaging findings of the course and potential abdominal complications of COVID-19 notably in the intensive care units (ICU). RESULTS: Forty-one sonographic examinations were done for 30 confirmed COVID-intensive care patients presented with abdominal symptoms. Of the 30 patients, 26 were males (86.66%), and 4 were females (13.3%), the average age of the patients was 57.7 years old. The most common sonographic observation was hepatomegaly (n, 23/41, 56%) and biliary system disease (n, 17/41, 41.4%); the imaging findings were correlated with the clinical and laboratory data. CT examination when indicated (in our study to assess hematomas for active extravasation and to assess bowel obstruction and its level). CONCLUSION: Abdominal sonographic imaging was often performed for inpatients with COVID-19. Hepatobiliary dysfunction as well as nephropathy was the most common imaging findings.","Abdelmohsen, Mohsen Ahmed; Alkandari, Buthaina M.; Gupta, Vikash K.; ElBeheiry, Ahmed Adel",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,28,1

The paper argues that young migrants’ narratives of migration shed important light on the working of aspirations in the processes of becoming through migration. Such orientations towards the future are shaped by young migrants’ engagements with doxic and habituated logics producing aspirations. The analytical lens of desire illuminates the role of discursive self-positioning, emotions, and the embodiment of lived experiences of migration in the enacting of particular migrant subjectivities and associated aspirations. In a context in which competing discourses of generation constitute important registers of meaning about migration and aspirations, mobilising generation discourses is a key temporal practice in young migrants’ constructions of narratives of migration.","Rodan, Lisa; Huijsmans, Roy",Eur J Dev Res,28,1

It also attempts to analyse the quality of women’s labour in terms of select parameters. The study finds that there is neither quantitative nor qualitative improvement in women’s employment over time on account of structural changes in the economy. There is no ‘U’ curve of female labour supply in response to GDP growth and expansion of female literacy, implying that economic growth has not generated adequate jobs for women. It also signifies that women’s entry or exit of labour market is influenced by non-economic factors also. There is no major occupational diversification in women’s employment despite structural shift of the economy from primary to tertiary sector. Agriculture is still the leading sector in women’s employment. The study further reveals that the quality of women’s labour is poor. Overcrowding of workforce in agriculture largely as wage labourers, lower earnings, poor literacy levels, large-scale informal employment and most self-employment in the form of unpaid work are indications of women’s disadvantaged position in the labour market.","Sundari, S.",Indian J Labour Econ,28,20

Meanwhile, climate change and conflict increasingly cause human and animal movement, affecting interspecies, intrahuman and interhuman barriers to disease. The dynamics and risks of zoonotic diseases among naive (host) populations and displaced communities are not well understood. This study aims to determine how displacement affects the vulnerability of displaced populations to zoonotic disease transmission, to improve policy development and humanitarian responses. METHODS: Following a literature review, countries for fieldwork were selected and visited based on zoonotic disease risk, livestock dependency and population displacement. Expert interviews were conducted in Jordan and Pakistan with policy makers and responders in public health, livestock and disaster management, and household interviews conducted with displaced. Data was analyzed using a conceptual framework considering biological, environmental, technological, social and political processes at national, local and individual level. RESULTS: Poverty and low socio-economic status are considered main determinants of people's vulnerability to disease, while disasters affect health services and staff, as well as disease pathogen, vector and host environments. Displacement exacerbates these risks, including the availability of water and sanitation, shelter and population density. The formal or informal status of refugees and internal displaced people influences their access to services, further affecting their health. Meanwhile, zoonotic disease dynamics are not sufficiently understood among stakeholders, and animals remain an afterthought in many humanitarian responses. CONCLUSIONS: Zoonoses in displacement settings need to be addressed using a transdisciplinary, multilevel approach, addressing disease as well as underlying political, social and economic risk factors. KEY MESSAGES: Zoonotic disease transmission depends on complex ecological, political and socio-economic drivers, therefore zoonotic disease risk in displacement requires a multilevel, transdisciplinary approach. Among rural populations dependent on livestock, the presence of endemic zoonotic pathogens is likely to be constant. Displacement may increase disease risk by affecting animal and human immunity.","Braam, D",Eur J Public Health,28,1

Survival of concomitant fracture dislocation of cervical spine and oesophageal perforation following Long Scarf Syndrome was rarely described and medium-term follow-up for this lesion has not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 39-year-old female who suffered accidental strangulation caused by the scarf around her neck getting trapped in the wheels of the a vehicle and was referred to our hospital forty days post injury. The CT examination showed a fracture dislocation at C5/6 levels with complete dissociation of the supporting structures. She developed paravertebral abscesses, cutaneous fistulas and oesophageal perforation confirmed by oesophagoscope. The patient was treated conservatively because of poor general condition and inappropriate initial treatment. Halo-vest was used to immobilize the cervical spine. The oesophagus-cutaneous fistula was managed with enteral tube feeding and repeated local care. The patient survived despite such severe injury. Nine months after the injury, the oesophageal perforation closed spontaneously and fixed malunion of the cervical spine was achieved. Six-year follow-up demonstrated that the patient survived with complete C5 tetraplegia. Literature associated with this lesion was reviewed and factors contributing to the survival were discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant fracture dislocation of cervical spine and oesophageal perforation following Long Scarf Syndrome is extremely rare with high risk of mortality. Though surgical intervention is always necessary, the optimal management for this kind of lesion should be made on an individual basis through a multidisciplinary approach.","Li, Xiang; Wang, Fangyong; Zhang, Junwei; Hong, Yi; Yang, Yong",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,28,1

Due to the variation of content in the interventions and the breadth of outcomes used to evaluate effects in such interventions, comparisons are difficult and the choice of which interventions to implement is challenging. Therefore, more information, beyond effects, is needed to guide decision-makers. The aim of this review was to investigate, to what degree factors important for decision-making have been reported in the existing health-promoting and preventive interventions literature for community-dwelling older people in the Nordic countries. METHODS: This review was guided by the PRISMA-ScR checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews), the methodological steps for scoping reviews described in the Arksey and O′Malley’s framework, and the Medical Research Council’s (MRC) guidance on complex interventions. Eligible studies for inclusion were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning health promotion or primary prevention for community-dwelling older people implemented in the Nordic countries. Additionally, all included RCTs were searched for related papers that were reporting on additional factors. Eligible studies were searched in seven databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Academic Search Elite, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, and SPORTDiscus. RESULTS: Eighty-two studies met the inclusion criteria (twenty-seven unique studies and fifty-five related studies). Twelve studies focused on fall prevention, eleven had a health-promoting approach, and four studies focused on preventing disability. All interventions, besides one, reported positive effects on at least one health outcome. Three studies reported data on cost-effectiveness, three on experiences of participants and two conducted feasibility studies. Only one intervention, reported information on all seven factors. CONCLUSIONS: All identified studies on health-promoting and preventive interventions for older people evaluated in the Nordic countries report positive effects although the magnitude of effects and number of follow-ups differed substantially. Overall, there was a general lack of studies on feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and experiences of participants, thus, limiting the basis for decision making. Considering all reported factors, promising candidates to be recommended for implementation in a Nordic municipality context are ‘Senior meetings’, ‘preventive home visits’ and ‘exercise interventions’ on its own or combined with other components.","Bajraktari, Saranda; Sandlund, Marlene; Zingmark, Magnus",Arch Public Health,28,1

OBJECTIVE: The importance of longitudinal studies is presented and the main findings of the Mannheim study of children at risk (MARS), the adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD), the pediatric and adolescent health survey (Kinder- und Jugendgesundheitssurvey, KiGGS) and the AIMS longitudinal European autism project (LEAP) cohort studies are described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was carried out in MEDLINE. RESULTS: The MARS followed participants with psychosocial and organic risks over more than 30 years starting from birth and showed the importance of early risk factors (prenatal period up to early childhood) for neuropsychosocial development. The ABCD cohort study (start 9–10 years old) underlined the developmental significance of early socioemotional and prenatal risks as well as toxin exposure. The KiGGS cohort followed children and adolescents from age 0–17 years up to the ages of 10–28 years. Main findings underline the importance of the socioeconomic status and gender-specific effects with respect to sensitive periods for the onset and trajectories of psychiatric disorders. The AIMS cohort followed patients with and without autism spectrum disorders aged between 6 and 30 years and first results revealed small effects regarding group differences. Further, cohort studies starting prenatally along with deep phenotyping are warranted to uncover the complex etiology of mental disorders. CONCLUSION: Existing cohort studies on early mental development have shown specific focal points. To identify general and specific risk and resilience factors for psychiatric disorders and to model trajectories, there is a need for multimodal integration of data sets.","Holz, N.

Many hospital laboratories in constrained resource settings such as Cambodia struggle to cope with the training needs of laboratory professionals in an environment of competing healthcare development priorities. Resource-limited countries need an adaptable and effective approach to provide laboratory professionals with job-specific quality oversight training to ensure the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of diagnostic services. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe the results of an in-service training and mentoring program conducted with the Cambodia Ministry of Health at 12 tertiary-level hospital laboratories to drive improvements in laboratory quality management systems toward ISO 15189 accreditation, which demonstrated significant progress between baseline and outcome audits in a concurrent study. This case study describes the program, and evaluates how the four primary activities, including actionable gap assessments and planning, centralized and in situ training curriculum, in-person mentoring, and remote tele-mentoring via video communication technologies, contributed towards quality improvement in the participating laboratories. We evaluated participant responses to Likert scale and free response questions from program and training evaluation surveys, and we used thematic analysis to develop a model of best practices within the program’s four primary activities to inform future training approaches. Of these activities, participants agreed most highly that in-person visits and planning based on gap assessments contributed to their learning and ability to improve laboratory operations. Tele-mentoring was rated lowest by participants, who were critical of excessive group dialogue and distraction during web-conferencing; however, feedback suggests both in-person and remote mentoring contribute to continuing education, accountability to action, and peer collaboration and problem solving to improve workforce efforts toward improved quality management systems. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend here a package of in-service training activities for laboratory quality management system improvement initiatives in resource constrained settings that includes needs-based curricula and personalized action plans for participants; interactive and on-site training workshops; and in-person mentoring, complemented with well managed and regular tele-mentoring that focuses on knowledge retention, accountability to goals, and collaborative problem solving. Our model presents an adaptable approach to human resource development for quality improvement in medical laboratories.","Ong, Siew Kim; Donovan, Grant T.; Ndefru, Nayah; Song, Sophanna; Leang, Chhayheng; Sek, Sophat; Noble, Michael; Perrone, Lucy A.",Hum Resour Health,28,33

Healthcare workers are one of the most vulnerable groups to psychological stress in pandemics especially COVID-19. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed depression, stress, and coping among a sample of Egyptian physicians using an electronic survey. It included demographic data; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21); and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). RESULTS: We found that the majority of the sample were females (61.2%), in medical specialties (51.2%), and living with vulnerable family members (92.4 %). The majority (63%) suffered from severe or extremely severe depression, 77.6% had extremely severe anxiety, and 72% suffered from stress. BRCS showed that only 17.1% had high resilient coping. Female physicians had significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores of DASS than male physicians (p = 0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). The anxiety scale was significantly higher in those with chronic diseases (p = 0.040) while the stress scale was lower significantly in those with higher academic degree (p = 0.034). Age had a significantly negative correlation with DASS anxiety (p = 0.031) and stress scores (p = 0.037). The BRCS score had a significantly negative correlation with the depression, anxiety, and stress scales of DASS (p = 0.018, 0.014, and 0.007 respectively).

Therefore, maintaining privacy in the published data is a critical problem. To prevent record linkage, attribute linkage, and similarity attacks based on the background knowledge of trajectory data, we propose a data privacy preservation with enhanced l-diversity. First, we determine those critical spatial-temporal sequences which are more likely to cause privacy leakage. Then, we perturb these sequences by adding or deleting some spatial-temporal points while ensuring the published data satisfy our ([Formula: see text] )-privacy, an enhanced privacy model from l-diversity. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets suggest that our proposed scheme can achieve better privacy while still ensuring high utility, compared with existing privacy preservation schemes on trajectory.","Yao, Lin; Chen, Zhenyu; Hu, Haibo; Wu, Guowei; Wu, Bin",Distrib Parallel Databases,28,1

H5 viruses consist of a high mutation rate, so universal vaccine designing is very challenging. Here, we describe a vaccinomics approach to design a novel multi-epitope influenza vaccine, based on the highly conserved regions of surface glycoprotein, Hemagglutinin (HA). Initially, the HA protein sequences from Bangladeshi origin were retrieved and aligned by ClustalW. The sequences of 100% conserved regions extracted and analyzed to select the highest potential T-cell and B-cell epitope. The HTL and CTL analyses using IEDB tools showed that DVWTYNAELLVLMEN possesses the highest affinity with MHC class I and II alleles, and it has the highest population coverage. The docking simulation study suggests that this epitope has the potential to interact with both MHC class I and MHC class II. The B-cell epitope prediction provides a potential peptide, GAIAGFIEGGWQGM. We further retrieved HA sequences of 3950 avian and 250 human H5 isolates from several populations of the world, where H5 was an epidemic. Surprisingly, these epitopes are more than 98% conserved in those regions which indicate their potentiality as a conserved vaccine. We have proposed a multi-epitope vaccine using these sequences and assess its stability and potentiality to induce B-cell immunity. In vivo study is necessary to corroborate this epitope as a vaccine, however, setting forth groundwork for wet-lab studies essential to mitigate pandemic threats and provide cross-protection of both avian and humans against H5 influenza viruses.

Here, we employed the avidin–biotin technology in a novel gold nanoparticle-decorated graphene field-effect transistor (AuNP-GFET) and demonstrated the specific detection of the biotinylated macromolecules such as biotinylated proteins and nucleotides in the sub-picomolar (pM) range. The AuNP-GFET was constructed by fabricating six pairs of interdigital electrodes on graphene transferred on a SiO(2)/Si substrate. The sensing performance of AuNP-GFET was characterized by the real-time two-terminal electrical current measurement upon injection of the analyte solution into a silicone pool preattached onto the electrodes. Avidin, a tetrameric biotin-binding protein with strong affinity and specificity, immobilized on AuNP-decorated single-layer graphene, was used as the sensing platform and transduced the electrical signal upon binding to the analyte macromolecules. The sensing capability of the AuNP-GFET was tested with the biotinylated protein A. Sensitivity of the present biosensor was estimated to be ∼0.4 pM. The specificity and applicability of the biosensor were confirmed using both synthetic and real samples. Because the biotin label can retain its binding capability to avidin with strong affinity and specificity even after conjugating with varieties of proteins and nucleotides, the present AuNP-GFET biosensor is expected to promote the research in developing different biosensors.","Wang, Shiyu; Hossain, Md.

This study aimed to assess the association between rhTM and outcomes in septic DIC patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: This retrospective observational study analyzed the data of patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a single center between January 2012 and December 2018, and diagnosed with sepsis-induced DIC and AKI. Data were extracted as follows: patients’ characteristics; DIC score, as calculated by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine and the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria; serum creatinine levels; and ICU and 28-day mortality rates. The primary outcome was the dependence on renal replacement therapy (RRT) at ICU discharge. The propensity score (PS) was calculated using the following variables: age, sex, septic shock at admission, DIC score, and KDIGO classification. Subsequently, logistic regression analysis was performed using the PS to evaluate the outcome. RESULTS: In total, 97 patients were included in this study. Of these, 52 (53.6%) patients had received rhTM. The dependence on RRT at ICU discharge was significantly lower in the rhTM than in the non-rhTM group (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19–0.97; P = 0.043). The serum creatinine levels at ICU discharge (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13–0.72; P = 0.007) and hospital discharge (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11–0.60; P = 0.002, respectively), and the 28-day mortality rate (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17–0.93; P = 0.033) were significantly lower in the rhTM than in the non-rhTM group. Moreover, the Kaplan–Meier survival curve revealed significantly lower mortality rates in the rhTM than in the non-rhTM group (P = 0.009). No significant differences in the DIC score and AKI severity were observed between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among sepsis-induced DIC patients with AKI, rhTM administration was associated with lower dependence on RRT at ICU discharge, improvement in renal function, and lower 28-day mortality rate.","Akatsuka, Masayuki; Masuda, Yoshiki; Tatsumi, Hiroomi; Sonoda, Tomoko",J Intensive Care,28,1

The aim of the study is to assess diagnostic performance of caIMR, using wire-derived index of microvascular resistance (IMR) as the reference standard. IMR was demonstrated in 56 patients (57 vessels) with stable/unstable angina pectoris and no obstructive coronary arteries in three centers using the Certus pressure wire. Based on the aortic pressure wave and coronary angiograms from two projections, the caIMR was computed and assessed in blinded fashion against the IMR at an independent core laboratory. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the caIMR with a cutoff value of 25 were 84.2% (95% CI: 72.1% to 92.5%), 86.1% (95% CI: 70.5% to 95.3%), 81.0% (95% CI: 58.1% to 94.6%), 88.6% (95% CI: 76.1% to 95.0%), and 77.3% (95% CI: 59.5% to 88.7%) against the IMR with a cutoff value of 25. The receiver-operating curve had area under the curve of 0.919 and the correlation coefficient equaled to 0.746 between caIMR and wire-derived IMR. Hence, caIMR could eliminate the need of a pressure wire, reduce technical error, and potentially increase adoption of physiological assessment of microvascular diseases in patients with ischemic heart disease.","Ai, Hu; Feng, Yundi; Gong, Yanjun; Zheng, Bo; Jin, Qinhua; Zhang, Hui-Ping; Sun, Fucheng; Li, Jianping; Chen, Yundai; Huo, Yunlong; Huo, Yong",Front Physiol,28,1
44250,44250,44250,in the final analysis,12.086816,3.0381472,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ~650,000 deaths recorded in < 5-year-olds in 2016. Cross-sectional studies on hospitalized LRTIs are available, but longitudinal studies on the total burden of viral LRTIs are scarce. This study (NCT01995175) prospectively collected incident RSV and other viral LRTIs in a multinational cohort. METHODS: From 2013 to 2017, infants in 8 countries were enrolled at birth and followed for LRTIs up to 2 years of age. Infants with suspected LRTIs were clinically examined and swabbed. Nasal swab samples were tested using quantitative real-time PCR for RSV and multiplex PCR panel for 16 other respiratory viruses/subtypes; bacterial culture was not performed. LRTI and severe LRTI episodes were defined per 2015 WHO LRTI case definitions. Viruses detected from nasal swabs collected from participants with WHO-defined LRTI and severe LRTI episodes are reported. RESULTS: The 2401 infants followed experienced 1012 LRTI episodes; 259 of these were severe LRTIs. At least 1 virus was detected from 909 (90%) and 235 (91%) LRTI and severe LRTI episodes, respectively. Enteroviruses/Rhinoviruses (EV/RV, 49%) were detected most frequently in samples collected from LRTI episodes, followed by RSV (22%), parainfluenza (PIV, 14%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 8%) and seasonal coronavirus (CoV, 6%). RSV was detected in 39% of samples from LRTI episodes in < 3-month-olds and in 18% of 1-year-olds (Table 1). In a similar trend, RSV was detected in 47% of samples from severe LRTI episodes in < 3-month-olds and in 21% of 1-year-olds (Table 2). Co-infection with another virus was common in CoV-positive samples (67%), while most samples positive for RSV (71%), hMPV (70%), EV/RV (67%) and PIV (58%) had no other virus detected. Table 1. Occurrence of laboratory confirmed respiratory viral infections by viral pathogens identified in nasal swab samples from WHO-defined LRTI episodes [Image: see text] Table 2. Occurrence of laboratory confirmed respiratory viral infections by viral pathogens identified in nasal swab samples from WHO-defined severe LRTI episodes [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses are detected in the majority of LRTIs during the first 2 years of life. RSV likely accounts for much of this overall LRTI burden. Our results suggest that RSV most strongly impacted the very young; it was the most commonly detected virus in severe LRTIs in infants aged < 3 months. RSV was also persistently detected at high levels in samples from LRTIs (22%) and severe LRTIs (28%) in children up to 2 years old.

In human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), synergistic mutations in its protease and the protease substrate – the Group-specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein – work together to confer drug resistance against protease inhibitors and compensate the mutations affecting viral fitness. Some Gag mutations can restore Gag-protease binding, yet most Gag-protease correlated mutations occur outside of the Gag cleavage site. To investigate the molecular basis for this, we now report multiscale modelling approaches to investigate various sequentially cleaved Gag products in the context of clinically relevant mutations that occur outside of the cleavage sites, including simulations of the largest Gag proteolytic product in its viral membrane-bound state. We found that some mutations, such as G123E and H219Q, involve direct interaction with cleavage site residues to influence their local environment, while certain mutations in the matrix domain lead to the enrichment of lipids important for Gag targeting and assembly. Collectively, our results reveal why non-cleavage site mutations have far-reaching implications outside of Gag proteolysis, with important consequences for drugging Gag maturation intermediates and tackling protease inhibitor resistance.","Samsudin, Firdaus; Gan, Samuel Ken-En; Bond, Peter J.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,28,8

Arterial hypercapnia is common in AHF and has been associated with a higher rate of intubation and non-invasive ventilation in the Emergency Room (ER), but its prognostic value has never been studied in the prehospital setting. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on the charts of all patients taken care of by a physician-staffed prehospital mobile unit between June 2016 and September 2019 in Geneva. After approval by the ethics committee, charts were screened to identify all adult patients with a diagnosis of AHF in whom a prehospital arterial blood gas (ABG) sample was drawn. The main predictor was prehospital hypercapnia. The primary outcome was the admission rate in an acute care unit (ACU, composite of intensive care and high-dependency units). Secondary outcomes were ER length of stay (LOS), orientation from ER (intensive care unit, high-dependency unit, general ward, discharge home), intubation rate at 24 h, hospital LOS and hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with a diagnosis of AHF were analysed. Hypercapnia was found in 61 (58%) patients and vital signs were more severely altered in this group. The overall ACU admission rate was 48%, with a statistically significant difference between hypercapnic and non-hypercapnic patients (59% vs 33%, p = 0.009). ER LOS was shorter in hypercapnic patients (5.4 h vs 8.9 h, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between prehospital arterial hypercapnia, acute care unit admission, and ER LOS in AHF patients.","Fabre, Mathias; Fehlmann, Christophe A.; Gartner, Birgit; Zimmermann-Ivoll, Catherine G.; Rey, Florian; Sarasin, François; Suppan, Laurent",BMC Emerg Med,28,1

The world economy was severely impacted and business-as-usual activities severely disrupted. The situation presented the necessity to make a trade-off between individual health and safety on one hand and socio-economic progress on the other. Based on the current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, a broad set of control measures has emerged along dimensions such as restricting people’s movements, high-volume testing, contract tracing, use of face masks, and enforcement of social-distancing. However, these interventions have their own limitations and varying level of efficacy depending on factors such as the population density and the socio-economic characteristics of the area. To help tailor the intervention, we develop a configurable, fine-grained agent-based simulation model that serves as a virtual representation, i.e., a digital twin of a diverse and heterogeneous area such as a city. In this paper, to illustrate our techniques, we focus our attention on the Indian city of Pune in the western state of Maharashtra. We use the digital twin to simulate various what-if scenarios of interest to (1) predict the spread of the virus; (2) understand the effectiveness of candidate interventions; and (3) predict the consequences of introduction of interventions possibly leading to trade-offs between public health, citizen comfort, and economy. Our model is configured for the specific city of interest and used as an in-silico experimentation aid to predict the trajectory of active infections, mortality rate, load on hospital, and quarantine facility centers for the candidate interventions. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a novel agent-based model that seamlessly captures people, place, and movement characteristics of the city, COVID-19 virus characteristics, and primitive set of candidate interventions, and (2) a simulation-driven approach to determine the exact intervention that needs to be applied under a given set of circumstances. Although the analysis presented in the paper is highly specific to COVID-19, our tools are generic enough to serve as a template for modeling the impact of future pandemics and formulating bespoke intervention strategies.","Barat, Souvik; Parchure, Ritu; Darak, Shrinivas; Kulkarni, Vinay; Paranjape, Aditya; Gajrani, Monika; Yadav, Abhishek; Kulkarni, Vinay",Trans Indian Natl,28,1

Consensual understanding (social representations) of home, if unexamined, risks retaining primordial, stable, bounded and historically continuous dimensions. The focus of this article, to this end, is the public’s understanding of home. The “un-homing” techniques used by populist leaders are brought into dialogue with how citizens, as dialogical selves, talk about home. The contours of common-sense on belonging are being informed; it is proposed by a third wave of decolonization. Stimulus-led interviews (N = 76) were conducted in England, Germany, Ireland, Scotland and Sweden. Dialogical analysis shows the public use two social representations relating to (i) freedom of movement and (ii) how the world is organized. These social representations decolonize home beyond national/transnational boundaries towards the transglobal. Citizens, irrespective of degree of migration, navigate future (in) securities using intergenerational dialogue. This serves to anchor transglobal migration-mobility to intergenerational continuity and the possibilities of travelling together through life. Public dialogue, when diffracted into a spectrum of positions on home, has the capacity to counter black/white, us/them, xenophobic protectionism within nationalist populism.

Patients with uncontrolled asthma are at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, highlighting the priority of adequate asthma control during the pandemic. Staying indoors exposes asthmatics to indoor asthma triggers, including disinfectants used for limiting the virus spread, in addition to psychological stresses of the pandemic which represent crucial contributors to loss of asthma control. Elective medical care, curtailed by the lockdown procedures, compromises adequate asthma follow up. The current study evaluated the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the level of asthma control and mental health of bronchial asthma patients. The study included 264 bronchial asthma patients, aged 12 years and older, who responded to an online questionnaire including the asthma control test to evaluate asthma control in the preceding 4 weeks. Anxiety and depression scores and the impact of event scale were also provided. RESULTS: Seventy percent of asthmatics had uncontrolled asthma, and disinfectant use was associated with perceived increase in asthma symptoms in 77.7%. Anxiety and depression were associated with uncontrolled asthma in 50% of participants, suggesting a possible psychological impact on asthma patients. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown, asthma patients participating in the study had significantly uncontrolled disease and associated anxiety and depression. Since regular follow-up of asthma patients is cornerstone to adequate asthma control, alternative methods of medical care for asthma patients during lockdown are warranted, and particular need for mental health support ought to be provided as a continuum to adequate asthma control.","Sheha, Dina S.; Abdel-Rehim, Asmaa S.; Abdel-Latif, Osama M.; Abdelkader, Maryam A.; Raafat, Riham H.; Sallam, Sarah A.; Mostafa, Nayera S.",Egypt J Bronchol,28,16

The publication of the results of the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) has underlined the importance of anatomic characterization of coronary heart disease by visualizing coronary plaques. Aided by machine learning/artificial intelligence, algorithms have been established for reproducible automated quantitative coronary plaque volumetry. These advances have led to questioning the significance of measuring myocardial ischemia, as it results secondarily from coronary plaque formation. Furthermore, the understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease has changed: the volume of (noncalcified) coronary plaque formation, its localization and dynamics as characteristics of vulnerability, appear to be more important than the focus on a large atheroma or expansive (outward) remodeling of individual plaques. In the guidelines coronary CTA has been promoted to the first-line diagnostic measure in both chronic and acute coronary syndromes without ST-elevation, with an equal strength of recommendation compared with classical imaging ischemia tests. Apart from this, cardiac CT is increasingly used for treatment planning of diseases, particularly of aortic and tricuspid valves, but also other structural heart diseases e.g. occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA).","Schmermund, Axel; Breitbart, Philipp; Eckert, Joachim; Magedanz, Annett; Schmidt, Marco; Voigtländer, Thomas",Kardiologe,28,1

This study examines people’s experiences and mental health in the 6th consecutive lockdown week in Portugal and compares with the pre-confinement population’s mental health. Specifically, we explore the difficulties experienced by the general population while in lockdown, their strategies to cope with it, and its impact on mental health. One thousand five hundred and two participants undergoing the 6th lockdown week answered a web-based cross-sectional survey. Demographic information, living conditions, confinement-related difficulties or challenges, strategies to cope with lockdown and mental health dimensions were assessed. Some difficult confined related experiences and sociodemographic variables were associated with poor mental health. When compared to our findings, the general population’ mental health was better before the pandemic. Lockdown challenges experienced by participants and their strategies to cope with confinement predicted 10 to 42% of the variance in mental health dimensions. This study identified several mental health-protective and risk factors related to long-term compulsory confinement. Individual strategies to prevent mental health problems are discussed.

This paper presents a real and financial social accounting matrix (FSAM) capable of distinguishing the direct and indirect effects that are transferred from micro-, small, medium, and large firms to the rest of the economy. We use the hypothetical extraction method (HEM) to explore the sequence of reactions associated with shocks that arise from the COVID-19 lockdown. Using a structural model for the Spanish economy, we identify the role of different firm size categories in the aggregate gross domestic product (GDP). Our results allow us to reconcile the mixed narrative that accompanies the evaluation of the role played by these categories in economic activity by revealing that both SMEs and large firms are important for supporting economic activity. In particular, SMEs help explain 43% of the income and two-thirds of the unemployment decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also show the importance of conditioning SME industrial policy to sectoral analysis. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The effects of the macroeconomic lockdown and its transmission to the rest of the economy differ by firm size and across sectors. Using the Spanish context for micro-, small, medium, and large firms, we distinguish the direct and indirect effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main implications are the following: (1) Research: results emphasize that SMEs and large firms are both important to support economic activity but, in order to account for the relative effects on SMEs, it is crucial to consider the specific sector that receives the disruption. 2) Policy: SMEs are an important focus of business support policies within the EU.

The present study sought to inform training in telepsychology (i.e., telehealth delivery of psychological services) by using both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the perspectives of doctoral students who have already been involved in such training. METHOD: A total of 19 predoctoral students from two universities, with at least some experience in telepsychology training, provided their perspectives on two complementary research questions: (1) How do students perceive their level of competence in various domains of telepsychology?; and (2) What are students’ perspectives on the process of telepsychology competency development during their doctoral training? RESULTS: The results of our study provide early evidence that doctoral trainees are able to develop telepsychology competencies and suggest that a supportive, training-oriented environment and fit between telepsychology and existing programmatic areas of emphasis are likely key to success. CONCLUSIONS: Continued efforts to enhance training in providing telepsychology services should focus on how to best define, measure, and promote competency development in this emerging specialty area.","Dopp, Alex R; Mapes, Ayla R; Wolkowicz, Noah R; McCord, Carly E; Feldner, Matthew T",Digit Health,28,1

In this study, we focused on cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN), which is an image translation technique using deep learning, and we conducted mutual stain conversion between Giemsa and Papanicolaou in cytological images using CycleGAN. METHODS: A total of 191 Giemsa-stained images and 209 Papanicolaou-stained images were collected from 63 patients with lung cancer. From those images, 67 images from nine cases were used for testing and the remaining images were used for training. For data augmentation, the number of training images was increased by rotation and inversion, and the images were pipelined to CycleGAN to train the mutual conversion process involving Giemsa- and Papanicolaou-stained images. Three pathologists and three cytotechnologists performed visual evaluations of the authenticity of cell nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell layouts of the test images translated using CycleGAN. RESULTS: As a result of converting Giemsa-stained images into Papanicolaou-stained images, the background red blood cell patterns present in Giemsa-stained images disappeared, and cell patterns that reproduced the shape and staining of the cell nuclei and cytoplasm peculiar to Papanicolaou staining were obtained. Regarding the reverse-translated results, nuclei became larger, and red blood cells that were not evident in Papanicolaou-stained images appeared. After visual evaluation, although actual images exhibited better results than converted images, the results were promising for various applications. DISCUSSION: The stain translation technique investigated in this paper can complement specimens under conditions where only single stained specimens are available; it also has potential applications in the massive training of artificial intelligence systems for cell classification, and can also be used for training cytotechnologist and pathologists.","Teramoto, Atsushi; Yamada, Ayumi; Tsukamoto, Tetsuya; Kiriyama, Yuka; Sakurai, Eiko; Shiogama, Kazuya; Michiba, Ayano; Imaizumi, Kazuyoshi; Saito, Kuniaki; Fujita, Hiroshi",Heliyon,28,1

With a lockdown that lasted almost three months and an impulse to new normality, transport demand has suffered a considerable impact in the Spanish case. It is mandatory to explore the effect of the pandemic on changes in travel behaviour in post-COVID-19 times. METHODOLOGY: A nationwide survey was carried out during the lockdown in Spring 2020 to overview the recent changes. The survey collected both stated preferences (socio-demographic characteristics and mobility-related attributes), and revealed preferences (individuals’ habits, especially in the frequency of the trips according to the trip purpose, and opinions regarding the willingness and acceptability of these changes, and which actors would have to drive them, and how) of individuals. This paper aims to study and understand the willingness to adopt a set of measures to improve the safety conditions of public transport and shared mobility services against possible contagion from COVID-19 and the willingness to pay for them. RESULTS: The results obtained show that some measures, such as the increase of supply and vehicle disinfection, result in a greater willingness to use public transport in post-COVID-19 times. Similarly, the provision of covers for handlebars and steering wheels also significantly increases individuals’ willingness to use sharing services. However, respondents expect that these measures and improvements would be implemented but maintaining the same pre-COVID-19 prices. The results of this research might help operators deploy strategies to adopt their services and retain users.","Awad-Núñez, Samir; Julio, Raky; Gomez, Juan; Moya-Gómez, Borja; González, Julián Sastre",Eur,28,1

These have been well studied in humans and other mammalian species, but much has still to be learned about the bovine collectins and the role they may play in the health and disease in cattle which have significant economic implications to the agricultural and food industries. This chapter focuses on the bovine collectins, which are important innate immune molecules and play a key role in immunoregulation and protection against pathogens. Like other mammalian collectins, they all have a related structure comprised of an N-terminal triple-helical collagen-like region and a ligand binding C-terminal C-type lectin domain. The bovine collectins are able to recognise and bind to complex glycoconjugates, particularly on the surface of microbes, neutralising infection, enhancing clearance by phagocytes and modulating immune response. Here, we will review the bovine collectins, surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), mannose binding lectins (MBL-A and MBL-C), conglutinin (CGN), collectin 43 (CL-43) and collectin 46 (CL-46), and their role in bovine immunity and disease. We will particularly focus on the structural, functional and anti-microbial roles of these collectins with an additional focus on genetic polymorphisms in their genes and predisposition to infectious diseases in the bovine host.

This research investigates students’ response to new educational environment in terms of two criteria: changes in overall course satisfaction, and the most preferable format of training. To get students’ feedback we conducted an anonymous survey in LMS Moodle for 350 first year students at North-Western State Medical University named after I.I. Mechnikov. The survey measured 3 key parameters of the course satisfaction: course expectations fulfillment, learning environments satisfaction, and achieving personal goals. Analysis of the survey outcomes shows that educational process was not disrupted despite the abrupt and rapid character of the introduction of the totally remote classroom. Since students had been familiar with learning digital tools, their goals and needs in education did not change. Psychological aspect gives reasons for the biggest concern: students miss safety and comfort of a conventional classroom. In general, course satisfaction and students’ motivation were not affected largely by the introduction of the totally remote classroom.

In this study, we examined megalocytivirus-induced RNA responses in the spleen of flounder by high-throughput sequencing and integrative analysis of various RNA-seq data. A total of 1327 microRNAs (miRNAs), including 368 novel miRNAs, were identified, among which, 171 (named DEmiRs) exhibited significantly differential expressions during viral infection in a time-dependent manner. For these DEmiRs, 805 differentially expressed target mRNAs (DETmRs) were predicted, whose expressions not only significantly changed after megalocytivirus infection but were also negatively correlated with their paired DEmiRs. Integrative analysis of immune-related DETmRs and their target DEmiRs identified 12 hub DEmiRs, which, together with their corresponding DETmRs, formed an interaction network containing 84 pairs of DEmiR and DETmR. In addition to DETmRs, 19 DEmiRs were also found to regulate six key immune genes (mRNAs) differentially expressed during megalocytivirus infection, and together they formed a network consisting of 21 interactive miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) pairs. Further analysis identified 9434 circular RNAs (circRNAs), 169 of which (named DEcircRs) showed time-specific and significantly altered expressions during megalocytivirus infection. Integrated analysis of the DETmR-DEmiR and DEcircR-DEmiR interactions led to the identification of a group of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) constituted by interacting triplets of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA involved in antiviral immunity. Together these results indicate that complicated regulatory networks of different types of non-coding RNAs and coding RNAs are involved in megalocytivirus infection.","Wu, Qian; Ning, Xianhui; Sun, Li",Int J Mol Sci,28,1

Recently, it has been suggested in experimental models that the elimination of senescent cells with pharmacological methods delays, prevents, and improves multiple adverse outcomes related to age. In this sense, the so-called senoylitic compounds are a class of drugs that selectively eliminates senescent cells (SCs) and that could be used in order to delay such adverse outcomes. Interestingly, the first senolytic drug (navitoclax) was discovered by using chemoinformatic and network analyses. Thus, in the present study, we searched for novel senolytic compounds through the use of chemoinformatic tools (fingerprinting and network pharmacology) over different chemical databases (InflamNat and BIOFACQUIM) coming from natural products (NPs) that have proven to be quite remarkable for drug development. As a result of screening, we obtained three molecules (hinokitiol, preussomerin C, and tanshinone I) that could be considered senolytic compound candidates since they share similarities in structure with senolytic leads (tunicamycin, ginsenoside Rb1, ABT 737, rapamycin, navitoclax, timosaponin A-III, digoxin, roxithromycin, and azithromycin) and targets involved in senescence pathways with potential use in the treatment of age-related diseases.","Barrera-Vázquez, Oscar Salvador; Gómez-Verjan, Juan Carlos; Magos-Guerrero, Gil Alfonso",Biomolecules,28,1

This study assesses heritability of basal temperature and explores effects of ageing on basal temperature and temperature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Observational study using multiple cohorts. Participants: (a) Twin volunteers: 1089 healthy adults enrolled in Twins-UK, mean age 59 (17); tympanic temperature measurements; (b) Community-based: 3972 adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application, age 43 (13); self-reported test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; self-reported temperature measurements; (c) Hospitalised: cohorts of 520 and 757 adult patients with emergency admission to two teaching hospitals between 01/03/2020–04/05/2020, age 62 (17) and 68 (17) respectively; RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. ANALYSIS: (a) heritability analysed using saturated and ACE univariate models; linear mixed-effect model for associations between basal temperature and age, sex and BMI. (b&c) multivariable linear regression for associations between temperature and age, sex and BMI; multivariable logistic regression for associations between fever(>/= 37.8°C) and age, sex and BMI. RESULTS: Basal temperature in twins demonstrated 50% heritability (95%CI[42–57%]). In healthy twin, community-based and hospitalised cohorts, increasing age is associated with lower temperatures, and increasing BMI with higher temperatures: (a) Twins (age:p < 0.001; BMI:p = 0.002); (b) Community-based (age: p < 0.001; BMI: p < 0.001); (c) Hospitalised (1st hospital: age: p = 0.106; BMI: p = 0.033; 2nd hospital: age: p < 0.001; BMI: p = 0.010). Increasing age was negatively and BMI positively associated with fever (1st hospital: Age: OR = 0.99, p = 0.033; BMI: OR = 1.00, p = 0.045; 2nd hospital: Age: OR = 0.99, p = 0.010; BMI: OR 1.02, p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Heritability of basal temperature suggests a genetic component to thermoregulation. Associations observed between increasing age and lower temperatures and higher BMI and higher temperatures are important in understanding effects of ageing and obesity on basal temperature and the fever response. In older adults, findings have important implications for defining fever thresholds and diagnosing infections, including SARS-CoV-2.","Penfold, R S; Zazzara, M B; Österdahl, M F; Veenith, T; Lord, J M; Steves, C J",Age Ageing,28,1

In this paper, we aimed to analyse the perspectives of Swiss experts on the topic of health data ownership and control. DESIGN: In our qualitative study, we selected participants through purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and then analysed thematically. SETTING: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person, via phone or online. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 48 experts (researchers, policy makers and other stakeholders) of the Swiss health-data framework. RESULTS: We identified different themes linked to data ownership. These include: (1) the data owner: data-subjects versus data-processors; (2) uncertainty about data ownership; (3) labour as a justification for data ownership and (4) the market value of data. Our results suggest that experts from Switzerland are still divided about who should be the data owner and also about what ownership would exactly mean. There is ambivalence between the willingness to acknowledge patients as the data owners and the fact that the effort made by data-processors (eg, researchers) to collect and manage the data entitles them to assert ownership claims towards the data themselves. Altogether, a tendency to speak about data in market terms also emerged. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a satisfactory account of data ownership as a concept to organise the relationship between data-subjects, data-processors and data themselves is an important endeavour for Switzerland and other countries who are developing data governance in the healthcare and research domains. Setting clearer rules on who owns data and on what ownership exactly entails would be important. If this proves unfeasible, the idea that health data cannot truly belong to anyone could be promoted. However, this will not be easy, as data are seen as an asset to control and profit from.","Martani, Andrea; Geneviève, Lester Darryl; Elger, Bernice; Wangmo, Tenzin",BMJ Open,28,1

This article analyses the markets in the Mediterranean to map the drivers and feedback loops that keep fisheries in an unsustainable trajectory and reviews the key innovations in support of a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable small-scale fishing sector. We show how the current market is dominated by lack of product traceability and underappreciation of the inherent value of SSF products (e.g. local production, freshness, season dependence, quantitatively and culinary varied nature). In addition, due to a lack of organisation and the capacity to act, small-scale fishers are poised to have little to no influence over the price. In what we conceptualise as a response to the negative effects of existing market structures, we identify and classify initiatives that add value to SSF products, but not exclusively. These are the shortening of the value chain, innovation in the distribution channel, diversification in the type of product offered, promotion and education regarding SSF products, label and brand development and the empowerment of SSF communities through improved leadership, ownership, cooperation and coordination. We provide examples of these activities and propose the key types of intervention at various levels of governance to accelerate and capitalise on them in order to accomplish policy goals and achieve a better status of both the oceans and the fishers.","Penca, Jerneja; Said, Alicia; Cavallé, Marta; Pita, Cristina; Libralato, Simone",Maritime Studies,28,20

Clinical Case: A 61-years-old healthy man was admitted in the hospital emergency with hypertension, facial flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting and tremors. The patient presented hypertensive encephalopathy requiring orotracheal intubation. During the procedure, after rocuronium administration, the arterial pressure levels suddenly incresead more. An abdomen CT performed for vomiting investigation showed a mass in the left upper quadrant measuring 12.3 x 8.1 x 11.4 cm, central cystic area and sparse coarse calcifications, solid component density of 30 UH in the non-contrast phase and absolut washout of 48%, suggesting phaeochromocytoma (FEO) etiology. The patient renal function impaired and hemodialysis was required as replacement therapy. Even with small amount of urine available for exams, 24h urine tests were compatible with FEO diagnosis: (normetanephrines above 4260 mcg/L, n< 732 mcg/L, 250 mL of urine). Considering the severity of symptoms, a chest CT scan was provided, not demonstrating any metastatic disease. Parenteral antihypertensive medication to manage blood pressure was required and this withdraw was reached after the introduction of prazosin 2 mg twice a day. After adequate preoperative preparation, the surgical removal was performed. Systolic BP intraoperative fluctuations occurred, with variations between 70 and 210mmHg. Splenectomy was necessary due the intimate contact with the adrenal mass. No obvious metastases were observed. The anatomopathological showed a 390 grams adrenal mass confirming FEO (PASS score 5). Genetic panel for phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma with complete sequencing found no pathogenic variants in any of the 22 genes analyzed, suggesting sporadic etiology. The patient got infected with COVID-19 after a family visitor confirmed by molecular test. He developed mild respiratory symptoms, delaying his hospital discharge. He was released seven weeks after surgery with complete kidney recover function using low doses of prazosin. Plasma metanephrines and normetanephrines were normal. Conclusion: Phaeochromocytoma is a rare disease with no specific clinical signs and symptoms. It implies in potentially lethal cardiovascular complications, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand it is a curable illness through the surgical tumor removal. Attention should be paid to high blood pressure levels even after the tumor is removed which can be justified by the remaining vascular hypertrophy as long as the suspicion of malignant FEO is excluded.","Dultra Bastos, Gabriel Fernando; Falcão, Camila Kruchewsky; Lins Rolim, Maria Creusa de Albuquerque",J Endocr Soc,28,1

In this paper, the problem of searching for an exponentially increasing number of targets in a complex and unknown environment is addressed. Our main objective is to propose a Robotic target search strategy based on the Elephants Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm, namely Robotic-EHO (REHO). The main additions were the collision-free path planning strategy, the velocity limitation, and the extension to the multi-target version in discrete environments. The proposed method has been the subject of many experiments, emulating the search of infected individuals by COVID-19 in a context of containment within complex and unknown random environments, as well as in the real case study of the USA. The particularity of these environments is their increasing targets’ number and the dynamic Containment Rate (CR) that we propose. The experimental results show that REHO reacts much better in high CR, early start search mission, and where the robots’ speed is higher than the virus spread speed.","Houacine, Naila Aziza; Drias, Habiba",Prog Artif Intell,28,1

This review aimed to identify and to summarize the best available evidence on the fungal contamination in the indoor air of critical hospital areas with an emphasis on pediatric/neonatal ICUs. Publications from 2005 to 2019 were searched in the databases Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Search (PubMed), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS).

Several such systems are now commercially available for children and young people. While all available systems have been shown to improve glycaemic control and quality of life in this population, qualitative data also highlights the challenges in using closed-loop systems, which vary among different pediatric age-groups. Very young children require systems that are able to cope with low insulin doses and significant glycaemic variability due to their high insulin sensitivity and unpredictable eating and exercise patterns. Adolescents' compliance is often related to size and number of devices, usability of the systems, need for calibrations, and their ability to interact with the system.

In 2015, NHS England published a commissioning policy enabling the use of bosentan for digital ulceration in SSc in patients refractory to intravenous 6-8 weekly prostanoid in combination with sildenafil following standard therapy (including calcium channel blockers (CCB), ACE inhibitors, losartan and fluoxetine). Bosentan is licensed to prevent new DUs in SSc. Specialist MDT ratification and Blueteq registration is required. RCTs showed bosentan reduced the formation of new DU by 30-50% in at risk individuals. It is a well-tolerated drug. It is now off-patent so its cost has reduced from £22,000 to £650 per year. Aim To audit current departmental practice in patients receiving prostanoid (epoprostenol) for severe RP from any cause and check adherence to the patient pathway for treatment escalation prior to prostanoid therapy. To determine approximate costs of alternative therapeutic approaches. Methods We retrospectively audited patients attending our day unit for epoprostenol infusions over a 12-month period between 2018 and 2019. Using our centre’s admissions database and electronic patient records, we identified which oral medications patients were currently co-prescribed or had previously trialled. Using pharmacy data and tariff costings, we calculated the cost of epoprostenol infusions and oral medications with blood monitoring. Results Between 2018 and 2019, 73 patients attended for epoprostenol infusions: 31 SSc, 25 RP, 17 other diagnoses (mixed/undifferentiated CTD, SLE, vasculitis). The mean number of epoprostenol infusions per patient per year was 5.92 days (range 1-25). The percentage of patients who had first been trialled on the following medications include: CCB 77.4%, ACEi/ARB 41.1%, fluoxetine 9.59%, sildenafil 87.1% and tadalafil 25.8%. In the SSc group 22.6% had also trialled bosentan. Only 2 SSc patients (6.45%) had trialled all of the drugs on the pathway prior to prostanoid reflecting the relative lack of efficacy of some first line therapies. The departmental tariff per prostanoid infusion is £450, resulting in an estimated average annual cost of £2700 per patient. The annual cost of supplying bosentan 125mg twice daily plus blood monitoring for the first year is approximately £1350. Conclusion Epoprostenol is used in our unit for patients with severe RP from a range of conditions. Sildenafil and CCB have been trialled in the majority of our patients prior to escalation. Only a minority of patients have received bosentan according to current guidelines and licensing. Given the reduction in cost, combined with the importance of avoiding hospital admissions with COVID-19, we would suggest that bosentan could be used earlier in the treatment pathway for a broader range of indications.

METHODS: This is an observational, cross-sectional study, with data collection from October to December 2020 at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The participants answered an online survey with questions on socioeconomic status, demographics, and food insecurity (Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale). A logistic regression model was constructed to investigate socioeconomic variables associated with food insecurity. RESULTS: Overall, 1327 volunteers participated in the study; 66.5% were undergraduates, 8.5% post-graduation students, 13.5% administrative staff, and 11.5% professors. Undergraduates presented a higher prevalence of African-Americans than the other studied groups (11.4% vs. 5.3% in post-graduation students, 5.0% in administrative servers, 3.9% professors, P = 0.004). 23.2% of the undergraduates presented an income up to the minimum wage vs. 1.8% in post-graduation students, 0.6% in administrative servers, and 0.0% in professors (P < 0.0005). More undergraduates and post-graduation students had more reduced family income during the pandemic than other groups (44.3% and 41.6%, respectively vs. 37.6% in administrative staff and 28.1% in professors, P < 0.0005). Food insecurity was more present in undergraduates (32.1% with mild food insecurity, 11.5% moderate and 4.8% severe), than in the other studied groups (post-graduation students: 25.7% mild, 2.7% moderate and 2.6% severe; administrative servers: 19% mild, 1.7% moderate, 0.0% severe; professors: 9.8% mild, 0.0% moderate or severe; P < 0.0005).

Historically, the US has been forced to relax its antitrust enforcement policies during its largest wartime mobilizations in order to urgently produce goods and services needed in the war effort. Likewise, when the COVID-19 pandemic began, companies should have been allowed to collaborate with each other and with the US government to adequately respond to the increased demand for healthcare goods and services. Guidance from antitrust agencies during the coronavirus pandemic suggested a willingness to allow such collaborations, but the guidance lacked specificity. This article suggests specific policies that the antitrust agencies should implement during pandemics in order to give companies confidence that they can legally engage in collaborations that will hasten the production and distribution of urgently needed healthcare goods and services. However, relaxing antitrust laws has historically caused and prolonged economic downturns. Thus, during a pandemic, the federal government should relax antitrust laws, but that relaxation could exacerbate the inevitable economic downturn caused by social distancing policies. Accordingly, this article suggests how the US government could use non-antitrust regulations to mitigate the systemic financial risk created by that relaxation in antitrust laws.","Banks, Nicolo",,28,16

In COPD, the relationship between the neutrophil serine protease, neutrophil elastase, and its endogenous inhibitor, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is the best characterised. AAT belongs to a superfamily of serine protease inhibitors known as serpins. Advances in screening technologies have, however, resulted in many members of the serpin superfamily being identified as having differential expression across a multitude of chronic lung diseases compared to healthy individuals. Serpins exhibit a unique suicide-substrate mechanism of inhibition during which they undergo a dramatic conformational change to a more stable form. A limitation is that this also renders them susceptible to disease-causing mutations. Identification of the extent of their physiological/pathological role in the airways would allow further expansion of knowledge regarding the complexity of protease regulation in the lung and may provide wider opportunity for their use as therapeutics to aid the management of COPD and other chronic airways diseases.","Kelly-Robinson, Gillian A.; Reihill, James A.; Lundy, Fionnuala T.; McGarvey, Lorcan P.; Lockhart, John C.; Litherland, Gary J.; Thornbury, Keith D.; Martin, S.

Collaborative capacity refers to the extent to which providers have influence over other healthcare workers’ decision-making, and can be assessed by measuring perceptions of task interdependence, quality of interaction and collaborative influence. However, each healthcare worker may present differing perceptions that can influence their ability to collaborate effectively during provision of care. No studies that specifically assessed healthcare workers’ perception of collaborative capacity in Malawi were identified. AIM: To assess the perceptions of healthcare workers regarding collaborative capacity in Malawi. SETTING: The study was conducted at a tertiary public hospital in Blantyre city, Malawi. METHODS: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional correlational design. The instrument used was a Care Coordination survey that had been used previously in similar studies in the United States of America. Descriptive statistics as well as univariate and multivariate analysis were computed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: A total of 384 healthcare workers participated in the study, with a response rate of 100%. There were differences in perceptions of collaborative capacity based on the cadre of the respondent (p < 0.005). Medical staff reported higher mean scores on quality of interaction (2.94) and collaborative influence (2.65), whereas technical support staff reported the lowest mean scores across all three measures of collaborative capacity (≤ 2.4). CONCLUSION: Differences in perceptions about collaborative capacity suggest the need for interventions to enhance interprofessional collaboration. CONTRIBUTION: The study will inform strategies to promote interprofessional collaboration.","Soko, Tulipoka N.; Jere, Diana L.; Wilson, Lynda L.",Health SA,28,1

A recent narrative, endorsed by tech-billionaires, says we face mass unemployment, and we need a basic income. In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is a purely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Both the global financial crisis from 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 illustrate the importance of social and legal policy, and suggest it is time to learn. Taking lessons from history, it is clear that unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy. To uphold human rights, governments should reprogramme the law, for full employment, fair incomes and more leisure, on a living planet. Robot owners will not automate your job away, if we defend economic democracy.","McGaughey, Ewan",,28,1

However, moral opposition to COVID-19 vaccine research can be based on other considerations, both secular and religious. We argue that religious or personal moral objections to vaccine research are unethical and irresponsible, and in an important sense often irrational. They are unethical because of the risk of causing serious harm to other people for no valid reason; irresponsible because they run counter to individual and collective responsibilities to contribute to important public health goals; and in the case of certain kinds of religious opposition, they might be irrational because they are internally inconsistent.

This antipsoriatic effect could be mediated not only by the glucose-lowering action of these agents but also via inhibition of keratinocyte over proliferation, increase expression of differentiation markers, suppression the immune inflammatory pathway, and blocking the calcium channels and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. On the other hand, there was no significant increase in adverse reactions associated with the treatment of pioglitazone or metformin. However, previous studies often had the relatively short duration of the trials, and did not have enough power to assess recurrence of psoriasis.

In this paper we present the methods for our new individual-level modelling representing all commuters in England and Wales. METHODS: Scenario commuter cycling potential in the PCT is modelled as a function of route distance and hilliness between home and work. Our new individual-level approach has allowed us to create an additional “Near Market” scenario where age, gender, ethnicity, car ownership and area level deprivation also affect an individual's likelihood of switching to cycling. For this and other scenarios, we calculate the carbon benefits of cycling uptake based on the trip distance and previous mode, while health benefits are additionally affected by hilliness and baseline average mortality risk. This allows the estimation of how health and carbon benefits differ by demographic group as well as by scenario. RESULTS: While cycle commuting in England and Wales is demographically skewed towards men and white people, women and people from ethnic minorities have greater cycling potential based on route distance and hilliness. Benefits from cycling uptake are distributed differently again. For example, while increasing female cycling mode share is good for equity, each additional female cyclist generates a smaller average health and carbon benefit than a male cyclist. This is based on women's lower baseline mortality risk, shorter commute travel distances, and lower propensity to commute by car than men. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a new approach to modelling that allows for more sophisticated and nuanced assessment of cycling uptake and subsequent benefits, under different scenarios. Health and carbon are increasingly incorporated into appraisal of active travel schemes, valuing important outcomes. However, especially with better representation of demographic factors, this can act as a barrier to equity goals.","Woodcock, James; Aldred, Rachel; Lovelace, Robin; Strain, Tessa; Goodman, Anna",J Transp Health,28,1

In the landing phase, information of poses estimated by a marker (ArUco) detection technique using a camera, ultrawideband (UWB) devices, and the drone’s software estimation are merged by utilizing an extended Kalman filter algorithm to improve the landing precision. A vector field-based method controls the drone to follow the desired path smoothly, reducing vibrations or harsh movements that could harm the transported parcel. Real experiments validate the delivery strategy and allow the evaluation of the performance of the adopted techniques.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) of dental practitioners regarding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS An online questionnaire was distributed among dentists across the globe using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. The questionnaire was divided into 4 sections: the 1st one contained personal information, whereas the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sections assessed knowledge (11 questions), attitudes (6 questions) and practices (7 questions) of the dentists. The data was subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate linear regression, and Pearson's correlation; 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and odds ratio (OR) was obtained. The analysis was done using IBM SPSS for Windows, v. 21.0. RESULTS The total number of the responses received (860) was divided with regard to various continents (Asia, Americas - North and South, Europe, Africa, and other - Australia and Antarctica). The largest number of dentists came from the Asian continent (264; 30.7%). Most dentists had a degree of MDS (Master of Dental Science) (301; 35.0%), followed by BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) (282; 32.8%) and DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) (226; 26.3%).

BACKGROUND The goal of LLR is to extend the benefits of the laparoscopic approach without compromising the fundamental principles of open liver surgery. LLR, however, presents unique technical challenges and its evaluation is made difficult by the restricted indications for this approach, the few centers world-wide experienced in the technique, and the heterogeneity of procedures and pathologies involved. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of liver resections from a unit with a comprehensive liver program, including resection and transplantation. RESULTS There were 166 laparoscopic liver resections between May 23, 1996 and December 31, 2007, including 100 (60%) for malignant pathology (64 HCC, 3 cholangiocarcinoma, 33 hepatic metastases) and 66 for benign pathology (adenoma, 23; FNH, 19; cystic, 17; other, 7). Numbers of resections for benign indications remained stable over time whereas those for malignant indications increased. There were 31 major resections, 56 left lateral sectionectomies, 28 segmentectomies, and 51 tumorectomies. There was 0% mortality and 15.1% morbidity. Median blood loss was 200 mL, 9 patients (5.4%) required transfusion, and median operating time was 180 minutes. Left lateral sectionectomies demonstrated reduced bleeding (median, 175 vs. 300 mL, P = 0.0015) and faster operating time (median, 170 vs. 180 minutes, P = 0.0265). In the second half of the experience, there was reduced bleeding (median, 200 vs. 300 mL, P = 0.0022) and a lower conversion rate (2.4% vs. 16.9%, P = 0.0015). CONCLUSIONS Good patient selection and refined surgical technique are the keys to successful LLR. The indications for resection of asymptomatic benign lesions should not be increased because the laparoscopic approach is available. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are more likely to be suitable to a laparoscopic approach than colorectal liver metastases. Left lateral sectionectomy and limited resection of solitary peripheral lesions are particularly suitable while hemihepatectomies remain challenging procedures. LLR requires an ongoing robust audit to identify any emerging problems.","Bryant, Richard; Laurent, Alexis; Tayar, Claude; Cherqui, Daniel",Annals of surgery,28,1

This study evaluated the ability of ultrasonic shear wave elastography to observe these changes in the brain after TBI in vivo. METHODS Mice and rats received a mild TBI or sham surgery and were imaged acutely or 24 hours after injury using shear wave elastography, and the hemispheric stiffness values were compared. RESULTS Stiffness values were consistent across brain hemispheres of sham TBI rodents. By 24 hours after TBI, relative brain tissue stiffness values for mice and rats each decreased ipsilaterally and increased contralaterally, both relative to each other and compared to sham TBI rodents (P < .05). The absolute tissue elasticity value increased for rats (P < .05) but not for mice. CONCLUSIONS Differences between intrahemispheric stiffness values of rodent brains by 24 hours after mild TBI may reflect the observed edema and hemorrhage ipsilateral to TBI and the known reduction of cerebral blood flow in both brain hemispheres. If these hypotheses hold true, ultrasonic shear wave elastography may offer a method for detecting adverse changes in fluid content within the brain after mild TBI.","Xu, Zinnia S; Yao, Anning; Chu, Stephanie S; Paun, Marla K; McClintic, Abbi M; Murphy, Sean P; Mourad, Pierre D",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,28,27

66339,66339,66339,Die Familienpräsenz sichern.,12.143982,3.2406566,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Moderate sedation is routinely performed in patients undergoing minor therapeutic and diagnostic procedures outside the operating room. The level of sedation is often monitored by sedation nurses using clinical criteria, such as sedation scores. The Bispectral Index (BIS) is derived from changes in the electroencephalograph profile that may provide an objective measure of the level of sedation. In this prospective observational study, we investigated whether using BIS values to guide sedative drug administration influences the level of sedation and the incidence of adverse events compared with using Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) only in nurse-administered moderate sedation. We hypothesized that both depth of sedation and the incidence of adverse events related to oversedation would decrease when sedation nurses used BIS values to help guide sedative drug administration. METHODS Sedation care was provided by trained sedation nurses under the supervision of a physician performing the procedure. The sedation regimen was initiated with IV midazolam 1 to 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg or hydromorphone 0.2 mg. Additional small boluses of midazolam, fentanyl, or hydromorphone were administered to maintain an RSS of 2 to 3 (cooperative, oriented, and responding to verbal command). Propofol was not used. Information including patient demographics, type of procedure, medication administered, RSS, and rates of adverse events was recorded by the sedation nurses for each patient on a computer-readable form. The study was divided into 3 phases. In phase 1 (baseline, 6 months' duration), baseline data on sedation practice were prospectively collected. There was no change from standard of care for all patients except that each patient had a BIS sensor attached, but the monitor was covered and nurses were blinded to the BIS values. In phase 2 (training, 3 months), the sedation nurses received comprehensive education on the use of BIS to guide sedative drug administration, pharmacology of commonly used drugs, and methods for rescue from oversedation. The recommended BIS range for moderate sedation was 75 to 90. Adequate training of all sedation nurses on the use of BIS was documented. In phase 3 (implementation, 6 months), the BIS values were used to guide drug administration. RESULTS Data were available on 1766 patients (999 and 767 patients in phases 1 and 3, respectively). Most of the procedures were colonoscopies, upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, examinations under anesthesia, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and central venous access catheter placements. No differences in the demographics between the 2 groups were observed. The RSS was inversely associated with the BIS value, r = -0.16 (95% confidence interval, -0.19 to -0.12; P < 0.00001). An RSS of 2 to 3 was maintained in 94% of patients in phase 1 and 96% of patients in phase 3 The mean (±SD) BIS values were 80.9 ± 6.8 in phase 1 and 80.4 ± 6.5 in phase 3. The number of sedation-related adverse events was lower in our sample when BIS was used, with an odds ratio of 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.62; P < 0.0001), and patients with restlessness had a lower BIS value than those without this symptom (P < 0.0001). No serious adverse events or deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS Nurse-administered moderate sedation using midazolam and fentanyl was usually associated with appropriate levels of sedation as assessed by both the RSS and BIS with an overall low incidence of adverse events. The use of BIS did not change the mean level of sedation significantly, although the number of sedation-related adverse events appears to be lower when BIS was used.","Yang, Katie S; Habib, Ashraf S; Lu, Minyi; Branch, M S; Muir, Holly; Manberg, Paul; Sigl, Jeffrey C; Gan, Tong J",Anesthesia and analgesia,28,19

However, data are scarce on the association between the time from onset and reperfusion results. Objective To analyze the rate of reperfusion after EVT started at different intervals after symptom onset in patients with AIS. Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 7 randomized trials of the Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices (HERMES) group. This is a multicenter cohort study of the intervention arm of randomized clinical trials included in the HERMES group. Patients with anterior circulation AIS who underwent EVT for M1/M2 or intracranial carotid artery occlusion were included. Each trial enrolled patients according to its specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on patients eligible but not enrolled (eg, refusals or exclusions) were not available. All analyses were performed by the HERMES biostatistical core laboratory using the pooled database. Data were analyzed between December 2010 and April 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures Successful reperfusion was defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 at the end of the EVT procedure adjusted for age, occlusion location, pretreatment intravenous thrombolysis, and clot burden score and was analyzed in relation to different intervals (onset, emergency department arrival, imaging, and puncture) using mixed-methods logistic regression. Results Among the 728 included patients, with a mean (SD) age of 65.4 (13.5) years and of whom 345 were female (47.4%), decreases in rates of successful reperfusion defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 were observed with increasing time from admission or first imaging to groin puncture. The magnitude of effect was a 22% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95) per additional hour between admission and puncture and a 26% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93) per additional hour between imaging and puncture. Conclusions and Relevance Because the probability of reperfusion declined significantly with time between hospital arrival and groin puncture, we provide additional arguments for minimizing the intervals after symptom onset in anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke.","Bourcier, Romain; Goyal, Mayank; Liebeskind, David S; Muir, Keith W; Desal, Hubert; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Dippel, Diederik W J; Majoie, Charles B; van Zwam, Wim H; Jovin, Tudor G; Levy, Elad I; Mitchell, Peter J; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Davis, Stephen M; Derraz, Imad; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Demchuk, Andrew M; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Kelly, Michael; Roos, Yvo B; Jahan, Reza; van der Lugt, Aad; Sprengers, Marieke; Velasco, Stephane; Lycklama À Nijeholt, Geert J; Ben Hassen, Wagih; Burns, Paul; Brown, Scott; Chabert, Emmanuel; Krings, Timo; Chloe, Hana; Weimar, Christian; Campbell, Bruce C V; Ford, Gary A; Ribo, Marc; White, Phil; Cloud, Geoffrey C; San Roman, Luis; Davalos, Antoni; Naggara, Olivier; Hill, Michael D; Bracard, Serge",JAMA neurology,28,1

METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis of 124 trials (28 240 patients) comparing a total of 10 strategies: saline, statin, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), NAC+NaHCO3, ascorbic acid, xanthine, dopaminergic agent, peripheral ischemic preconditioning, and natriuretic peptide. Compared with saline, the risk of CIAKI was reduced by using statin (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.26-0.67), xanthine (OR, 0.32; 95% CrI, 0.17-0.57), ischemic preconditioning (OR, 0.48; 95% CrI, 0.26-0.87), NAC+NaHCO3 (OR, 0.50; 95% CrI, 0.33-0.76), NAC (OR, 0.68; 95% CrI, 0.55-0.84), and NaHCO3 (OR, 0.66; 95% CrI, 0.47-0.90). The benefit of statin therapy was consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses, whereas the efficacy of all the other strategies was questioned by restricting the analysis to high-quality trials. Overall, high heterogeneity was observed for comparisons involving xanthine and ischemic preconditioning, although the impact of NAC and xanthine was probably influenced by publication bias/small-study effect. Hydration alone was the least effective preventive strategy for CIAKI. Meta-regressions did not reveal significant associations with baseline creatinine and contrast volume. In patients with diabetes mellitus, no strategy was found to reduce the incidence of CIAKI. CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary procedures, statin administration is associated with a marked and consistent reduction in the risk of CIAKI compared with saline. Although xanthine, NAC, NaHCO3, NAC+NaHCO3, ischemic preconditioning, and natriuretic peptide may have nephroprotective effects, these results were not consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses.","Giacoppo, Daniele; Gargiulo, Giuseppe; Buccheri, Sergio; Aruta, Patrizia; Byrne, Robert A; Cassese, Salvatore; Dangas, George; Kastrati, Adnan; Mehran, Roxana; Tamburino, Corrado; Capodanno, Davide",Circulation.

Payments may influence physicians' clinical decision making and drug prescribing. PURPOSE To evaluate whether receipt of payments from the drug industry is associated with physician prescribing practices. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EconLit were searched without language restrictions. The search had no limiting start date and concluded on 16 September 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies that estimated the association between receipt of industry payments (exposure) and prescribing (outcome). DATA EXTRACTION Pairs of reviewers extracted the primary analysis or analyses from each study and evaluated risk of bias (ROB). DATA SYNTHESIS Thirty-six studies comprising 101 analyses were included. Most studies (n = 30) identified a positive association between payments and prescribing in all analyses; the remainder (n = 6) had a mix of positive and null findings. No study had only null findings. Of 101 individual analyses, 89 identified a positive association. Payments were associated with increased prescribing of the paying company's drug, increased prescribing costs, and increased prescribing of branded drugs. Nine studies assessed and found evidence of a temporal association; 25 assessed and found evidence of a dose-response relationship. LIMITATION The design was observational, 21 of 36 studies had serious ROB, and publication bias was possible. CONCLUSION The association between industry payments and physician prescribing was consistent across all studies that have evaluated this association. Findings regarding a temporal association and dose-response suggest a causal relationship.

Curcumin has been indicated to be neuroprotective against neurological and psychological disorders. However, the role of curcumin in autistic phenotypes remains unclear. OBJECTIVES In the current study, we evaluated the effects of neonatal curcumin treatment on behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBRT+ltpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model of autism. METHODS C57BL/6J (C57) and BTBR mouse pups were treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or curcumin (20 mg/kg) from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P8. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) were evaluated on P8, and neurogenesis was measured on P24 by immunofluorescence. A battery of behavioral tests was carried out when the mice were 8 weeks of age. RESULTS Neonatal curcumin treatment improved autism-related symptoms in BTBR mice, enhancing sociability, reducing repetitive behaviors, and ameliorating cognitive impairments. Furthermore, the suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBR mice was greatly rescued after neonatal curcumin treatment, leading to an increase in neurogenic processes and an increase in NPC proliferation concomitant with an expansion of the NPC pool on P8, and NPC differentiation towards the neuronal lineage was promoted in the DG of BTBR mice on P24. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that neonatal curcumin treatment elicits a therapeutic response through the restoration of hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBR mice and thus may represent a promising novel pharmacological strategy for ASD treatment.","Zhong, Hongyu; Xiao, Rui; Ruan, Ruotong; Liu, Hui; Li, Xin; Cai, Yun; Zhao, Jinghui; Fan, Xiaotang",Psychopharmacology,28,22

These treatments can lead to inadvertent immune suppression and may increase the risk of viral infection. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a JAK family member required for efficient type I interferon (IFN-α/β) signaling. We report here that selective TYK2 inhibition preferentially blocked potentially detrimental type I IFN signaling, whereas IFN-λ-mediated responses were largely preserved. In contrast, the clinically used JAK1/2 inhibitor baricitinib was equally potent in blocking IFN-α/β- or IFN-λ-driven responses. Mechanistically, we showed that epithelial cells did not require TYK2 for IFN-λ-mediated signaling or antiviral protection. TYK2 deficiency diminished IFN-α-induced protection against lethal influenza virus infection in mice but did not impair IFN-λ-mediated antiviral protection. Our findings suggest that selective TYK2 inhibitors used in place of broadly acting JAK1/2 inhibitors may represent a superior treatment option for type I interferonopathies to counteract inflammatory responses while preserving antiviral protection mediated by IFN-λ.","Schnepf, Daniel; Crotta, Stefania; Thamamongood, Thiprampai; Stanifer, Megan; Polcik, Laura; Ohnemus, Annette; Vier, Juliane; Jakob, Celia; Llorian, Miriam; Gad, Hans Henrik; Hartmann, Rune; Strobl, Birgit; Kirschnek, Susanne; Boulant, Steeve; Schwemmle, Martin; Wack, Andreas; Staeheli, Peter",Science immunology,28,1

We explored whether such a low VT could be adequately delivered by ICU ventilators, and whether such low VTs prevent the heated humidifier (HH) from reaching the recommended target of 33 mg/L absolute humidity (AH). METHODS We attached a lung model to 5 ICU ventilators set in volume controlled mode and body temperature and pressure saturated. We ran 2 protocols over a 100-280 mL VT range used with adult or neonatal breathing circuit at a breathing frequency (f) of 15 (f15) or 30 (f30) breaths/min. In the first protocol, with the HH off, VT was measured with a dedicated data logger and expressed in body temperature and pressure saturated. The relationships of measured VT to set VT were studied, and the relative error in VT was analyzed within its 10% boundaries. In the second protocol, the HH was on, and we measured AH using a psychrometric method. The relationship of AH to set VT was analyzed with linear regression. RESULTS For the 5 ventilators used, the slope (95% CI) between measured VT versus set VT averaged 0.93 (0.92-0.93), 0.93 (0.93-0.94), 0.91 (0.90-0.91), and 0.91 (0.90-0.91) mL/mL for adult and neonatal circuits at f15 and f30, respectively (P < .05 vs 1 in each instance), indicating a systematic under-delivery of VT. The VT relative error fell within the ±10% accuracy range for only 2 ventilators with adult circuits at f15 and f30. AH increased linearly with VT. The recommended target of 33 mg/L AH was reached with all of the ventilators for the adult circuit at f30 only. The minimum volume that met the recommended threshold for AH was 100, 150, 190, 160, and 100 mL for the G5, Carestation, PB980, Servo-U, and V500 ventilators, respectively, at f30. CONCLUSION Low VT was systematically under-delivered by modern ICU ventilators by roughly 7-9%. To meet the recommended target of 33 mg/L AH, adult circuit at f30 should be used.","Moro, Barbara; Baboi, Loredana; Yonis, Hodane; Subtil, Fabien; Louis, Bruno; Guérin, Claude",Respiratory care,28,1

We evaluated the performance of TBDCapSeq to surveil samples that included human whole blood, mouse tissues, and field-collected ticks. For Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti, the sensitivity of TBDCapSeq was comparable and occasionally exceeded the performance of agent-specific quantitative PCR and resulted in 25 to > 10,000-fold increase in pathogen reads when compared to standard unbiased sequencing. TBDCapSeq also enabled genome analyses directly within vertebrate and tick hosts. The implementation of TBDCapSeq could have major impact in studies of tick-borne pathogens by improving detection and facilitating genomic research that was previously unachievable with standard sequencing approaches.","Jain, Komal; Tagliafierro, Teresa; Marques, Adriana; Sanchez-Vicente, Santiago; Gokden, Alper; Fallon, Brian; Mishra, Nischay; Briese, Thomas; Kapoor, Vishal; Sameroff, Stephen; Guo, Cheng; Marcos, Luis A; Hu, Linden; Lipkin, W Ian; Tokarz, Rafal",Scientific reports,28,1

Additionally, there is significant international variability in the index management, and few published data on real-world clinical practice. The aim of DAMASCUS is to identify areas of practice variability and their potential association with differences in short- and medium-term clinical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS DAMASCUS is an international, collaborative, prospective observational study, recruiting patients from over 200 sites across six continents. The study opened in October 2020, with a rolling start. Identification of new sites will cease in February 2021 and data collection will cease in August 2021. All adult patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis (radiologically or intraoperatively) at each participating centre will be included. The primary objective of DAMSCUS is to assess for national and international variability in the presentation and index management of acute diverticulitis (medical, interventional radiology and surgical). Secondary objectives include assessing 30-day and 6-month clinical outcome data (re-admission, re-intervention, morbidity and mortality) and variations in surgical procedures for those undergoing surgery. All data will be recorded and managed using a secure REDCap electronic data capture tool and analysed using Stata (SE) version 16.1. The results will be reported in accordance with the STROBE statement. CONCLUSION By analysing variations in the management of acute diverticulitis and the subsequent outcomes, DAMASCUS will be an important step towards identifying optimal care for patients with diverticulitis.","Vimalachandran, Dale",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,28,33

We sought to investigate the relationship between colonic stool burden and slow transit constipation, as determined by a radiopaque marker (ROM) transit study. METHODS A retrospective cohort population was assembled, consisting of adult patients with chronic constipation who underwent testing with both a ROM study and anorectal manometry at 2 tertiary care centers over 5 years. Stool burden was graded by 2 independent observers, with colonic transit being assessed by the Hinton method. RESULTS Of 361 patients, 145 (40.3%) had slow transit constipation, and women were more likely than men to have slow transit constipation (42.3% vs 26.5%, P = 0.04). The mean stool burden scores by observer 1 and observer 2 for patients with slow transit constipation were significantly higher than the mean stool burden scores for patients with normal transit constipation (8.1 ± 1.6 vs 6.9 ± 1.9, P < 0.0001; 8.5 ± 1.5 vs 5.8 ± 1.6, P < 0.0001). The Pearson correlation coefficient for the stool burden score and number of remaining ROMs was 0.31 (moderate) for observer 1 (P < 0.0001) and 0.62 (strong) for observer 2 (P < 0.0001), whereas the Pearson correlation coefficient for interrater reliability of the stool burden score was 0.58 (P < 0.0001), indicating a strong correlation. The ideal score cutoff for both observers was 7, with moderate agreement by Cohen's kappa (0.43, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Stool burden assessment on AXR may be a reliable alternative ROM study in the assessment of colonic transit.","Cangemi, David J; Flanagan, Ryan; Barshop, Kenneth; Kuo, Braden; Staller, Kyle",The American journal of gastroenterology,28,16

We herein report the case of a child who underwent laparoscopic extirpation of a large omental lipoblastoma. A 4-year-old girl was diagnosed with an intra-abdominal solid tumor. Abdominal imaging revealed a fat density mass that was well encapsulated and measured 18 × 15 × 7.5 cm in size. Considering the MRI findings and movability of the tumor, we strongly suspected that the lesion was an omental lipoblastoma. We initially decided to perform laparoscopic exploration and, if possible, extirpation of the solid tumor sequentially. A total of five trocars were used, and the tumor was found to originate from the omentum. We successfully performed complete resection of the tumor laparoscopically. A histological examination revealed lipoblastoma. For large abdominal tumors in children, the laparoscopic approach is recommended as the first procedure when the tumor is preoperatively considered to be benign and resectable.","Furukawa, Taizo; Aoi, Shigeyoshi; Sakai, Kohei; Higashi, Mayumi; Fumino, Shigehisa; Tajiri, Tatsuro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,28,32

The relationship of coagulation tests and thrombosis requires investigation to identify best diagnostic and treatment approaches. We assessed for hypercoagulable characteristics in critically-ill COVID-19 patients using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and explored relationships of D-dimer and ROTEM measurements with thrombotic complications. METHODS Critically-ill adult COVID-19 patients receiving ROTEM testing between March-April 2020 were analyzed. Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation prior to ROTEM were excluded. ROTEM measurements from COVID-19 patients were compared to non-COVID-19 patients matched by age, sex, and body mass index. Intergroup differences in ROTEM measurements were assessed using t-tests. Correlations of D-dimer levels to ROTEM measurements were assessed in COVID-19 patients who had available concurrent testing. Intergroup differences of D-dimer and ROTEM measurements were explored in COVID-19 patients with and without thrombosis. RESULTS Of 30 COVID-19 patients receiving ROTEM, we identified hypercoagulability from elevated fibrinogen compared to non-COVID-19 patients (FIBTEM MCF: 47+/-13mm vs 20+/-7mm; mean intergroup difference: 27.4mm; 95%CI: 22.1mm-32.7mm; p<0.0001). In our COVID-19 cohort, thrombotic complications were identified in 33%. In COVID-19 patients developing thrombotic complications, we identified higher D-dimer levels (17.5+/-4.3ug/mL vs 8.0+/-6.3ug/mL; mean difference: 9.5ug/mL; 95%CI: 13.9-5.1; p<0.0001) but lower FIBTEM MCF (39.7+/-10.8mm vs 50.1+/-12.0mm; mean difference: -11.2mm; 95%CI: -2.1 to -20.2; p=0.02) compared to patients without thrombosis. We identified negative correlations of D-dimer levels and ROTEM MCF in these patients (r: -0.61; p=0.001). CONCLUSION We identified elevated D-dimer levels and hypercoagulable blood clot characteristics from increased fibrinogen on ROTEM testing in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. However, we identified lower, albeit still hypercoagulable, ROTEM measurements of fibrinogen in COVID-19 patients with thrombotic complications compared to those without. Further work is required to externally validate these findings and to investigate the mechanistic drivers for these relationships to identify best diagnostic and treatment approaches for these patients.

Our aim was to investigate the physical and mental demands of mobile x-ray imaging on radiographers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, within a local NHS Trust. METHODS A total of 16 participants from 1 NHS Trust took part within this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data was obtained through an online survey. Statistical data was obtained via the Trust Radiology Information System (RIS). Data was gathered for the thirteen weeks from 23rd March to 21st June 2020 (the first wave); direct comparison was made to the same period in 2019. RESULTS Three key themes emerged from the data. These include mental health challenges/work morale in Radiology, demand of mobile imaging and departmental and Trust-wide mental health support. Results indicate a high demand in mobile imaging which has made a significant difference in the working life of some radiographers. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental health of a proportion of radiographers at this Trust. Results indicate high workload and demand in mobile imaging has made a significant difference to the working life of radiographers, specifically the ones who were relatively newly qualified. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Two key interventions are proposed from this study. The first one is to provide and promote mental health support within radiology departments. The second is to encourage dual working on mobile x-ray examinations to help manage the emotional and physical burden.","Yasin, B; Barlow, N; Milner, R",Radiography,28,7

Now, it has spread to over 200 countries. COVID 19-associated respiratory syndrome is causing a lot of mortality and morbidity. There are reports suggesting that the complications and ARDS associated with COVID 19 is an immune response reaction. The cytokine storm associated with severe cases of COVID 19 acts as a cause of death in many sick patients. It has been shown that COVID 19 is associated with a peculiar immune profile: Decrease in CD3, CD4, CD8, natural killer cell and B-cells; Rise in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha; Decrease in IL-10; Decrease in interferon-gamma. Low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) immunosuppressive features resulting from M2 macrophage phenotype activation, increase in IL-10, transforming growth factor beta, a decrease in IL-6, TNF alpha and an increase in CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell counts may negate the harmful effects of cytokine release syndrome. Literature review shows that radiation was previously used to treat viral pneumonia with a good success rate. This practice was discontinued in view of the availability of effective antibiotics and antivirals. As there are no scientifically proven treatment for severe COVID 19-associated respiratory distress today, it is prudent that we understand the benefits of LDRT at this critical juncture and take rational decisions to treat the same. This article provides an radioimmunological rationale for the treatment of immune crisis mediated complications in severe cases of COVID 19.","Kumar, Rishabh; Haresh, Kunhi Parambath; Sharma, Daya Nand; Gupta, Anil; Gupta, Subhash; Vellaiyan, Subramani; Rath, Goura Kishor",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,28,32

The NDHM architecture is initially expected to be a claims platform for the national health insurance programme 'Ayushman Bharat' that serves 500 million people. Such large-scale digitisation and mobility of health data will have significant ramifications on care delivery, population health planning, as well as on the rights and privacy of individuals. Traditional mechanisms that seek to protect individual autonomy through patient consent will be inadequate in a digitised ecosystem where processed data can travel near instantaneously across various nodes in the system and be combined, aggregated, or even re-identified.In this paper we explore the limitations of 'informed' consent that is sought either when data are collected or when they are ported across the system. We examine the merits and limitations of proposed alternatives like the fiduciary framework that imposes accountability on those that use the data; privacy by design principles that rely on technological safeguards against abuse; or regulations. Our recommendations combine complementary approaches in light of the evolving jurisprudence in India and provide a generalisable framework for health data exchange that balances individual rights with advances in data science.","Saksena, Nivedita; Matthan, Rahul; Bhan, Anant; Balsari, Satchit",BMJ global health,28,5

In 2018, samples from Ross 308 breeding hens aged 35 weeks were delivered for IBV diagnosis. IBV presence was detected, but all attempts to amplify the S gene fragment were negative. The field material was analysed using the Illumina MiSeq platform and a 1073-nt fragment of the S1 coding region was obtained. The gCoV/ck/Poland/516/2018 strain shared only 52.7-58.1% nucleotide identity to any known genotypes of IBV and shared the highest identity of 81.4% to the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant. Based on the obtained sequence, a specific molecular test was constructed and used for screening of chicken samples from 35 field cases delivered to our laboratory between 2018 and 2019 for IBV diagnosis. Application of this test enabled detection of another three chicken flocks as positive for this new strain. All positives were identified in commercial layers with egg production problems. To date, the virus has not been detected in broiler chickens.Taking into account the proposed criteria for the definition of a new IBV genotype or lineage, it seems that the detected viruses in Poland together with the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant may be classified as a separate lineages/genotype in the new IBV classification.RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS - The new IBV variant is distantly related to other known GI-GVII IBV genotypes/lineages- It affects long-lived birds causing egg production problems- The detected IBV together with the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant are candidates for separate lineages in the new GVIII genotype.","Domanska-Blicharz, Katarzyna; Sajewicz-Krukowska, Joanna; Lisowska, Anna",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,28,16

Such dietary inadequacies may be detrimental for their current and future health. Schools are favorable settings to establish healthy eating practices. Still, no school meal arrangement is provided in Norway, and most children typically bring packed lunches from home. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serving a free healthy school meal for one year resulted in a higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of unhealthy snacks in total among 10-12-year-olds in Norway. METHODS The School Meal Project in Southern Norway was a non-randomized trial in two elementary schools in rural areas in the school year 2014/2015. The study sample consisted of 10- to 12-year-old children; an intervention group (N = 55) and a control group (N = 109) resulting in a total of 164 school children at baseline. A food frequency questionnaire was completed by the children at baseline, at five months follow-up and after one year to assess fruit, vegetable, and snacks intake. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess intervention effects on overall intake of fruit and vegetables and unhealthy snacks. RESULTS Serving of a free healthy school meal for one year was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches in the intervention group compared to the control group, adjusted for baseline intake (B: 1.11 (95% CI: .38, 1.85)) at the end of the intervention. No other significant intervention effects were found for the remaining fruit and vegetables measures. Serving of a free healthy school meal was not associated with a lower weekly intake of unhealthy snacks (i.e. potato chips, candy, sugar sweetened beverages) in the intervention group compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS A free healthy school meal was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches but did not significantly change any other investigated dietary behaviors. However, given the inadequate intake of vegetables among children and that even moderate improvements have public health relevance, a free healthy school meal for all school children could be beneficial.

Shunt complications are frequent with an estimated 20-40% failure rate within the first year, and 4.5% per year subsequently. We have an open-door 'possible shunt malfunction' pathway for children treated with a shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy, providing direct ward access to ensure rapid assessment and timely management of children. OBJECTIVE To audit the 'possible shunt malfunction' pathway in terms of clinical outcomes (percentage-confirmed shunt dysfunction and number of re-attendances) and costs. METHODS Clinical data for patients attending the triage service were prospectively recorded over 7 months-including the number of attendances, previous shunt revisions, shunt type, investigations performed (CT, x-rays), and outcome. Costings (e.g. costs of physician, inpatient stay, investigations) were obtained from the hospital's procurement department. RESULTS In the study period, there were 81 attendances by 62 patients and only 16% of attendances resulted in surgical management (either shunt revision or ETV). Approximately 17% of patients re-attended at least once. The average cost per attendance in our pathway was £765.57 ($969.63; €858.73). The total expenditure for the pathway over 7 months was £62,011.03 ($78,540.07; €69,556.81), with inpatient stay making up the biggest percentage of cost (49.2%). CONCLUSION Only 16% (13 attendances) of those attending through our pathway required neurosurgical intervention. Investigations for possible blocked shunt come at significant health, social, and financial cost. High rates of shunt failure, re-attendance, investigations, and inpatient stays incur a sizable financial burden to the healthcare system.","Tong, Liting; Higgins, Louise; Sivakumar, Gnanamurthy; Tyagi, Atul; Goodden, John; Chumas, Paul",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,28,19

Encephalopathy caused by or arising from seizures, especially nonconvulsive seizures (NCS), often requires electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring for diagnosis. The prevalence of seizures and other EEG abnormalities among COVID-19-infected patients is unknown. METHODS Medical records and EEG studies of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infections over a 2-month period at a single US academic health system (four hospitals) were reviewed to describe the distribution of EEG findings including epileptiform abnormalities (seizures, periodic discharges, or nonperiodic epileptiform discharges). Factors including demographics, remote and acute brain injury, prior history of epilepsy, preceding seizures, critical illness severity scores, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were compared to EEG findings to identify predictors of epileptiform EEG abnormalities. RESULTS Of 111 patients monitored, most were male (71%), middle-aged or older (median age 64 years), admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU; 77%), and comatose (70%). Excluding 11 patients monitored after cardiac arrest, the most frequent EEG finding was moderate generalized slowing (57%), but epileptiform findings were observed in 30% and seizures in 7% (4% with NCS). Three patients with EEG seizures did not have epilepsy or evidence of acute or remote brain injury, although all had clinical seizures prior to EEG. Only having epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] 5.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-21) or seizure(s) prior to EEG (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.7-13) was independently associated with epileptiform EEG findings. SIGNIFICANCE Our study supports growing evidence that COVID-19 can affect the central nervous system, although seizures are unlikely a common cause of encephalopathy. Seizures and epileptiform activity on EEG occurred infrequently, and having a history of epilepsy or seizure(s) prior to EEG testing was predictive of epileptiform findings. This has important implications for triaging EEG testing in this population.","Pellinen, Jacob; Carroll, Elizabeth; Friedman, Daniel; Boffa, Michael; Dugan, Patricia; Friedman, David E; Gazzola, Deana; Jongeling, Amy; Rodriguez, Alcibiades J; Holmes, Manisha",Epilepsia,28,31

OBJECTIVES The main objective of the present study is to analyze in the Iberian population the effect of 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with NOA in Han Chinese through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and to establish their possible functional relevance in the development of specific SpF patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS We genotyped 674 Iberian infertile men (including 480 NOA and 194 SO patients) and 1058 matched unaffected controls for the GWAS-associated variants PRMT6-rs12097821, PEX10-rs2477686, CDC42BPA-rs3000811, IL17A-rs13206743, ABLIM1-rs7099208, and SOX5-rs10842262. Their association with SpF, SO, NOA, and different NOA phenotypes was evaluated by logistic regression models, and their functional relevance was defined by comprehensive interrogation of public resources. RESULTS ABLIM1-rs7099208 was associated with SpF under both the additive (OR=0.86, P=0.036) and dominant models (OR=0.78, P=0.026). The CDC42BPA-rs3000811 minor allele frequency was significantly increased in the subgroup of NOA patients showing maturation arrest (MA) of germ cells compared to the remaining NOA cases under the recessive model (OR=4.45, P=0.044). The PEX10-rs2477686 SNP was associated with a negative testicular sperm extraction (TESE) outcome under the additive model (OR=1.32, P=0.034). The analysis of functional annotations suggested that these variants affect the testis-specific expression of nearby genes and that lincRNA may play a role in SpF. CONCLUSIONS Our data support the association of 3 previously reported NOA risk variants in Asians (ABLIM1-rs7099208, CDC42BPA-rs3000811, and PEX10-rs2477686) with different manifestations of SpF in Iberians of European descent, likely by influencing gene expression and lincRNA deregulation.","Cerván-Martín, Miriam; Bossini-Castillo, Lara; Rivera-Egea, Rocío; Garrido, Nicolás; Luján, Saturnino; Romeu, Gema; Santos-Ribeiro, Samuel; Castilla, José A; Carmen Gonzalvo, M; Clavero, Ana; Vicente, F Javier; Guzmán-Jiménez, Andrea; Burgos, Miguel; Barrionuevo, Francisco J; Jiménez, Rafael; Sánchez-Curbelo, Josvany; López-Rodrigo, Olga; Peraza, M Fernanda; Pereira-Caetano, Iris; Marques, Patrícia I; Carvalho, Filipa; Barros, Alberto; Bassas, Lluís; Seixas, Susana; Gonçalves, João; Larriba, Sara; Lopes, Alexandra M; Carmona, F David; Palomino-Morales, Rogelio J",Andrology,28,5

The mean follow-up period for the patients operated on in our department was 17 months until the time of the analysis. None of the patients showed any leakage or stricture, and no mediastinal complications were reported in the group. Following our own experience, mechanical anastomosis with the use of a circular stapler seems to decrease the time of the operation as well as significantly reducing the incidence of leakages from the anastomosis. This type of anastomosis may decrease the number of postoperative strictures and the most dangerous mediastinal infections.","Zieliński, Jacek; Jaworski, Radosław; Irga-Jaworska, Ninela; Haponiuk, Ireneusz; Jaśkiewicz, Janusz",Kardiochirurgia i torakochirurgia polska = Polish journal of cardio-thoracic surgery,28,26

Several toxins and pathogens bind to these glycans to enter the cells. Understanding the fundamentals of the complex interplay between microbial pathogens and their glycan receptors at the molecular level could lead to the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Using Shiga toxin and influenza virus as examples, we describe the complex biological interface between host glycans and these infectious agents, and recent strategies to develop glycan-based high-affinity ligands. These molecules are expected to ultimately be incorporated into diagnostics and therapeutics, and can be used as probes to study important biological processes. Additionally, by focusing on the specific glycans that microbial pathogens target, we can begin to decipher the ""glycocode"" and how these glycans participate in normal and aberrant cellular communication.","Kulkarni, Ashish A; Weiss, Alison A; Iyer, Suri S",Medicinal research reviews,28,30

Our objective was to assess the current early complication rate associated with biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) since the introduction of a laparoscopic approach in our institution, a university-affiliated tertiary care center. METHODS A consecutive series of 1000 patients who had undergone BPD-DS from November 2006 to January 2010 was surveyed. The primary endpoint was the mortality rate. The secondary endpoints were the major 30-day complication rate and hospital stay >10 days. The data are reported as a mean ± SD, comparing the laparoscopic (n = 228) and open (n = 772) groups. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 43 ± 10 years (40 ± 10 years in the laparoscopy group versus 44 ± 10 years in the open group, P < .01). The preoperative body mass index was 51 ± 8 kg/m(2) (47 ± 7 laparoscopy versus 52 ± 8 kg/m(2) open, P < .01). The conversion rate in the laparoscopy group was 2.6%. There was 1 postoperative death (.1%) from a pulmonary embolism in the laparoscopy group. The mean hospital stay was shorter after laparoscopic surgery (6 ± 6 d versus 7 ± 9 d, P = .01), and a hospital stay >10 days was more frequent in the open group (4.4% versus 7%, P = .04). Major complications occurred in 7% of the patients, with no significant differences between the 2 groups (7% versus 7.4%, P = .1). No differences were found in the overall leak or intra-abdominal abscess rate (3.5% versus 4%, P = .1); however, gastric leaks were more frequent after open surgery (0% versus 2%, P = .02). During a mean 2-year follow-up, 1 additional death occurred from myocardial infarction, 2 years after open BPD-DS. CONCLUSION The early and late mortality rate of BPD-DS is low and comparable to that of other bariatric surgeries.","Biertho, Laurent; Lebel, Stéfane; Marceau, Simon; Hould, Frédéric-Simon; Lescelleur, Odette; Moustarah, Fady; Simard, Serge; Biron, Simon; Marceau, Picard",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,28,1

Customized radiofrequency energy is applied via the percutaneous route to produce skin tightening and fascia contraction at body temperature, avoiding thermal injury. We combine PRD with lipoplasty and call this combined procedure dermaplasty-assisted lipoplasty (DAL). The purpose of this study was to review both the safety and efficacy of DAL. METHODS We developed the required novel device and technique to perform DAL and then performed a clinical trial including Type I and Type II lipodystrophy female patients undergoing a primary liposuction of the circumferential trunk. The trial comprised two phases. In Phase I, 51 patients were included in a prospective, comparative, controlled trial and divided into two groups. In Group 1, 29 patients underwent DAL, and in Group 2, 22 patients underwent a standard suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL) alone. In Phase II, 84 patients underwent DAL, including 9 cases initially scheduled for a mini-abdominoplasty. RESULTS Phase I: We found better aesthetic results with DAL (93.1%) than with SAL alone (72.7%) [p < .05]. Postoperative correction of flaccid skin was superior with DAL (93.1%) than with SAL alone (36.4%) [p < .01]. Phase II: DAL achieved good-to-excellent aesthetic results in 94% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS DAL was found to be a reliable and safe treatment for fat removal with concomitant skin and fascia tightening but without compromising the viability of the overlying skin.

Direct evidence is lacking as few studies have directly compared different race distances. This study aimed to investigate the etiology of deficits in neuromuscular function following short versus long trail-running races. Thirty-two male trail runners completed one of five trail-running races as LONG (>100 km) or SHORT (<60 km). Pre- and post-race, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque and evoked responses to electrical nerve stimulation during MVCs and at rest were used to assess voluntary activation and muscle contractile properties of knee-extensor (KE) and plantar-flexor (PF) muscles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess evoked responses and corticospinal excitability in maximal and submaximal KE contractions. Race distance correlated with KE MVC (ρ = -0.556) and twitch (ρ = -0.521) torque decreases (P ≤ 0.003). KE twitch torque decreased more in LONG (-28 ± 14%) than SHORT (-14 ± 10%, P = 0.005); however, KE MVC time × distance interaction was not significant (P = 0.073). No differences between LONG and SHORT for PF MVC or twitch torque were observed. Maximal voluntary activation decreased similarly in LONG and SHORT in both muscle groups (P ≥ 0.637). TMS-elicited silent period decreased in LONG (P = 0.021) but not SHORT (P = 0.912). Greater muscle-contractile property impairment in longer races, not central perturbations, contributed to the correlation between KE MVC loss and race distance. Conversely, PF fatigability was unaffected by race distance.","Temesi, John; Besson, Thibault; Parent, Audrey; Singh, Benjamin; Martin, Vincent; Brownstein, Callum G; Espeit, Loïc; Royer, Nicolas; Rimaud, Diana; Lapole, Thomas; Féasson, Léonard; Millet, Guillaume Y",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,28,8

Considering the severity of disease and the widespread geographical occurrence of CCHFV, investigating viral entry is of great value for development of antivirals. In this study, we have shown that knockdown of clathrin by small interfering RNA significantly reduced CCHFV nucleocapsid protein and viral RNA levels, suggesting that CCHFV utilizes clathrin-dependent endocytosis. In contrast, caveolin-1, an important constituent of caveolae endocytosis, is not important in CCHFV infection. Moreover, treatment with drugs that are known to interfere with the formation of clathrin-coated pits (sucrose and chlorpromazine) or endosome acidification (bafilomycin A1 and NH(4)Cl) also supported a clathrin-dependent pathway in the entry process of CCHFV. Finally, we demonstrated that cholesterol depletion in the cell plasma membrane significantly inhibited CCHFV infection. In the presence of exogenous cholesterol, this process was reversed, suggesting that cholesterol is important in the life cycle of CCHFV.","Simon, Melinda; Johansson, Cecilia; Mirazimi, Ali",The Journal of general virology,28,19

Cell death of Vero cells after infection with SARS-CoV was reduced upon deletion of ORF 3a. Electron microscopy of infected cells revealed a role for ORF 3a in SARS-CoV induced vesicle formation, a prominent feature of cells from SARS patients. In addition, we report that ORF 3a is both necessary and sufficient for SARS-CoV-induced Golgi fragmentation and that the 3a protein accumulates and localizes to vesicles containing markers for late endosomes. Finally, overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a small GTPase essential for the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus, restored Golgi morphology during infection.

We assessed the post-licensure safety data for IIV3-HD in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 2011-2019. METHODS We searched VAERS for reports after IIV3-HD during 1/1/2011-06/30/2019 in persons aged ≥65 years. Medical records were reviewed for all death reports and for certain pre-specified conditions (e.g. Guillain Barré Syndrome [GBS], anaphylaxis). We also reviewed certain groups who received IIV3-HD erroneously (e.g. pregnant women, children). Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional reporting. RESULTS VAERS received 12,320 reports after IIV3-HD;723 reports (5.9%) were serious. The most common adverse events (AEs) among serious reports were pyrexia (30.2%), asthenia (28.9%), and dyspnea (24.9%), and among non-serious reports were injection site erythema (16.8%), pain in extremity (15.8%), and injection site pain (14.2%). Among 55 death reports, the most common causes of death were diseases of the circulatory system (n = 23;41.8%). Based on medical record review, there were 61 reports of GBS and 13 of anaphylaxis. There were 13 reports of pregnant-women who inadvertently received IIV3-HD; three reports described arm pain or local reactions, and 10 did not report any AE. Among 59 reports of children who erroneously received IIV3-HD, 31 experienced an AE (most commonly injection site or constitutional reactions) and the remaining 28 reports did not describe any AE. CONCLUSIONS Post-licensure safety data of IIV3-HD during 9 influenza seasons revealed no new or unexpected safety concerns among individuals ≥65 years. Inadvertent administration of IIV3-HD to children or pregnant women was observed, although with no serious AEs reported.

DATA SOURCES Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 2018. Search terms included eclampsia, predict, likelihood ratio, predictive value, and risk. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Abstracts and later full texts were selected for review if a diagnosis of eclampsia was made, a comparator arm included (women without a diagnosis of eclampsia), and predictors of imminent eclampsia reported. Of 2,791 retrieved records, 11 were selected. Significant heterogeneity existed between studies, with differing designs, settings, participants, and signs or symptoms. In total, 28 signs or symptoms were reported, with visual disturbances and epigastric pain most common (six studies), followed by headache (five studies), and any edema (four studies). TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Data on study characteristics and predictive value of signs or symptoms were extracted, and, where appropriate, bivariate mixed-effect meta-analysis was applied to raw data. None of the pooled estimates were able to accurately predict eclampsia nor rule out eclampsia in their absence, with moderate specificity (83-94%) and poor sensitivity (29-56%). CONCLUSION There is a dearth of high-quality studies investigating the predictive value of imminent signs and symptoms of eclampsia. Owing to the small number of studies, heterogeneity, and inconsistent reporting, it is difficult to provide accurate estimates of the predictive value of prodromal symptoms of eclampsia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 90 women aged 18 - 45 years (mean age - 33.9 ± 0.31) were recruited in the study: 60 women with UF were included in the study group and 30 healthy women were included in the control group. The lymphocyte count was performed with laser-based flow cytofluorimetry. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon IFN-β (IFN-β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrotizing factor α (TNF-α) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF basic) were detected with ELISA test. The diagnosis of UF was confirmed with histological examination of biopsy specimen. RESULTS Typical clinical features of UF (abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pains, symptoms of adjacent organs compression) were found in 66.67% women in the study group while 18.33% of them had miscarriages and 26.67% had infertility.

Compared to eukaryotic cells, viruses are composed by a limited numbers of proteins that, nevertheless, set up multiple interactions with cellular components, allowing the virus to take control of the infected cell. Each virus/host interaction can be considered as a therapeutical target for new antiviral drugs but, unfortunately, the systematic study of a so huge number of interactions is time-consuming and expensive, calling for models overcoming these drawbacks. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a label-free optical technique to study biomolecular interactions in real time by detecting reflected light from a prism-gold film interface. Launched 20 years ago, SPR has become a nearly irreplaceable technology for the study of biomolecular interactions. Accordingly, SPR is increasingly used in the field of virology, spanning from the study of biological interactions to the identification of putative antiviral drugs. From the literature available, SPR emerges as an ideal link between conventional biological experimentation and system biology studies functional to the identification of highly connected viral or host proteins that act as nodal points in virus life cycle and thus considerable as therapeutical targets for the development of innovative antiviral strategies.","Rusnati, Marco; Chiodelli, Paola; Bugatti, Antonella; Urbinati, Chiara",Critical reviews in microbiology,28,16

However, the full potential of these technologies for early detection and response to natural or intentional disease events has not been fully realised in animal health at the global level. This paper discusses advances made in these technologies and examples of how they have been applied in animal health for near real-time data collection and analysis. The technologies reviewed include: i) mobile health (mHealth) technologies, wireless sensors and biosensors for remote data collection; ii) crowdsourced and Internet-based data collection; and iii) electronic health (eHealth) technologies for data integration and analysis. Experiences of implementing these technologies, and challenges with their use, are also discussed so as to provide recommendations on their future application in animal health. The world is ripe with opportunities to develop and enhance mHealth and eHealth technologies that are cost effective and capable of near real-time data collection and analysis. Such technologies have been shown to be valuable and capable of being implemented in both developing and developed countries, and ultimately will strengthen disease surveillance and reporting across the globe. International mechanisms and data standards are needed to facilitate the sharing and analysis of animal and human health data between countries. Identifying ways in which animal and human health data collection and analysis can be better integrated within a 'One Health' approach will enhance the coordination and capability of disease detection and response at the human-animal interface.","Holmstrom, L; Beckham, T",Revue scientifique et technique,28,1

Most patients who survive the initial hours and days after CA die of postanoxic brain damage. Current monitors, such as electrocardiography and end-tidal capnography, provide only indirect information about the condition of the brain during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In contrast, cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy provides continuous, noninvasive, real-time information about brain oxygenation without the need for a pulsatile blood flow. It measures transcutaneous cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2). This information could supplement currently used monitors. Moreover, an evolution in rSO2 monitoring technology has made it easier to assess rSO2 in CA conditions. OBJECTIVE We give an overview of the literature regarding rSO2 measurements during CPR and the current commercially available devices. We highlight the feasibility of cerebral saturation measurement during CPR, its role as a quality parameter of CPR, predictor of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurologic outcome, and its monitoring function during transport. DISCUSSION rSO2 is feasible in the setting of CA and has the potential to measure the quality of CPR, predict ROSC and neurologic outcome, and monitor post-CA patients during transport. CONCLUSION The literature shows that rSO2 has the potential to serve multiple roles as a neuromonitoring tool during CPR and also to guide neuroprotective therapeutic strategies.","Genbrugge, Cornelia; Dens, Jo; Meex, Ingrid; Boer, Willem; Eertmans, Ward; Sabbe, Marc; Jans, Frank; De Deyne, Cathy",The Journal of emergency medicine,28,1

The primary objectives of transfusion therapy are twofold: to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis and to ensure appropriate growth and development through childhood. In practice, a number of different transfusion protocols are in use across the developed world, with on-demand transfusion still being the paradigm in most of the developing world with limited resources. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS To investigate perceived differences in transfusion practice, a self-reported electronic survey was disseminated to eight US thalassemia treatment centers in February 2011. The survey was divided into sections ranging from laboratory and clinical practices to emerging transfusion-transmitted diseases. RESULTS The survey response rate was 100%. The total number of transfused patients was 411. One-hundred percent of institutions used leukoreduced blood. No centers routinely provided cytomegalovirus-seronegative red blood cells (RBCs). Half the centers provided irradiated RBCs; only one routinely provided washed RBCs, and none transfused RBCs of defined storage age. Seventy-five percent of centers routinely phenotyped thalassemia patients' RBC antigens; 50% prophylactically matched for Rh and K antigens. The frequency of antibody investigations varied widely, and 25% of centers routinely medicated patients before transfusion. CONCLUSION Eight thalassemia centers in the United States were surveyed to determine the uniformity of transfusion practice. The variability of the results was surprising. Consequently, we performed a literature review and propose an evidence-based protocol for routine transfusion therapy for patients with thalassemia.","Goss, Cheryl; Giardina, Patricia; Degtyaryova, Diana; Kleinert, Dorothy; Sheth, Sujit; Cushing, Melissa",Transfusion,28,1

It is crucial to establish reliability of conducting virtual assessments for musculoskeletal conditions. OBJECTIVES This research determined the intra- and interrater reliability of measuring knee and wrist range of motion (ROM) assessed virtually and obtained face-to-face (F2F) using a goniometer (UG) for a student and an experienced examiner. METHOD Knee and wrist joint ROM for 54 healthy participants was assessed virtually and F2F by a student examiner and an experienced physical therapist. Intra- (virtual vs. UG assessment) and inter-rater (virtual or UG assessment between examiners) reliabilities were examined for all ROM using Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC values were considered good (>0.75) or excellent (>0.90). Bland and Altman plots determined the limits of agreement (LOA) in assessing joint ROM. RESULTS/FINDINGS Student examiner had good reliability in virtually estimating knee extension (ICC = 0.79), wrist flexion (ICC = 0.82) and wrist extension (ICC = 0.78), whereas the experienced examiner had excellent reliability in virtually estimating all knee and wrist ROM (ICC > 0.90). The LOA in assessing knee and wrist ROM for the student examiner were wider indicating higher disagreement between virtual and UG-obtained ROM in some cases. CONCLUSIONS Virtual estimation of knee and wrist ROM is a reliable technique, however experience level impacts the precision of measurement. It is suggested that the same examiner conducts all the ROM assessments throughout the clinical course of a patient receiving virtual interventions for knee or wrist pathologies.","Mehta, Saurabh P; Kendall, Kaitlyn M; Reasor, Charlotte M",Musculoskeletal care,28,31

However, there is great worry about the impact of pesticides on human health, due to their wide distribution and possible long-term effects. Complex mixtures with different formulations are often used, including a variety of genotoxic compounds. Thus, genotoxicity tests form an important part of cancer research and risk assessment of potential carcinogens. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analytical review of possible genetic damage resulting from occupational exposure in farmworkers and workers employed in pesticide production, both ever in comparison to non-exposed people, using comet assay (CA), micronucleus test (MN) and telomere length (TL) data available in the scientific literature. A total of 145 datasets were evaluated. The results showed that the occupationally exposed workers had more DNA damage in CA and MN than non-exposed workers. The TL result did not show difference between groups. When the data were categorized by gender (male, female or both), crop (general, tobacco, fruits, soybeans, cotton) and occupation (manufacturing or farmworkers), the study found that the exposed group always presented higher damage than the non-exposed individuals, in CA and MN. More studies with TL are needed to obtain a more precise response, and to segregate the effect of tobacco farming from pesticide exposure. When TL was segregated by gender, women and men presented difference between exposed and non-exposed groups. In general, the publication bias impact was modest. If all relevant studies were included, the key finding (i.e. the effect of pesticide exposure increases the genotoxicity and mutation rate) would probably remain unchanged. Lastly, it is important to highlight the importance of the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and offer safer options to farmworkers (e.g. organic farming or less toxic alternatives).","Silva Pinto, Bruna Gabriele; Marques Soares, Tábatta Kim; Azevedo Linhares, Maristela; Castilhos Ghisi, Nédia",The Science of the total environment,28,17

METHODS Six consecutive patients were included in this study with the following criteria of inclusion: (1) failure of dual antiplatelet therapy defined as recurrent TIA or ischemic stroke, (2) presence of ICS of ≥70 %, and (3) endovascular accessibility of the target lesion as judged by CTA or MRA. Technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy were observed for the first-ballon-then-stent (FBTS) technique using the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon microcatheter over which a self-expandable microstent can be directly delivered obviating the need to exchange microcatheters. RESULTS FBTS was performed in six patients (four female, median age 69, median stenosis 82.5 %) all refractory to best medical treatment: three V4, two M1, and one supraclinoid ICA stenosis. PTA and stent deployment were technically feasible in all patients and immediately effective with a median postprocedural stenosis grade of 10 %. Angiographic and clinical safety measures were met with no occult or clinically evident hemorrhage or ischemic complications (four patients discharged without alteration in mRS, two patients with significant clinical improvement). No occurrence of TIA, stroke, or death was observed during follow-up. CONCLUSION The FBTS method in this series appeared to be safe and effective for the endovascular treatment of ICS. It bears the specific potential to reduce wire perforations, which so far have been linked to major procedure-related adverse events of endovascular ICS treatment.","Möhlenbruch, Markus A; Pfaff, Johannes; Herweh, Christian; Bösel, Julian; Rizos, Timolaos; Nagel, Simon; Ringleb, Peter A; Bendszus, Martin; Pham, Mirko",Neuroradiology,28,1

Various cancer societies have issued recommendations regarding patients care, but few studies addressed the perception of cancer patients regarding this pandemic. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to assess the perception of cancer patients regarding their health risks during this pandemic and the preventive measures taken. MATERIALS AND METHODS An anonymous survey was conducted among cancer patients presenting for their treatment, during 10 consecutive working days, at the one-day clinic of Hotel-Dieu de France University hospital in Beirut. We evaluated their state of disease, comorbidities, precautions taken, and their concerns regarding the virus spread. RESULTS A total of 216 patients responded with a mean age of 60 years. The majority had a good performance status (performance status = 0-1 in 79.6%), 51.4% had metastatic disease, and chemotherapy was the main therapy used (65.7%). A total of 52.3% of patients considered themselves to be at increased risk of contracting the virus. A total of 55.1% were more worried about the coronavirus rather than their disease. The priority was for the treatment of their cancer in 47.7% of the total patients studied. Of note, only 2.8% of planned one-day clinic reservations were canceled or postponed to avoid COVID-19 exposure. CONCLUSIONS Although cancer is a disease with a high mortality rate, many patients are more concerned about the actual pandemic rather than their disease. Nevertheless, the absenteeism from their treatment sessions during the COVID-19 atmosphere was minimal.","Haddad, Fady Gh; Kourie, Hampig Raphael; Gebara, Nicole; Matta, Christian; Eid, Roland; El Karak, Fady; Nasr, Fadi; Chahine, Georges; Ghosn, Marwan; Kattan, Joseph",Journal of patient safety,28,12

Mass coral bleaching and mortality have recently occurred where reefs have experienced chronic low oxygen events. However, the mechanistic basis of tolerance to oxygen levels inadequate to sustain normal functioning (i.e. hypoxia) and whether it contributes to bleaching susceptibility, remain unknown. We therefore experimentally exposed colonies of the environmentally resilient Acropora tenuis, a common reef-building coral from the Great Barrier Reef, to deoxygenation-reoxygenation stress that was aligned to their natural night-day light cycle. Specifically, the treatment involved removing the 'night-time O2 buffer' to challenge the inherent hypoxia thresholds. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that coral possess a complete and active hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxia response system (HRS) homologous to other metazoans. As expected, A. tenuis exhibited bleaching resistance and showed a strong inducibility of HIF target genes in response to deoxygenation stress. We applied this same approach in parallel to a colony of Acropora selago, known to be environmnetally susceptible, which conversely exhibited a bleaching phenotype response. This phenotypic divergence of A. selago was accompanied by contrasting gene expression profiles indicative of varied effectiveness of their HIF-HRS. Based on our RNA-Seq analysis, we propose (a) that the HIF-HRS is central for corals to manage deoxygenation stress and (b) that key genes of this system (and the wider gene network) may contribute to variation in coral bleaching susceptibility. Our analysis suggests that heat shock protein (hsp) 70 and 90 are important for low oxygen stress tolerance and further highlights how hsp90 expression might also affect the inducibility of coral HIF-HRS in overcoming a metabolic crisis under deoxygenation stress. We propose that differences in coral HIF-HRS could be central in regulating sensitivity to other climate change stressors-notably thermal stress-that commonly drive bleaching.","Alderdice, Rachel; Suggett, David J; Cárdenas, Anny; Hughes, David J; Kühl, Michael; Pernice, Mathieu; Voolstra, Christian R",Global change biology,28,16

The authors describe a new surgical strategy for LFS based on anatomical considerations using 3D image fusion with MRI/CT analysis. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted on 78 consecutive patients surgically treated for LFS at the lumbosacral junction (2013-2017). The location and extent of stenosis, including the narrowest site and associated pathology (bone or soft tissue), were measured using 3D image fusion with MRI/CT. Stenosis was defined as medial intervertebral foraminal (MF; inner edge to pedicle center), lateral intervertebral foraminal (LF; pedicle center to outer edge), or extraforaminal (EF; outside the pedicle). Lumbar (low-back pain, leg pain) and patient satisfaction visual analog scale (VAS) scores and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores were evaluated. Surgical outcome was evaluated 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS Most instances of stenosis existed outside the pedicle's center (94%), including LF (58%), EF (36%), and MF (6%). In all MF cases, stenosis resulted from soft-tissue structures. The narrowest stenosis sites were localized around the pedicle's outer border. The areas for sufficient nerve decompression were extended in MF+LF (10%), MF+LF+EF (14%), LF+EF (39%), LF (11%), and EF (26%). No iatrogenic pars interarticularis damage occurred. The JOA score was 14.9 ± 2.6 points preoperatively and 22.4 ± 3.5 points at 2 years postoperatively. The JOA recovery rate was 56.0% ± 18.6%. The VAS score (low-back and leg pain) was significantly improved 2 years postoperatively (p < 0.01). According to patients' self-assessment of the minimally invasive surgery, 62 (79.5%) chose ""surgery met my expectations"" at follow-up. Nine patients (11.5%) selected ""I did not improve as much as I had hoped but I would undergo the same surgery for the same outcome."" CONCLUSIONS Most LFS existed outside the pedicle's center and was rarely noted in the pars region. The main regions of stenosis were localized to the pedicle's outer edge. Considering this anatomical distribution of LFS, the authors recommend that lateral fenestration should be the first priority for foraminal decompression. Other surgical options including foraminotomy, total facetectomy, and hemilaminectomy likely require more bone resections than LFS treatment. The microendoscopic surgery results were very good, indicating that this minimally invasive surgery was suitable for treating this disease.","Murata, Shizumasa; Minamide, Akihito; Iwasaki, Hiroshi; Nakagawa, Yukihiro; Hashizume, Hiroshi; Yukawa, Yasutsugu; Tsutsui, Shunji; Takami, Masanari; Okada, Motohiro; Nagata, Keiji; Yoshida, Munehito; Schoenfeld, Andrew J; Simpson, Andrew K; Yamada, Hiroshi",Journal of neurosurgery.

As the COVID-19 continues to spread globally, isolation and restriction orders taken by the governments have become the cores to control the pandemic. In this study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the ureteral stone presentations in a high-volume university hospital during the COVID-19 restrictions order period. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 149 patients who were hospitalized due to ureteral stone both during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions period and the corresponding period (non-COVID-19) of the previous year were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Unpaired Student's t test was used to compare continuous variables. The categorical data were assessed using a chi-square test. RESULTS Of 149 patients, 35 were hospitalized in the COVID-19 period. While the mean age and the stone characteristics of the two groups did not differ significantly, serum creatinine levels (1.91.85 vs 1.150.64) and the white blood cell counts (12.456.54 vs 8.214.15) at hospital admission were significantly higher in the COVID-period group (p=0.034 and p=0.005, respectively). According to the priority classification of the European Urology Guidelines Office Rapid Reaction Group Urolithiasis Guidelines Panel applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant difference was observed between the two periods (X2=9.907, p=0.019). In particular, the rate of emergency cases was found more than 3-fold in the COVID-19 period. Although there was no significant difference in terms of the grade of hydronephrosis at hospital admission between the two groups, the rate of grade 3 and 4 hydronephroses was higher in the COVID-period group (1.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively). CONCLUSION The rate of complicated ureteral stone disease significantly increased during the COVID-19 restrictions period.

METHODS This was a retrospective, non-comparative; inter ventional case series in which all patients with primary open-angle glaucoma who underwent phacoemulsification with Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy between June 2018 and April 2019 were enrolled. All the participants had a minimum follow-up period of 6 months. Preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure values (at 1, 3, and 6 months), number of antiglaucoma medications, best-corrected visual acuity, surgical complications, and any subsequent related events or procedures were recorded. A logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between the different variables and surgical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 47 patients (57 eyes) were included (mean age, 70.5 ± 7 years). The mean intraocular pressure was reduced from 15.5 ± 4.2 mmHg to 12.2 ± 2.4 mmHg at the last follow-up visit (p<0.001). The mean number of antiglaucoma medications decreased significantly from 1.9 ± 1.0 to 0.6 ± 1.0 during the same period (p<0.001). On the basis of the predefined criterion (intraocular pressure reduction ≥20% and/or reduction ≥1 medication), the 6-month success rate was 86%. A higher preoperative intraocular pressure value (odds ratio [OR]= 2.01; p=0.016) and greater percentage of initial (30 days) intraocular pressure reduction (OR= 1.02; p=0.033) were sig nificantly associated with surgical success. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that phacoemulsification with Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy is an effective and safe alternative for cataract management in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma that positively impacts intraocular pressure control and medication burden. Eyes with higher baseline intraocular pressure and a more pronounced initial response to the procedure appeared to present better outcomes at 6 months. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety profile of the procedure.","Ibrahim, Larissa Fouad; Pereira, Anna Flavia Ribeiro; Terenzi, Larissa Alves de Oliveira; Vianello, Marcos Pereira; Dorairaj, Syril Kumar; Prata, Tiago Santos; Kanadani, Fabio Nishimura",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,28,5

Currently, there is no consensus on the technical standards for LPD. Objective The aim of this consensus statement is to guide the continued safe progression and adoption of LPD. Evidence Review An international panel of experts was selected based on their clinical and scientific expertise in laparoscopic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Statements were produced upon reviewing the literature and assessed by the members of the expert panel. The literature search and its critical appraisal were limited to articles published in English during the period from 1994 to 2019. The Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials databases were searched, The search strategy included, but was not limited to, the terms 'laparoscopic', 'pancreaticoduodenectomy, 'pancreatoduodenectomy', 'Whipple's operation', and 'minimally invasive surgery'. Reference lists from the included articles were manually checked for any additional studies, which were included when appropriate. Delphi method was used to establish expert consensus and the AGREE II-GRS Instrument was applied to assess the methodological quality and externally validate the final statements. The statements were further discussed during a one-day face-to-face meeting at the 1st Summit on Minimally Invasive Pancreatico-Biliary Surgery in Wuhan, China. Findings Twenty-eight international experts from 8 countries constructed the expert panel. Sixteen statements were produced by the members of the expert panel.

It is the major cause of difficult mask ventilation. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine whether head rotation improves the efficiency of mask ventilation of anaesthetised apnoeic adults. DESIGN A randomised, crossover study. SETTING Single university teaching hospital. PATIENTS Forty patients, aged 18 to 75 years with a BMI 18.5 to 35.0 kg m requiring general anaesthesia for elective surgery were recruited and randomised into two groups. INTERVENTIONS Once apnoeic after induction of general anaesthesia, face mask ventilation began with pressure controlled ventilation, at a peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O. Each patient was ventilated for three 1-min intervals with the head position alternated every minute: group A, mask ventilation was performed with a neutral head position for 1 min, followed by an axial head position rotated 45° to the right for 1 min and then returned to the neutral position for another 1 min. In group B, the sequence of head positioning was rotated → neutral → rotated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Expiratory tidal volume, measured with a respiratory inductive plethysmograph. RESULTS Two patients were excluded due to protocol violation; thus, data from 38 patients were analysed. The mean expiratory tidal volume was significantly higher in the rotated head position than in the neutral position (612.6 vs. 544.0 ml: difference [95% confidence interval], 68.6 [46.8 to 90.4] ml, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Head rotation of 45° in anaesthetised apnoeic adults significantly increases the efficiency of mask ventilation compared with the neutral head position. Head rotation is an effective alternative to improve mask ventilation if airway obstruction is encountered.

The objective of this survey was to assess the change in neurosurgical training in India following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Between May 7, 2020, and May 16, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated among neurosurgical residents across India by social media, regarding changes in the department's functioning, patient interaction, surgical exposure, changes in academics, and fears and apprehensions associated with the pandemic. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for changes during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS A total of 118 residents from 29 neurosurgical training programs across 17 states/union territories of the country gave their responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey revealed that the surgical exposure of neurosurgical residents has drastically reduced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, from an average of 39.86 surgeries performed/assisted per month (median 30) to 12.31 per month (median 10), representing a decrease of 67.50%. The number of academic sessions has fallen from a median of 5 per week to 2 per week. The survey uncovered the lack of universal guidelines and homogeneity regarding preoperative COVID-19 testing. The survey also reveals reluctance toward detailed patient examinations since the COVID-19 outbreak. The majority of respondents felt that the COVID-19 pandemic will hamper their operative and clinical skills. Fear of rescheduling or deferring of licensing examinations was significantly higher among those closest to the examination (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS The adverse impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical training needs to be addressed. While ensuring the safety of the residents, institutes and neurosurgical societies/bodies must take it upon themselves to ensure that their residents continue to learn and develop neurosurgical skills during these difficult times.","Dash, Chinmaya; Venkataram, Tejas; Goyal, Nishant; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Raheja, Amol; Singla, Raghav; Sardhara, Jayesh; Gupta, Ravi",Neurosurgical focus,28,1

Contact investigation and management were conducted to identify potential cases. Epidemiological investigation was carried out to determine the epidemiological and demographic characteristics of the outbreak. We estimated the secondary attack rate (SAR), incubation time, and time-dependent reproductive number (Rt ), and explored the predisposing factors for cluster infection. The incubation time was 5.4 days and the serial interval (SI) was 4.4 days, with the rate of negative-valued SIs at 24.5%. The SAR at the bathing pool (3.3%) was relatively low due to its high temperature and humidity. The SAR was higher in the colleagues' cluster (20.5%) than in the family cluster (11.8%). Superspreaders had a longer isolation delay time (P=0.004). The Rt of the cluster decreased from the highest value of 3.88 on January 27, 2020 to 1.22 on February 6. Our findings suggest that the predisposing factors of the outbreak included close contact with an infected person, airtight and crowded spaces, temperature and humidity in the space, and untimely isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts at the early stage of transmission. Measures to reduce the risk of infection at these gatherings and subsequent tracking of close contacts were effective.","Bao, Changjun; Pan, Enchun; Ai, Jing; Dai, Qigang; Xu, Ke; Shi, Naiyang; Gao, Qiang; Hu, Jianli; Peng, Zhihang; Huang, Haodi; Jin, Hui; Zhu, Fengcai",Transboundary and emerging diseases,28,1

Classical PKU patients showed higher current blood Phe levels than mild PKU patients (U = 37.000, p = 0.003). Lifetime and childhood Phe levels were associated with recent metabolic control (τ = 0.76, p = 0.000; τ = 0.70, p = 0.000, respectively). The perception of barriers to treatment was associated with a higher blood Phe level (τ = 0.39, p = 0.003). Tolerance to Phe, metabolic control throughout childhood, and perceived difficulty in living with demands of treatment are important factors of greater vulnerability to poor adherence in PKU patients.","Teruya, Katia Irie; Remor, Eduardo; Schwartz, Ida Vanessa Doederlein",American journal of medical genetics.

Respiratory samples were tested using a combination of two commercially available reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) DNA microarray systems allowing rapid detection of influenza A virus strains, including the new A/H1N1v strain as well as 20 other common or newly discovered respiratory viruses. Concomitantly, a generic and classical real-time RT-PCR assay was performed to detect all circulating influenza A virus strains in the same samples. Of the 95 respiratory samples tested, 30 (31%) were positive for the detection of influenza A/H1N1v virus infection by both RT-PCR DNA microarray and classical real-time RT-PCR detection assays. Among the infections, 25 (83%) were monoinfections, whereas 5 (17%) were multiple infections associating influenza A/H1N1v virus with coronavirus (CoV), human bocavirus (HBoV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or human rhinoviruses (HRVs). Of the 95 respiratory samples tested, 35 (37%) were positive for respiratory viruses other than influenza A/H1N1v virus. Among these infections, we observed 30 monoinfections (HRVs [63%], parainfluenza viruses [PIVs] [20%]), influenza A/H3N2 virus [6%], coronavirus [4%], and HBoV [4%]) and 5 multiple infections, in which HRVs and PIVs were the most frequently detected viruses. No specific single or mixed viral infections appeared to be associated significantly with secondary hospitalization in infectious disease or intensive care departments during the study period (P > 0.5). The use of RT-PCR DNA microarray systems in clinical virology practice allows the rapid and accurate detection of conventional and newly discovered viral respiratory pathogens in patients suffering from ILI and therefore could be of major interest for development of new epidemiological survey systems for respiratory viral infections.","Renois, Fanny; Talmud, Déborah; Huguenin, Antoine; Moutte, Lauryane; Strady, Christophe; Cousson, Joel; Lévêque, Nicolas; Andréoletti, Laurent",Journal of clinical microbiology,28,25

It is estimated that 25% of adult population have mental health condition and 68% of them suffer from comorbid medical condition. Readmission rates in psychiatric patients are high and we still lack understanding potential predictors of recidivism. Physical comorbidity could be one of important risk factors for psychiatric readmission. The aim of the present study was to review the impact of physical comorbidity variables on readmission after discharge from psychiatric or general inpatient care among patients with co-occurring psychiatric and medical conditions. METHODS A comprehensive database search from January 1990 to June 2014 was performed in the following bibliographic databases: Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, ProQuest Health Management, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. An integrative research review was conducted on 23 observational studies. RESULTS Six studies documented physical comorbidity variables only at admission/discharge and 17 also at readmission. The main body of studies supported the hypothesis that patients with mental disorders are at increased risk of readmission if they had co-occurring medical condition. The impact of physical comorbidity variables on psychiatric readmission was most frequently studied in in patients with affective and substance use disorders (SUD). Most common physical comorbidity variables with higher probability for psychiatric readmission were associated with certain category of psychiatric diagnoses. Chronic lung conditions, hepatitis C virus infection, hypertension and number of medical diagnoses were associated with increased risk of readmission in SUD; Charlson Comorbidity Index, somatic complaints, physical health problems with serious mental illnesses (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, personality disorders); not specified medical illness, somatic complaints, number of medical diagnoses, hyperthyroidism with affective disorders (depression, bipolar disorder). Co-occurring physical and mental disorders can worsen patient's course of illness leading to hospital readmission also due to non-psychiatric reasons. CONCLUSIONS The association between physical comorbidity and psychiatric readmission is still poorly understood phenomenon. Nevertheless, that physical comorbid conditions are more common among readmitted patients than single admission patients, their association with readmission can vary according to the nature of mental disorders, characteristics of study population, applied concept of comorbidity, and study protocol.","Šprah, Lilijana; Dernovšek, Mojca Zvezdana; Wahlbeck, Kristian; Haaramo, Peija",BMC psychiatry,28,1

It is a highly contagious disease transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces, mainly through respiratory droplets, but other routes are being investigated. OBJECTIVE It is known that coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause a variety of ocular pathologies in animals, including conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis, many of which are severe. However, there is no evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 presence in the eye tissue of asymptomatic patients, even if the symptomatic incidence is low. This systematic review presents updated literature on this issue. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE COVID-19 has now spread throughout the continents and poses a global threat to public health. The risk of rapidly overloading health care systems and causing substantial mortality worldwide is real. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced coronavirus as a global pandemic. Several studies described a few cases with initial ocular symptoms followed by systemic symptoms of the disease. SUMMARY Although the frequency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the eye is low, ocular symptoms are not uncommon in COVID-19. In some cases, eye symptoms may be the first signs of illness. This implies the need for hygienic recommendations and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff and other services to minimize COVID-19 infection of both health-care workers and patients. A triage for ophthalmic outpatient clinic is mandatory.","Latalska, Małgorzata; Mackiewicz, Jerzy",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,28,5

The major immediate early promoter (MIEP) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives the expression of crucial lytic cycle transactivators but is silenced during latency in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Because the MIEP has poor activity in HPCs, it is unclear how viral transactivators are expressed during reactivation. It has been presumed that viral gene expression is reinitiated via de-repression of the MIEP. We demonstrate that immediate early transcripts arising from reactivation originate predominantly from alternative promoters within the canonical major immediate early locus. Disruption of these intronic promoters results in striking defects in re-expression of viral genes and viral genome replication in the THP-1 latency model. Furthermore, we show that these promoters are necessary for efficient reactivation in primary CD34+ HPCs. Our findings shift the paradigm for HCMV reactivation by demonstrating that promoter switching governs reactivation from viral latency in a context-specific manner.","Collins-McMillen, Donna; Rak, Mike; Buehler, Jason C; Igarashi-Hayes, Suzu; Kamil, Jeremy P; Moorman, Nathaniel J; Goodrum, Felicia",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,28,5

This paper proposes a simple bioreactor to mechanically stimulate up to three constructs for tendon and ligament repair, composed of a stainless-steel frame and an electric motor. METHODS The deformation is produced by a cam wheel, whose eccentricity defines the maximum deformation. The test samples, braids of PLA seeded in surface with mouse fibroblasts, are immersed in the culture medium during mechanical stimulation. RESULTS Its advantages over existing similar bioreactor designs include: easy renewal of the culture medium and an external electric motor to avoid heating and contamination issues. After 14 days of stretching, the culture samples showed enhanced cellular proliferation and cell fibre alignment in addition to higher production of type I collagen. The cells initially seeded on the braid surface migrated to the inside of the braid. CONCLUSION Although the results obtained have a poor statistical basis, they do suggest that the bioreactor could be usefully applied to stimulate constructs for tendon and ligament repair.

METHODS We collected clinical and laboratory data of patients, suspected COVID-19 cases, admitted at the emergency department of University General Hospital of Ioannina (Ioannina, Greece). We selected 197 negative and 368 positive cases, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. COVID-19 cases were classified into mild, serious, and critical disease. Receiver operating characteristic curve and binary logistic regression analysis were utilized for assessing the diagnosing ability of biomarkers. RESULTS WBC, neutrophil count (NEUT), and HFLC can discriminate efficiently negative cases from mild and serious COVID-19, whereas eosinopenia and basopenia are early indicators of the disease. The combined WBC-HFLC marker is the best diagnostic marker for both mild (sensitivity: 90.6% and specificity: 64.1%) and serious (sensitivity: 90.3% and specificity: 73.4%) disease. CRP and Lymphocyte count are early indicators of progression to serious disease whereas WBC, NEUT, IG, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are the best indicators of critical disease. CONCLUSION Lymphopenia is not useful in screening patients with COVID-19.

The occurrence of new onset atrial fibrillation may precipitate acute heart failure and lead to thromboembolic complications as well as being associated with increased in-hospital and in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Despite being common, much of our current knowledge regarding the treatment of new onset atrial fibrillation comes from patients with chronic atrial fibrillation or post cardiac surgery. It is unclear if management strategies in these patient cohorts can be applied to new onset atrial fibrillation in the general ICU. This protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to address this uncertainty and define what is the most effective management strategy for the treatment of new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) in acutely unwell adult patients. METHODS In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we plan to search electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science and relevant trial registries) for relevant randomised and non-randomised trials. Citations will be reviewed by title, abstract and full text by two independent reviewers and disagreement resolved by discussion and a third independent reviewer, if necessary. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool will be used to assess risk of bias in randomised trials and the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool will be used for non-randomised studies. Statistical analysis will be carried out using R package meta and netmeta. We will first conduct a pairwise meta-analysis. If conditions for indirect comparison are satisfied and suitable data are available, we will conduct network meta-analysis using frequentist methodology. Treatments will be ranked according to efficacy with associated P-scores. We will assess the quality of the evidence in the pairwise using GRADE methodology and network meta-analysis comparisons in the CINeMA module in R package meta.

Several viruses induce stress granules during the course of infection, but the exact function of these structures during virus replication is not well understood. In this study, we showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induced host stress granules in epithelial cells during the course of infection. We also showed that stress granules are distinct from cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies and that the RNA binding protein HuR, normally found in stress granules, also localized to viral inclusion bodies during infection. Interestingly, we demonstrated that infected cells containing stress granules also contained more RSV protein than infected cells that did not form inclusion bodies. To address the role of stress granule formation in RSV infection, we generated a stable epithelial cell line with reduced expression of the Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein (G3BP) that displayed an inhibited stress granule response. Surprisingly, RSV replication was impaired in these cells compared to its replication in cells with intact G3BP expression. In contrast, knockdown of HuR by RNA interference did not affect stress granule formation or RSV replication. Finally, using RNA probes specific for RSV genomic RNA, we found that viral RNA predominantly localized to viral inclusion bodies but a small percentage also interacted with stress granules during infection. These results suggest that RSV induces a host stress granule response and preferentially replicates in host cells that have committed to a stress response.","Lindquist, Michael E; Lifland, Aaron W; Utley, Thomas J; Santangelo, Philip J; Crowe, James E",Journal of virology,28,24

BACKGROUND Mass-gathering events (MGEs) occur frequently throughout the world. Having an understanding of the complexities of MGEs is important to determine required health resources. Environmental, psychosocial, and biomedical domains may be a logical starting point to determine how data are being collected and reported in the literature; however, it may be that other factors influencing health resources are not identified within these domains. METHOD Based on an exhaustive literature synthesis, this paper is the final paper in a series that explores the collection of variables that impact biomedical presentations associated with attendance/participation in MGEs. FINDINGS The authors propose further evolution of the Arbon model to include the addition of several domains, including: event environment; command, control, and communication (C3); public health; health promotion; and legacy when reporting the health outcomes of an event. CONCLUSIONS Including a variety of domains that contribute to an MGE allows for formal evaluation of the event, which in turn informs future knowledge and skill development for both the event management group and the wider community.","Hutton, Alison; Ranse, Jamie; Zimmerman, Peta-Anne",Prehospital and disaster medicine,28,1

Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of CRS. We describe the efficacy and safety of TCZ in SARS CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from April 20 2020 to May 21 2020. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of a composite of either need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Safety outcomes included an increase in liver transaminases and/or evidence of infection. RESULTS A total of 20 patients received TCZ during the study period. The median age was 54 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 47-63). About 85% of the patients were male. Nearly 70% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. About 55% required ICU admission. The median duration of ICU stay was 11 days (95% CI: 3-13 days). The cumulative incidence of the requirement for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvement and mortality was 11% (95% CI: 0.03%-1%), 74% (95% CI 37%-89%) and 25% (95% CI: 11%-63%), respectively. There was no difference in outcomes according to age, gender or computed tomography severity score. Asymptomatic transaminitis was the most common drug reaction (55%), and one patient developed bacteraemia. CONCLUSIONS TCZ is likely a safe and effective modality of treatment for improving clinical and laboratory parameters of SARS CoV-2 patients with a reduction in ICU stay and ventilatory care need.","Patel, Atul; Shah, Kinjal; Dharsandiya, Mitkumar; Patel, Ketan; Patel, Tushar; Patel, Mukesh; Reljic, Tea; Kumar, Ambuj",Indian journal of medical microbiology,28,7

To date, relatively little has been published on the consequences of intra-abdominal placement of a mesh with respect to the decrease of mesh size (shrinkage). METHODS In each of 16 sheep, four meshes (dimensions 10 × 10 cm), two based on polyester and two on polypropylene, were placed laparoscopically on intact peritoneum and fixed with either non-absorbable or absorbable tacks. After 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, four animals, respectively, underwent a new laparoscopy with the harvesting of mesh and fascia. Quantitative measurement of the mesh size was performed and expressed as percentage shrinkage. Random core biopsies of mesh and adjacent tissue were obtained and histologically examined. RESULTS There was a significant difference of the two meshes with respect to shrinkage at all time points. The coated polyester-based mesh was exposed to more shrinkage compared to the polypropylene mesh covered with anti-adhesive material. Random biopsies at 3 months showed an increased foreign body reaction to the coated polyester mesh. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first long-term experimental study on mesh shrinkage after the laparoscopic placement of mesh. The polyester-based mesh induced a more intense foreign body reaction and was exposed to significantly more shrinkage than the covered polypropylene mesh.","Zinther, N B; Wara, P; Friis-Andersen, H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,28,1

Here we analyzed the influence of thrombus length on the number of thrombectomy maneuvers needed for recanalization, intraprocedural complications, recanalization success, and clinical outcome after mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed angiographic and clinical data from 72 consecutive patients with acute occlusion of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy using stent retrievers. Successful recanalization was defined as a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or 3. Good neurological outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of ≤2 at 90 days after stroke onset. RESULTS Mean thrombus length was 13.4±5.2 mm. Univariate binary logistic regression did not show an association of thrombus length with the probability of a good clinical outcome (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03, p=0.176) or successful recanalization (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05, p=0.225). There was no significant correlation between thrombus length and the number of thrombectomy maneuvers needed for recanalization (p=0.112). Furthermore, thrombus length was not correlated with the probability of intraprocedural complications (p=0.813), including embolization in a new territory (n=3). CONCLUSIONS In this study, thrombus length had no relevant impact on recanalization, neurological outcome, or intraprocedural complications following mechanical thrombectomy of middle cerebral artery occlusions. Therefore, mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers can be attempted with large clots.","Seker, Fatih; Pfaff, Johannes; Wolf, Marcel; Schönenberger, Silvia; Nagel, Simon; Herweh, Christian; Pham, Mirko; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,28,7

Scientists are divided over dosing strategies.,12.321743,3.5375037,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Anti-viral immune response is crucial to achieve pathogen clearance, however in some patients an excessive and aberrant host immune response can lead to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. The comprehension of the mechanisms that regulate pathogen elimination, immunity, and pathology is essential to better characterize disease progression and widen the spectrum of therapeutic options. METHODS We performed a flow cytometric characterization of immune cells subsets from 30 COVID-19 patients and correlated these data with clinical outcomes. RESULTS COVID-19 patients showed decreased numbers of circulating T, B and NK cells, and exhibited a skewing of CD8+ T cells towards a terminally differentiated/senescent phenotype. In agreement, T CD4+, T CD8+ but also NK cells displayed reduced anti-viral cytokine production capability. Moreover, a reduced cytotoxic potential was identified in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those that required intensive care. The latter group of patients showed also increased serum IL-6 levels, that correlated to the frequency of granzyme-expressing NK cells. Off-label treatment with tocilizumab restored the cytotoxic potential of NK cells. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the association between IL-6 serum levels and the impairment of cytotoxic activity suggests the possibility that targeting this cytokine may restore anti-viral mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE We examined the effectiveness of exercise training on improving fear-avoidance beliefs. METHODS A systematic review (data sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and metaanalysis of randomised controlled/clinical trials of exercise training in adults versus relevant nonexercise comparators that quantified fear-avoidance was conducted. RESULTS After screening 4603 identified records, 17 (2014 participants) and 13 (1152 participants) studies were eligible for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Pairwise meta-analysis showed exercise training was more effective than all non-exercise comparators (standardised mean difference (SMD) [95% CI] - 0.378 [- 0.623, - 0.133], P = 0.002, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE]: very low) for reducing fear-avoidance. Exercise training was more effective than true control for reducing fear avoidance (- 0.407 [- 0.750, - 0.065], P = 0.020, GRADE: very low), however it was not more effective than other interventions (- 0.243 [- 0.614, 0.128], P = 0.199, GRADE: very low). In people with low back pain, exercise training was more effective than non-exercise comparator groups for reducing fear-avoidance (- 0.530 [- 0.755, - 0.304], P < 0.001, GRADE: very low). For individuals with neck pain, exercise training was not more effective than non-exercise comparator groups for reducing fear-avoidance (0.061 [- 0.360, 0.482], P = 0.777, GRADE: very low). CONCLUSION There is very low to low-quality evidence that exercise training is effective for reducing fear-avoidance, including in people with low back pain. Exercise training may be more effective than no intervention for reducing fear avoidance, but there is very low-quality evidence that non-exercise interventions are as effective as exercise for fear avoidance. Few studies with low risk of bias is a limitation.

Systematic capacity-building efforts are warranted to provide technical support for community health workers and improve their confidence in the integrated service provision. An intervention trial was conducted between 2018 and 2019 with 120 community health workers (CHW) from 60 communes in Vietnam's four provinces. The 60 intervention CHW received in-person training to enhance their HIV/addiction-related service knowledge and skills. Online support groups were established between trained CHW and local HIV and addiction specialists. The intervention outcomes were assessed using mixed-effects regression models with the data collected at baseline and every 3 months for 1 year. Adjusted analyses showed that intervention CHW reported a significant increase in the interaction with other treatment providers than the control group at 6 months and remained at the 12-month follow-up. The difference in the improvement of confidence in HIV/addiction-related service delivery between the intervention and control groups was significant at 6-month but became insignificant at the 12-month. Male CHW were more confident in providing services than female CHW at baseline, and gender differences in the changing patterns were observed over time. This capacity-building intervention demonstrated promising outcomes on CHW inter-agency collaborations and confidence in service delivery.

A series of environmental and trace-back and trace-forward investigations linked sprout consumption with the disease, but fecal-oral transmission was also documented. The genome sequences of the pathogen revealed a clonal outbreak with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). Some EAEC virulence factors are carried on the virulence plasmid pAA. From an unknown source, the epidemic strains acquired a lambdoid prophage carrying the gene for the Shiga toxin. The resulting strains therefore possess two different mobile elements, a phage and a plasmid, contributing essential virulence genes. Shiga toxin is released by decaying bacteria in the gut, migrates through the intestinal barrier, and is transported via the blood to target organs, like the kidney. In a mouse model, probiotic bifidobacteria interfered with transport of the toxin through the gut mucosa. Researchers explored bacteriophages, bacteriocins, and low-molecular-weight inhibitors against STEC. Randomized controlled clinical trials of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) patients found none of the interventions superior to supportive therapy alone. Antibodies against one subtype of Shiga toxin protected pigs against fatal neurological infection, while treatment with a toxin receptor decoy showed no effect in a clinical trial. Likewise, a monoclonal antibody directed against a complement protein led to mixed results. Plasma exchange and IgG immunoadsoprtion ameliorated the condition in small uncontrolled trials. The epidemic O104:H4 strains were resistant to all penicillins and cephalosporins but susceptible to carbapenems, which were recommended for treatment.","Muniesa, Maite; Hammerl, Jens A; Hertwig, Stefan; Appel, Bernd; Brüssow, Harald",Applied and environmental microbiology,28,1

DATA SOURCES Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. REVIEW METHODS A comprehensive search was performed for SR and MA citations from 2012 to 2017 in the 10 highest impact factor otolaryngology journals. Abstracts were screened to identify published manuscripts in which the authors indicated clearly that they were performing an SR or MA. Applying a modified typology of reviews, 4 reviewers characterized the review type as SR, MA, or another review type. A simplified version of the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2) tool was used to assess the reporting and methodological quality of the SRs and MAs that were focused on interventions. RESULTS Search and abstract screening generated 499 manuscripts that identified themselves as performing an SR or MA. A substantial number (85/499, 17%) were review types other than SRs or MAs, including 34 (7%) that were literature reviews. In total, 236 SRs and MAs focused on interventions. Over 50% of these SRs and MAs had weaknesses in at least 3 of the 16 items in the AMSTAR 2, and over 40% had weaknesses in at least 2 of the 7 critical domains. Ninety-nine percent of SRs and MAs provided critically low confidence in the results of the reviews.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potentials of Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 on brain health including cognitive and memory functions during aging and the impacts of high fat diet during a 12-week period. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into six groups: (1) young animals on normal diet (ND, (2) young animals on a high fat diet (HFD), (3) aged animals on ND, (4) aged animals on HFD, (5) aged animals on HFD and L. plantarum DR7 (109 cfu/day) and (6) aged animals receiving HFD and lovastatin. To induce ageing, all rats in group 3 to 6 were injected sub-cutaneously at 600 mg/kg/day of D-galactose daily. The administration of DR7 has reduced anxiety accompanied by enhanced memory during behavioural assessments in aged-HFD rats (P<0.05). Hippocampal concentration of all three pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased during aging but reduced upon administration of both statin and DR7. Expressions of hippocampal neurotransmitters and apoptosis genes showed reduced expressions of indoleamine dioxygenase and P53 accompanied by increased expression of TPH1 in aged- HFD rats administered with DR7, indicating potential effects of DR7 along the pathways of serotonin and oxidative senescence.

OBJECTIVE To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed including 54 peer reviewed papers and 18 non-peer reviewed preprints. CONCLUSIONS While non-specific, acute phase reactants including CRP, ferritin, SAA, and procalcitonin were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated WBC count, marked lymphopenia, decreased CD3, CD4 or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts, high neutrophil count, thrombocytopenia, and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated IL-6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients.

Several studies have shown that obesity is associated with better functional outcome after stroke. Whether obesity influences the benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) in stroke patients is unknown. We evaluated the association between body mass index (BMI) and outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel -occlusion (LVO), and assessed whether BMI affects the -benefit of EVT. METHODS This is a post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands trial (-ISRCTN10888758). BMI was used as a continuous and categorical variable, distinguishing underweight and normal weight (BMI <25), overweight (BMI 25-30), and obesity (BMI ≥30). We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to estimate the association of BMI with functional outcome (shift analysis), assessed with modified Rankin Scale (mRs) at 90 days. The impact of BMI on EVT effect was tested by the use of a multiplicative interaction term. RESULTS Of 366 patients, 160 (44%) were underweight or normal weight, 145 (40%) overweight, and 61 (17%) were obese. In multivariable analysis with BMI as a continuous variable, we found a shift toward better functional outcome with higher BMI (mRS adjusted common OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.0-1.09), and mortality was inversely related to BMI (aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Safety analysis showed that higher BMI was associated with lower risk of stroke progression (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.99). Additional analysis showed no interaction between BMI and EVT effect on functional outcome, mortality, and other safety outcomes. CONCLUSION Our study confirms the effect of obesity on outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with LVO, meaning better functional outcome, lower mortality, and lower risk of stroke progression for patients with higher BMI. As we found no interaction between BMI and EVT effect, all BMI classes may expect the same benefit from EVT.","Pirson, France Anne Victoire; Hinsenveld, Wouter H; Staals, Julie; de Greef, Bianca T A; van Zwam, Wim H; Dippel, Diederik W J; Vos, Jan Albert; Schonewille, Wouter J; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J",Cerebrovascular diseases,28,1

The changes that took place to the physical and mental health among young athletes during this time remain unknown, however. OBJECTIVE Identify changes in the health (mental health, physical activity and quality of life) of athletes that occurred during the CoVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Sample recruited via social media. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS 3243 Wisconsin adolescent athletes (age=16.2±1.2 yrs., female=58% female) completed an online survey in May 2020 (DuringCoVID-19). Health measures for this cohort were compared with previously reported data for Wisconsin adolescent athletes (n=5231, age=15.7±1.2, 47% female) collected in 2016-2018 (PreCoVID-19). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Demographic information included: sex, grade and sports played. Health assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) to identify depression symptoms, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for health related quality of life (HRQoL). Univariable comparisons of these variables between groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each group were estimated by survey weighted ANOVA models. RESULTS Compared to PreCoVID-19, a larger proportion of the During-CoVID-19 participants reported rates of moderate to severe levels of depression (9.7% vs 32.9%, p<0.001). During-CoVID-19 participants reported 50% lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean:12.2 [95%CI: 11.9, 12.5] vs 24.7 [24.5, 24.9] p<0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to the PreCoVID-19 participants (78.4 [78.0, 78.8] vs. 90.9 [90.5, 91.3] p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS During the CoVID-19 pandemic, adolescent athletes reported increased symptoms of depression, decreased physical activity and decreased quality of life compared to adolescent athletes in previous years.","McGuine, Timothy A; Biese, Kevin; Hetzel, Scott J; Petrovska, Labina; Kliethermes, Stephanie; Reardon, Claudia L; Bell, David R; Brooks, M Alison; Watson, Andrew M",Journal of athletic training,28,25

By enabling definition of lineages it facilitates tracking of the global spread of the virus. The evolution of new variants can be monitored and knowledge of specific mutations provides insights into the mechanisms through which the virus increases transmissibility or evades immunity. To date almost one million SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced by members of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium. To achieve similar feats in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner in future, improved high throughput virus sequencing protocols are required. We have therefore developed a miniaturized library preparation protocol with drastically reduced consumable use and costs. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was amplified using the ARTIC nCov-2019 multiplex RT-PCR protocol and purified using a conventional liquid handling system. Acoustic liquid transfer (Echo 525) was employed to reduce reaction volumes and the number of tips required for a Nextera XT library preparation. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. Results: We present the 'Mini-XT' miniaturized tagmentation-based library preparation protocol available on protocols.io (https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bvntn5en). The final version of Mini-XT has been used to sequence 4,384 SARS-CoV-2 samples from N. Ireland with a COG-UK QC pass rate of 97.4%. Sequencing quality was comparable and lineage calling consistent for replicate samples processed with full volume Nextera DNA Flex (333 samples) or using nanopore technology (20 samples). SNP calling between Mini-XT and these technologies was consistent and sequences from replicate samples paired together in maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. Conclusion: The Mini-XT protocol maintains sequence quality while reducing library preparation reagent volumes 8-fold and halving overall tip usage from sample to sequence to provide concomitant cost savings relative to standard protocols. This will enable more efficient high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates and future pathogen WGS.","Fuchs, M.; Radulescu, C.; Tang, M.; Mahesh, A.; Lavin, D.; Umbreen, S.; McKenna, J.; Smyth, M.; McColgan, E.; Molnar, Z.; Baxter, C.; Skvortsov, T.; Singh, A.; Rogan, F.; Miskelly, J.; Bridgett, S.; Fairley, D.; Simpson, D.

Responding to emergencies successfully requires widespread participation of local government sectors that engages in diversified collaboration behav-iors across organizational boundaries for achieving sustainability. However, the multi-organizational collaborative process is highly dynamic and complex, as well as its outcomes are uncertain under-lying the emergency response network. Examining characteristics of the collaborative process and exploring how collaborative behaviors local governmental sectors engaging in the impact their perceived outcomes is essential to understand how disastrous situations are addressed by collaborative efforts in emergency management. This research investigates diversified collaborative behaviors in emergency response and then examines this using a multi-dimensional model consisting of joint decision making, joint implementation, compromised autonomy, resource sharing, and trust building. We surveyed 148 local governments and their affiliated sectors in China in-depth understanding how collaborative processes contribute to perceived outcomes from perspectives of participating sectors in the context of a centralized political-administrative system. A structural equation model (SEM) is employed to encode multiple dimensions of the collaborative process, perceived outcomes, as well as their relationships. The empirical finding indicates that joint decision making and implementation positively affect the perceived outcomes significantly. The empirical results indicate that joint decision making and joint implementation affect perceived outcomes significantly. Instead, resource sharing and trust building do not affect the outcomes positively as expected. Additionally, compromised autonomy negatively affects the collaborative outcomes. We also discuss the institutional advantages for achieving successful outcomes in emergency management in China by reducing the degree of compromised autonomy. Our findings provide insight that can improve efforts to build and maintain a collaborative process to respond to emergencies. © 2021 by the authors.

This article analyzes how heads of state and heads of government in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden framed the problems and solutions to the spread of the virus during the pandemic's initial phase. A Foucauldian-inspired method of problematization guides the narrative analysis, complemented by governmentality, risk communication, and taskscape theories. The results of the analysis show how the individual is conceptualized as a central actor and whose practices are framed as crucial to overcoming the crisis. Through invoking a sense of responsibility, sacrifice, and current life during the pandemic as a difficult time, the speeches allude to how people through changed behavior can/sould, contribute to the greater good. The individual is positioned as a key cause of, and solution to the problem;however, construing the individual as an indispensable actor to overcoming the crisis also means that the individual is laid open for reprehension. To facilitate the spread of the containment message and to support individual understanding of overt risk, the four countries' leadership also augment their conceptualization of the crisis with ideas of national identity to inspire the individual to contribute to the ""battle"" and ""defeat"" of the virus. The leadership does also embrace the important role of the national government in controlling the outbreak and the role of science, and trust in science, are also emphasized. The speeches analyzed in this paper can be understood as governance technologies;the spatial disciplining and self-governance demanded by the regimes create subject positions for individuals or groups. A debate on the rights and responsibilities of the citizen is another aspect that comes to the fore, considering how the containment strategies in all four countries proclaim the individual as a core agent in circumscribing the virus, and hence the individual's activities as potentially damaging to the fight against the pandemic. This throws into question the connection between individual autonomy as a democratic right and disciplinary mechanisms, sometimes phrased encouragingly and at other times in an enforcing way.","Sjolander-Lindqvist, A.; Larsson, S.; Fava, N.; Gillberg, N.; Marciano, C.; Cinque, S.",Frontiers in Communication,28,1

Within Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent containment measures have led to reduced face-to-face attendances. To maintain access to mental health consultations, new telehealth services were introduced by the Australian Government in late March 2020.ObjectivesWe aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patterns of mental health attendances in Australia using an interrupted time series model.MethodsTo characterise patterns of mental health service utilisation, monthly mental health attendances between January 2016 and June 2020 were extracted from the Medicare database, stratified by clinician type: general practitioner (GP), psychiatrist, and allied health. We used triple exponential smoothing to model attendances between January 2017 and December 2019. Observed and predicted attendances between January and June 2020 were compared with 95% confidence (p<0.05).ResultsOur models showed decreased mental health attendances in March and April, consistent with all healthcare services during this time. While uptake of telehealth was significant, it only partially covered the reduction in mental health attendances.ConclusionsOur modelling highlights the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health services in Australia, with telehealth only partially compensating for the reduction in face-to-face attendances. These results suggest that telehealth services may not be suitable for all individuals (e.g. those without reliable internet access).

However, the efficiency of this material is controversial. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cloth masks in reducing transmission and contamination by droplets and aerosols for the general population and healthcare workers. Electronic databases were searched without year or language restrictions. Clinical and laboratorial studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using an adapted quality checklist for laboratory-based studies. ROBINS-I tool and Cochrane RoB 2.0 were used to evaluate non-randomized (n-RCT) and randomized clinical trials (RCT), respectively. The quality of the evidence was assessed through GRADE tool. From the eleven studies selected, eight were laboratory-based studies, one non-randomized and one RCT supported by laboratory data. Between the evaluated fabrics only three presented a filtration efficiency >90%. Hybrid of cotton/chiffon (95%CI 95.2 to 98.8), hybrid of cotton/silk (95%CI 92.2 to 95.8) and cotton quilt (95%CI 94.2 to 97.8). A meta-analysis was not feasible due to a high methodological heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Despite the lower efficiency compared to medical masks, laboratorial results may underestimate the efficiency of cloth masks in real life. Cloth mask efficiency is higher when made of hybrid fabrics (cotton/chiffon, cotton/silk) and cotton quilt, mainly with multiple layers. In pandemic situations any measure that can contribute to source control at the population level can have a beneficial effect. However, cloth masks are not recommended for healthcare workers.","Santos, M.; Torres, D.; Cardoso, P. C.; Pandis, N.; Flores-Mir, C.; Medeiros, R.; Normando, D.",,28,1

Therefore, this study aims to examine the factors that influence students' actual usage of e-learning system during the pandemic from three different dimensions (i.e., usability, interaction, and quality) and also to explore the interaction effects of instructor support on the three main dimensions identified above. This study adopted a quantitative research method and collected the survey data from 160 undergraduate students enrolled in two courses at King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia, reflecting their individual experience with the system usage. Regression analysis and model assessment were tested using SmartPLS with the partial least square-structural equation modeling. The findings confirm the positive effects of the three dimensions on the e-learning usage in both models (direct effects and interaction effects). The quality dimension stands as the most significant driving force among the three dimensions. Furthermore, the findings show that instructor support positively moderates the relationship between the quality dimension and students' usage of e-learning, while it has insignificant negative interaction effects on both usability and interaction dimension. This research sheds light on relevant factors within different dimensions for effective use of e-learning system, also offers new insights to academicians and practitioners to further provide more appropriate mechanisms likely to drive students' usage of e-learning.

The first case present a 34-year-old male was admitted complaining of sudden dyspnea starting one day before. He also reported diarrhea in the last two weeks. There was no history of trauma or comorbidities. At admission, the patient was afebrile. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), blood pressure (BP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) with 2L/minute of supplemental oxygen (O2) were 112 beats per minute, 24 breaths per minute, 100/90mmHg and 93%, respectively. Thoracic examination showed hypersonority to percussion and abolished vesicular murmur in the left hemithorax. Test swab oropharynx with polymerase chain reaction test for real-time reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was positive for COVID-19. High-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) scan showed bilateral consolidations and ground-glass opacities with peripheral predominance, compromising around 50% of the lung parenchyma, and pneumothorax on the left side with deviation of contralateral mediastinal structures and ipsilateral lung collapse. Thoracic drainage was performed in the left pleural space with clinical stabilization. The patient is still hospitalized and stable, needing oxygen supplementation. The second case present a 62-year-old and ex-smoker (18 pack-years) male was admitted to the emergency department with anosmia, fever, general malaise, dry cough and dyspnea that started twenty days before, with worsening cough and dyspnea in the last day. At admission, he was afebrile, and HR, RR, and BP were 97 beats per minute, 21 breaths per minute, and 220/110 mmHg, respectively. The initial SpO2 was 81% on room air and 91% with a non-reigning mask with 9L/min of O2. Nasopharynx swab RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced many healthcare systems to expand access for patients using telemedicine, but little is known about cancellation frequencies in telemedicine vs. in-person appointments and its impact on clinical outcomes. Objective: Compare ambulatory clinic cancellation rates, 30-day inpatient hospitalizations rates, and 30-day emergency department visit rates between in-person and video telemedicine appointments, and examine differences in cancellation rates by age, race/ethnicity, gender, and insurance. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Setting: The largest academic healthcare system in the state of Georgia with ambulatory clinics in urban, suburban and rural settings. Participants: Adults scheduled for an ambulatory clinic appointment from June 2020 to December 2020 were included. Each appointment was identified as either a video telemedicine or in-person clinic appointment. Demographics including age, race, ethnicity, gender, primary insurance, and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic medical record. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary process outcome was ambulatory clinic cancellation rates. The primary clinical outcomes were 30-day hospitalization rates and 30-day emergency department visit rates.

Risk factors associated with the development of ARDS include older age and diabetes2. However, little is known about factors associated with ARDS in the setting of COVID-19, in patients with rheumatic disease or those receiving immunosuppressive medications. Prediction algorithms using traditional regression methods perform poorly with rare outcomes, often yielding high specificity but very low sensitivity. Machine learning algorithms optimized for rare events are an alternative approach with potentially improved sensitivity for rare events, such as ARDS in COVID-19 among patients with rheumatic disease. Objectives: We aimed to develop a prediction model for ARDS in people with COVID-19 and pre-existing rheumatic disease using a series of machine learning algorithms and to identify risk factors associated with ARDS in this population. Methods: We used data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA) Registry from March 24 to Nov 1, 2020. ARDS diagnosis was indicated by the reporting clinician. Five machine learning algorithms optimized for rare events predicted ARDS using 42 variables covering patient demographics, rheumatic disease diagnoses, medications used at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and comorbidities. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, area under curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Adjusted odds ratios corresponding to the 10 most influential predictors from the best performing model were derived using hierarchical multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression that accounted for within-country correlations. Results: A total of 5,931 COVID-19 cases from 67 countries were included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age was 54.9 (16.0) years, 4,152 (70.0%) were female, and 2,399 (40.5%) were hospitalized. ARDS was reported in 388 (6.5% of total and 15.6% of hospitalized) cases. Statistically significant differences in the risk of ARDS were observed by demographics, diagnoses, medications, and comorbidities using unadjusted univariate comparisons (data not shown). Gradient boosting machine (GBM) had the highest sensitivity (0.81) and was considered the best performing model (Table 1). Hypertension, interstitial lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, older age, glucocorticoids, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies were associated with the development of ARDS while tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were associated with a protective effect (Figure 1). Conclusion: In this global cohort of patients with rheumatic disease, a machine learning model, GBM, predicted the onset of ARDS with 81% sensitivity using baseline information obtained at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. These results identify patients who may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Further studies are necessary to validate the proposed prediction model in external cohorts and to evaluate its clinical utility.

ATI cells have a broad flattened morphology and cover about 95% of the gas exchange surface of the lung. Whilst, ATIIs are small cuboidal cells with characteristic lamellar inclusions and apical microvilli that line the remainder of the alveolus (about 5%). ATII cells make and secrete a pulmonary surfactant, which reduces the surface tension in the alveoli preventing alveolar collapse during respiration and reducing the energy required to inflate the lungs, thereby increasing pulmonary compliance. These cells also transport ions from the apical to the basolateral surface so as to keep the alveoli relatively fluid free and have roles in the innate immune response. Importantly, they are the progenitor cells for the alveolar epithelium in the adult lung. Having a very thin cytoplasm, a limited number of mitochondria and covering a higher surface area, ATI cells are easily damaged during lung injury, after which they are replaced by ATII cells through the alveolar epithelium regeneration process. Despite ATII cells are considered an essential part of this process, numerous interstitial lung diseases are characterized by hyperplastic ATIIs: in fact, they may also contribute to the fibroproliferative reaction by secreting a number of growth factors and proinflammatory molecules.","Confalonieri, Marco Salton Francesco Ruaro Barbara Confalonieri Paola Volpe Maria Concetta",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine (Second Edition),28,24

As a technologically mediated way of communication, it proved that during a pandemic, the virtual communication is the only alternative to traditional face-to-face communication, and its use was inevitable to partially or completely overcome the social restrictions imposed. In order to examine some of the effects of the virtual communication during the social isolation in Bulgaria, an academic research team from the Faculty of Journalism and Mass Communication at The St. Kliment Ohridsky Sofia University undertook a study in the declared two month’s period (13.03.–13.05.2020) of the state of national emergency in the country. The researchers conducted a three-folded study: on the sociological polls and the media coverage during the pandemics;on the activities of the telecommunication industry;and on the impacts of virtual communication during the social isolation, using mixed methodology: quantitative and qualitative survey with three groups of respondents: media users, media professionals and media experts.

The survey included social, demographic and the history of affective disorders data. The anxiety distress level was evaluated with the Psychological Stress Measure (PSM-25).ResultsIndividuals from sub-cohort of Russian cities with populations less than one million had higher stress levels (M=135.39) compared to Moscow (M=129.47;p=0.003) or St.-Petersburg (M=126.63;p<0.001). However, stress scores in respondents with a history of affective disorders correspond to the average stress level according to PSM-25. Respondents without affective disorders from St.-Petersburg reported lower stress levels (M=92.88) than respondents from Moscow (M=100.47;p<0.001) and Russian cities with less than one million population (M=98.4;p<0.001). Average stress scores from St.-Petersburg and other Russian cities show a low level of stress on PSM-25, which indicates psychological adaptation. Stress scores from Moscow have borderline values between low and medium levels.ConclusionsOur study showed that the city of residence and affective disorders status significantly affect stress levels in Russian population. These factors could be further used in individual psychological support strategies.","Kasyanov, E.; Rukavishnikov, G.; Sorokin, M.; Makarevich, O.; Neznanov, N.; Lutova, N.; Mazo, G.",European Psychiatry,28,1

In these contexts, connected independent journalists act as gatekeepers linking the virtual and the physical offline spaces of the orality and mythical traditions of their societies. Myths are a way of making sense of reality and in times of crisis, lack of information truthfulness can open the gateways for uncertainties and disorientation. A more culture-centered approach to social media may provide an opportunity to halt misconceptions in these contexts serving as a corrective mechanism against false information. This paper asks: How do fact-checkers combat/halt Covid-19 myths and misconceptions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic? How do they engage in social media networks toward sense-giving and sharing corrective information? It discusses two cases of online media projects, 'Congo Check' and `Talato', led by independent journalists that combine fact-checking skills when communicating the pandemic and attempt to engage civil society to better consume information. The data collection comprises of interviews with the journalists, as well as the Twitter handling of these projects.

Here we describe the safety and durability of the immune response from two doses of a DNA vaccine (INO-4800) targeting the full-length Spike antigen and a subsequent homologous booster dose. Methods: INO-4800 was evaluated in 120 healthy participants across three dose groups (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg), each stratified by age. INO-4800 was injected intradermally followed by electroporation at 0 and 4 weeks followed by an optional booster dose 6-10.5 months following the second dose. Results: INO-4800 was well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported. Most adverse events were mild in severity and did not increase in frequency with age and subsequent dosing. A durable antibody response was observed 6 months following the second dose; a homologous booster dose significantly increased immune responses. Cytokine producing T cells and activated CD8+T cells with lytic potential were detected in the 2.0 mg dose group. Conclusion: INO-4800 was well-tolerated as a 2-dose series and as a homologous booster dose in all adults, including the elderly. These results support further development of INO-4800 as a primary series and as a booster. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; Clinical trial; DNA Vaccine; COVID-19; Immunogenicity; Booster","Kraynyak, K.

Alhydroxiquim-II is a TLR7/8 small-molecule agonist chemisorbed on aluminium hydroxide. Vaccination with Alhydroxiquim-II combined with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (termed CoVac-II) resulted in high-titre NAbs in mice, with no decay in responses over an 8-month period. NAbs from sera of CoVac-II-immunized mice, horses and rabbits were broadly neutralising against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Boosting long-term CoVac-II-immunized mice with adjuvanted spike protein from the Beta variant markedly increased levels of NAb titres against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants; notably high titres against the Delta variant were observed.

The precise role of TCF7L2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in adult adipocytes remains to be defined. Here, we aim to investigate how changes in TCF7L2 expression in mature adipocytes affect glucose homeostasis. Tcf7l2 was selectively ablated from mature adipocytes in C57BL/6J mice using an adiponectin promoter-driven Cre recombinase to recombine alleles floxed at exon 1 of the Tcf7l2 gene. Mice lacking Tcf7l2 in mature adipocytes displayed normal body weight. Male mice exhibited normal glucose homeostasis at eight weeks of age. Male heterozygote knockout mice (aTCF7L2het) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (AUC increased 1.14 ± 0.04 -fold, p=0.03), as assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, and changes in fat mass at 16 weeks (increased by 1.4 ± 0.09-fold, p=0.007). Homozygote knockout mice exhibited impaired oral glucose tolerance at 16 weeks of age (AUC increased 2.15 ± 0.15-fold, p=0.0001). Islets of Langerhans exhibited impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro (decreased 0.54 ± 0.13-fold aTCF7L2KO vs control, p=0.02), but no changes in in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Female mice in which one or two alleles of the Tcf7l2 gene was knocked out in adipocytes displayed no changes in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. Plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were lowered in knockout mice (decreased 0.57 ± 0.03-fold and 0.41 ± 0.12-fold, p=0.04 and p=0.002, respectively), whilst plasma free fatty acids and Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 circulating levels were increased by 1.27 ± 0.07 and 1.78 ± 0.32-fold, respectively (p=0.05 and p=0.03). Mice with biallelic Tcf7l2 deletion exposed to high fat diet for 9 weeks exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (p=0.003 at 15 min after glucose injection) which was associated with reduced in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (decreased 0.51 ± 0.03-fold, p=0.02). Thus, our data indicate that loss of Tcf7l2 gene expression in adipocytes leads to impairments on metabolic responses which are dependent on gender, age and nutritional status. Our findings further illuminate the role of TCF7L2 in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.","Nguyen-Tu, Marie-Sophie; Martinez-Sanchez, Aida; Leclerc, Isabelle; Rutter, Guy A.; da Silva Xavier, Gabriela",bioRxiv,28,1

Consumption has become a phenomenon that turned into madness due to the acceleration of aggressive sales enhancing efforts based on fierce competition and to the fact that consumers confuse the concepts of need and desire. Confronting the consumers with easily reachable products and broad distribution channels, markets are vital institutions for people. The first aim of this study is to determine the factors increasing and decreasing customer satisfaction. The second aim is to determine whether there is a meaningful correlation between markets and demographic elements. To this end, perceptions of 407 consumers in Diyarbakir who were chosen by convenience sampling method were measured by face-to-face questions. Then their answers were subjected to frequency analysis and chi-square test. In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis has been utilized to see the model.

Mice exposed by handling or by soiled bedding did not develop coronavirus antibody. Two of 10 mice exposed to SDAV-inoculated rats by close contact were coronavirus seropositive when tested 3 weeks postexposure. SDAV-inoculated rats and mice developed coronavirus lesions and antibody. These results suggest that rat-to-rat transmission of SDAV is likely via fomites or handling; however, rat-to-mouse transmission is unlikely when animals are housed and husbanded using modern techniques.

The ns2 gene comprises an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative nonstructural (ns) protein of 279 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 32-kDa. The S gene comprises an ORF encoding a protein of 1353 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular weight of 149,918. Sequence comparison between HCV-OC43 and the antigenically related bovine coronavirus (BCV) revealed more sequence divergence in the putative bulbous part of the S protein (S1) than in the stem region (S2). The cysteine residues near the transmembrane domain and the internal predicted protease cleavage site are conserved in the HCV-OC43 S protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the region between the S and M gene loci revealed the presence of an unexpected intragenomic partial leader sequence and two ORFs encoding potential proteins of 12.9 and 9.5-kDa. These two proteins were identified as nonstructural by comparison with the homologous BCV genes. In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the HCV-OC43 9.5-kDa protein, like its BCV counterpart, is poorly translated when situated down-stream of the 12.9-kDa ORF, but is expressed in infected cells, as shown by immunofluorescence. Interestingly, two ORFs, potentially encoding 4.9 and 4.8-kDa ns proteins in BCV are absent in HCV-OC43, indicating that they are not essential for viral replication in HRT-18 cells.","Mounir, S; Labonté, P; Talbot, P J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,28,24

STUDY DESIGN: This observational longitudinal cohort study of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-and their infants at 3 NYU Langone Health hospitals was conducted between March 25, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Mothers were surveyed by telephone regarding predelivery feeding plans, in-hospital feeding, and home feeding of their neonates. Any change prompted an additional question to determine whether this change was due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Of the 160 mother-newborn dyads, 103 mothers were reached by telephone, and 85 consented to participate. There was no significant difference in the predelivery feeding plan between the separated and unseparated dyads (P = .268). Higher rates of breastfeeding were observed in the unseparated dyads compared with the separated dyads both in the hospital (P < .001) and at home (P = .012). Only 2 mothers in each group reported expressed breast milk as the hospital feeding source (5.6% of unseparated vs 4.1% of separated). COVID-19 was more commonly cited as the reason for change in the separated group (49.0% vs 16.7%; P < .001). When the dyads were further stratified by symptom status into 4 groups-asymptomatic separated, asymptomatic unseparated, symptomatic separated, and symptomatic unseparated-the results remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of COVID-19, separation of mother-newborn dyads impacts breastfeeding outcomes, with lower rates of breastfeeding both during hospitalization and at home following discharge compared with unseparated mothers and infants.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Literature analysis, the theoretical foundations of the contagion effect and the analysis of financial and historical data were used as the research method. Findings: The impact of the contagion effect on the course and scale of the financial crisis depends on many factors and circumstances, which differ in respect of a country and additionally change in time, in spite of the fact that the system of disorder impulse transmission is universal and includes four basic channels, namely liquidity (repo transactions and unsecured financing), assets and public debt channel. Practical Implications: The combination of administrative tools (e.g., introduction of a temporary ban on the short-term sale of shares listed on stock exchange) and central bank monetary policy instruments (e.g. practically unlimited access to liquidity for banks) may considerably reduce the role of the liquidity channel in the contagion effect transmission. Non-standard banking activity on the government securities markets led to the reduction of sovereign bonds margins, thus contributing to the limitation of contagion effect thought the public debt channel. Originality/Value: The article specifically indicated and evaluated the shock transmission channels and contagion effects between countries and markets and between banks through the interbank market (taking into account the differences and specific character of the secured and unsecured lending market).

We intend to train chest x-rays of infected and not infected ones with different CNNs architectures including VGG19, Densnet-121, and Xception. Training these architectures resulted in different accuracies which were much faster and more precise than usual ways of testing.","Babaeipour, Ramtin; Azizi, Elham; Khotanlou, Hassan",,28,1

We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of influenza among Chinese adults during this special season. A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was performed by recruiting 4822 participants. There were 76.09% of the participants reporting that they learned more knowledge of influenza during the COVID-19 epidemic. The mean knowledge score of participants was 5.51 ± 1.55 (78.7% correct rate), and participants who received influenza vaccination in the past year scored the highest (6.06 ± 1.30, p< .001). Nearly half of the participants (49.63%) agreed the threat to the functioning of society by influenza was far less than the COVID-19. 73.04% of the participants knew influenza vaccination was the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, while 54.18% did not know the vaccination location. The proportion of participants who were willing to get vaccinated would increase from 62.53% to 85.82% if clinicians recommended the vaccination. For influenza-like illness, merely 36.11% of participants would seek medical care from the hospital, and 60.53% agreed or showed a neutral attitude toward antibiotic use for influenza treatment. Regression analyses showed that the medical profession and history of influenza vaccination were both associated with higher knowledge or attitude score and participants' use of face masks in previous seasons and their willingness to receive influenza vaccination. In conclusion, the awareness of influenza vaccination among adults in China should be reinforced and educational campaigns were warranted to increase the coverage of influenza vaccination.","Jiang, Minghuan; Feng, Liuxin; Wang, Weihua; Gong, Yilin; Ming, Wai-Kit; Hayat, Khezar; Li, Pengchao; Gillani, Ali Hassan; Yao, Xuelin; Fang, Yu",Hum Vaccin Immunother,28,17

We consider civic movements and novel forms of collaboration as a potentially transformative challenger to the predominant approach of corporatist collaboration in the mobility and energy sectors. However, while trade unions and employer organizations provide a permanent and active arena for policy-oriented collaboration, civil society groups cannot rely on an equivalently institutionalized corridor to secure policy impact and public resonance. In that sense, conventional forms of collaboration tend to hinder the transformation towards a post-carbon economy. Collaboration in the German corporatist setting is thus, from a sustainability perspective, simultaneously a problem and a solution. We argue for more institutionalized corridors between civil society and state institutions. Co-creation, as we would like to call this methodical approach to collaborating, can be anchored within the environmental and industrial policy arenas.","Herberg, Jeremias; Haas, Tobias; Oppold, Daniel; von Schneidemesser, Dirk",Sustainability,28,1

It is noteworthy that air quality is also closely related to the risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we aimed to assess the mediating role of air quality on the association between human mobility and the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. METHODS: We collected daily confirmed cases, human mobility data, air quality data and meteorological variables in 120 cities from China between January 23, 2020 and February 29, 2020. We applied the generalized additive model to examine the association of human mobility index with COVID-19 confirmed cases, and to assess the mediating effects of air quality index and each pollutant. RESULTS: We observed a significant positive relationship between human mobility index and the daily counts of COVID-19 confirmed cases. A unit increase in human mobility index (lag0-14) was associated with a 6.45% increase in daily COVID-19 confirmed cases, and air quality index significantly mediated 19.47% of this association. We also observed a positive relationship between human mobility index and air quality index. In the pollutant level analyses, we found significant mediating effects of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that limiting human movements could reduce COVID-19 cases by improving air quality besides decreasing social contact.","Zhu, Yongjian; Xie, Jingui; Huang, Fengming; Cao, Liqing",Environ Res,28,16

AREAS COVERED: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and MedRxiv 11/1/2019 to 3/1/2021, including studies comparing outcomes in COVID-19-related ARDS (COVID-19 group) and ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 (ARDS group). Outcomes investigated were duration of mechanical ventilation-free days, intensive care unit (ICU) length-of-stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mortality. Random effects models were fit for each outcome measure. Effect sizes were reported as pooled median differences of medians (MDMs), mean differences (MDs), or odds ratios (ORs). EXPERT OPINION: Ten studies with 2,281 patients met inclusion criteria (COVID-19: 861 [37.7%], ARDS: 1420 [62.3%]). There were no significant differences between the COVID-19 and ARDS groups for median number of mechanical ventilator-free days (MDM: -7.0 [95% CI: -14.8; 0.7], p = 0.075), ICU LOS (MD: 3.1 [95% CI: -5.9; 12.1], p = 0.501), hospital LOS (MD: 2.5 [95% CI: -5.6; 10.7], p = 0.542), or all-cause mortality (OR: 1.25 [95% CI: 0.78; 1.99], p = 0.361).

This study had the aim of exploring the potential of developing and validating a model for prediction of future CGM measurements in order to overcome the time-delay. METHODS: An artificial neural network regression (NN) approach were used to predict CGM values with a lead-time of 15 min. The NN were trained and internally validated on 23 million minutes of CGM and externally validated on 2 million minutes of CGM. The validation included data from 278 type 1 diabetes patients using three different CGM sensors. The NN performance were compared with three alternative methods, linear extrapolation, spline extrapolation and last observation carried forward. RESULTS: The internal validation yielded a RMSE of 9.1 mg/dL, a MARD of 4.2 % and 99.9 % of predictions were in the A + B zone of the consensus error grid. The external validation yielded a RMSE of 5.9-11.3 mg/dL, a MARD of 3.2-5.4 % and 99.9-100 % of predictions were in the A + B zone of the consensus error grid. The NN performed better on all parameters compared to the two alternative methods. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed and validated a NN glucose prediction model that is potential simple to use and implement. The model only needs input from a CGM system in order to facilitate glucose prediction with a lead time of 15 min.

Food and Drug administration for emergency use to interfere with the replication of SARS CoV-2 virus (the agent that causes COVID-19) in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease. The crystal structure of the metabolite of remdesivir (Monophosphate of GS-441524) and NSP12-NSP8-NSP7 of SARS CoV-2 virus was recently reported. The crystal structures of ADP-Ribose or AMP and NSP3 of SARS CoV-2 virus were also released, recently. This study compared their binding sites and suggests the crystal structure of NSP3 of SARS CoV-2 virus as an alternative binding site of AMP or ADP-ribose to treat COVID-19. We virtually screened 682 FDA-approved compounds, and the top 10 compounds were selected by analysis of docking scores, (G-score, D-score, and Chemscore) and visual analysis using a structure-based docking approach of NSP3 of SARS CoV-2 virus. All immunization approaches are based on the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. A recent study reported that the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein reduces S1 shedding and increases infectivity of SARS COV-2 virus. Therefore, if there is a severe change in the spike protein of a modified Coronavirus, all developed vaccines can lose their efficacy, necessitating the need for an alternative treatment method. The top 10 compounds (FDA-approved) in this study are selected based on NSP 3 binding site, and therefore are a potential viable treatment because they will show potential activity for all mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein.","Jung, Lindsey S; Gund, Tamara M; Narayan, Mahesh",Protein J,28,21

Facility-based childbirth is promoted as the standard of care for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. We conducted a convergent, mixed methods study to assess barriers and facilitators to facility-based childbirth at Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais (HUM) in Mirebalais, Haiti. METHODS: We conducted secondary analyses of a prospective cohort of pregnant women seeking antenatal care at HUM and quantitatively assessed predictors of not having a facility-based childbirth at HUM. We prospectively enrolled 30 pregnant women and interviewed them about their experiences delivering at home or at HUM. RESULTS: Of 1105 pregnant women seeking antenatal care at the hospital between May and December 2017, 773 (70%) returned to the hospital for facility-based childbirth. In multivariable analyses, living farther from the hospital (adjusted OR (AOR)=0.73; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96), poverty (AOR=0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99) and household hunger (AOR=0.45; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.79) were associated with not having a facility-based childbirth. Primigravid women were more likely to have a facility-based childbirth (AOR=1.34, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.76). Qualitative data provided insight into the value women place on traditional birth attendants ('matrons') during home-based childbirths. While women perceived facility-based childbirths as better equipped to handle birth complications, barriers such as distance, costs of transportation and supplies, discomfort of facility birthing practices and mistreatment by medical staff resulted in negative perceptions of facility-based childbirths. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women in rural Haiti must overcome substantial structural barriers and forfeit valued support from traditional birth attendants when they pursue facility-based childbirths. If traditional birth attendants could be involved in care alongside midwives at facilities, women may be more inclined to deliver there. While complex structural barriers remain, the inclusion of matrons at facilities may increase uptake of facility-based childbirths, and ultimately improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.","Raymondville, Maxi; Rodriguez, Carly A; Richterman, Aaron; Jerome, Gregory; Katz, Arlene; Gilbert, Hannah; Anderson, Gregory; Joseph, Jean Paul; Franke, Molly F; Ivers, Louise C",,28,5

To solve this problem, we propose a novel spatio-temporal infected rate (IR) measure based on human moving trajectories that can adequately describe the risk of being infected by a given query trajectory of a patient. Then, we manage source data through an efficient spatio-temporal index to make our system more scalable, and can quickly query susceptible crowds from massive trajectories. Besides, we design several pruning strategies that can effectively reduce calculations. Further, we design a spatial first time (SFT) index, which enables us to quickly query multiple trajectories without much I/O consumption and data redundancy. The performance of the solutions is demonstrated in experiments based on real and synthetic trajectory datasets that have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions.","He, Huajun; Li, Ruiyuan; Wang, Rubin; Bao, Jie; Zheng, Yu; Li, Tianrui",,28,5

T-type channels have been implicated in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including epilepsy, autism, and mood regulation, but the brain structures involved remain incompletely understood. The medial habenula (MHb) is an epithalamic structure implicated in anxiety-like and withdrawal behavior. Previous studies have shown that MHb neurons fire tonic APs at a frequency of â¼2-10 Hz or display depolarized low amplitude membrane oscillations. Here, we report in C57BL/6J mice that a subpopulation of MHb neurons are capable of firing transient, high frequency AP bursts mediated by T-type channels. Burst firing was observed following rebounding from hyperpolarizing current injections or during depolarization from hyperpolarized membrane potentials in â¼20% of MHb neurons. It was rarely observed at baseline but could be evoked in MHb neurons displaying different initial activity states. Further, we show that T-type channel mRNA, in particular Cav3.1, is expressed in the MHb in both cholinergic and substance P-ergic neurons. Pharmacological Cav3 antagonism blocked both burst firing and evoked Ca2+ currents in MHb neurons. Additionally, we observed high frequency AP doublet firing at sustained depolarized membrane potentials that was independent of T-type channels. Thus, there is a greater diversity of AP firing patterns in MHb neurons than previously identified, including T-type channel-mediated burst firing, which may uniquely contribute to behaviors with relevance to neuropsychiatric disease.Significance statement Previous studies have reported that medial habenula neurons solely fire tonic action potentials at â¼2-10 Hz or display depolarized low amplitude membrane oscillations. In contrast, we found that a subpopulation of medial habenula neurons fire high frequency action potential bursts that share the characteristics of T-type Ca2+ channel-mediated low threshold spikes and were blocked by pharmacological antagonism of T-type Ca2+ channels. T-type Ca2+ channel mRNA, especially Cav3.1, is expressed in the medial habenula in both cholinergic and substance P-ergic neurons. T-type channel-independent action potential doublets were also observed in medial habenula neurons at sustained depolarized membrane potentials. Thus, there is a greater diversity of AP firing patterns in MHb neurons than previously recognized, including T-type Ca2+ channel-mediated burst firing.","Vickstrom, Casey R; Liu, Xiaojie; Zhang, Yuqi; Mu, Lianwei; Kelly, Thomas J; Yan, Xudong; Hu, Meng-Ming; Snarrenberg, Shana T; Liu, Qing-Song",ENeuro,28,22

Here, we tested whether a specific psychological belief-identification with all humanity-predicts cooperation with public health guidelines as well as helpful behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that peoples' endorsement of this belief-their relative perception of a connection and moral commitment to other humans-would predict their tendencies to adopt World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and to help others. To assess this, we conducted a global online study (N = 2537 participants) of four WHO-recommended health behaviors and four pandemic-related moral dilemmas that we constructed to be relevant to helping others at a potential cost to oneself. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) that included 10 predictor variables (demographic, contextual, and psychological) for each of five outcome measures (a WHO cooperative health behavior score, plus responses to each of our four moral, helping dilemmas). Identification with all humanity was the most consistent and consequential predictor of individuals' cooperative health behavior and helpful responding. Analyses showed that the identification with all humanity significantly predicted each of the five outcomes while controlling for the other variables (Prange < 10-22 to < 0.009). The mean effect size of the identification with all humanity predictor on these outcomes was more than twice as large as the effect sizes of other predictors. Identification with all humanity is a psychological construct that, through targeted interventions, may help scientists and policymakers to better understand and promote cooperative health behavior and help-oriented concern for others during the current pandemic as well as in future humanitarian crises.","Barragan, Rodolfo C; Oliveira, Nigini; Khalvati, Koosha; Brooks, Rechele; Reinecke, Katharina; Rao, Rajesh P N; Meltzoff, Andrew N",PLoS One,28,20

Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study to assess the incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19 positivity among asymptomatic, adult patients who were planned for systemic therapy as day care at a tertiary care cancer center. COVID-19 testing was done by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction by throat/nasopharyngeal swab once before the first cycle of systemic therapy and once every 3 weeks until completion of systemic therapy. Results A total of 824 systemic therapies were delivered in day care from May 7 to June 20, 2020. Among the 761 COVID-19 testing done before systemic therapy, 11 patients were COVID-19 positive (1.45%, 95% confidence interval: 0.60-2.29). Among the 11 patients, 45% were negative before the first systemic therapy but tested positive before subsequent cycles. Among the asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients, 54% were hospitalized for observation and 46% were on home quarantine for 14 days. None of them received investigational therapy or traditional treatment for COVID-19. None of the patients needed admission in the intensive care unit or oxygen/ventilatory support. There was no mortality among these patients. All patients turned COVID-19 negative at a median of 9 days. Currently, 45% (n = 5/11) of the patients have resumed systemic therapy. Conclusion The incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19 positivity among adult cancer patients planned for day care systemic therapy is low (1.45%). Hence, COVID-19 testing should be done after informed/shared decision with the patient/attendants. Repeat COVID-19 testing before each cycle of systemic therapy is preferable, as 45% of the patients were COVID-19 negative before the first cycle of systemic therapy and turned positive before subsequent cycles in the present study. There was no morbidity or mortality in this cohort of asymptomatic COVID-19-positive cancer patients.","Ovett, J.; Dhanushkodi, M.; Radhakrishnan, V.; Mehra, N.; Kalaiarasi, J.

This study assessed COVID-19 vaccine trust, transmission awareness, risk and protective behaviors, and effects of COVID-19 on mental health and smoking among a sample of clients in California residential SUD treatment programs and identified factors associated with vaccine trust. METHODS: A multi-site sample of SUD treatment clients (n = 265) completed a cross-sectional survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine trust. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly male (82.3 %) and racially/ethnically diverse (33.3 % Non-Hispanic White). Most participants were aware of COVID-19 modes of transmission, however, only 39.5 % trusted a COVID-19 vaccine would be safe and effective. Factors independently associated with trust in a COVID-19 vaccine included age (AOR = 1.03, 95 % CI = 1.02, 1.05, p = 0.0001) and wearing a mask all the time (AOR = 2.48, 95 % CI = 1.86, 3.31, p = 0.0001).

In this report, we develop a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) quantitively. Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In agreement with the data published in literature, we found that the incorporation efficiency of remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and incorporation of remdesivir-TP caused delayed chain termination which can be overcome by higher concentrations of the following nucleotide to be incorporated. Our data also showed that the delay chain termination pattern caused by remdesivir-TP incorporation is different for different template sequence. Multiple incorporations of remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our assay condition. Incorporation of sofosbuvir-TP is very low suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2'-C-methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2'-C-methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report provides a simple screening method that should be useful in evaluating nucleotide-based drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and for studying the mechanism of action of selected nucleotide analog.","Lu, Gaofei; Zhang, Xi; Zheng, Weinan; Sun, Jialei; Hua, Lan; Xu, Lan; Chu, Xin-Jie; Ding, Sheng; Xiong, Wen",,28,33

We sought to understand its effects on vascular surgery practices stratified by VASCON surgical readiness level and determine how these effects have changed during the course of the pandemic. METHODS: All members of the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Society were sent electronic surveys questioning the effects of COVID-19 on their practices in the early pandemic in April (EP) and four months later in the pandemic in August (LP) 2020. RESULTS: Response rates were 206/731 (28%) in the EP group and 108/731 (15%) in the LP group (P < 0.0001). Most EP respondents reported VASCON levels less than 3 (168/206,82%), indicating increased hospital limitations while 6/108 (6%) in the LP group reported this level (P < 0.0001). The EP group was more likely to report a lower VASCON level (increased resource limitations), and decreased clinic, hospital and emergency room consults. Despite an increase of average cases/week to pre-COVID-19 levels, 46/108 (43%) of LP report continued decreased compensation, with 57% reporting more than 10% decrease. Respondents in the decreased compensation group were more likely to have reported a VASCON level 3 or lower earlier in the pandemic (Pâ¯=â¯0.018). 91/108(84%) of LP group have treated COVID-19 patients for thromboembolic events, most commonly acute limb ischemia (76/108) and acute DVT (76/108). While the majority of respondents are no longer delaying the vascular surgery cases, 76/108 (70%) feel that vascular patient care has suffered due to earlier delays, and 36/108 (33%) report a backlog of cases caused by the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a profound effect on vascular surgery practices earlier in the pandemic, resulting in continued detrimental effects on the provision of vascular care as well as compensation received by vascular surgeons.","Bath, Jonathan; Aziz, Faisal; Smeds, Matthew R",Ann. vasc. surg,28,16

This policy received many critics, as Indonesia still experiencing a fluctuated number of infected cases. Understanding public perception through effective risk communication can assist the government in relaying an appropriate message to improve people's compliance and to avoid further disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study observed how risk communication using social media platforms like Twitter could be adopted to measure public attention on COVID-19 related issues ""New Normal"". METHOD: From May 21 to June 18, 2020, we archived all tweets related to COVID-19 containing keywords: ""#NewNormal"", and ""New Normal"" using Drone Emprit Academy (DEA) engine. DEA search API collected all requested tweets and described the cumulative tweets for trend analysis, word segmentation, and word frequency. We further analyzed the public perception using sentiment analysis and identified the predominant tweets using emotion analysis. RESULT: We collected 284,216 tweets from 137,057 active users. From the trend analysis, we observed three stages of the changing trend of the public's attention on the ""New Normal"". Results from the sentiment analysis indicate that more than half of the population (52%) had a ""positive"" sentiment towards the ""New Normal"" issues while only 41% of them had a ""negative"" perception. Our study also demonstrated the public's sentiment trend has gradually shifted from ""negative"" to ""positive"" due to the influence of both the government actions and the spread of the disease. A more detailed analysis of the emotion analysis showed that the majority of the public emotions (77.6%) relied on the emotion of ""trust"", ""anticipation"", and ""joy"". Meanwhile, people were also surprised (8.62%) that the Indonesian government progressed to the ""New Normal"" concept despite a fluctuating number of cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings offer an opportunity for the government to use Twitter in the process of quick decision-making and policy evaluation during uncertain times in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rahmanti, Annisa Ristya; Ningrum, Dina Nur Anggraini; Lazuardi, Lutfan; Yang, Hsuan-Chia; Li, Yu-Chuan Jack",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,28,16

METHODS: Participants were 670 young adult cohort members (ages 21-29) of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018 who participated in the C-EAT study (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time). RESULTS: Among the sample, 84% (n = 561) reported pandemic-related changes to their mood or stress and 33% (n = 221) reported changes to their substance use. Linear regression analyses identified several meaningful risk factors for higher psychological distress during the pandemic, including female gender, White race, higher pre-pandemic depressive symptoms and perceived stress, and lower pre-pandemic stress management ability. A thematic analysis further identified five major themes related to changes in stress and mood following the COVID-19 outbreak describing specific emotional reactions, stress related to the direct impact of the pandemic as well as interpersonal connectedness and economic factors, and strategies for managing stress. In addition, two major themes were identified related to substance use during the pandemic detailing specific changes in and motivations for substance use. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to develop effective, scalable, and rapidly deployable public health resources that target the stressors commonly experienced among young adults to improve their psychological wellbeing during this pandemic.","Emery, Rebecca L; Johnson, Sydney T; Simone, Melissa; Loth, Katie A; Berge, Jerica M; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Soc Sci Med,28,32

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A survey was conducted of clinician-scientists in ophthalmology at US academic institutions between April 17, 2019, and May 19, 2019. Collected information including 1) demographic data; 2) amount, type, and source of startup funding; first extramural grant; and first R01-equivalent independent grant; 3) starting and current salaries; and 4) Likert-scale measurements of career satisfaction were analyzed using multivariate regression. RESULTS: Ninety-eight clinician-scientists in ophthalmology were surveyed across different ages (mean: 48 ± 11 years), research categories, institutional types, geographic regions, and academic ranks. Median startup funding ranged from $50-99k, and median starting salaries ranged from $150-199k. A majority of investigators (67%) received their first extramural award from the National Eye Institute, mainly through K-award mechanisms (82%). The median time to receiving their first independent grant was 8 years, mainly through an R01 award (70%). Greater institutional startup support (P = .027) and earlier extramural grant success (P = .022) were associated with earlier independent funding. Male investigators (P = .001) and MD degreed participants (P = .008) were associated with higher current salaries but not starting salaries. Overall career satisfaction increased with career duration (P = .011) but not with earlier independent funding (P = .746) or higher income (P = .300). CONCLUSIONS: Success in research funding by clinician-scientists in ophthalmology may be linked to institutional support and earlier acquisition of extramural grants but does not impact academic salaries. Nevertheless, career satisfaction among clinician-scientists improves with time, which is not necessarily influenced by research or financial success.","Rusakevich, Alexander M; Protopsaltis, Nicholas J; Rao, Rajesh C; Chao, Daniel L; Yiu, Glenn",Am J Ophthalmol,28,24

The physiopathology of human SARS-CoV-2 has not been completely understood, but its pathogenesis has been linked to a disproportionate response of the immune system. Just as described for SARS and MERS, an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in severe COVID-19 patients. It results from the release by immune and non-immune effector cells of substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and appears to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage. In addition, hyper-coagulation and thrombosis resulted from the important release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the lethality of subjects severely infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore essential to have a deep understanding of the various cytokines involved in this exacerbated immune response, and that could be targeted by potential immunological treatments. The aim of this review was to gather the current knowledge about the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNF&#945; in SARS-CoV-2 CRS, the probable causes and clinical outcomes of this phenomenon in severe cases of COVID-19.","Darif, Dounia; Hammi, Ikram; Kihel, Ayyoub; El Idrissi Saik, Imane; Guessous, Fadila; Akarid, Khadija",Microb Pathog,28,16

Method: MY LIFE is comprised of 263 children (2-16 years) with a physical illness recruited from McMaster Children’s Hospital, their primary caregiving parent, and their closest-aged sibling. Participants are followed with data collection at recruitment, 6, 12, and 24 months which includes structured interviews, self-reported measures, and biological samples and occur in a private research office or at participants’ homes. Post-COVID-19, data collection transitioned to mail and telephone surveys. Results: At recruitment, children were 9.4 (4.2) years of age and 52.7% were male. The mean duration of their physical illness was 4.5 (4.1) years;25% represent incident cases (duration &lt;1 year). Most (69.7%) had healthy body weight and intelligence in the average range (73.5%). Overall, 38.2% of children screened positive for ≥1 mental illness according to parent report (24.8% screened positive based on child self-report). Compared to 2016 Census data, the MY LIFE cohort overrepresents families of higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Multimorbidity is common among children and these baseline data will serve to measure relative changes in the mental health of children with physical illness over time. MY LIFE will provide new information for understanding multimorbidity among children, though underrepresentation of lower socioeconomic families may have implications for the generalizability of findings.","Ferro, M.

Methods: This cross-sectional, web-based survey collected data on demographic characteristics and psychological health with DASS-21;QoL with 5-level 5-dimension EuroQol instrument;and treatment satisfaction using Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) V9. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to examine the relation between TSQM and PH and the demographic variables. Factor analysis was used for multi-collinearity tests, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore demographic variables and TSQM. Results: Out of 421 initial screenings, 367 patient-participants were included in the analysis. The mean age of included participants was 33.61 +/- 9.47 years. Marital status and socio-economic class positively correlated with TSQM. Physical symptoms in patients are positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress;and in contrast, negatively with QoL. Global satisfaction with Divya-Swasari-Coronil-Kit medication negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, stress, effectiveness, convenience;whereas global satisfaction correlated positively with QoL. Conclusion: Present study (SATISFACTION COVID) indicates that treatment satisfaction due to avaliablity and treatment of Divya-Swasari-Coronil-Kit has constructive and beneficial implications on psychological health, Quality of life and demographic factors. In addition, web-based patient-reported perspectives may well be a feasible way to provide better insights into treatment satisfaction, in relation to psychological health and Quality of life.","Balkrishna, A.; Raj, P.; Singh, P.; Varshney, A.",Patient preference &amp; adherence,28,1

Higher levels of serum SP-D have been reported in the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection. rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain. Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following treatment with rfhSP-D (10 µg/ml). These results highlight the therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection and merit pre-clinical studies in animal models.","Hsieh, Miao-Hsi; Beirag, Nazar; Murugaiah, Valarmathy; Chou, Yu-Chi; Kuo, Wen-Shuo; Kao, Hui-Fang; Madan, Taruna; Kishore, Uday; Wang, Jiu-Yao",Front Immunol,28,3

METHODS: Clinical characteristics and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 86 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. The chronological analysis method was used to detail neurosensory dysfunction. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to approximately indicate viral load. RESULTS: Forty-four (51.2%) patients had neurosensory dysfunction: hyposmia (34, 39.5%), hypogeusia (33, 38.4%), and tinnitus (three, 3.5%). Neurosensory dysfunction was significantly more common in patients under 40 years old (p = 0.001) and women (p = 0.006). Hyposmia and hypogeusia coexisted in 23 (26.7%) patients. The interval between onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 0.7 ± 1.46 days. The interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to typical COVID-19 symptoms was 0.22 ± 4.57 and 0.75 ± 6.77 days; the interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to admission was 6.06 ± 6.68 and 5.76 ± 7.68 days; and the duration of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 9.09 ± 5.74 and 7.12 ± 4.66 days, respectively. The viral load was high following symptoms onset, peaked within the first week, and gradually declined. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosensory dysfunction tends to occur in the early stage of COVID-19, and it could be used as a marker for the early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Liang, Yujie; Xu, Jiabin; Chu, Mei; Mai, Jianbo; Lai, Niangmei; Tang, Wen; Yang, Tuanjie; Zhang, Sien; Guan, Chenyu; Zhong, Fan; Yang, Liuping; Liao, Guiqing",Int J Infect Dis,28,16

Recently, COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health care systems worldwide. As a disease preventive approach and to bring relief to the severity of the symptoms, a infusion termed as Bhabha Anti-Viral Infusion-23 ('BhAVI-23') was conceptualized and formulated which comprised of 23 selected spices and herbals. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to assess the in vitro antiviral potential of the formulation, BhaAVI-23. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The in-vitro anti-viral potential of BhAVI-23 was assessed through inhibition of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as through a novel P1 (virulent) bacteriphage based screening assay system. Anti-diabetic potential was assessed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin and the bioactive volatile components were detected through headspace gas chromatography followed by molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: The infusion displayed prominent anti-viral activity as evident from significant (57%) inhibition of the HIV1-RT as well as through reduction in the infectivity of P1 (virulent) bacteriophage. The infusion also exerted profound protection (â¼64%) to non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin. Headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of at least 47 major compounds. Docking analysis indicated possible interaction of &#945;-pinene and eugenol with SARS-CoV spike protein. CONCLUSION: This 'BhAVI-23' infusion displayed prominent in-vitro anti-viral and anti-diabetic potential in different model systems. These attributes have relevance as diabetic patients are more prone to COVID-19 morbidity. 'BhAVI-23' opens the avenue for its potential inclusion as a supportive health care system upon due regulatory approval during the current pandemic.","Saxena, Sudhanshu; Kumar, Sanjeev; Hajare, Sachin N; Gupta, Sumit; Gautam, Satyendra; Ghosh, Sunil K",,28,10

The authors observed the effect of acarbose, insulin, and both drugs on the metabolic control and development of mesangial enlargement of kidney glomeruli in alloxan-diabetic rats. METHODS: Five groups of Wistar rats were used: normal rats (N), non-treated alloxan-diabetic rats (D), alloxan-diabetic rats treated with acarbose (AD), alloxan-diabetic rats treated with insulin (ID), and alloxan-diabetic rats treated with insulin plus acarbose (IAD). The following parameters were evaluated: body weight; water and food intake; diuresis; blood and urine glucose levels; and the kidney lesions: mesangial enlargement and tubule cell vacuolization. Renal lesions were analysed using a semi-quantitative score 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after diabetes induction. RESULTS: Diabetic rats showed a marked increase of glycemia, urinary glucose levels, diuresis, water and food intake, and weight loss, while the treated diabetic rats showed significant decreased levels of these parameters. The most satisfactory metabolic control was that of diabetic rats treated with acarbose + insulin. There was a significant mesangial enlargement in diabetic rats compared to normal rats from the third up to the 12th month after diabetes induction, with a significant difference between the animals treated with acarbose + insulin and non-treated diabetic rats. A difference between the animals treated with acarbose or insulin alone and non-treated diabetics rats was not seen. CONCLUSIONS: The authors discuss the results stressing the role of diabetic metabolic control in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy.","Sperandéo Macedo, Célia; Maria Capelletti, Sonia; Cecília Salgado Mercadante, Maria; Roberto Padovani, Carlos; Tadeu Spadella, César",Acta cir. bras.,28,1

A secondary objective was to explore changes in PrEP use and the need for PrEP follow-up. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey. The questionnaire was available in Dutch, French and English, between April 10 and 27 (2020), and disseminated via sexual health and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer or intersex organisations throughout Belgium. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, not being exclusively heterosexual and living or being born in Belgium. RESULTS: The sample included 694 MSM. Physical sex with non-steady partners decreased from 59.1% to 8.9% during the first weeks of the lockdown. Those who had sex with non-steady partners were significantly more likely to be HIV positive, to use PrEP or to have engaged in sexual practices such as group sex, chemsex and sex work before the lockdown, compared with their counterparts. Among those who used PrEP before the lockdown, 47.0% stopped using PrEP, 19.7% used event-driven PrEP and 33.3% used daily PrEP during the lockdown. Almost two-thirds of PrEP users had a PrEP care appointment in the weeks before the lockdown and a minority received follow-up elsewhere or online. Some PrEP users had concerns regarding their follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MSM in our survey substantially reduced sexual contact with non-steady partners during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting that the risk for HIV and STI transmission in this period was low. We recommend ensuring access to sexual health services, such as HIV testing and follow-up for PrEP for the small group having multiple sex partners and engaging in sexual practices such as chemsex, or group sex, even in times of a pandemic threat.","Reyniers, Thijs; Rotsaert, Anke; Thunissen, Estrelle; Buffel, Veerle; Masquillier, Caroline; Van Landeghem, Ella; Vanhamel, Jef; Nöstlinger, Christiana; Wouters, Edwin; Laga, Marie; Vuylsteke, Bea",Sex. transm. infect,28,16

Spread occurred despite standard outbreak controls at affected shelter and supportive housing sites. Among these 37 cases, drink sharing was frequently identified as a modifiable mode of possible transmission. We collaborated with emergency shelters, a supportive housing site, and street and encampment outreach groups, using mixed service delivery by health staff, non-profits, and peers with lived experience with homelessness. INTERVENTION: To empower individuals to decrease COVID-19 transmission using a harm reduction approach, we provided disposable paper cups to service providers for distribution to clients. Service providers tracked the number of cups distributed. To assess effectiveness, we interviewed staff and peers who distributed the cups. OUTCOMES: Cup distribution was highest among populations with higher rates of alcohol use, and the intervention was well received by people who drink alcohol regularly, providing unique opportunities to promote COVID-19 awareness and safer drinking practices. Providers to these populations reported enthusiastic client engagement and repeat requests for cups for safer drinking. Intervention usefulness was limited in contexts with low alcohol consumption and in the absence of paired COVID-19 education. Provider reports suggest appropriate disposal of these cups after use. IMPLICATIONS: Disposable cups are a novel, rapidly implementable, low-cost harm reduction tool to empower people experiencing homelessness to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission due to drink sharing, ideally as part of a larger harm reduction and community education strategy.","Steer, Kieran J D; Klassen, David C; O039,; Gorman, Claire M; Webster, Marisa; Mitchell, Mhairi; Krichevsky, Liubov; Christiansen, Kathy; Benham, Jamie L; Schindler, Richelle S",Can J Public Health,28,8

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 as the receptor to enter host cell in a species-specific manner. We and others have previously shown that ACE2 orthologs from New World monkey, koala and mouse cannot interact with SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry, and this defect can be restored by humanization of the restrictive residues in New World monkey ACE2. To better understand the genetic determinants behind the ability of ACE2 orthologs to support viral entry, we compared koala and mouse ACE2 sequences with that of human and identified the key residues in koala and mouse ACE2 that restrict viral receptor activity. Humanization of these critical residues rendered both koala and mouse ACE2 capable of binding the spike protein and facilitating viral entry. Our study shed more lights into the genetic determinants of ACE2 as the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates our understanding of viral entry.","Ren, Wenlin; Zhu, Yunkai; Wang, Yuyan; Shi, Hongyang; Yu, Yin; Hu, Gaowei; Feng, Fei; Zhao, Xiaomin; Lan, Jun; Wu, Jianping; Kenney, Devin J; Douam, Florian; Tong, Yimin; Zhong, Jin; Xie, Youhua; Wang, Xinquan; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhou, Dongming; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang",PLoS Pathog,28,16

New challenges have been identified in order to maintain the safety of this procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A novel approach, using a modified demistifier canopy, was developed during the first wave of the pandemic and implemented for 17 consecutive percutaneous tracheostomies in order to enhance procedural safety. METHODS: A protocol was developed after performing a literature review of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary tracheostomy team was established, including the departments of otolaryngology, critical care, and respiratory therapy. Simulation was performed prior to each PT, and postoperative debriefings were done. RESULTS: A protocol and technical description of PT using a modified demistifier canopy covering was written and video documented. Data were collected on 17 patients who underwent this procedure safely in our tertiary care hospital. There were no procedure-related complications, and no evidence of COVID-19 transmission to any member of the health care team during the study period. CONCLUSION: As patients continue to recover from COVID-19, their need for tracheostomy will increase. The technique described provides a safe, multidisciplinary method of performing PT in COVID-19 patients.","Turkdogan, Sena; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Giroux, Melanie; Piché, Chantal; Khwaja, Kosar; Mascarella, Marco; Khalife, Sarah; Alohali, Sama; Kost, Karen",Ear Nose Throat J,28,6

Although epidemiological data indicate that COVID-19 produces more severe symptoms and higher mortality in elderly in comparison to young patients and in men in comparison to women to date sex and age differences in vitamin D status in infected patients have not been evaluated yet. In this study we evaluated the levels of circulating 25(OH)D in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 divided accordingly to their sex and age. We also correlated 25(OH)D levels with patient's respiratory status (i.e., PaO2/FiO2 ratio) and with sex hormones plasma levels to analyze the potential relationship of these parameters. We found no significant differences in plasma levels of 25(OH)D between pre- and post-menopausal female patients and age matched male patients. Interestingly, the 25(OH)D plasma levels positively correlated to PaO2/FiO2 ratio only in young patients, regardless of their sex. We also found a significantly positive correlation between 17β-estradiol and 25(OH)D in elderly women and between testosterone and 25(OH)D in elderly men, supporting the role of sex hormones in maintaining 25(OH)D levels. In conclusion, we suggest that a synergy between vitamin D and sex hormones could contribute to the age-related outcome of COVID-19.","Peruzzu, D.; Pagano, M.

METHODS: A multicentric prospective observational study in patients with COVID-19 requiring EEG during hospitalization. RESULTS: We found 94 EEG from 62 patients (55 % men, mean age 59.7 ± 17.8 years) were analyzed. Most frequent comorbidity was cardiac (52 %), followed by metabolic (45 %) and CNS disease (39 %). Patients required ICU management by 60 %, with a mortality of 27 % in the whole cohort. The most frequent EEG finding was generalized continuous slow-wave activity (66 %). Epileptic activity was observed in 19 % including non-convulsive status epilepticus, seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges. Periodic patterns were observed in 3 patients (3.2 %). Multivariate analysis found that cancer comorbidity and requiring an EEG during the third week of evolution portended a higher risk of mortality CONCLUSION: We observed that the most prevalent EEG finding in this cohort was generalized continuous slow-wave activity, while epileptic activity was observed in less than 20 % of the cases. Mortality risk factors were comorbidity with cancer and requiring an EEG during the third week of evolution, possibly related to the hyperinflammatory state.","Skorin, Ilona; Carrillo, Rogelio; Perez, Carmen P; Sanchez, Natalie; Parra, Jorge; Troncoso, Patricia; Uribe-San-Martin, Reinaldo",Seizure,28,7

Although antibody responses were initially dominated by RBD specificity, the third immunization boosted non-RBD antibody titers. Antibodies showed potent neutralization against the vaccine strain and the Alpha variant after two immunizations and robust neutralization of Beta and Gamma strains.

Laboratory confirmation of lesions has impacts on trade restrictions for herds, therefore if laboratory capacity was diminished, how herds are treated would require an informed risk policy. Here we report the proportion of herds with subsequent evidence of within-herd transmission, based on skin-test results. We assess how herd-size, herd-type, and bTB-history affect the probability of additional reactors at follow-up test using univariable and multivariable random-effects models. The study represents a rapid response to developing an evidential base for policy demands during an extraordinary event, the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland. A dataset from 2005 to 2019 of breakdowns were collated. Overall, 20,116 breakdowns were initiated by LRS cases. During the index tests of these breakdowns, 3931 revealed &#8805;1 skin-test reactor animals (19.54%; &#8805;1 standard reactors: 3827; 19.02%). Increasing herd-size was associated with reactor disclosure on follow-up. For small herds (<33 animals), 11.74% of follow-up tests disclosed &#8805;1 reactor; 24.63% of follow-up tests from very large herds (>137) disclosed &#8805;1 reactors. Beef (13.87%) and ""other"" (13%) herd production types had lower proportion of index tests with reactors in comparison with dairy (28.27%) or suckler (20.48%) herds.

Guidelines to manage post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia are available for adults, but not children. The objective of this review was to identify practices related to hypocalcemia prevention and management in pediatric patients. METHODS: We identified studies examining the prevention and management of hypocalcemia in pediatric patients post-thyroidectomy within PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Three independent reviewers screened citations and reviewed full-text papers. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included, representing 1552 patients. The overall study quality was weak with lack of randomization and inconsistent outcome reporting. The pooled incidence of hypocalcemia from the 15 studies was 35.5% for transient hypocalcemia and 4.2% for permanent hypocalcemia. All studies discussed post-operative hypocalcemia treatment, with most patients requiring admission for intra-venous calcium therapy. One study described a protocol discharging asymptomatic patients on calcitriol and calcium. Three studies discussed preoperative calcium supplementation in patients at risk of hypocalcemia. No studies examined routine use of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation to prevent post-operative hypocalcemia. CONCLUSION: A significant number of children undergoing thyroidectomy develop hypocalcemia. Despite this high incidence, our systematic review demonstrates significant practice variation surrounding post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia prevention and management in children.

The pandemic brought into light structural weaknesses of the health system, including its governance and decision-making process, but also provoked changes that helped to improve its resilience. We analyse the French experience of Covid-19 in 2020 by critically reviewing major policy measures implemented during the first two waves of the pandemic. France has struggled to find the right balance between the rock of economic and social damage caused by containment measures and the hard alternative of a rapidly spreading pandemic. The response to the first wave, including a full lock-down, was an emergency response that revealed the low level of preparedness for pandemics and the overly hospital-centred provision of health care in France. During the second wave, this response evolved into a more level strategy trying to reconcile health needs in a broader perspective integrating socio-economic considerations, but without fully managing to put in place an effective health strategy. We conclude that to achieve the right balance, France will have to strengthen health system capacity and improve the cooperation between actors at central and local levels with greater participatory decision-making that takes into account local-level realities and the diversity of needs.","Or, Zeynep; Gandré, Coralie; Durand Zaleski, Isabelle; Steffen, Monika",Health Econ Policy Law,28,16

Provincial Geriatrics Leadership Ontario, in collaboration with interRAI and the International Federation on Aging, hosted a virtual Town Hall on September 25, 2020. The purpose of this event was to bring together international perspectives from researchers, clinicians, and policy experts to address important themes potentially amenable to timely policy interventions. This article summarizes these themes and the ensuing discussions among 130 attendees from 5 continents. The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frail residents of LTC homes reflects a systematic lack of equitable prioritization by health system decision makers around the world. The primary risk factors for an outbreak in an LTC home were outbreaks in the surrounding community, high staff and visitor traffic in large facilities, and crowding of residents in ageing buildings. Infection control measures must be prioritized in LTC homes, though care must be taken to protect frail and vulnerable residents from their overly blunt application that deprives residents from appropriate physical and psychosocial support. Staffing, in terms of overall numbers, training, and leadership skills, was inadequate. The built environment of LTC homes can be configured for both optimal resident well-being and infection control. Infection control and resident wellness need not be mutually exclusive. Improving outcomes for LTC residents requires more staffing with proper training and interprofessional leadership. All these initiatives must be underpinned by an effective quality assurance system based on standardized, comprehensive, accessible, and clinically relevant data, and which can support broad communities of practice capable of effecting real and meaningful change for frail older persons, wherever they chose to reside.","Heckman, George A; Kay, Kelly; Morrison, Adam; Grabowski, David C; Hirdes, John P; Mor, Vince; Shaw, Greg; Benjamin, Sophiya; Boscart, Veronique M; Costa, Andrew P; Declercq, Anja; Geffen, Leon; Sang Lum, Terry Yat; Moser, Andrea; Onder, Graziano; van Hout, Hein",J Am Med Dir Assoc,28,16

Commencing with the discovery of coal in the 18th century, to gold and copper and base metals in the 19th century, to the world class iron ore, mineral sands and diamond mines of the 20th century to the current day, the paper will attempt to determine how and why an industry, formerly well-respected by the public, is considered to be a pariah in the eyes of many sections of society. The theory of social licence and its use in the Australian minerals industry is briefly described and a working definition of ""an honest, transparent engagement resulting in a beneficial outcome to all parties before, during and after mining"" is adopted throughout the paper. Case studies illustrating examples where mining operations were, and continue to be sustained for decades, provide clear evidence of having a social licence to operate. On the other hand, examples are provided illustrating where poor environmental management practices, tailings dam failures, disputes with landowners, and/or government intervention have resulted in the loss of the social licence and early, unplanned closure. The paradox is that despite the industry's acknowledged contribution to the Australian economy, particularly in times of global ructions such as the GFC and the current coronavirus pandemic, there is considerable antipathy towards the industry by the public. Furthermore, the Australian mining industry's approach to environmental management and sustainable development is regularly used as a model for emerging mining economies. The industry has pioneered remediation and rehabilitation on challenging sites, including prime agricultural land, forests, riverine and beach environments. Successes are rarely acknowledged however but failures are highlighted, by the media, opponents of the industry, and governments. Clearly, the business as usual approach is not enough. Mining industry leaders need to take strong measures to ensure the industry is sustainable and maintains its social licence including eliminating all fatalities and serious injuries, ensuring the safety and stability of tailings storage facilities, accelerating progressive rehabilitation particularly on open cut coal mines, successfully closing mines, and lifting the environmental performance of all mines, not just a few.","Laurence, David",,28,1

The production of goods and services is a highly interdependent process and can be severely impacted by the default of critical suppliers or customers. While knowing the impact of individual companies on national economies is a prerequisite for efficient risk management, the quantitative assessment of the involved economic systemic risks (ESR) is hitherto practically non-existent, mainly because of a lack of fine-grained data in combination with coherent methods. Based on a unique value added tax dataset we derive the detailed production network of an entire country and present a novel approach for computing the ESR of all individual firms. We demonstrate that a tiny fraction (0.035%) of companies has extraordinarily high systemic risk impacting about 23% of the national economic production should any of them default. Firm size alone cannot explain the ESR of individual companies; their position in the production networks does matter substantially. If companies are ranked according to their economic systemic risk index (ESRI), firms with a rank above a characteristic value have very similar ESRI values, while for the rest the rank distribution of ESRI decays slowly as a power-law; 99.8% of all companies have an impact on less than 1% of the economy. We show that the assessment of ESR is impossible with aggregate data as used in traditional Input-Output Economics. We discuss how simple policies of introducing supply chain redundancies can reduce ESR of some extremely risky companies.","Diem, Christian; Borsos, Andr'as; Reisch, Tobias; Kert'esz, J'anos; Thurner, Stefan",,28,7

However evidence suggests that effectiveness of e-learning is influenced by many prevailing factors. Methods A cross sectional study aimed to evaluate health care students’ perception towards implementation of e-learning was conducted for a period of 4 months from April 2020 to July 2020. Research instrument consisted of a self-designed, qualitative questionnaire with three domains was validated using field pretest method and administered among health care students of King Khalid University using social media platforms. Chi square test was used to estimate the effect of e-learning on various domains whereas linear regression analysis was used to find the association between subjects’ characteristics to overall domain scores. P value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results Among 254 respondents 59.8% were males and 96.5% respondents were staying with their families.10.2% reported medically imposed quarantine for one or more family members. 59.8% reported that the online classes were commenced too early. 63.4% of the respondents reported that they had no previous experience. Poor network connectivity (32.3%) and unawareness about online platforms (29.9%), poor audio/video qualities (26.3%) were found as major barriers. Psychological stress, discipline of study, living status and quarantine history had a remarkable impact on the effectiveness of online education. Conclusion Health care students are still cynical and are yet to embrace e-learning fully. Psychological distress, technical issues in association with accessibility, inexperience and unpreparedness were found to be main barriers that limited student acceptance of e-learning.","Shaik Alavudeen, Sirajudeen Easwaran Vigneshwaran Iqbal Mir Javid Shahrani Sultan M.; Ali Aseeri, Anas Abdullah Khan Noohu Mohammed Almodeer Ahmed Abdullah Asiri Abdulaziz",Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal,28,16

In 2020, hydroxychloroquine (and to a lesser extent chloroquine) also received attention as a possible treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During investigation for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, concerns for serious adverse events arose. OBJECTIVE: We review the toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine use both short-term and long-term and in overdose. METHODS: Medline (via OVID) was searched from its inception through June 7 2020 using the following as either MeSH or keyword terms: (""Chloroquine/"" or ""Hydroxychloroquine/"") AND (""Adverse Drug Event/"" or ""Toxicities, Drug/"" or ""Toxic.mp."" or ""Toxicity.mp."" or ""Overdose.mp.""). We limited resultant articles to those published in English and reporting on Human subjects. This search yielded 330 articles, of which 57 were included. Articles were excluded due to lack of relevance, not reporting desired outcomes, or being duplicative in their content. Twenty-five additional articles were identified through screening references of included articles. To identify toxicities in individuals treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with COVID-19, we searched PubMed on June 10th, 2020: (""Chloroquine"" or ""Hydroxychloroquine"") AND (""Coronavirus"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2""). This search resulted in 638 articles. We reviewed articles for reporting of adverse events or toxicities. Most citations were excluded because they did not include original investigations or extrapolated data from subjects that did not have COVID-19; 34 citations were relevant. For the drug-interactions section, relevant classes and agents were identified through a screen of the https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/ website. We then conducted targeted searches of PubMed up to June 7th 2020 combining ""chloroquine"" and ""hydroxychloroquine"" with terms for specific drug classes and drugs identified from the drug-interaction site as potentially relevant. We found 29 relevant articles. TOXICITY WITH SHORT-TERM USE: Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal toxicities are the most common to occur following initiation of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea account for most reported intolerances. Glucose abnormalities: Alterations in blood glucose concentrations may occur with hydroxychloroquine but are rare with standard therapeutic use. Cardiotoxicity: Short-term use can produce conduction abnormalities. Evidence from COVID-19 treatment suggests QT/QTc prolongation is of concern, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin, although disagreement exists across studies. Dermatologic: Drug eruptions or rashes, followed by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, pruritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, may occur within days to weeks of exposure but usually resolve with the discontinuation of therapy. Neuropsychiatric: Reported symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and hallucination within 24-48 h of drug initiation. Other toxicities: Hemolysis and anemia may occur in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 was associated with elevation in creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB activities with more events in the higher-dose group. TOXICITY WITH LONG-TERM USE: Retinopathy: Retinopathy is the major dose-limiting toxicity associated with long-term use; the risk is higher with increasing age, dose, and duration of usage. Cardiotoxicity: Long-term use has been associated with conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and valvular disorders. Neurotoxicity: Rarely myositis and muscle weakness, extremity weakness, and pseudoparkinsonism have been reported. TOXICITY IN OVERDOSE: Symptoms in overdose manifest rapidly (minutes to hours) and cardiotoxicity such as cardiovascular shock and collapse are most prominent. Neurotoxic effects such as psychosis and seizure may also occur. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine is a generally well-tolerated medication. Short-term (days to weeks) toxicity includes gastrointestinal effects and rarely glucose abnormalities, dermatologic reactions, and neuropsychiatric events. Cardiotoxicity became of increased concern with its use in COVID-19 patients. Long-term (years) toxicities include retinopathy, neuromyotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity (conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy). Deaths from overdoses most often result from cardiovascular collapse.","Doyno, Cassandra; Sobieraj, Diana M; Baker, William L",Clin Toxicol (Phila),28,1

METHODS: To examine presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with ESKD on dialysis, we retrospectively collected clinical data on 59 patients on dialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19. We used Wilcoxon rank sum and Fischer exact tests to compare patients who died versus those still living. RESULTS: Two of the study's 59 patients were on peritoneal dialysis, and 57 were on hemodialysis. Median age was 63 years, with high prevalence of hypertension (98%) and diabetes (69%). Patients who died were significantly older than those still living (median age, 75 versus 62 years) and had a higher median Charlson comorbidity index (8 versus 7). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (49%) and cough (39%); initial radiographs most commonly showed multifocal or bilateral opacities (59%). By end of follow-up, 18 patients (31%) died a median 6 days after hospitalization, including 75% of patients who required mechanical ventilation. Eleven of those who died had advanced directives against intubation. The remaining 41 patients (69%) were discharged home a median 8 days after admission. The median initial white blood cell count was significantly higher in patients who died compared with those still living (7.5 versus 5.7×103/µl), as was C-reactive protein (163 versus 80 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: The association of COVID-19 with high mortality in patients with ESKD on dialysis reinforces the need to take appropriate infection control measures to prevent COVID-19 spread in this vulnerable population.","Valeri, Anthony M; Robbins-Juarez, Shelief Y; Stevens, Jacob S; Ahn, Wooin; Rao, Maya K; Radhakrishnan, Jai; Gharavi, Ali G; Mohan, Sumit; Husain, S Ali",J Am Soc Nephrol,28,16

As reviewed in the literature, psoriasis may independently be associated with other autoimmune conditions like vitiligo, alopecia areata, LP, and discoid lupus erythematosus. A rare co-occurrence of these two or three autoimmune diseases has been reported. Here, we report a case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with persistent nonpruritic multiple hyperpigmented scaly papules and plaques over the body since 6 months of age. Histopathology revealed features suggestive of both LP and psoriasis in the same section.

Comorbidities such as age over 40 years, obesity, and diabetes mellitus play an important role in the response inflammatory and immunological that can accelerate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines causing endothelial dysfunction that produces endotheliitis, hypercoagulability, and fibrinolysis not only at lung level but also in other organs such as the heart and central nervous system. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which has a high prevalence in older adults with obesity, is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction due to hypoxia that may favor hyper inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore OSA should be considered serious comorbidity for COVID-19 fatality.

Comorbilidades como la edad mayor de 40 años, la obesidad y la diabetes mellitus juegan un papel importante en la respuesta inflamatoria e inmunológica que puede acelerar la producción de citosinas proinflamatorias provocando disfunción endotelial que produce endotelitis, hipercoagulabilidad y fibrinólisis, no solo a nivel pulmonar sino también en otros órganos como el corazón y el sistema nervioso central. La apnea obstructiva del sueño (AOS), que tiene una alta prevalencia en adultos mayores con obesidad, es un factor de riesgo de disfunción endotelial por la hipoxia que puede favorecer la hiperinflamación en respuesta al SARS-CoV-2 y, por tanto, la AOS debe considerarse una comorbilidad grave para la letalidad de COVID-19.

Airborne and aerosol transmission have also been implicated. Aerosol generating procedures such as scaling and polishing may increase the risk for developing COVID-19 in dental clinics, and may thus place some psychological strain on dental therapists. This study aimed to determine the psychosocial effect of COVID‑19 on dental therapists in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out following ethical approval from the institutional Ethics Committee. Data collection was through self-administered online questionnaires and included socio-demographic characteristics. Psychosocial well‑being was assessed using a five‑point Likert scale that assessed the level of worry. Scores were summed up to obtain the mean (range 5-25). Statistical significance was set at a level of P ≤ 0.05. Results: The 192 respondents had a mean age of 28.0 ± 7.2 years, 96.9% were aware of COVID‑19. Sixteen (8.3%) participants reported at least one medical condition. The mean psychosocial‑wellbeing score was 18.4 ± 4.9. Most (90.1%) were worried about the COVID-19 pandemic, while 76% were severely worried about getting infected with COVID-19 in the dental clinic, and 72.9% were severely worried about the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the clinic. Participants with self‑reported medical conditions had a slightly higher psychosocial score (18.6 vs. 18.4), but this was not significant (P = 0.902). Conclusion: The psychosocial effect of the COVID‑19 pandemic was considerable on the dental therapists.

The critical thinking assessment was carried out twice, at the beginning and at the end of the study, using the validated HEIghten® Critical Thinking Assessment suite in the native language of the respondents. The results of the study show that learning a Chinese language can facilitate the development of critical thinking in international students and that the low level of critical thinking among Chinese speakers is a myth. Future studies should focus more on exploring the psychophysiological predictors of critical thinking and developing valid psychodiagnostic techniques with regard to racial and ethnic characteristics of the psychophysiological mechanisms of cognition.

METHODS: A total of 5750 HCWs were included in the study. Those in contact with COVID-19 patients were allocated into a high-risk or a low-risk group based on contact type (PPE- or non-PPE-protected); high-risk workers underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests, while among low-risk workers, swab tests were carried out only for symptomatic workers (active surveillance). The prevalence was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal samples. RESULTS: 3570 HCWs had contact with 1065 COVID-19 patients. Among them, 3494 were subjected to active surveillance (low-risk group); 2886 (82.60%) were subjected to a swab test; and 15 were positive (0.52%). Seventy-six HCWs (2.13% of exposed) were included in the high-risk group, and a swab test was mandatory for each participant. Overall, 66 (86.84% of high-risk) were negative, and 10 were positive (13.16%), resulting in a higher risk of infection than in the low-risk group [OR = 29.00; 95% CI:12.56-66.94; p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSION: To date, the SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence is 0.70% among exposed HCWs and 0.435% among all HCWs working at the examined university hospital.

This study analyzed plasma samples from 126 eligible convalescent blood donors in addition to 15 naive individuals, as well as an additional 20 convalescent individuals as a validation cohort. Multiplexed Fc Array binding assays and functional antibody response assays were utilized to evaluate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody composition and activity. Donor convalescent plasma samples contained a range of antibody cell- and complement-mediated effector functions, indicating the diverse antiviral activity of humoral responses observed among recovered individuals. In addition to viral neutralization, convalescent plasma samples contained antibodies capable of mediating such Fc-dependent functions as complement activation, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2. Plasma samples from a fraction of eligible donors exhibited high activity across all activities evaluated. These polyfunctional plasma samples could be identified with high accuracy with even single Fc Array features, whose correlation with polyfunctional activity was confirmed in the validation cohort. Collectively, these results expand understanding of the diversity of antibody-mediated antiviral functions associated with convalescent plasma, and the polyfunctional antiviral functions suggest that it could retain activity even when its neutralizing capacity is reduced by mutations in variant SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Convalescent plasma has been deployed globally as a treatment for COVID-19, but efficacy has been mixed. Better understanding of the antibody characteristics that may contribute to its antiviral effects is important for this intervention as well as offer insights into correlates of vaccine-mediated protection. Here, a survey of convalescent plasma activities, including antibody neutralization and diverse effector functions, was used to define plasma samples with broad activity profiles. These polyfunctional plasma samples could be reliably identified in multiple cohorts by multiplex assay, presenting a widely deployable screening test for plasma selection and investigation of vaccine-elicited responses.","Natarajan, Harini; Crowley, Andrew R; Butler, Savannah E; Xu, Shiwei; Weiner, Joshua A; Bloch, Evan M; Littlefield, Kirsten; Wieland-Alter, Wendy; Connor, Ruth I; Wright, Peter F; Benner, Sarah E; Bonny, Tania S; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C; Larman, H Benjamin; Casadevall, Arturo; Pekosz, Andrew; Redd, Andrew D; Tobian, Aaron A R; Ackerman, Margaret E",mBio (Online),28,24

In this paper, we propose the LABS (L\'{e}vy Adaptive B-Spline regression) model, an extension of the LARK models, for the estimation of functions with varying degrees of smoothness. LABS model is a LARK with B-spline bases as generating kernels. The B-spline basis consists of piecewise k degree polynomials with k-1 continuous derivatives and can express systematically functions with varying degrees of smoothness. By changing the orders of the B-spline basis, LABS can systematically adapt the smoothness of functions, i.e., jump discontinuities, sharp peaks, etc. Results of simulation studies and real data examples support that this model catches not only smooth areas but also jumps and sharp peaks of functions. The proposed model also has the best performance in almost all examples. Finally, we provide theoretical results that the mean function for the LABS model belongs to the certain Besov spaces based on the orders of the B-spline basis and that the prior of the model has the full support on the Besov spaces.","Park, Sewon; Oh, Hee-Seok; Lee, Jaeyong",,28,16

This problem poses a threat to healthcare workers, first responders, and the public, which demands solutions that can span the gap between institutional shortages and resupplies. Objectives: To examine the efficacy of autoclave-based decontamination for the reuse of single-use surgical masks and N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). This method is the most readily available form of decontamination in the hospital and laboratory settings. Methods: Three models of N95 FFRs and two procedural masks were evaluated in this study. A moist heat autoclave using four different autoclave cycles: 115°C for one hour, 121.1°C for 30 minutes, 130°C for two minutes, and 130°C for four minutes was used. After the autoclave process, the FFRs were NIOSH fit tested and particle counting was performed for both coarse particles of 5 micrometers (µM) and fine particles from 0.1µM to 1.0µM. Results: We observed negligible alterations in the functionality and integrity of 3M 1805 and 3M 1870/1870+ N95 FFRs after three autoclave cycles. Surgical masks also showed minimal changes in functionality and integrity. The 3M 1860 FFR failed fit test after a single autoclave decontamination cycle. Discussion and Conclusion: The study finds that specific surgical masks and N95 FFR models can withstand autoclave decontamination for up to three cycles. Additionally, the autoclave cycles tested were those that could be readily achieved by both clinical and research institutions.","Bopp, Nathen E.; Bouyer, Donald H.; Gibbs, Christopher M.; Nichols, Joan E.; Ntiforo, Corrie A.; Grimaldo, Miguel A.",Appl.

Under an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 state of emergency in Japan served as a nationwide social experiment to investigate the impact of quarantine or isolation on the incidence of KD. Objective: To assess the role of droplet or contact transmission in the etiopathogenesis of KD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, longitudinal, cross-sectional study was conducted from 2015 to 2020 at Fukuoka Children's Hospital and 5 adjacent general hospitals. The number of admissions for KD and infectious diseases were analyzed. Participants were pediatric patients admitted to the participating hospitals for KD or infectious diseases. Exposures: Quarantine and isolation owing to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end points were the ratios of patients with KD to patients with respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infections admitted from April to May in 2015 to 2019 and 2020. A Poisson regression model was used to analyze them. Results: The study participants included 1649 patients with KD (median [interquartile range] age, 25 [13-43] months; 901 boys [54.6%]) and 15â¯586 patients with infectious disease (data on age and sex were not available for these patients). The number of admissions for KD showed no significant change between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (mean [SD], 24.8 [5.6] vs 18.0 [4.0] admissions per month; 27.4% decrease; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.10; P = .12). However, the number of admissions for droplet-transmitted or contact-transmitted respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 157.6 [14.4] vs 39.0 [15.0] admissions per month; 75.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17-0.35; P < .001) and gastrointestinal infections (mean [SD], 43.8 [12.9] vs 6.0 [2.0] admissions per month; 86.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; P < .001) showed significant decreases between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (total, 12â¯254 infections). Thus, the ratio of KD to droplet- or contact-transmitted respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections incidence in April and May 2020 was significantly increased (ratio, 0.40 vs 0.12; &#967;21 = 22.76; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the significantly increased incidence of KD compared with respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections during the COVID-19 state of emergency suggests that contact or droplet transmission is not a major route for KD development and that KD may be associated with airborne infections in most cases.","Hara, Takuya; Furuno, Kenji; Yamamura, Kenichiro; Kishimoto, Junji; Mizuno, Yumi; Murata, Kenji; Onoyama, Sagano; Hatae, Ken; Takemoto, Megumi; Ishizaki, Yoshito; Kanno, Shunsuke; Sato, Kazuo; Motomura, Yoshitomo; Sakai, Yasunari; Ohga, Shouichi; Yashiro, Mayumi; Nakamura, Yoshikazu; Hara, Toshiro",JAMA Netw Open,28,23

Several lines of evidence suggest that these networks are fine-tuned by the largest family of TE controllers, the KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs). One tissue permissive for TE transcriptional activation (termed ""transposcription"") is the adult human brain, however comprehensive studies on the extent of this process and its potential contribution to human brain development are lacking. To elucidate the spatiotemporal transposcriptome of the developing human brain, we have analyzed two independent RNA-seq data sets encompassing 16 brain regions from eight weeks postconception into adulthood. We reveal a distinct KZFP:TE transcriptional profile defining the late prenatal to early postnatal transition, and the spatiotemporal and cell type-specific activation of TE-derived alternative promoters driving the expression of neurogenesis-associated genes. Long-read sequencing confirmed these TE-driven isoforms as significant contributors to neurogenic transcripts. We also show experimentally that a co-opted antisense L2 element drives temporal protein relocalization away from the endoplasmic reticulum, suggestive of novel TE dependent protein function in primate evolution. This work highlights the widespread dynamic nature of the spatiotemporal KZFP:TE transcriptome and its importance throughout TE mediated genome innovation and neurotypical human brain development.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research method was a diagnostic survey with the use of a research tool - a questionnaire. The basic source of data presented in this article was information collected from a survey carried out in December 2020. In the process of preparing this publication, both literature analysis of the discussed issue and questionnaire research were used. The article presents in detail differences in behaviour patterns at the stage of making purchasing decisions in Poland, depending on gender, education, and percapita income in the household. Findings: The conclusions from the study indicate that consumers in Poland display some differences at the stage of analysing whether a product is organic. When shopping for food products, they adopt various attitudes which can be distinguished based on consumption determinants. The knowledge obtained can be used both for practical purposes and for further theoretical considerations. Practical Implications: The article sheds some light on the determinants of the purchasing choices of contemporary consumers in Poland, and on the attitudes they adopt when choosing food products. This knowledge can influence the means of conveying information about the ecological nature of products, facilitating the forms of presenting labels and compositions by producers so as to meet consumer expectations, and using the knowledge about the factors characterising each of the attitudes to present information about producers ' own activities in a way better tailored to expectations. Originality/Value: This article presents the results of a study on the determinants of shopping choices conducted on a representative group of1000 Poles at the end of2020.","Żelazna, Anna Bojanowska Agnieszka Buraczyńska Barbara",European Research Studies,28,16

The N501Y specific assay only delivers an amplification signal if the Y501 variant is present. RESULTS: 436 samples initially screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 were randomly selected. Only one of these samples showed a fluorescence signal increase indicative for the Y501 variant. The remaining 435 samples had a melting peak at 54 °C indicating the N501 wildtype. SIGNIFICANCE: The screening of a broad population base can still be performed with the established test system. In case of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding clinical and anamnestic indications, a second qPCR for the mutation N501Y can follow and deliver the result to public health authorities and to the treating physician within a few hours.","Durner, Jürgen; Burggraf, Siegfried; Czibere, Ludwig; Tehrani, Arman; Watts, David C; Becker, Marc",Dent Mater,28,0

The limitation of ICU beds has been one of the major burdens in the management around the world; therefore, clinical strategies to avoid ICU admission are needed. We aimed to describe the influence of tocilizumab on the need of transfer to ICU or death in non-critically ill patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not qualify as requiring transfer to ICU during the first 24h after admission to a conventional ward, were included. The criteria to receive tocilizumab was radiological impairment, oxygen demand or an increasing of inflammatory parameters, however, the ultimate decision was left to the attending physician judgement. The primary outcome was the need of ICU admission or death whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients received tocilizumab and 94 did not. The tocilizumab group had less ICU admissions (10.3% vs. 27.6%, P=0.005) and need of invasive ventilation (0 vs 13.8%, P=0.001). In the multivariable analysis, tocilizumab remained as a protective variable (OR: 0.03, CI 95%: 0.007-0.1, P=0.0001) of ICU admission or death. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab in early stages of the inflammatory flare could reduce an important number of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate of 10.3% among patients receiving tocilizumab appears to be lower than other reports. This is a non-randomized study and the results should be interpreted with caution.","Moreno-García, E; Rico, E; Albiach, L; Agüero, D; Ambrosioni, J; Bodro, M; Cardozo, C; Chumbita, M; De la Mora, M; García-Pouton, N; Garcia-Vidal, C; González-Cordón, A; Hernández-Meneses, M; Inciarte, A; Laguno, M; Leal, L; Linares, L; Macay, I; Meira, F; Mensa, J; Moreno, A; Morata, L; Puerta-Alcalde, P; Rojas, J; Solá, M; Torres, B; Torres, M; Tomé, A; Tuset, M; Castro, P; Fernández, S; Nicolás, J M; Almuedo-Riera, A; Muñoz, J; Fernandez-Pittol, M; Marcos, M A; Soy, D; Martínez, J A; García, F; Soriano, A",Rev Esp Quimioter,28,20

Reducing patient exposure to COVID‐19 became a primary concern, especially for populations at an increased risk for severe illness, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to measure the impact of pharmacy services including telehealth through the percentage of virologically suppressed patients (HIV ribonucleic acid [RNA] < 200 copies/mL) during the pre‐COVID and post‐COVID time periods. Secondary objectives included the percentage of patients with undetectable viral loads (HIV RNA < 20 copies/mL), percentage of patients with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts greater than 200 cells/mm(3), and changes in CD4 cell counts and percentages pre‐COVID and post‐COVID. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review at a single center HIV primary care clinic in Brooklyn, NY evaluating electronic medical records (EMRs) of 211 HIV‐positive patients. Pre‐COVID was defined as 1 year prior to March 13, 2020, and post‐COVID was defined as March 13 to July 20, 2020. RESULTS: Viral load suppression rates for pre and post‐COVID were 88.6% and 85.3%, respectively (P = .28). Undetectable viral load rates for pre and post‐COVID were approximately 81.5% and 74.4% (P = .096). Mean CD4 cell counts and percentages were 617 cells/mm(3) and 29% for pre‐COVID, and 460 cells/mm(3) and 22% for post‐COVID. CD4 cell counts greater than 200 cells/mm(3) pre‐COVID and post‐COVID was 92.6% and 78.3%, respectively (P = .001). CONCLUSION: Utilization of pharmacy services including telehealth, may allow clinical pharmacists to collaboratively provide remote services without jeopardizing patient outcomes. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, and display the long‐term impact and satisfaction of these services.","Sorbera, Maria; Fischetti, Briann; Khaimova, Rebecca; Niewinski, Mateusz; Wen, Kelly",J Am Coll Clin Pharm,28,2

In the present work, the “VIRARE” survey was addressed to all the healthcare providers in the Lazio region and, in particular, to those working in the oncology field. Healthcare providers’ opinions on the impact and on the management of the pandemic have been analyzed, to provide an exhaustive overview about the level of their experienced psychological distress. ABSTRACT: While the emotional response of healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic has been extensively investigated in countries in the Far-East, little is known about the psychological impact and the associated emotional distress of healthcare providers in Italy, especially with regard to different regions. The aim of the “VIRARE” survey, which was addressed to all the healthcare providers in the Lazio region (central Italy) and, in particular, to those working in the oncology field, is to analyze their opinion on the impact and management of the pandemic, to better understand the level of their psychological distress. A global good psychological response of healthcare providers to the pandemic has emerged, independently from their different occupations in the oncology field. Healthcare providers show a high degree of resilience, identifying the major causes of distress the difficulty of the management of this situation, the obstacles in their working activity and expressing a high degree of dissatisfaction with how Italian institutions handled this situation. This survey also provides a direct comparison between COVID-19-infected (or directly in contact with COVID-19-infected patients) and uninfected healthcare providers, identifying the sub-category of infected professionals that reported signs of depression as particularly vulnerable.","Fabi, Alessandra; Pugliese, Patrizia; Falbo, Pina Tiziana; Corsi, Domenico; Fabbri, Maria Agnese; Vincenzi, Bruno; Bria, Emilio; Angelini, Francesco; Bonucci, Alessandro; Pellegrino, Arianna; Falcicchio, Chiara; Caruso, Anita; Giacomelli, Luca; Mirisola, Valentina; Papa, Simonetta; Cognetti, Francesco; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Perrone, Maria",Cancers (Basel),28,28

Restrictions placed on the population during the first COVID-19 lockdown may have disproportionately affected older adults, possibly through increasing loneliness. We sought to investigate this by examining loneliness in referrals to mental health of older adults (MHOA) services during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Referrals to MHOA services from a large South London catchment area were identified for the 16-week period of the UK lockdown starting in March 2020, and for the corresponding period in 2019. A natural language processing algorithm identified loneliness in the patients' records. We applied logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and diagnosis, to examine associations of loneliness in the study population. RESULTS: 1,991 referrals were identified, 56.9% of whom were female, with a mean age of 77.9 years. Only 26.9% occurred during the 2020 lockdown, but with a higher prevalence of loneliness (22.0 vs. 17.7%, p = 0.028). In the whole sample, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (Odds ratio (OR): 1.65), depressed mood (OR: 1.73), psychotic symptoms (OR: 1.65), relationship problems (OR: 1.49), problems with daytime activities (OR: 1.36), and antidepressant use (OR: 2.11). During lockdown, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (OR: 2.52), problem drinking or drug-taking (OR 2.33), and antidepressant use (OR 2.10). CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness is associated with more severe symptoms of affective illness, worse functional problems and increased use of antidepressant medication in older adults. During lockdown loneliness in referrals to MHOA services increased, and was associated with increased risk-taking behaviour. Loneliness is a potential modifiable risk factor for mental illness, and efforts to minimise it in older adults should be prioritised as we emerge from the pandemic.

Here, we detected coronavirus sequences in next‐generation sequence data created from Eonycteris spelaea faeces and urine. We also screened by PCR urine samples, faecal samples and rectal swabs collected from six species of bats in Singapore between 2011 and 2014, all of which were negative. The phylogenetic analysis indicates this novel strain is most closely related to lineage D Betacoronaviruses detected in a diverse range of bat species. This is the second time that coronaviruses have been detected in cave nectar bats, but the first coronavirus sequence data generated from this species. Bat species from which this group of coronaviruses has been detected are widely distributed across SE Asia, South Asia and Southern China.

Pharmacological activities of chelerythrine and its congeners have been studied and reported in the literature. This compound simultaneously has two key therapeutic effects for the treatment of COVID-19, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. Chelerythrine can prevent hyper-inflammatory immune response through regulating critical signaling pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as alteration in Nrf2, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK activities. In addition, chelerythrine has a strong protein kinase C-α/-β inhibitory activity suitable for cerebral vasospasm prevention and eryptosis reduction, as well as beneficial effects in suppressing pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In terms of antiviral activity, chelerythrine can fight with SARS-CoV-2 through various mechanisms, such as direct-acting mechanism, viral RNA-intercalation, and regulation of host-based antiviral targets. Although chelerythrine is toxic in vitro, the in vivo toxicity is significantly reduced due to its structural conversion to alkanolamine. Its multifunctional action makes chelerythrine a prominent compound for the treatment of COVID-19. Considering precautions related to the toxicity at higher doses, it is expected that this compound is useful in combination with proper antivirals to reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.","Valipour, Mehdi; Zarghi, Afshin; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad Ali; Irannejad, Hamid",Cell Cycle,28,24

In May 2020, in Puerto Rico there were approximately 1806 positive cases reported, with a mortality rate ranging among 5% [2]. But, is this number even real? At the moment, we are using the Reverse Transcription-PCR for diagnosis;but is this study completely reliable? CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 69-year-old man with multiple chronic comorbidities such as: hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, bronchial asthma and sleep apnea. Patient complained of three days of cough, anorexia, generalized malaise, fever and chills prior to a sudden loss of consciousness episode in which he had a right side 8th rib fracture developing a small apical right sided pneumothorax. Laboratory markers such as Ferritin, LDH, sed rate, CRP, D-dimer, lactic acid and procalcitonin, all of which have been associated with COVID-19, were elevated upon admission. Chest CT scan demonstrated evidence of the small right apical pneumothorax and a focal consolidation of a left lung base. In light of patient’s signs and symptoms, he was considered a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. A nasopharyngeal (NP) RT-PCR was done, yielding a negative test. Patient continued developing fever episodes and worsening hypoxemia and his inflammatory markers continued on an increasing trend. Chest CT scan was repeated and there was evidence of worsening, bilateral and bibasilar patchy ground glass opacities. Another 2 NP RT-PCRs were done in light of high suspicion for COVID-19 pneumonia;both of them came back negative. Was there any other etiology that we were missing? Patient was taken to bronchoscopy and the RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in BAL came back positive, despite 3 previous negative NP tests results. DISCUSSION: RT-PCR is the most useful diagnostic test currently used for the detection of COVID-19. Mostly the nasopharyngeal test is done, mainly due to its simplicity. There are multiple existing RT-PCR assays in the market along with several manufacturers [1,3]. Among the different assays there are: RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2;being the most sensitive the RdRp (3). Yi Wei Tang et al recently published a study in which they developed three different RT-PCR assays and compared them to the currently existing and mostly used assay (RdRp). They discovered that the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was the most sensitive and specific of them and the one with less cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: This case brings a very important question, how reliable are the currently used RT-PCR tests regarding our Novel Coronavirus? Reference #1: Chan JF-W, et al. 2020.

We employ a set of difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities.

We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated ""actual"" cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere.","FANG, H.; WANG, L.; YANG, Y.",,28,12

METHOD: A systematic review of literature published up to March 2021 was conducted to summarize changes in prevalence, incidence, and severity of substance use associated with COVID-19 and the accompanying public health measures, including lockdown, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing. RESULTS: We identified 53 papers describing changes to substance use at the population level. The majority of papers described changes related to alcohol use and most relied on self-reported measures of consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic use. There was less evidence to support changes in non-alcohol substance use. In general, risky pre-pandemic alcohol use, caregiving responsibilities, stress, depression, anxiety, and current treatment for a mental disorder were found to be associated with increased substance use. CONCLUSION: This review provides preliminary data on changes in substance use, indicating that certain segments of the population increased their alcohol use early on in the COVID-19 pandemic and may be at greater risk of harm and in need of additional services. There is a need for additional population-level information on substance use to inform evidence-based rapid responses from a treatment system perspective.","Schmidt, Rose A.; Genois, Rosalie; Jin, Jonathan; Vigo, Daniel; Rehm, Jürgen; Rush, Brian",Drug Alcohol Depend,28,26

631315,631315,631315,Science in crisis,12.275991,3.325759,2020-05-09,"ADP-ribosylation is a ubiquitous post-translational addition of either monomers or polymers of ADP-ribose to target proteins by ADP-ribosyltransferases, usually by interferon-inducible diphtheria toxin-like enzymes known as PARPs. While several PARPs have known antiviral activities, these activities are mostly independent of ADP-ribosylation. Consequently, less is known about the antiviral effects of ADP-ribosylation. Several viral families, including Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, encode for macrodomain proteins that bind to and hydrolyze ADP-ribose from proteins and are critical for optimal replication and virulence. These results suggest that macrodomains counter cellular ADP-ribosylation, but whether PARPs or, alternatively, other ADP-ribosyltransferases cause this modification is not clear. Here we show that pan-PARP inhibition enhanced replication and inhibited interferon production in primary macrophages infected with macrodomain-mutant but not wild-type coronavirus. Specifically, knockdown of two abundantly expressed PARPs, PARP12 and PARP14, led to increased replication of mutant but did not significantly affect wild-type virus. PARP14 was also important for the induction of interferon in mouse and human cells, indicating a critical role for this PARP in the regulation of innate immunity. In summary, these data demonstrate that the macrodomain is required to prevent PARP-mediated inhibition of coronavirus replication and enhancement of interferon production.","Grunewald, Matthew E.; Chen, Yating; Kuny, Chad; Maejima, Takashi; Lease, Robert; Ferraris, Dana; Aikawa, Masanori; Sullivan, Christopher S.; Perlman, Stanley; Fehr, Anthony R.",PLoS Pathog,28,24

CRP, by activating the classical complement pathway and interacting with macrophages via Fc gamma receptors, can cause pulmonary inflammation with subsequent fibrosis. Recently, we have reported first-in-man CRP apheresis in a “high-risk” COVID-19 patient. Treatment was unfortunately clinically unsuccessful. Here, we report on successful CRP apheresis treatment in a “lower-risk” COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old male patient suffering from fatigue, dyspnea, and fever for 4 days was referred to us. The patient had to be intubated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a throat smear revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mutation analysis revealed the VOC B. 1.1.7 variant. CRP levels were 79.2 mg/L and increased to 161.63 mg/L. Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were continuously normal (<0.5 ng/ml). Antibiotic therapy was started to avoid bacterial superinfection. CRP apheresis was performed once via central venous access. CRP levels declined from a maximum of 161.63 mg/L to 32.58 mg/L. No apheresis-associated adverse effects were observed. Subsequently, CRP plasma levels declined day by day and normalized on day 5. The patient was extubated on day 5 and discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on day 6. A second low CRP peak (maximum 22.41 mg/L) on day 7 remained clinically inapparent. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition with a CRP level of 6.94 mg/L on day 8. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce an uncontrolled CRP-mediated autoimmune response of ancient immunity. In this patient, the autoimmune response was potently and successfully suppressed by early selective CRP apheresis.","Torzewski, Jan; Zimmermann, Oliver; Kayser, Stefan; Heigl, Franz; Wagner, Florian; Sheriff, Ahmed; Schumann, Christian",Am J Case Rep,28,28

METHODS This multicentric study included 22 international readers divided in the radiologist group (RAD) and non-radiologist group (nRAD). A total of 99 patients, 52 with COVID-19 and 47 with SSc-ILD, were included in the study. RESULTS Fibrosis inside focal ground glass opacities (GGO) in the upper lobes; fibrosis in the lower lobe GGO; reticulations in lower lobes (especially if bilateral and symmetrical or associated with signs of fibrosis) were the CT features most frequently associated with SSc-ILD. The CT features most frequently associated with COVID- 19 pneumonia were: consolidation (CONS) in the lower lobes, CONS with peripheral (both central/peripheral or patchy distributions), anterior and posterior CONS and rounded-shaped GGOs in the lower lobes. After multivariate analysis, the presence of CONS in the lower lobes (p < 0.0001) and signs of fibrosis in GGO in the lower lobes (p < 0.0001) remained independently associated with COVID-19 pneumonia or SSc-ILD, respectively. A predictive score was created which resulted positively associated with the COVID-19 diagnosis (96.1% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity). CONCLUSION The CT differential diagnosis between COVID-19 pneumonia and SSc-ILD is possible through the combination the proposed score and the radiologic expertise. The presence of consolidation in the lower lobes may suggest a COVID-19 pneumonia while the presence of fibrosis inside GGO may indicate a SSc-ILD.","Orlandi, Martina; Landini, Nicholas; Sambataro, Gianluca; Nardi, Cosimo; Tofani, Lorenzo; Bruni, Cosimo; Bellando-Randone, Silvia; Blagojevic, Jelena; Melchiorre, Daniela; Hughes, Michael; Denton, Christopher P; Luppi, Fabrizio; Ruaro, Barbara; Della Casa, Francesca; Rossi, Francesca W; De Luca, Giacomo; Campochiaro, Corrado; Spinicci, Michele; Zammarchi, Lorenzo; Tomassetti, Sara; Caminati, Antonella; Cavigli, Edoardo; Albanesi, Marco; Melchiorre, Fabio; Palmucci, Stefano; Vegni, Virginia; Guiducci, Serena; Moggi-Pignone, Alberto; Allanore, Yannick; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Confalonieri, Marco; Dagna, Lorenzo; De Cobelli, Francesco; De Paulis, Amato; Harari, Sergio; Khanna, Dinesh; Kuwana, Masataka; Taliani, Gloria; Lavorini, Federico; Miele, Vittorio; Morana, Giovanni; Pesci, Alberto; Vancheri, Carlo; Colagrande, Stefano; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco",Rheumatology,28,28

While much has been published about the benefits and limitations of IV versus SC administration to patients and health systems, less attention has been given to payer considerations regarding these routes of administration. Accordingly, this article provides payer perspectives on some of the key differences between IV and SC administration as they relate to management and billing, cost, treatment adherence and safety, and patient preference and quality of life. The benefits and limitations of these drug administration routes to key healthcare stakeholders—namely patients, physicians, and payers—are also discussed.

The cardiovascular (CV) risk distribution and outcomes, as well as health literacy, are likely to differ from the host population. Challenges related to migrant health status, cardiovascular risk distribution and health literacy are compounded by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) crisis. METHODS: We performed a narrative review of available evidence on migrant CV and health literacy in Europe. RESULTS: Health literacy is lower in migrants but can be improved through targeted interventions. In some subgroups of migrants, rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, most importantly hypertension and diabetes, are higher. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for a so-called healthy migrant effect, describing lower rates of CV risk distribution and mortality in a different subset of migrants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CV risk factors, as well as health literacy, are key elements in optimally managing public health responses in the ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Migrants are both an opportunity and a challenge for public health in Europe. Research aimed at better understanding the healthy migrant effect is necessary. Implementing the beneficial behaviors of migrants could improve outcomes in the whole population. Specific interventions to screen for risk factors, manage chronic disease and increase health literacy could improve health care for migrants. This pandemic is a challenge for the whole population, but active inclusion of immigrants in established health care systems could help improve the long-term health outcomes of migrants in Europe.","Wernly, Bernhard; Wernly, Sarah; Magnano, Anthony; Paul, Elizabeth",Z Gesundh Wiss,28,28

Accurate and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases is essential for correct medical treatment to control this pandemic. Compared with the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, chest radiography imaging techniques are shown to be more effective to detect coronavirus. For the limitation of available medical images, transfer learning is better suited to classify patterns in medical images. This paper presents a combined architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-rays. The deep transfer techniques used in this experiment are VGG19, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2. CNN is used to extract complex features from samples and classified them using RNN. The VGG19-RNN architecture achieved the best performance among all the networks in terms of accuracy and computational time in our experiments. Finally, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize class-specific regions of images that are responsible to make decision. The system achieved promising results compared to other existing systems and might be validated in the future when more samples would be available. The experiment demonstrated a good alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 for medical staff.","Islam, M. M.; Islam, M. Z.; Asraf, A.; Ding, W.",,28,24

The interurban multi-agent EP strategy, as a key component of this mechanism, includes the spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model, and the collaborative EP model. In this study, firstly, the theoretical mechanism of the interurban multi-agent EP strategy was analyzed. Then, we proposed a three-party differential game model including factors such as the risk coefficient for the virus infection and EP experience teaching. Finally, prevention strategies, prevention efficiency, and prevention losses were compared under the three models based on theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. The results of this study are as follows. COVID-19 EP should be guided by a model of central government (CG) leadership, interurban collaboration, and social participation. The CG and urban governments (UGs) should comprehensively carry out COVID-19 EP from various aspects, including EP experience teaching, mass EP comfort, the utilization rate of EP funds, and the ability to implement strategies. During the course of the COVID-19 EP, when the CG and UGs transition from spontaneous EP model to a higher-level EP model, the UG’s EP efforts will be enhanced. Under the collaborative EP model, the CG and UGs undergo the highest levels of EP effort. Compared with spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model can promote a Pareto improvement for all parties. From the perspective of total loss, the collaborative EP model is superior to the other two EP models. This study not only provides practical guidance for coordinating interurban relationships and enabling multi-agents to fully form joint forces, but also provides theoretical support for the establishment of an interurban joint EP mechanism under unified leadership.","Yin, Shi; Zhang, Nan",Nonlinear Dyn,28,24

Furthermore, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are controversial at role in the process of COVID-19 cases. The aim of the study was to investigate whether underlying diseases and taking ACEi/ARBs, affect the duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Medical usage claims data for the past three years until 15 May 2020, from the “CORONA-19 International Cooperation Research” project was used. We analyzed the medical insurance claims data for all 7590 coronavirus (COVID-19) patients confirmed by RT-PCR tests nationwide up to 15 May 2020. Among the comorbidities, a history of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.056–2.158) and diabetes (HR, 1.867; 95% CI, 1.408–2.475) were associated significantly with mortality. Furthermore, heart failure (HR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.027–1.884), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.615; 95% CI, 1.185–2.202), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.451; 95% CI, 1.018–2.069), mental disorder (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.106–2.343), end stage renal disease (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.185–13.12) were also associated significantly with mortality. The underlying disease has increased the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes, hypertension, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and mental disorders increased mortality.

Replacement of cytology with molecular HPV testing as the primary screening test and adoption of risk‐based screening, with less intense screening of vaccinated individuals and initiated at older ages is expected to improve efficiency. However, policy officials may decide to further reduce or eliminate screening as the ratio of benefits to harms continues to decline. To evaluate the level of risk currently tolerated for different cancers in the United States (ie, for which clinical guidelines do not recommend secondary prevention though effective screening methods exist), we used US cancer registry data to compare incidence (2008‐2012) and survival (1988‐2011) associated with different cancers for which organized screening is recommended and not recommended. The most common cancer at ages 70 to 74 years (ie, age group with highest cancer incidence and reasonable life expectancy to consider screening in the US) satisfying Wilson and Jungner's classic screening criteria was vulvar cancer (incidence = 9/100 000 females). In comparison, the incidence of cervical cancer among females 65 years of age (the upper recommended age limit for screening) was 13 cases per 100 000 females (low as a reflection of effective screening), whereas 10‐year survival was 66% (similar to vulvar cancer at 67%).

Differences exist in medical education for both countries, allowing South Korean medical graduates to have a more holistic education in comparison to their Italian counterparts, who specialize in medical education earlier on. Additionally, there are fewer South Korean physicians per 1000 people in South Korea compared to Italian physicians per 1000 people in Italy. However, both countries have a national healthcare system with universal healthcare coverage. Despite this underlying similarity, the two countries addressed COVID-19 in nearly opposite manners. South Korea employed technology and the holistic education of its physician community, despite having a smaller proportion of physicians in society, to its advantage by implementing efficacious drive-through centers that test suspected individuals rapidly and with little to no contact with healthcare staff, decreasing the possibility of transmission of COVID-19. Conversely, Italy is presently considered the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe and has recorded the highest death toll of any country outside of mainland China. This is partially due to the reactionary nature of Italy’s public health measures compared to South Korea’s proactive response. The different healthcare responses of South Korea and Italy can inform decisions made by public health bodies in other countries, especially in countries across the Americas, which can selectively adopt policies that have worked in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and learn from mistakes made by both countries.","Palaniappan, Ashwin; Dave, Udit; Gosine, Brandon",Rev Panam Salud Publica,28,1

Most countries with significant outbreaks have introduced social distancing or “lockdown” measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how, and to what extent, these measures can be lifted. Publically available data, on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, were used to fit regression models estimating trajectories, doubling times and the reproduction number (R(0)) of the disease, before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 21st May 2020, and were sufficient for analysis in 89 countries. The estimates of R(0), before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published: between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions – R(0) 0.76 (95%CI 0.72–0.82), based on cases and 0.77 (95%CI 0.73–0.80) based on mortality. Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity.

Conventional tools to study and characterize virus, such as next generation sequencing, genome amplification (RT-PCR), and serological antibody testing, are not adequately suited to rapidly mutating pathogens like Influenza virus where the success of infection heavily depends on the phenotypic expression of surface glycoproteins. Bridging the gap between genome and pathogenic expression remains a challenge. Using sialic acid as a universal Influenza virus binding receptor, a novel virus avidin-biotin complex-based capture coating was developed and characterized that may be used to create future diagnostic and interrogation platforms for viable whole Influenza virus. First, fluorescent FITC probe studies were used to optimize coating component concentrations. Then atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to profile the surface characteristics of the novel capture coating, acquire topographical imaging of Influenza particles immobilized by the coating, and calculate the capture efficiency of the coating (over 90%) for all four representative human Influenza virus strains tested.","Trexler, Micaela; Brusatori, Michelle; Auner, Gregory",PLoS One,28,1

Understanding the factors driving the uncertainty regarding vaccination against COVID-19 is crucial. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was designed to identify the perceptions and attitudes of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards COVID-19 vaccines and determine the predictive factors that affect their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. An online survey was distributed among HCWs to collect data assessing demographic and general characteristics of the participants and vaccine-related characteristics, including source of information about the vaccine. In addition to items assessing the perception of COVID-19, there were items on COVID-19 vaccines and attitude towards vaccination in general and towards COVID-19 vaccines in particular. RESULTS: The participants were classified according to their willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine as follows: hesitant (41.9%), refusing (32.1%), and willing (26%). Statistically significant differences were observed among the three groups for the perception of COVID-19 vaccines, attitude towards vaccination in general, and COVID-19 vaccines in particular (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although the participants adequately perceived COVID-19 severity, prevention, and COVID-19 vaccine safety, they were widely hesitant or refused to be vaccinated. A multidimensional approach is required to increase the vaccine acceptability rate. Higher income and increased years of work experience are positive predictors of willingness to receive a vaccine. Thus, further studies addressing the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are warranted as an initial step to build trust in COVID-19 vaccination efforts with continuous monitoring of attitudes and practices of HCWs towards COVID-19 vaccines in the future.

Crucial components that have contributed to progress thus far and are necessary for achieving the national malaria elimination goals include properly identifying and treating all malaria cases through accurate diagnosis. This study sought to compare and assess the diagnostic performance of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) and Light Microscopy (LM) with photo-induced electron transfer polymerase chain reaction (PET-PCR) as the gold standard using 2018 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) data across Zambia to better understand diagnostic accuracy metrics and how these vary across a transmission gradient. METHODS: Cross-sectional samples collected in a nationally representative survey from 7 provinces in Zambia were tested for the presence of malaria parasites by light microscopy (LM), rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the gold standard PET-PCR. Diagnostic performance was assessed including sensitivity, specificity, negative- and positive-predictive values across a wide malaria transmission spectrum. Diagnostic accuracy metrics were measured, and statistically significant differences were calculated between test methods for different outcome variables. RESULTS: From the individuals included in the MIS, the overall prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria was 32.9% by RDT, 19.4% by LM, and 23.2% by PET-PCR. Herein, RDT and LM diagnostic performance was compared against gold standard PET-PCR with LM displaying a higher diagnostic accuracy than RDTs (91.3% vs. 84.6% respectively) across the transmission spectrum in Zambia. However, the performance of both diagnostics was significantly reduced in low parasitaemia samples. Consistent with previous studies, RDT diagnostic accuracy was predominantly affected by a high rate of false positives. CONCLUSIONS: RDTs and LM both perform well across a range of transmission intensities within their respective target applications, i.e., in the community, for the former, where ease of use and speed of result is critical, and at the health facility, for the latter, where accuracy is prioritized. However, the performance of both diagnostic methods is adversely affected by low parasitaemia infections. As Zambia moves towards elimination more sensitive tools may be required to identify the last cases.

NLCs were produced by hot homogenization, frozen at different speeds, and lyophilized using several CPs at variable concentrations. NLCs were characterized, and results were expressed as increase in particle size (Δ size), polydispersity (Δ PdI), and zeta potential (Δ ZP) of lyophilized powders (LP) regarding initial dispersions. CPs were classified according to their molecular weights (MW), and the osmolarities (Π) of CPs solutions were also determined. Databases obtained were finally modelled through FormRules(®) (Intelligensys Ltd., Kirkwall, Scotland, UK), an NFL software.

However, fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 has not been established to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the duration of fecal swab positivity in COVID-19 patients after pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative and to explore its potential for fecal-oral transmission. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical records, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of 17 COVID-19 patients confirmed by laboratory tests from January 22 to February 7, 2020 at a tertiary hospital was performed. The potential of fecal-oral transmission was assessed by detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal swab samples. Results: A total of 16 patients (94.1%) had fever; other symptoms included dry cough, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, sore throat, fatigue, and muscle pain. Three patients had decreased white blood cell counts, 7 had decreased lymphocyte numbers, and 7 had increased C-reactive protein levels. Fecal samples of 11 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, of whom the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was longer in 10 patients than that for pharyngeal swab samples, and only one case exhibited a shorter time for his fecal sample to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative compared to his pharyngeal swab sample. The remaining 6 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal samples. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in both pharyngeal swab and fecal samples, the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was generally longer than that in pharyngeal swab samples. However, there is currently no evidence demonstrating that the virus can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route.","Wang, S.; Tu, J.; Sheng, Y.",,28,23

METHODS: We identified all statewide social distancing measures that were implemented and/or relaxed in the United States between 10 March and 15 July 2020, triangulating data from state government and third-party sources. Using segmented linear regression, we estimated the extent to which relaxation of social distancing affected epidemic control, as indicated by the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (R(t)). RESULTS: In the 8 weeks prior to relaxation, mean R(t) declined by 0.012 units per day (95% confidence interval [CI], −.013 to −.012), and 46/51 jurisdictions achieved R(t) < 1.0 by the date of relaxation. After relaxation of social distancing, R(t) reversed course and began increasing by 0.007 units per day (95% CI, .006–.007), reaching a mean R(t) of 1.16. Eight weeks later, the mean R(t) was 1.16 and only 9/51 jurisdictions were maintaining an R(t) < 1.0. Parallel models showed similar reversals in the growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Indicators often used to motivate relaxation at the time of relaxation (eg, test positivity rate <5%) predicted greater postrelaxation epidemic growth. CONCLUSIONS: We detected an immediate and significant reversal in SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suppression after relaxation of social distancing measures across the United States.

Methods Data from 160 veterans with history of moderate-to-severe TBI (n = 23), TBI+PTSD (n = 36), PTSD (n = 53), and control veterans (n = 48) were obtained from the Department of Defense Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database.

The fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity were then correlated with neuropsychological scores and amyloid deposition in the trauma groups. Results Compared to controls, the three trauma groups showed grey-matter atrophy, lower FA, and distinctly higher diffusivity in the major WM tracts included the corpus callosum, external and internal capsules, cingulum, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi. The FA and mean diffusivity correlated with the cognitive deficits in the trauma groups. Furthermore, the FA in the cingulum correlated negatively with amyloid deposition in the posterior cingulate cortex of all three trauma groups.

Automated detection of lung infections and their boundaries from medical images offers a great potential to augment the patient treatment healthcare strategies for tackling COVID-19 and its impacts. Detecting this disease from lung CT scan images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose patients. However, finding the presence of infected tissues and segment them from CT slices faces numerous challenges, including similar adjacent tissues, vague boundary, and erratic infections. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a two-route convolutional neural network (CNN) by extracting global and local features for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. Each pixel from the image is classified into the normal and infected tissues. For improving the classification accuracy, we used two different strategies including fuzzy c-means clustering and local directional pattern (LDN) encoding methods to represent the input image differently. This allows us to find more complex pattern from the image. To overcome the overfitting problems due to small samples, an augmentation approach is utilized.

The results were confirmed by sequence analysis: apart from influenza B, both influenza A subtypes H3N2 and H1N1, associated with the seasonal outbreak, were detected.","Minosse, Claudia; Selleri, Marina; Zaniratti, Maria S.; Lauria, Francesco N.; Puro, Vincenzo; Carletti, Fabrizio; Cappiello, Giuseppina; Gualano, Gina; Bevilacqua, Nazario; Capobianchi, Maria R.",J Virol Methods,28,24

One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. There have been increasing efforts on developing deep learning methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, these works are difficult to reproduce and adopt since the CT data used in their studies are not publicly available. Besides, these works require a large number of CTs to train accurate diagnosis models, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We build a publicly-available dataset containing hundreds of CT scans positive for COVID-19 and develop sample-efficient deep learning methods that can achieve high diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19 from CT scans even when the number of training CT images are limited. Specifically, we propose an Self-Trans approach, which synergistically integrates contrastive self-supervised learning with transfer learning to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Self-Trans approach compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach achieves an F1 of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans, even though the number of training CTs is just a few hundred.","He, X.; Yang, X.; Zhang, S.; Zhao, J.; Zhang, Y.; Xing, E.; Xie, P.",,28,30

METHODS: Statistical analysis, including multiple logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with death in these patients. RESULTS: The results showed that age (60 years or more, O.R. = 3.13, C.I. 95% [2.02; 4.84]), days in the ICU (11 days or more, O.R. = 1.76, C.I. 95% [1.16; 2.66]), neurological diseases (O.R. = 2.15, C.I. 95% [1.07; 4.31]), pneumopathy (O.R = 2.19, C.I. 95% [1.01; 4.82]), diabetes (O.R. = 1.55, C.I. 95% [1.03; 2.32]), and kidney disease (O.R. = 2.27, C.I. 95% [1.18; 4.70]) were associated with increased risk for death from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Knowing the risk factors associated with death after ICUs hospitalization is useful for identifying the most vulnerable groups, as well as for defining vaccination priorities, considering its scarcity in many parts of the world, mainly in underdeveloped countries, including Brazil.","Olak, André S.; Susuki, Aline M.; Kanashiro, Milena; Paoliello, Monica M.B.; Aschner, Michael; Urbano, Mariana R.",Toxicol Rep,28,10

It has been suggested that early liver injury in these patients could be a risk factor for poor outcome. We aimed to identify early biochemical predictive factors related to severe disease development with intensive care requirements in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Data from COVID-19 patients were collected at admission time to our hospital. Differential biochemical factors were identified between seriously ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (ICU patients) versus stable patients without the need for ICU admission (non-ICU patients). Multiple linear regression was applied, then a predictive model of severity called Age-AST-D dimer (AAD) was constructed (n = 166) and validated (n = 170). RESULTS: Derivation cohort: from 166 patients included, there were 27 (16.3%) ICU patients that showed higher levels of liver injury markers (P < 0.01) compared with non-ICU patients: alanine aminotrasnferase (ALT) 225.4 ± 341.2 vs. 41.3 ± 41.1, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 325.3 ± 382.4 vs. 52.8 ± 47.1, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 764.6 ± 401.9 vs. 461.0 ± 185.6, D-dimer (DD) 7765 ± 9109 vs. 1871 ± 4146, and age 58.6 ± 12.7 vs. 49.1 ± 12.8. With these finding, a model called Age-AST-DD (AAD), with a cut-point of <2.75 (sensitivity = 0.797 and specificity = 0.391, c − statistic = 0.74; 95%IC: 0.62-0.86, P < 0.001), to predict the risk of need admission to ICU (OR = 5.8; 95% CI: 2.2-15.4, P = 0.001), was constructed. Validation cohort: in 170 different patients, the AAD model < 2.75 (c − statistic = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.91, P < 0.001) adequately predicted the risk (OR = 8.8, 95% CI: 3.4-22.6, P < 0.001) to be admitted in the ICU (27 patients, 15.95%). CONCLUSIONS: The elevation of AST (a possible marker of early liver injury) along with DD and age efficiently predict early (at admission time) probability of ICU admission during the clinical course of COVID-19. The AAD model can improve the comprehensive management of COVID-19 patients, and it could be useful as a triage tool to early classify patients with a high risk of developing a severe clinical course of the disease.","Higuera-de-la-Tijera, Fátima; Servín-Caamaño, Alfredo; Reyes-Herrera, Daniel; Flores-López, Argelia; Robiou-Vivero, Enrique J.

The development of therapeutics to treat infection or as prophylactics to halt viral transmission and spread is urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 relies on structural rearrangements within a spike (S) glycoprotein to mediate fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we describe the development of a lipopeptide that is derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of SARS-CoV-2 S that potently inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2. The lipopeptide inhibits cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S and blocks infection by live SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cell monolayers more effectively than previously described lipopeptides. The SARS-CoV-2 lipopeptide exhibits broad-spectrum activity by inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and blocking infection by live MERS-CoV in cell monolayers. We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 HRC-derived lipopeptide potently blocks the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, an ex vivo model designed to mimic respiratory viral propagation in humans. While viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was widespread in untreated airways, those treated with SARS-CoV-2 HRC lipopeptide showed no detectable evidence of viral spread. These data provide a framework for the development of peptide therapeutics for the treatment of or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses.","Outlaw, Victor K.; Bovier, Francesca T.; Mears, Megan C.; Cajimat, Maria N.; Zhu, Yun; Lin, Michelle J.; Addetia, Amin; Lieberman, Nicole A.

The optimal treatment for this patient group is unknown. Consequently, the treatment of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients should be determined individually, considering patient age and comorbidities, as well as graft function, time of transplant, and immunosuppressive treatment. Immunosuppressive treatments may give rise to severe COVID-19. On the contrary, they may also lead to a milder and atypical presentation by diminishing the immune system overdrive. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year old female kidney transplant recipient presented to the transplant clinic with a progressive dry cough and fever that started three days ago. Although the COVID-19 test was found to be negative, chest computed tomography images showed consolidation typical of the disease; thus, following hospital admission, anti-bacterial and COVID-19 treatments were initiated. However, despite clinical improvement of the lung consolidation, her creatinine levels continued to increase. Ultrasound of the graft showed no pathology. The tacrolimus blood level was determined and the elevation in creatinine was found to be related to an interaction between tacrolimus and azithromycin. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, various single or combination drugs have been utilized to find an effective treatment regimen. This has increased the possibility of drug interactions. A limited number of studies published in the literature have highlighted some of these pharmacokinetic interactions. Treatments used for COVID-19 therapy; azithromycin, atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, ribavirin, and tocilizumab, interact with immunosuppressive treatments, most importantly with calcineurin inhibitors. Thus, their levels should be frequently monitored to prevent toxicity.","Oguz, Ebru Gok; Atilgan, Kadir Gokhan; Cimen, Sanem Guler; Sahin, Hatice; Selen, Tamer; Ebinc, Fatma Ayerden; Cimen, Sertac; Ayli, Mehmet Deniz",World J Transplant,28,24

During an infectious disease pandemic, such as the one caused by COVID-19, social distancing, quarantines, and lockdowns are used to reduce community spread of the disease. Unfortunately, such nonpharmacological interventions or physical risk mitigation measures also make it challenging to engage in PA. Reduced PA could then trigger physiological changes that affect both mental and physical health. In this regard, women are more likely to experience physical and psychological distress. PA is a safe and effective nonpharmacological modality that can help prevent and manage several mental and physical health problems when performed correctly. PA might even confer benefits that are directly related to decreasing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in women. In this review, we summarize why optimal PA must be a priority for women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then discuss chronic COVID-19 illness and its impact on women, which further underscores the need for worldwide preventive health strategies that include PA. Finally, we discuss the importance of vaccination against COVID-19 for women, as part of prioritizing preventive healthcare and an active lifestyle.","Garcia-Pelagio, Karla P.; Hew-Butler, Tamara; Fahlman, Mariane M.; Roche, Joseph A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,28,1

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess real-time public awareness and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 epidemic across 12 selected countries. METHODS: Internet surveillance was used to collect real-time data from the general public to assess public awareness and rumors (China: Baidu; worldwide: Google Trends) and behavior responses (China: Ali Index; worldwide: Google Shopping). These indices measured the daily number of searches or purchases and were compared with the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases. The trend comparisons across selected countries were observed from December 1, 2019 (prepandemic baseline) to April 11, 2020 (at least one month after the governments of selected countries took actions for the pandemic). RESULTS: We identified missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control in 12 countries, when public awareness was very low despite the emerging epidemic. China's epidemic and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern did not prompt a worldwide public reaction to adopt health-protective measures; instead, most countries and regions only responded to the epidemic after their own case counts increased. Rumors and misinformation led to a surge of sales in herbal remedies in China and antimalarial drugs worldwide, and timely clarification of rumors mitigated the rush to purchase unproven remedies. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study highlights the urgent need for international coordination to promote mutual learning about epidemic characteristics and effective control measures as well as to trigger early and timely responses in individual countries. Early release of official guidelines and timely clarification of rumors led by governments are necessary to guide the public to take rational action.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Du, Fanxing; Zhou, Xinyu; Jiang, Hao; Martin, Sam; Larson, Heidi; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,28,24
