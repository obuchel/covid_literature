12512,The Impact of Receiving Pretravel Health Advice on the Prevention of Hajj-Related Illnesses Among Australian Pilgrims: Cohort Study,2020-07-14,"This work aimed to study the anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm and anti-oxidant potential effects of low molecular weight (LMW) peptides (Br-p) isolated from burdock (Arctium lappa L.) roots. We conducted a preliminary study to exclude or confirm the antibiotic activity of the LMW peptides fraction of this plant. Br-p were isolated using gel filtration and a 10 kDa cut-off membrane. The obtained peptides were identified by MALDI TOF/TOF. Antibacterial activity was tested against acne strains using diffusion tests, MIC and MBC. The fibroblast cytotoxicity of Br-p was tested, and the selectivity index (SI) value was determined. The fraction of 46 Br-p peptides isolated from burdock root with a molecular weight below 5000 Da and theoretic pI (isoelectric point) of 3.67–11.83 showed a narrow spectrum of activity against Gram-positive acne bacterial strains. One of the Br-p peptides assessed on MALDI RapidDeNovo was LRCDYGRFFASKSLYDPLKKRR cationic peptide. It was analogous to that contained in A. lappa protein, and theoretically it was matched as a peptide with antibiotic nature. Br-p did not show toxicity to fibroblasts in the tested concentration up to 10 mg/mL, obtaining CC(50) 10 mg/mL. The SI value for the tested Propionibacterium strains ranged from 160 to 320. Finally, an active dressing based on chitosan/alginate/genipin was prepared using freeze-drying. The formed dressing was evaluated for its anti-acne activity. To sum up: preliminary biological studies confirmed the anti-acne properties of the isolated peptide fraction from burdock root and pointed to the possibility of using it to create an active dressing on the skin.","Miazga-Karska, Malgorzata; Michalak, Katarzyna; Ginalska, Grazyna",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248785/,632
16172,Use of #SaludTues Tweetchats for the Dissemination of Culturally Relevant Information on Latino Health Equity: Exploratory Case Study,2021-03-01,"Although some studies have suggested the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy for hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the role of HBO has not been established. We compared the treatment outcomes of 8 patients with viral HC (adenovirus [ADV], n = 2; BK virus [BKV], n = 6) treated with HBO (HBO[+]) and 8 patients (ADV, n = 2; BKV, n = 6) treated with conventional therapy (HBO[−]), such as urinary catheterization and intravenous cidofovir. HBO therapy was performed at 2.1 atmospheres for 90 min/day until clinical improvement was achieved. The median number of HBO treatments was 10 (range 8–12). The median duration of HBO treatment was 19.5 days (range 10–23 days). All 8 HBO(+) patients achieved complete remission (CR) at a median of 14.5 days (range 5–25 days). Of the 8 HBO(−) patients, 5 (62.5%) obtained CR and 3 remained symptomatic for 2–6 months. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality at day 100 after allogeneic HSCT was significantly higher in the HBO(−) patients than in the HBO(+) patients (14.2 vs. 0%, P < 0.05). No severe HBO-related adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, HBO is a feasible option for treating viral HC after allogeneic HSCT.","Hosokawa, Kohei; Aoki, Go; Ohata, Kinya; Takamatsu, Hiroyuki; Nakagawa, Noriharu; Imi, Tatsuya; Iwaki, Noriko; Ito, Kiyoaki; Kawano, Mitsuhiro; Nakamura, Takashi; Takamori, Masato; Ishiyama, Ken; Kondo, Yukio; Yamazaki, Hirohito; Nakao, Shinji",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7962929/,632
16263,Combining Wearable Devices and Mobile Surveys to Study Child and Youth Development in Malawi: Implementation Study of a Multimodal Approach,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of tenascin-C are linked to increased risk and severity of major depressive disorder (MDD), while testosterone shows a protective effect. The present study explored associations between serum levels of tenascin-C and testosterone in Chinese men with MDD. METHODS: Testosterone and tenascin-C levels were measured in sera of 412 men with MDD and 237 age- and sex-matched controls. Serum levels of thyroid hormone, lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were also quantified. Potential associations were examined using covariance, subgroup analysis, and multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Significantly higher concentrations of tenascin-C were detected in sera of subjects with MDD than in controls. Among subjects with MDD, testosterone concentrations inversely correlated with tenascin-C levels. This relationship was observed when patients were stratified by age at onset; duration or severity of depression; or concentration of thyroid hormones, low- or high-density lipoprotein, or hs-CRP. The negative association remained even when the statistical model was adjusted for age, smoking status, alcohol use, and body mass index. Linear regression with bootstrap resampling confirmed that high tenascin-C levels inversely correlated with testosterone levels. CONCLUSION: In men with MDD, high tenascin-C concentrations correlate with testosterone deficiency. The combination of elevated tenascin-C and testosterone deficiency may be associated with MDD progression.","Peng, Rui; Li, Yan",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981168/,632
60620,Definitions and Prevalence of Multimorbidity in Large Database Studies: A Scoping Review.,2021-02-09,"The paper presents the results of experimental studies of the influence of the local anodic oxidation control parameters on the geometric parameters of oxide nanoscale structures (ONS) and profiled nanoscale structures (PNS) on the surface of epitaxial structures of silicon doped gallium arsenide with an impurity concentration of 5 × 1017 cm-3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed that GaAs oxide consists of oxide phases Ga2O3 and As2O3, and the thickness of the Ga2O3 layer is 2-3 times greater than the thickness of As2O3 area-i.e., the oxidized GaAs region consists mainly of Ga2O3. The experimental studies of the influence of ONS thickness on the resistive switching effect were obtained. An increase in the ONS thickness from 0.8 ± 0.3 to 7.6 ± 0.6 nm leads to an increase in the switching voltage Uset from 2.8 ± 0.3 to 6.8 ± 0.9 V. The results can be used in the development of technological processes for the manufacturing of nano-electronic elements, such as ReRAM, as well as a high-efficiency quantum dot laser.","Avilov, Vadim; Polupanov, Nikita; Tominov, Roman; Solodovnik, Maxim; Konoplev, Boris; Smirnov, Vladimir; Ageev, Oleg",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13163451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764373/,632
60735,"Does Active Design Influence Activity, Sitting, Wellbeing and Productivity in the Workplace? A Systematic Review.",2020-12-10,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a natural linear polysaccharide that has excellent hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low immunogenicity, making it one of the most attractive biopolymers used for biomedical researches and applications. Due to the multiple functional sites on HA and its intrinsic affinity for CD44, a receptor highly expressed on various cancer cells, HA has been widely engineered to construct different drug-loading nanoparticles (NPs) for CD44- targeted anti-tumor therapy. When a cocktail of drugs is co-loaded in HA NP, a multifunctional nano-carriers could be obtained, which features as a highly effective and self-targeting strategy to combat the cancers with CD44 overexpression. The HA-based multidrug nano-carriers can be a combination of different drugs, various therapeutic modalities, or the integration of therapy and diagnostics (theranostics). Up to now, there are many types of HA-based multidrug nano-carriers constructed by different formulation strategies including drug co-conjugates, micelles, nano-gels and hybrid NP of HA and so on. This multidrug nano-carrier takes the full advantages of HA as NP matrix, drug carriers and targeting ligand, representing a simplified and biocompatible platform to realize the targeted and synergistic combination therapy against the cancers. In this review, recent progresses about HA-based multidrug nano-carriers for combination cancer therapy are summarized and its potential challenges for translational applications have been discussed.","Gao, Menghan; Deng, Hong; Zhang, Weiqi",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/1568026620666200922113846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962617/,632
65066,Burnout in relation to specific contributing factors and health outcomes among nurses: a systematic review.,2013,"BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease, affecting around 10 500 people in the UK. Precision medicines have been developed to treat specific CF-gene mutations. The newest, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELEX/TEZ/IVA), has been found to be highly effective in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and became available to a large proportion of UK CF patients in 2020. Understanding the potential health economic impacts of ELEX/TEZ/IVA is vital to planning service provision. METHODS We combined observational UK CF Registry data with RCT results to project the impact of ELEX/TEZ/IVA on total days of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment at a population level. Registry data from 2015 to 2017 were used to develop prediction models for IV days over a 1-year period using several predictors, and to estimate 1-year population total IV days based on standards of care pre-ELEX/TEZ/IVA. We considered two approaches to imposing the impact of ELEX/TEZ/IVA on projected outcomes using effect estimates from RCTs: approach 1 based on effect estimates on FEV1% and approach 2 based on effect estimates on exacerbation rate. RESULTS ELEX/TEZ/IVA is expected to result in significant reductions in population-level requirements for IV antibiotics of 16.1% (~17 800 days) using approach 1 and 43.6% (~39 500 days) using approach 2. The two approaches require different assumptions. Increased understanding of the mechanisms through which ELEX/TEZ/IVA acts on these outcomes would enable further refinements to our projections. CONCLUSIONS This work contributes to increased understanding of the changing healthcare needs of people with CF and illustrates how Registry data can be used in combination with RCT evidence to estimate population-level treatment impacts.","Keogh, Ruth H; Cosgriff, Rebecca; Andrinopoulou, Eleni-Rosalina; Brownlee, Keith G; Carr, Siobhán B; Diaz-Ordaz, Karla; Granger, Emily; Jewell, Nicholas P; Lewin, Alex; Leyrat, Clemence; Schlüter, Daniela K; van Smeden, Maarten; Szczesniak, Rhonda D; Connett, Gary J",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-216265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556554/,632
65852,Medical student interpreter training schemes: an aid in post-COVID primary care?,2020-11-06,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, limited data exist on patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and short-term outcomes of patients diagnosed with VTE during hospitalization for COVID-19. This is a prospective multinational study of patients with incident VTE during the course of hospitalization for COVID-19. Data were obtained from the Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmbólica (RIETE) registry. All-cause mortality, VTE recurrences, and major bleeding during the first 10 days were separately investigated for patients in hospital wards versus those in intensive care units (ICUs). As of May 03, 2020, a total number of 455 patients were diagnosed with VTE (83% pulmonary embolism, 17% isolated deep vein thrombosis) during their hospital stay; 71% were male, the median age was 65 (interquartile range, 55-74) years. Most patients (68%) were hospitalized in medical wards, and 145 in ICUs. Three hundred and seventeen (88%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 84-91%) patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis at the time of VTE diagnosis. Most patients (88%) received therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin, and 15 (3.6%) received reperfusion therapies. Among 420 patients with complete 10-day follow-up, 51 (12%; 95% CI: 9.3-15%) died, no patient recurred, and 12 (2.9%; 95% CI: 1.6-4.8%) experienced major bleeding. The 10-day mortality rate was 9.1% (95% CI: 6.1-13%) among patients in hospital wards and 19% (95% CI: 13-26%) among those in ICUs. This study provides characteristics and early outcomes of patients diagnosed with acute VTE during hospitalization for COVID-19. Additional studies are needed to identify the optimal strategies to prevent VTE and to mitigate adverse outcomes associated.","Fernández-Capitán, Carmen; Barba, Raquel; Díaz-Pedroche, María Del Carmen; Sigüenza, Patricia; Demelo-Rodriguez, Pablo; Siniscalchi, Carmine; Pedrajas, José María; Farfán-Sedano, Ana I; Olivera, Pavel Eduardo; Gómez-Cuervo, Covadonga; Llamas, Pilar; Villares, Paula; Sanchez, Olivier; López-Reyes, Raquel; Catella, Judith; Bikdeli, Behnood; Weinberg, Ido; Tafur, Alfonso J; Jiménez, David; Monreal, Manuel",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1718402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086403/,632

Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) control the widespread transmission of such pathogens through dermal contact, excessive exposure to alcohol mists and vapors causes CNS disorders, apart from skin infections and negative impacts on the useful microbiome. Herein, we propose bentonite paste, which interacts strongly with different +RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2/poliovirus, for dermal sanitization. Repeated hand cleansing with bentonite paste not only provides complete protection against any viruses but also improves the skin condition. The proposed method is useful for contact isolation and as a strict infection control tool in hospital settings and in public.","Das, Partha; Tadikonda, Bharat Venkata",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006886/,632

Our aim was to design a practical and user-friendly format for BUS that could include the details of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. Materials and Methods As a team of radiologists and surgeons trained in the management of breast diseases, we gathered and carried out the project in four phases-literature search and collection of present report formats, summarizing key points and preparing the first draft, seeking expert opinion and preparing the final format, and pilot testing-followed by a survey was answered by the research team's radiologists and surgeons. Results It produced a list of items to be stated in the BUS report, the final BUS report format, and the pilot format guide. Then, the radiologists used the format in three active ultrasound units in university-affiliated centers, and reports were referred to the surgeons. At the end of the project, the survey showed a high degree of ease of use, clarity, conciseness, comprehensiveness, and well-classified structure of the report format; but radiologists believed that the new organization took more time.

92597,Allocation of Flood Drainage Rights Based on the PSR Model and Pythagoras Fuzzy TOPSIS Method.,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND In vivo studies of HIV-1 pathogenesis and testing of antiviral strategies have been hampered by the lack of an immunocompetent small animal model that is highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Although transgenic rats that express the HIV-1 receptor complex hCD4 and hCCR5 are susceptible to infection, HIV-1 replicates very poorly in these animals. To demonstrate the molecular basis for developing a better rat model for HIV-1 infection, we evaluated the effect of human CyclinT1 (hCycT1) and CRM1 (hCRM1) on Gag p24 production in rat T cells and macrophages using both established cell lines and primary cells prepared from hCycT1/hCRM1 transgenic rats. RESULTS Expression of hCycT1 augmented Gag production 20-50 fold in rat T cells, but had little effect in macrophages. Expression of hCRM1 enhanced Gag production 10-15 fold in macrophages, but only marginally in T cells. Expression of both factors synergistically enhanced p24 production to levels approximately 10-40% of those detected in human cells. R5 viruses produced in rat T cells and macrophages were fully infectious. CONCLUSION The expression of both hCycT1 and hCRM1 appears to be fundamental to developing a rat model that supports robust propagation of HIV-1.","Okada, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Xianfeng; Ben Fofana, Ismael; Nagai, Mika; Suzuki, Hajime; Ohashi, Takashi; Shida, Hisatoshi",Retrovirology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-6-43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19435492/,632
94262,Interventions to Promote Early Discharge and Avoid Inappropriate Hospital (Re)Admission: A Systematic Review.,2019,"INTRODUCTION The purpose of the present study was to assess orthopedic and orthopedic trauma patients' willingness to perform hypothetical remote video consultations, possible advantages as well as concerns. METHODS Between June 2019 and November 2019, a survey amongst consecutive regular orthopedic and orthopedic trauma patients at the outpatient clinics from three European level I trauma centers was conducted via paper-based questionnaires, composed of participants` demographics as well as five open and closed questions. Participation was voluntary and anonymity was granted. RESULTS In total, 780 participants (female 302, 38.7%, male 478, 61.3%) with a mean age of 43.8 years (SD 17.1, range from 14 years to 94 years) were included. The majority of the participants (57,6%) were eager to use a remote consultation. Participants with an age of more than 55 years were significantly less likely to use a remote consultation than their younger counterparts (OR= 0.18, p=0.003. r2=0.141). Among the whole study population, 86.2% stated, that they had a device compatible with an online video consultation. The highest willingness to conduct a video consultation in respect of the participants` occupation was observed in ""part-time""-jobs (70.6%), whereas the lowest disposition was seen in retired patients (37.1%) (p= 0.0001). The most stated reason why to conduct a video consultation was ""communication of medical findings"" (67.8%). The most stated advantage was the ""reduction of physical consultations"" (66.4%). ""No physical examination"" was the most frequently stated disadvantage (75.9%). CONCLUSION The majority of orthopedic and orthopedic trauma outpatients would use a video consultation, especially because of commuting and time issues and ideally to communicate medical findings, such as x-ray reports or lab values. Elderly patients appear to be less eager in regard to video consultations. These results may change for even better acceptance in view of a current pandemic situation, as experienced since early 2020. We feel that this assumption may warrant further investigation.","Scherer, Julian; Osterhoff, Georg; Kaufmann, Ernest; Estel, Katharina; Neuhaus, Valentin; Willy, Christian; Hepp, Pierre; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Back, David A",Injury,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2021.02.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33648741/,632

Here, we demonstrate that side-chain engineering of non-fullerene acceptors could drive the fused-ring backbone assembly from a π-π stacking mode to an intermixed packing mode, and to a non-stacking mode to refine its solid-state properties. Different from the above-mentioned understanding, we find that close atom contacts in a non-stacking mode can form efficient charge transport pathway through close side atom interactions. The intermixed solid-state packing motif in active layers could enable organic solar cells with superior efficiency and reduced non-radiative recombination loss compared with devices based on molecules with the classic end-group π-π stacking mode.

We sought to evaluate outcomes of delayed intubation and examine the ROX index ([SpO2/FIO2]/breathing frequency) to predict weaning from high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in COVID-19. METHODS We performed a multi-centered retrospective observational cohort study of subjects with respiratory failure from COVID-19 managed with HFNC. The ROX index was applied to predict HFNC success. Subjects that failed HFNC were divided into early HFNC failure (≤48 hours of HFNC therapy prior to mechanical ventilation) and late failure (>48 hours). Standard statistical comparisons and regression analyses were used to compare overall hospital mortality and secondary endpoints including time specific mortality, need for ECMO, and ICU length of stay between early and late failure groups. RESULTS 272 subjects with COVID-19 were managed with HFNC. 164 (60.3%) were successfully weaned from HFNC and 111 (67.7%) of those weaned were managed solely in non-ICU settings. ROX index >3.0 at 2, 6, and 12 hours after initiation of HFNC was 85.3% sensitive for identifying subsequent HFNC success. 108 subjects were intubated for failure of HFNC (61 early failures and 47 late failures). Mortality after HFNC failure was high (45.4%). There was no statistical difference in hospital mortality (39.3% vs. 53.2%; P=0.18) or any of the secondary endpoints between early and late HFNC failure groups. This remained true even when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective review, HFNC was a viable strategy and mechanical ventilation was avoided in the majority of subjects. In the minority that progressed to mechanical ventilation, duration of HFNC did not differentiate subjects with worse clinical outcomes. The ROX index was sensitive for the identification of subjects successfully weaned from HFNC. Prospective studies in COVID-19 are warranted to confirm these findings and to optimize patient selection for use of HFNC in this disease.","Chandel, Abhimanyu; Patolia, Saloni; Brown, A Whitney; Collins, A Claire; Sahjwani, Dhwani; Khangoora, Vikramjit; Cameron, Paula C; Desai, Mehul; Kasarabada, Aditya; Kilcullen, Jack K; Nathan, Steven D; King, Christopher S",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328179/,632

However, we recently showed that inefficient immune activation and a poor virus-specific T cell response underlie severe disease in SARS-CoV-infected mice. Here, we extend these results to show that virus-specific T cells, in the absence of activation of the innate immune response, were sufficient to significantly enhance survival and diminish clinical disease. We demonstrated that T cells are responsible for virus clearance, as intravenous adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-immune splenocytes or in vitro-generated T cells to SCID or BALB/c mice enhanced survival and reduced virus titers in the lung. Enhancement of the number of virus-specific CD8 T cells by immunization with SARS-CoV peptide-pulsed dendritic cells also resulted in a robust T cell response, earlier virus clearance, and increased survival. These studies are the first to show that T cells play a crucial role in SARS-CoV clearance and that a suboptimal T cell response contributes to the pathological changes observed in SARS. They also provide a new approach to SARS vaccine design.","Zhao, Jincun; Zhao, Jingxian; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01049-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20610717/,632

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions was conducted (PROSPERO, CRD42018094083). The PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched. RCTs from 2000 to 2017 and with employees (18-65 years) were selected. Then, intervention characteristics and work-related outcomes data were extracted. A total of 47 RCTs were included in the systematic review, and 19 RCTs (11 absenteeism, 7 productivity, and 5 work ability) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the effectiveness of workplace interventions for absenteeism was -1.56 (95% CI, -2.67 to -0.44) and -2.65 (95% CI, -4.49 to -0.81) considering only moderate quality RCTs. In contrast, only a few studies of workplace interventions for productivity and work ability were included, which was insufficient for determining the effectiveness and best design for improving these work outcomes. The workplace is an interesting environment to reduce absenteeism, and individualized and counseling interventions with <10 sessions/total were the most effective workplace intervention methodological design for reducing the absenteeism of employees. Future high-quality RCTs that also consider health risks should be implemented to strengthen the results.","Tarro, Lucia; Llauradó, Elisabet; Ulldemolins, Gemma; Hermoso, Pedro; Solà, Rosa",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17061901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183392/,632

118824,Evaluation of a Suicide Prevention Program for the Energy Sector.,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND Psychosocial distresses are often associated with sleep disorders. This is found as a common population level observation during natural calamities or emergency situations like a pandemic. The current study was conducted to determine the magnitude of self-reported insomnia, and to identify its associated factors among the apparently healthy Indian adult population having access to social media during the lockdown period of COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey was conducted from April 20 - May 19, 2020 in India using online questionnaire comprising Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, variables related to concern, fear and apprehension about COVID19 pandemic, and different socio-clinical variables. The questionnaire was disseminated via different social media platforms and responses from 1081 respondents were included in the analysis. RESULTS Moderate clinical insomnia was present in 13.32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.23%-14.50%), and severe clinical insomnia was present in 1.85% (95% CI: 1.08%-3.14%). For higher levels of insomnia mild anxiety was associated with a proportional odds ratio (OR) of 1.83 (95% CI: 1.24-2.71), and moderate and severe anxiety had an OR of 4.01 (95% CI: 2.57-6.25). Factors associated with higher severity of insomnia were middle age group (36-50 years), being a professional, living alone, perceiving COVID as serious disease, urban residence and those having comorbidity. The OR for being concerned for staying indoors was 5.09 (95% CI: 4.09-5.33), whereas the OR for fear of scarcity in availability of masks and sanitizers was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.26-1.75); and the OR for fear of unavailability of essential goods was 3.20 (95% CI: 2.06-4.98). CONCLUSIONS Psychosocial factors like generalized anxiety, higher age, higher perceived severity, and various concerns related to COVID19 pandemic were identified to be associated with higher degrees of insomnia. Necessary psychosocial interventions, may be required to address the burden of insomnia in a timely and long-term mode.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Acharya, Rudraprasad; Dey, Abhijit; Chakraborty, Arup",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.11.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33333469/,632
120922,Mercury and Prenatal Growth: A Systematic Review.,2021-07-03,"BACKGROUND We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of thrombectomy for the treatment of stroke in a trial embedded within a population-based stroke reperfusion registry. METHODS During a 2-year period at four centers in Catalonia, Spain, we randomly assigned 206 patients who could be treated within 8 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute ischemic stroke to receive either medical therapy (including intravenous alteplase when eligible) and endovascular therapy with the Solitaire stent retriever (thrombectomy group) or medical therapy alone (control group). All patients had confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion and the absence of a large infarct on neuroimaging. In all study patients, the use of alteplase either did not achieve revascularization or was contraindicated. The primary outcome was the severity of global disability at 90 days, as measured on the modified Rankin scale (ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Although the maximum planned sample size was 690, enrollment was halted early because of loss of equipoise after positive results for thrombectomy were reported from other similar trials. RESULTS Thrombectomy reduced the severity of disability over the range of the modified Rankin scale (adjusted odds ratio for improvement of 1 point, 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 2.8) and led to higher rates of functional independence (a score of 0 to 2) at 90 days (43.7% vs. 28.2%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0). At 90 days, the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were 1.9% in both the thrombectomy group and the control group (P=1.00), and rates of death were 18.4% and 15.5%, respectively (P=0.60). Registry data indicated that only eight patients who met the eligibility criteria were treated outside the trial at participating hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with anterior circulation stroke who could be treated within 8 hours after symptom onset, stent retriever thrombectomy reduced the severity of post-stroke disability and increased the rate of functional independence.

121591,Psychological and Physiological Responses in Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder: The Use of Acute Exercise and Virtual Reality Environment.,2020-07-06,"Heavy metals are considered to be among the leading environmental factors that trigger amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, no convincing biopathological mechanism and therapeutic clinical implication of such metals in ALS pathogenesis have been established. This is partly attributable to the technical and scientific difficulties in demonstrating a direct and causative role of heavy metals in the onset of ALS in patients. However, a body of epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidences suggest that lead (Pb), more than other metals, could actually play a major role in the onset and progression of ALS. Here, to clarify the nature of the association and the causative role of Pb in ALS, we comprehensively reviewed the scientific literature of the last decade with objective database searches and the methods typically adopted in systematic reviews, critically analysing and summarising the various scientifically sound evidence on the relationship between ALS and Pb. From these tasks, we noted a number of multidisciplinary associations between ALS and Pb, and specifically the importance of occupational exposure to Pb in ALS development and/or progression. We also report the possible involvement of TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43)-based molecular mechanism in Pb-mediated ALS, although these data rely on a single study, which included both in vitro experiments and an animal model, and are therefore still preliminary. Finally, we briefly examined whether this knowledge could inspire new targeted therapies and policies in the fight against ALS.","Farace, Cristiano; Fenu, Grazia; Lintas, Simone; Oggiano, Riccardo; Pisano, Andrea; Sabalic, Angela; Solinas, Giuliana; Bocca, Beatrice; Forte, Giovanni; Madeddu, Roberto",Neurotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2020.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941938/,632

Amino acid 159 of the envelope (E) protein is reportedly implicated in the different levels of neurovirulence in mice infected with WNV NY99 or Eg101. We investigated the role of amino acid 159 of the E protein in the pathogenesis of WNV infection. We produced recombinant WNV with the structural proteins of the NY99 or Eg101 strain (NY-WT or EgCME-WT) and mutant viruses with substitutions of amino acid 159 of the E protein (NY-E-V159I or EgCME-E-I159V). The NY-WT and NY-E-V159I or EgCME-WT and EgCME-E-I159V titers in culture supernatant were similar. The mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intraperitoneally with NY-WT or NY-E-V159I were also similar. In contrast, the mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intracranially with EgCME-E-I159V were significantly higher than those of mice inoculated with EgCME-WT. The numbers of CD3-positive and CD8-positive T cells were greater in brains inoculated with EgCME-E-I159V than in those inoculated with EgCME-WT. Therefore, amino acid 159 of the E protein modulates the pathogenicity of WNV by affecting viral replication and T-cell infiltration in the brain.","Kobayashi, Shintaro; Kaneko, Chisato; Kawakami, Ryoko; Hasebe, Rie; Sawa, Hirofumi; Yoshii, Kentaro; Kariwa, Hiroaki",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64199-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346055/,632

The main reasons for this are lack of efficient therapy, which is linked to too late discovery of the disease itself. With this in mind, biomarkers are recognised as an element which can bring a major contribution to research, helping elucidate the disease and the search for treatments. They are also playing an increasing role in early detection and timely diagnosis, which are considered the principal hopes of effective management in the absence of an effective drug. The current arsenal of biomarkers could already, if more widely deployed, provide an effective minimum service to patients and health systems. A concerted action by policy makers and stakeholders could drive progress in access to AD biomarker testing to provide an optimum service in the medium term. This paper discusses how to improve the use of and access to biomarker testing in the detection and diagnosis of AD and other diseases featuring dementia, and how EU healthcare systems could benefit. It outlines the challenges, lists the achievements to date, and highlights the actions needed to allow biomarker testing to deliver more fully on their potential in AD.","Horgan, Denis; Nobili, Flavio; Teunissen, Charlotte; Grimmer, Timo; Mitrecic, Dinko; Ris, Laurence; Pirtosek, Zvezdan; Bernini, Chiara; Federico, Antonio; Blackburn, Daniel; Logroscino, Giancarlo; Scarmeas, Nikos",Biomedicine hub,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564663/,632

127338,Green Space and Health in Mainland China: A Systematic Review.,2021-09-21,"BACKGROUND & AIMS It is not clear whether familial risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies with age of index CRC patients or their relatives. We quantified the risk of CRC in first-degree relatives (FDRs), second-degree relatives, and first-cousin relatives of individuals with CRC, stratified by ages and sexes of index patients and ages of relatives. METHODS CRCs diagnosed between 1980 and 2010 were identified from the Utah Cancer Registry and linked to pedigrees from the Utah Population Database. Age- and sex-matched CRC-free individuals were selected to form the comparison group. CRC risk in relatives was determined by Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Of 18,208 index patients diagnosed with CRC, the highest familial risk was observed in FDRs of index CRC patients who were diagnosed at an age younger than 40 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.79). However, familial risk was increased in FDRs even when the index case was diagnosed with cancer at an advanced age (>80 years; HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.59-1.94). Ages of relatives and ages of index cases of CRC each affected familial cancer risk; the highest risk was found in young relatives (<50 years) of individuals with early-onset CRC (<40 years; HR, 7.0; 95% CI, 2.86-17.09). CONCLUSIONS All relatives of individuals with CRC are at increased risk for this cancer, regardless of the age of diagnosis of the index patient. Although risk is greatest among young relatives of early-onset CRC cases, relatives of patients diagnosed at advanced ages also have an increased risk.","Samadder, N Jewel; Smith, Ken Robert; Hanson, Heidi; Pimentel, Richard; Wong, Jathine; Boucher, Kenneth; Ahnen, Dennis; Singh, Harminder; Ulrich, Cornelia M; Burt, Randall W; Curtin, Karen",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2015.06.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26188136/,632

In this monocentric study, we aimed at evaluating the impact of type 2 diabetes, comorbidities, plasma glucose levels, and antidiabetes medications on the survival of COVID-19 patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a case series involving 387 COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center in the region of Lombardy, the epicenter of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic in Italy, between 20 February and 9 April 2020. Medical history, pharmacological treatments, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes of patients without diabetes and patients with type 2 diabetes were compared. Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to investigate risk factors associated with mortality. RESULTS Our samples included 90 patients (23.3%) with type 2 diabetes, who displayed double the mortality rate of subjects without diabetes (42.3% vs. 21.7%, P < 0.001). In spite of this, after correction for age and sex, risk of mortality was significantly associated with a history of hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.84, 95% CI 1.15-2.95; P = 0.011), coronary artery disease (aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.04-2.35; P = 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aHR 2.07, 95% CI 1.27-3.38; P = 0.003), stroke (aHR 2.09, 95% CI 1.23-3.55; P = 0.006), and cancer (aHR 1.57, 95% CI 1.08-2.42; P = 0.04) but not with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.170). In patients with diabetes, elevated plasma glucose (aHR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.44, per mmol/L; P = 0.015) and IL-6 levels at admission (aHR 2.47, 95% CI 1.28-4.78, per 1-SD increase; P = 0.007) as well as treatments with insulin (aHR 3.05, 95% CI 1.57-5.95; P = 0.001) and β-blockers (aHR 3.20, 95% CI 1.50-6.60; P = 0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality, whereas the use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors was significantly and independently associated with a lower risk of mortality (aHR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.92; P = 0.042).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS A total of 102 patients (male-to-female ratio, 73:29; age range, 35-85 years; mean age, 58.1 years) with 119 malignant hepatic tumors were enrolled and analyzed prospectively. The patients underwent percutaneous RFA with IV infusion of opioid analgesics. Changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and the occurrence of significant cardiovascular inhibition (BP or HR < 70% of baseline) were monitored during the procedure. Respiratory rate and skin body temperature were recorded before and after the procedure. RESULTS Whereas the mean BP was elevated (36%, 43/119) or depressed (36%, 43/119) with a similar frequency, the HR was predominantly depressed (56%, 66/119) during the procedure. The BP and HR were stable in only 18% cases (21/119), respectively. The respiratory rate showed no significant change (p = 0.521) after RFA; however, body temperature decreased (p < 0.001) after RFA. Although significant cardiovascular inhibition occurred in 41 cases (35%), all of the cases could be managed successfully and the technical success rate was 100% (119/119). Among the risk factors analyzed, old age (B = -0.003, p = 0.019) was significant for systolic BP depression, and contact of the RFA zone with the central portal vein (B = -0.096, p = 0.014) and female sex (B = -0.078, p = 0.033) were significant risk factors for HR depression as determined by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Changes in BP and HR, especially bradycardia, are common during percutaneous RFA of hepatic lesions. Significant risk factors for severe cardiovascular inhibition include contact of the RFA zone with the branches of the central portal vein, old age, and female sex.","Park, Min Jung; Kim, Young-sun; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lim, Hyo Keun; Shin, Byung Seop; Choi, Dongil; Lee, Min Woo; Kim, Dong Hwan",AJR.

This work is conducted to better understand the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory viruses circulating in southern China. METHODS Totally 22,680 respiratory samples were collected from ARI patients from 18 hospitals in southern China during 2009-2018, and seven common respiratory viruses including Flu, RSV, PIV, hMPV, ADV, HCoV and HBoV were screened using in-house real-time PCR. RESULTS Totally 9,760 ARI cases (9760/22680, 43.03%) were detected as positive for the 7 common respiratory viruses. The most detected virus was Flu (14.15%), followed by RSV (10.33%) and PIV (5.43%). Flu-A, PIV3 and HCoV-OC43 were the predominant subtypes. Although most of the viruses were more easily detected in inpatients and males, Flu was more likely detected in outpatient and females. Flu infection was more likely to cause URTI (upper respiratory tract infection), whereas RSV infection was more likely to cause pneumonia and bronchitis. The prevalence of Flu was particularly high in 2009. The epidemic level was found notably high in 2014-2018 for RSV, in 2016-2018 for PIV, in the summer of 2018 for ADV, in the summer of 2016 and winter of 2018 for HCoV, and in the summer of 2011 and autumn of 2018 for HBoV. The co-detection rate of 7 viruses was 4.70% and RSV, PIV and Flu were the most commonly co-detected viruses. CONCLUSIONS This work demonstrates the epidemiological characteristics of 7 common respiratory viruses in ARI patients in southern China.","Huang, Xu-Bin; Yuan, Lei; Ye, Cong-Xiu; Zhu, Xun; Lin, Cui-Ji; Zhang, Ding-Mei; He, Kai-Shu; Niu, Ruo-Xi; Cao, Kai-Yuan; Xu, Lin",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32562851/,632
132437,Effects of PM2.5 on People's Emotion: A Case Study of Weibo (Chinese Twitter) in Beijing.,2021-05-19,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 10 million people and caused more than 502,539 deaths worldwide as of June 2020. The explosive spread of the virus and the rapid increase in the number of cases require the immediate development of effective therapies and vaccines as well as accurate diagnosis tools. The pathogenesis of the disease is triggered by the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein into ACE2-bearing host cells, particularly pneumocytes, resulting in overactivation of the immune system, which attacks the infected cells and damages the lung tissue. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with host cells is primarily mediated by the N-terminal helix of ACE2; thus, inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for blocking the virus entry into host cells. In this paper, we used an in-silico approach to explore small-molecule α-helix mimetics as inhibitors that may disrupt the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. First, the RBD-ACE2 interface in the 6M0J structure was studied by the MM-GBSA decomposition module of the HawkDock server, which led to the identification of two critical target regions in the RBD. Next, two virtual screening experiments of 7236 α-helix mimetics from ASINEX were conducted on the above regions using the iDock tool, which resulted in 10 candidates with favorable binding affinities. Finally, the stability of RBD complexes with the top-two ranked compounds was further validated by 100 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

133510,Analysis of Wellbeing in Nongovernmental Organizations' Workplace in a Developed Area Context.,2020-08-11,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is currently an evolving situation. Operating rooms (OR) are high-risk areas for the transmission of any respiratory infection with multiple personnel involved, in close proximity. Of concern to neurosurgeons, is the high-risk of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) like transsphenoidal and endonasal surgery. Endonasal AGPs theoretically present a higher risk of viral exposure due to the longer duration of exposure and aggressive disruption of potentially virus-containing mucosa. Objective The current review discusses potential strategies to neuro-surgeons to avoid transmission of COVID 19 during endo-nasal and trans-sphenoidal surgeries. Materials and Methods We searched PubMed using the search terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""coronavirus"" in combination with ""neurosurgery"", and identified 13 relevant articles. A pre-surgical risk assessment score is proposed based on the risk of transmission. A flow chart of patient selection and care has been formulated. Conclusion In all emergency patients, it is preferable to consider transcranial surgery or a sub-labial approach avoiding exposure to mucosa. Due to laboratory constraints routine swabs is not always available. Therefore, routine preoperative screening computed tomography (CT) chest is performed in all patients. Based on risk of transmission of infection to others, we propose a classification of patients for skull-based surgery into low, high and very high risk groups and suggest suitable personal protective equipment. Additionally, we discuss avoiding use of powered drills in or any AGP. However, cold procedures involving shavers and microdebriders generate lesser amounts of aerosol. Post-operatively, the length of stay could be reduced with a multidisciplinary approach.","Panigrahi, Manas; Kakani, Nikhil; Vooturi, Sudhindra",Neurology India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.287683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32611906/,632

This paper presents how the user-centred design process together with a patient organisation was transformed to a digital approach and the experiences from performing a remote co-creation user workshop. The digital approximation had a satisfactory result and the main contribution lies in the sharing of recommendations for how to practically apply a remote user-centred design methodology.","Smaradottir, Berglind F; Bellika, Johan Gustav; Fredeng, Aina; Fagerlund, Asbjørn J",Studies in health technology and informatics,https://doi.org/10.3233/shti200722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33227768/,632

Investigational therapies for COVID-19 may cause clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to study potential DDIs (pDDIs) and their risk factors in COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in a tertiary respiratory hospital dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Lexi-Interact database was used to investigate clinically important pDDIs. The database output including interacting drug pairs, risk rating, reliability rating, mechanism, and management was evaluated. Associations between the occurrence of pDDIs and probable risk factors were assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Medical charts of 227 patients were reviewed. About 38% of the patients had at least one clinically important pDDI. More than half of the interactions were between protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) and regularly prescribed medications for the management of comorbidities or COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., atorvastatin, alprazolam, salmeterol, and tamsulosin). Ischemic heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, and ICU admission were significantly associated with the occurrence of pDDIs. CONCLUSIONS We recommend considering the risk factors for the emergence of clinically important DDIs in the pharmacotherapy of COVID-19 patients. Using an alternative medication or dose adjustments may be required in high-risk patients.","Mahboobipour, Amir Ali; Baniasadi, Shadi",Drug metabolism and personalized therapy,https://doi.org/10.1515/dmpt-2020-0145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33580642/,632

The dynamics of SW-GW interactions may depend on factors such as the relative water levels between streams and aquifers, resulting in a temporal variation of exchange, which imposes complexity to the understanding of such dynamics. This study highlights the use of high-resolution time series and multi-resolution analysis to help to gain insights into such complex dynamics. Wavelet coherence (WTC) is applied on hourly time series of rainfall, stream and spring discharges of a low lying karstified spring catchment to yield a correlation in the time-frequency domain. This analysis provides comprehensive information on the overall impact of the river on the spring, which is supported by the cross-correlation function, as well as by more detailed information, including time-variant influences such as a threshold level of influence. Field observations of turbidity sampling at the spring appear to support this interpretation. This innovative approach relies on basic hydrological parameters, water level or discharge, and is therefore applicable to many other systems with such existing time series.

139073,A Scoping Review of the Association of Social Disadvantage and Cerebrovascular Disease Confirmed by Neuroimaging and Neuropathology.,2021-07-02,"INTRODUCTION Even though results have been encouraging, an unequivocal conclusion on the beneficial effect of minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery cannot be derived from previous publications. Long-term outcomes are rarely reported and a significant decrease in operative mortality has not been shown. Most studies have a limited number of patients and are underpowered. They merely report on short-term results of a heterogeneous intraoperative group using different types of ECC system in aortic valve surgery. The aim of the present study was to determine whether MiECC systems are more beneficial than conventional extracorporeal systems (CECC) with regard to mortality, hospital stay and inflammation and with only haemodilution and blood-air interface as differences. METHODS We retrospectively analysed data regarding mortality, hospital stay and inflammation in patients undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery. Forty patients were divided into two groups based on the type of extracorporeal system used; conventional (n=20) or MiECC (n=20). RESULTS Perioperative blood product requirements were significantly lower in the MiECC group (MiECC: 0.2±0.5 units vs CECC: 0.9±1.2 units, p=0.004). No differences were seen postoperatively regarding mortality (5% vs 5%, p=0.99), total length of hospital stay (10.6±7.2 days (MiECC) vs 12.1±5.9 days (CECC), p=0.39) or inflammation markers (CRP: MiECC: 7.09±13.62 mg/L vs CECC: 3.4±3.2 mg/L, p=0.89). CONCLUSION MiECC provides circulatory support that is equally safe and feasible as conventional extracorporeal circuits. No differences in mortality, hospital stay or inflammation markers were observed.","Starinieri, Pascal; Declercq, Peter E; Robic, Boris; Yilmaz, Alaaddin; Van Tornout, Michiel; Dubois, Jasperina; Mees, Urbain; Hendrikx, Marc",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659117691814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28553780/,632

We aimed to evaluate the safety outcome profile of CEA and CAS in Chinese patients with carotid artery stenosis. The Revascularization of Extracranial Carotid Artery Stenosis trial was a multicentre, prospective cohort study of CEA or CAS in treating patients with carotid artery stenosis. We included symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis (≥ 50%). The primary endpoint was any stroke, myocardial infarction and/or death within 1 month post-procedure. Overall, 2719 cases (1543 CAS-treated patients and 1176 CEA-treated patients) were enrolled from 36 centres. The primary outcome was 4.3% (95% CI 3.2-5.6%) and 4.7% (95%CI 3.5-6.3%) in the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. No significant difference in the primary outcome was found between CAS and CEA in both symptomatic (p = 0.338) and asymptomatic (p = 0.890) patients. High- versus low-volume centre significantly related to lower rate of primary outcome in CEA-treated patients (OR 2.54; 95%CI 1.19-5.44; p = 0.017) and asymptomatic patients (OR 2.54; 95%CI 1.42-4.54; p = 0.002). CEA and CAS decided by surgeons' discretion have comparable risks among patients with carotid artery stenosis in China. Both CEA and CAS should be avoided in asymptomatic patients until a consistently low complication rate is showed with centre-level audits. Medical treatment for patients with carotid stenosis in China needs to be improved.

141561,Family Variables and Quality of Life in Children with Down Syndrome: A Scoping Review.,2021-01-07,"UNLABELLED Preterm neonates are susceptible to perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, for which no treatment is available. In a preclinical animal model of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in ovine fetuses, we have demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of systemically administered mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The mechanism of MSC treatment is unclear but suggested to be paracrine, through secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Therefore, we investigated in this study the protective effects of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) in a preclinical model of preterm hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Ovine fetuses were subjected to global hypoxia-ischemia by transient umbilical cord occlusion, followed by in utero intravenous administration of MSC-EVs. The therapeutic effects of MSC-EV administration were assessed by analysis of electrophysiological parameters and histology of the brain. Systemic administration of MSC-EVs improved brain function by reducing the total number and duration of seizures, and by preserving baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. These functional protections were accompanied by a tendency to prevent hypomyelination. Cerebral inflammation remained unaffected by the MSC-EV treatment. Our data demonstrate that MSC-EV treatment might provide a novel strategy to reduce the neurological sequelae following hypoxic-ischemic injury of the preterm brain. Our study results suggest that a cell-free preparation comprising neuroprotective MSC-EVs could substitute MSCs in the treatment of preterm neonates with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, thereby circumventing the potential risks of systemic administration of living cells. SIGNIFICANCE Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) show promise in treating hypoxic-ischemic injury of the preterm brain. Study results suggest administration of extracellular vesicles, rather than intact MSCs, is sufficient to exert therapeutic effects and avoids potential concerns associated with administration of living cells. The therapeutic efficacy of systemically administered mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) on hypoxia-ischemia-induced injury was assessed in the preterm ovine brain. Impaired function and structural injury of the fetal brain was improved following global hypoxia-ischemia. A cell-free preparation of MSC-EVs could substitute for the cellular counterpart in the treatment of preterm neonates with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. This may open new clinical applications for ""off-the-shelf"" interventions with MSC-EVs.","Ophelders, Daan R M G; Wolfs, Tim G A M; Jellema, Reint K; Zwanenburg, Alex; Andriessen, Peter; Delhaas, Tammo; Ludwig, Anna-Kristin; Radtke, Stefan; Peters, Vera; Janssen, Leon; Giebel, Bernd; Kramer, Boris W",Stem cells translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2015-0197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27160705/,632

Furthermore, ICU ventilators offer numerous patient-triggered modes that work differently across brands. We systematically investigated, using a bench model, the effect of patient-triggered modes on the size and variability of VT at different breathing frequencies (f), patient effort, and ARDS severity. METHODS We used a V500 Infinity ICU ventilator connected to an ASL 5000 lung model whose compliance was mimicking mild, moderate, and severe ARDS. Thirteen patient-triggered modes were tested, falling into 3 categories, namely volume control ventilation with mandatory minute ventilation; pressure control ventilation, including airway pressure release ventilation (APRV); and pressure support ventilation. Two levels of f and effort were tested for each ARDS severity in each mode. Median (first-third quartiles) VT was compared across modes using non-parametric tests. The probability of VT > 6 mL/kg ideal body weight was assessed by binomial regression and expressed as the odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. VT variability was measured from the coefficient of variation. RESULTS VT distribution over all f, effort, and ARDS categories significantly differed across modes (P < .001, Kruskal-Wallis test). VT was significantly greater with pressure support (OR 420 mL, 95% CI 332-527 mL) than with any other mode except for variable pressure support level. Risk for VT to be > 6 mL/kg was significantly increased with spontaneous breaths patient-triggered by pressure support (OR 19.36, 95% CI 12.37-30.65) and significantly reduced in APRV (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.72) and pressure support with guaranteed volume mode. The risk increased with increasing effort and decreasing f. Coefficient of variation of VT was greater for low f and volume control-mandatory minute ventilation and pressure control modes. APRV had the greatest within-mode variability. CONCLUSIONS Risk of VT > 6 mL/kg was significantly reduced in APRV and pressure support with guaranteed volume mode. APRV had the highest variability. Pressure support with guaranteed volume could be tested in patients with ARDS.","Perinel-Ragey, Sophie; Baboi, Loredana; Guérin, Claude",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28765493/,632

The diagnosis of PJI is very difficult, especially in the early postoperative period. The value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is useful for diagnosing infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the NLR for the diagnosis of early PJI after total knee or hip arthroplasty. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated consecutive primary total knee or hip arthroplasty and identified the patients who readmitted within the first 90 days postoperatively between January 2011 and October 2018.There were 20 cases diagnosed early PJI and 101 uninfected cases on the basis of the modified Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. The serum parameters including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood-cell (WBC) count, NLR and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were compared between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to estimate the optimal cutoff values for each parameter. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for each parameter were calculated. RESULTS The CRP, ESR, WBC, NLR and IL-6 values were all significally higher in the infected group than the uninfected group. The median of CRP was 66.6 mg/l in the infected group and 8.6 mg/l in the uninfected group (p < 0.001). The median of ESR was 34.8 mm/hr. in the infected group and 17.4 mm/hr. in the uninfected group (p < 0.001). In the infected group and uninfected group, the median of WBC was 8.2X109 /L and 6.1 X109 /L (p = 0.002), respectively; while the median of NLR was 5.2 and 2.1 (p < 0.001). The median of IL-6 was 46 pg/ml and 6.4 pg/ml (p < 0.001),respectively. The best parameter for the diagnosis of early PJI was IL-6 (AUC = 0.814) followed by the NLR (AUC =0.802), CRP (AUC =0.793), ESR (AUC =0.744) and WBC (AUC = 0.632). CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to show that NLR values are more accurate than CRP and may be considered as useful parameters for the diagnosis of early PJI because it is a cheap and convenient parameter to be calculated in daily practice without extra costs.","Yu, Bao-Zhan; Fu, Jun; Chai, Wei; Hao, Li-Bo; Chen, Ji-Ying",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-020-03704-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109144/,632

However, passing these devices can be challenging because of limitations in their design. DESCRIPTION Two independent concepts were combined into one design aiming to overcome the limitation of passing the straight anvil of an endoscopic stapler through a tunnel typically created by a curved dissection instrument within the complex cluster of tubular structures that comprise the pulmonary hilum. EVALUATION A library of 45 unedited advanced thoracoscopic lung resection videos containing a balance of all major anatomic resections (36 lobectomy and 9 pneumonectomy) spanning 2004 to 2011 were reviewed, and 220 hilar structure division times were measured along with the adjunctive techniques like catheter leaders or silicone slings. Prolonged passage times occurred throughout the series despite improved experience; however, early experience with 51 passes using the new design showed significant time savings (median 61 s versus 115 s, p = 0.005).

153580,The Impact of Enforcement Capabilities on the Effectiveness of Public Assessment on Occupational Safety.,2020-09-03,"Sepsis and meningitis due to invasive group B Streptococcus (iGBS) disease during early infancy is a leading cause of child mortality. Recent systematic estimates of the worldwide burden of GBS suggested that there are 319,000 cases of infant iGBS disease each year, and an estimated 147,000 stillbirths and young-infant deaths, with the highest burden occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. The following priority data gaps were highlighted: (1) long-term outcome data after infant iGBS, including mild disability, to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and (2) economic burden for iGBS survivors and their families. Geographic data gaps were also noted with few studies from low- and middle- income countries (LMIC), where the GBS burden is estimated to be the highest. In this paper we present the protocol for a multi-country matched cohort study designed to estimate the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), socioemotional behaviors, and economic outcomes for children who survive invasive GBS disease in Argentina, India, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa. Children will be identified from health demographic surveillance systems, hospital records, and among participants of previous epidemiological studies. The children will be aged between 18 months to 17 years. A tablet-based custom-designed application will be used to capture data from direct assessment of the child and interviews with the main caregiver. In addition, a parallel sub-study will prospectively measure the acute costs of hospitalization due to neonatal sepsis or meningitis, irrespective of underlying etiology. In summary, these data are necessary to characterize the consequences of iGBS disease and enable the advancement of effective strategies for survivors to reach their developmental and economic potential. In particular, our study will inform the development of a full public health value proposition on maternal GBS immunization that is being coordinated by the World Health Organization.","Paul, Proma; Procter, Simon R; Dangor, Ziyaad; Bassat, Quique; Abubakar, Amina; Santhanam, Sridhar; Libster, Romina; Gonçalves, Bronner P; Madhi, Shabir A; Bardají, Azucena; Mwangome, Eva; Mabrouk, Adam; John, Hima B; Sánchez Yanotti, Clara; Chandna, Jaya; Sithole, Pamela; Mucasse, Humberto; Katana, Patrick V; Koukounari, Artemis; Harden, Lois M; Aerts, Celine; Ghoor, Azra; Leahy, Shannon; Mbatha, Sibongile; Lowick, Sarah; Lala, Sanjay G; Bramugy, Justina; Newton, Charles; Hossain, A K M Tanvir; Sadeq-Ur Rahman, Qazi; Lambach, Philipp; Jit, Mark; Lawn, Joy E",Gates open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13185.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368637/,632

Data on critically ill patients with MERS-CoV infection are limited. OBJECTIVE To describe the critical illness associated with MERS-CoV. DESIGN Case series. SETTING 3 intensive care units (ICUs) at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS 12 patients with confirmed or probable MERS-CoV infection. MEASUREMENTS Presenting symptoms, comorbid conditions, pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations, measures of severity of illness and organ failure, ICU course, and outcome are described, as are the results of surveillance of health care workers (HCWs) and patients with potential exposure. RESULTS Between December 2012 and August 2013, 114 patients were tested for suspected MERS-CoV; of these, 11 ICU patients (10%) met the definition of confirmed or probable cases. Three of these patients were part of a health care-associated cluster that also included 3 HCWs. One HCW became critically ill and was the 12th patient in this case series. Median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 28 (range, 16 to 36). All 12 patients had underlying comorbid conditions and presented with acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Most patients (92%) had extrapulmonary manifestations, including shock, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. Five (42%) were alive at day 90. Of the 520 exposed HCWs, only 4 (1%) were positive. LIMITATION The sample size was small. CONCLUSION MERS-CoV causes severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and considerable extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and is associated with high mortality. Community-acquired and health care-associated MERS-CoV infection occurs in patients with chronic comorbid conditions.

OBJECTIVE -To evaluate histopathology and in situ hybridization for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in gastrointestinal samples from patients with recent and remote COVID-19. DESIGN -Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal tests and a gastrointestinal tissue specimen were included. SARS-CoV-2 in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on each sample. A subset had SARS-CoV-2 next generation sequencing (NGS) performed. RESULTS -Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria. Five had positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal tests within 7 days of their gastrointestinal procedure. Two were ulcerative colitis patients on steroid therapy who lacked typical COVID-19 symptoms. Their colectomies showed severe ulcerative colitis; one demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 by NGS but a negative ISH. Another had an ischemic colon resected as a complication of the COVID-19 course; however, both ISH and NGS were negative. A fourth had a normal-appearing terminal ileum but positive ISH and NGS. The fifth patient had ileal ulcers with SARS-CoV-2 negativity by both modalities. The remaining 20 patients had positive nasopharyngeal tests an average of 53 days prior to procedure. None of their samples demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 ISH positivity, but one was positive on NGS despite a negative nasopharyngeal test. CONCLUSIONS -Gastrointestinal findings from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients ranged from normal with virus detected by ISH and NGS, to bowel ischemia secondary to systemic viral effects, without evidence of virus in the tissue. No distinct histologic finding was identified in those with gastrointestinal tissue specimens demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 positivity in this cohort.","Westerhoff, Maria; Jones, Dan; Hrycaj, Steven M; Chan, May P; Pantanowitz, Liron; Tu, Huolin; Choi, Karen; Greenson, Joel; Lamps, Laura",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2021-0137-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961007/,632

In previous work, we reported that infected monocytes, the in vivo target cells of FIPV, express viral proteins in their plasma membranes. These proteins are quickly internalized upon binding of antibodies. As the cell surface is cleared from viral proteins, internalization might offer protection against antibody-dependent cell lysis. Here, the internalization and subsequent trafficking of the antigen-antibody complexes were characterized using biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches. Internalization occurred through a clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathway that did not require dynamin, rafts, actin or rho-GTPases. These findings indicate that the viral antigen-antibody complexes were not internalized through any of the previously described pathways. Further characterization showed that this internalization process was independent from phosphatases and tyrosine kinases but did depend on serine/threonine kinases. After internalization, the viral antigen-antibody complexes passed through the early endosomes, where they resided only briefly, and accumulated in the late endosomes.

METHODS Full-thickness abdominal wall defects were created in 108 Wistar rats, and reconstructed with 83 PLA(94) and 25 lightweight polypropylene (PPL) meshes. The meshes were previously gamma-ray sterilised with 25, 75 or 125 kGy to accelerate PLA(94) degradation. RESULTS The inflammatory response in PLA(94) was significantly less pronounced and collagen organisation significantly better than in PPL. The higher the level of gamma-radiation, the higher the incidence of abdominal wall herniation (22.2, 31.3 and 52.6% with 25, 75 and 125 kGy, respectively). No herniation occurred in the PPL group. Tensile strength was dramatically reduced after gamma-ray-sterilised PLA(94) mesh implantation. CONCLUSION The gamma-ray-sterilised PLA(94) mesh was poor in preventing abdominal wall hernia recurrences in a rat model.","de Tayrac, R; Letouzey, V; Garreau, H; Guiraud, I; Vert, M; Mares, P",European surgical research.

The primary prevention strategy against the disease is vaccination and entomological control of vectors; however, implementing such a strategy in several countries in the continent is far below what is necessary to control the disease. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic further aggravated this situation and negatively impacted these measures, mainly the coverage of vaccination campaigns, due to restrictive measures to control the disease. Therefore, the most significant risk is that the incidence of DF in the continent will increase even more in the coming years, as a reflection of the negative impact of the pandemic on the control of the disease. To prevent another public health crisis, immediate and multidisciplinary approaches are required to address the epidemiological control of DF in African countries.","Aborode, Abdullahi Tunde; Corriero, Anna Chiara; Fajemisin, Emmanuel Adebowale; Hasan, Mohammad Mehedi; Kazmi, Syeda Kanza; Olajiga, Olayinka",The International journal of health planning and management,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523165/,632

A case study from a large metropolitan healthcare trust,2020,"Antigenic and genetic studies of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were made on isolates obtained from three continents over 27 years. Antigenic variation between eight isolates was initially determined using protein G-specific monoclonal antibodies. Four distinct reaction patterns were observed, two of which corresponded to the previously established subgroups A and AB. A third pattern was produced by five Scandinavian strains and a fourth was observed from a single Dutch isolate. The genetic diversity of 27 strains of BRSV was investigated by comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of a 731 nucleotide fragment in the G protein gene. Nine of the BRSV strains were analysed by direct sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons whereas sequences of 18 BRSV and three human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) strains were obtained from GenBank. The analysis revealed similarities of 88-100% among BRSV strains and 38-41% between BRSV and HRSV. A phylogenetic tree created for BRSV revealed two main branches, one of which divided into five further lineages, each representing a geographic cluster. A correlation was evident between the positions of some strains in the phylogenetic tree and their antigenic pattern. For HRSV strains, a genetic similarity of only 62% allowed the distinction of two antigenic subgroups, A and B, a pattern which was not seen for BRSV. This study showed that genetic analysis was an accurate method for discriminating BRSV strains and that these viruses should be regarded as a single genetic and antigenic group, within which variants can be distinguished.","Elvander, M; Vilcek, S; Baule, C; Uttenthal, A; Ballagi-Pordány, A; Belák, S",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880007/,632

238033,"Older Adolescents Who Did or Did Not Experience COVID-19 Symptoms: Associations with Mental Health, Risk Perception and Social Connection",2021,"BACKGROUND: This paper describes a model for estimating COVID-19 related excess deaths that are a direct consequence of insufficient hospital ward bed and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. METHODS: Compartmental models were used to estimate deaths under different combinations of ICU and ward care required and received in England up to late April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information and organisations collating COVID-19 data. A sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent increased mortality due to insufficient ICU or general ward bed capacity. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers, 'Optimistic', 'Middling' and 'Pessimistic', were modelled and compared with the subsequent observations to the 3rd February. RESULTS: The key output was the demand and capacity model described. There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in the 'Optimistic' scenario. Several of the 'Middling' scenario applications resulted in excess deaths-up to 597 deaths (0.6% increase) with a 20% reduction compared to best estimate ICU capacity. All the 'Pessimistic' scenario applications resulted in excess deaths, ranging from 49,178 (17.0% increase) for a 20% increase in ward bed availability, to 103,735 (35.8% increase) for a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability. These scenarios took no account of the emergence of the new, more transmissible, variant of concern (b.1.1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is increased when hospital demand exceeds available capacity. No excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the 'Optimistic' scenario. The 'Middling' scenario could result in some excess deaths-up to a 0.7% increase relative to the total number of deaths. The 'Pessimistic' scenario would have resulted in significant excess deaths. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,178 (17% increase) and 103,735 (35.8% increase). Given the new variant, the pessimistic scenario appeared increasingly likely and could have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths. In the event, it would appear that capacity was not breached at any stage at a national level with no excess deaths. it will remain unclear if minor local capacity breaches resulted in any small number of excess deaths.","Martin, Christopher; McDonald, Stuart; Bale, Steve; Luteijn, Michiel; Sarkar, Rahul",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,632

Este trabalho foi delineado para investigar a patogenicidade de um isolado do vírus da raiva, do morcego insetívoro Lassiurus ega, procedente do município de Presidente Prudente SP, em comparação ao vírus fixo da raiva, amostra CVS/32 (Challenge Vírus Standard). Os vírus foram reativados por meio de inoculação intracerebral em camundongos e os experimentos de patogenicidade foram realizados em camundongos e hamsters, desafiando-os pelas vias intramuscular (IM), intradérmica (ID), intranasal (IN) e abrasão superficial da pele (AP). A presença do vírus nos cérebros de animais que haviam manifestado sinais compatíveis à raiva, foi confirmada mediante a prova de imunofluorescência direta. Foram considerados para a avaliação da patogenicidade o quadro clínico, proporção de mortos, e a duração dos períodos de incubação (PI) e clínicos (PC) em dias. Em hamsters, o isolado de L. ega exibiu um quadro furioso, com proporção total de mortos de 2.60%; assim discriminada: 2.08% IM (PI: 11 dias; PC: 6 dias) e 8.33% IN (PI:10.66 ± 1.15 e PC: 7.33 ± 1.54). A presença do vírus no SNC foi detectada apenas em animais inoculados por essas vias. Por outro lado, o vírus CVS produziu um quadro paralítico com mortalidade total de 39.84%, com a seguinte distribuição: 62.50% IM (PI 7.50 ± 2.33; PC: 5.13 ± 1.89) 78.12% ID (PI 9.13 ± 2.23; PC 3.88 ± 2.23) 18.75% IN (PI 12.00 ± 2.77; PC 7.14 ± 2.54). Em camundongos, o isolado do L. ega manifestou sinais de agressividade e a raiva foi confirmada em animais inoculados IM e IN. A proporção de mortos observados em camundongos foi de 50.00% (PI 16.80 ± 2.20; PC 1.4 ± 0.54) e 30% (PI 14 ± 4.35; PC: 2.66 ± 0.57) respectivamente e o vírus CVS produziu mortalidade de 45.00% (PI: 6.30 ± 0.67; PC: 1.5 ± 0.70), 70% (PI: 7.14 ± 1.34; PC 2.28 ± 1.25) e 30% (PI:10.00; PC:1) pelas vias mencionadas acima, com quadro clínico de paralisia. O isolado de L. ega mostrou diferenças na proporção de mortos e quadro clínico furioso quando comparado com o CVS nos dois modelos animais.

247028,"Workers’ Healthcare Assistance Model (WHAM): Development, Validation, and Assessment of Sustainable Return on Investment (S-ROI)",2020,"BACKGROUND: Primary health centers (PHCs) represent the first tier of the Indian health care system, providing a range of essential outpatient services to people living in the rural, suburban, and hard-to-reach areas. Diversion of health care resources for containing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly undermined the accessibility and availability of essential health services. Under these circumstances, the preparedness of PHCs in providing safe patient-centered care and meeting the current health needs of the population while preventing further transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the primary health care facility preparedness toward the provision of safe outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among supervisors and managers of primary health care facilities attached to medical colleges and institutions in India. A list of 60 faculties involved in the management and supervision of PHCs affiliated with the community medicine departments of medical colleges and institutes across India was compiled from an accessible private organization member database. We collected the data through a rapid survey from April 24 to 30, 2020, using a Google Forms online digital questionnaire that evaluated preparedness parameters based on self-assessment by the participants. The preparedness domains assessed were infrastructure availability, health worker safety, and patient care. RESULTS: A total of 51 faculties responded to the survey. Each medical college and institution had on average a total of 2.94 (SD 1.7) PHCs under its jurisdiction. Infrastructural and infection control deficits at the PHC were reported in terms of limited physical space and queuing capacity, lack of separate entry and exit gates (n=25, 49%), inadequate ventilation (n=29, 57%), and negligible airborne infection control measures (n=38, 75.5%). N95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites. Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% (n=12) and 27.4% (n=14) of sites, respectively. The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, was significantly disrupted (P<.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures. Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policy makers and health managers working at primary health care facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.","Garg, Suneela; Basu, Saurav; Rustagi, Ruchir; Borle, Amod",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,632

251068,The Research on Patient Satisfaction with Remote Healthcare Prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported on December 31, 2019. Because it has only been studied for just over three months, our understanding of this disease is still incomplete, particularly regarding its sequelae and long-term outcomes. Moreover, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs of patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care. The objective of this report is to answer the question ""What rehabilitation services do survivors of COVID-19 require?"" The question was asked within the context of a subacute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. Three areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified. First, details of how patients may present have been summarized, including comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay with or without intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including those pertaining to cardiac, neurological, cognitive, and mental health. Second, I have suggested procedures regarding the design of inpatient rehabilitation units for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been proposed with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as recovery of mobility and function. A thorough assessment and an individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life. Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients recover as completely as possible.","Sheehy, Lisa Mary",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,632

257476,Comparison of physical activity levels in youths before and during a pandemic lockdown,2021,"BackgroundIn countries with high COVID-19 vaccination rates the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has resulted in rapidly increasing case numbers. This study evaluated the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) coupled with alternative COVID-19 vaccination strategies to determine feasible Delta mitigation strategies for Australia. We aimed to understanding the interplay between high vaccine coverage levels and NPI physical distancing activation, and to establish the benefit of adding children and adolescents to the vaccination program. Border closure has limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Australia, however slow vaccination uptake resulted in Delta outbreaks in the two largest cities, and may continue once international travel resumes. MethodsAn agent-based model was used to evaluate the potential reduction in the COVID-19 health burden resulting from alternative vaccination strategies. We assumed immunity was derived from vaccination with the BNT162b2 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Two age-specific vaccination strategies were evaluated, age 5 and above, and 12 and above, and the health burden determined under alternative coverages, with/without activation of NPIs. Age-specific infections generated by the model, together with recent UK data, permitted reductions in the health burden to be quantified. ResultsCases, hospitalisations and deaths are shown to reduce by: i) increasing coverage to include children aged 5 to 11 years, ii) activating moderate NPI measures, and/or iii) increasing coverage levels above 80%. At 80% coverage, vaccinating ages 12 plus without NPIs is predicted to give 1,162 hospitalisations; adding ages 5 and above gives 1,073 cases per million population. Activating moderate NPIs reduces hospitalisations to 705. Alternatively, increasing coverage to 90% reduces this to 684. Combining all three measures is shown to reduce cases to 398, hospitalisations to 2 and deaths to zero. ConclusionsDelta variant outbreaks may be successfully managed by an achievable 80% vaccine coverage rate and moderate NPI measures, allowing schools and many workplaces to remain open. This prevents use of hard lockdown measures, and consequential economic and societal damage. Activating moderate NPIs is shown to give a similar reduction in health burden as increasing coverage of ages 12 and above to 90%. If 90% coverage cannot be achieved, including children and adolescents in the vaccination program coupled with moderate NPIs appears necessary to contain future COVID-19 Delta transmission.

259146,Psychological Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Hungarian Adults,2020,"Since the 2009 influenza pandemic, the Netherlands has used a weekly death monitoring system to estimate deaths in excess of expectations. We present estimates of excess deaths during the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and 10 previous influenza epidemics. Excess deaths per influenza epidemic averaged 4,000. The estimated 9,554 excess deaths (41% in excess) during the COVID-19 epidemic weeks 12-19 of 2020 appeared comparable to the 9,373 excess deaths (18%) during the severe influenza epidemic of 2017-18. However, these deaths occurred in a shorter time, had a higher peak, and were mitigated by nonpharmaceutical control measures. Excess deaths were 1.8-fold higher than reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths (5,449). Based on excess deaths and preliminary results from seroepidemiologic studies, we estimated the infection-fatality rate to be 1%. Monitoring of excess deaths is crucial for timely estimates of disease burden for influenza and COVID-19. Our data complement laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 death reports and enable comparisons between epidemics.","van Asten, Liselotte; Harmsen, Carel N; Stoeldraijer, Lenny; Klinkenberg, Don; Teirlinck, Anne C; de Lange, Marit M A; Meijer, Adam; van de Kassteele, Jan; van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B; van den Hof, Susan; van der Hoek, Wim",Emerg Infect Dis,,632

Lung function measures were found to be genetically correlated with seven druggable biochemical traits, with further evidence of a causal relationship between increased fasting glucose and diminished lung function. Moreover, we developed polygenic scores for lung function specifically within pathways with known drug targets and investigated their relationship with pulmonary phenotypes and gene expression in independent cohorts to prioritise individuals who may benefit from particular drug-repurposing opportunities. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of lung function was then performed which identified several drug-gene interactions with predicted lung function increasing modes of action. Drugs that regulate blood glucose were uncovered through both polygenic scoring and TWAS methodologies. In summary, we provided genetic justification for a number of novel drug-repurposing opportunities that could improve lung function.","Reay, William R; El Shair, Sahar I; Geaghan, Michael P; Riveros, Carlos; Holliday, Elizabeth G; McEvoy, Mark A; Hancock, Stephen; Peel, Roseanne; Scott, Rodney J; Attia, John R; Cairns, Murray J",eLife (Cambridge),,632

In this study, data from UK Biobank participants who were tested for COVID-19 infection (16 March to 7 September 2020) were used to explore the link between shift work and COVID-19 infection. Using the baseline occupational information, participants were categorised as non-shift workers, day shift workers, mixed shift workers and night shift workers. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the association between shift work and COVID-19 infection. Among the 18,221 participants (9.4% positive cases), 11.2% were health workers, and 16.4% were involved in shift-work-based jobs. Ethnic minorities (18%) and people in night-shift-based jobs (18.1%) had a significantly higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection than others. Adjusted logistics regression model suggest that, compared with their counterparts, people employed in a night-shift-based job were 1.85-fold (95% CI: 1.42-2.41) more likely to have COVID-19 infection. Sensitivity analysis focusing on people working in a non-healthcare setting suggests that people in shift-work-based jobs had 1.81-fold (95% CI: 1.04%-3.18%) higher odds of COVID-19 infection than their counterparts. Shift workers, particularly night shift workers, irrespective of their occupational group, seem to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection. If similar results are obtained from other studies, then it would mandate to revisit the criteria for defining high-risk groups for COVID-19 and implementing appropriate interventions to protect people in shift-based jobs.","Fatima, Yaqoot; Bucks, Romola S; Mamun, Abdullah A; Skinner, Isabelle; Rosenzweig, Ivana; Leschziner, Guy; Skinner, Timothy C",J Sleep Res,,632

However, over the past weeks, an increase in the number of children presenting to hospitals in the greater Paris region with a phenotype resembling Kawasaki disease (KD) has led to an alert by the French national health authorities. METHODS: Multicentre compilation of patients with KD in Paris region since April 2020, associated with the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ('Kawa-COVID-19'). A historical cohort of 'classical' KD served as a comparator. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (sex ratio=1, median age 10 years IQR (4·7 to 12.5)). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 12 cases (69%), while a further three cases had documented recent contact with a quantitative PCR-positive individual (19%). Cardiac involvement included myocarditis in 44% (n=7). Factors prognostic for the development of severe disease (ie, requiring intensive care, n=7) were age over 5 years and ferritinaemia >1400 µg/L. Only five patients (31%) were successfully treated with a single intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) infusion, while 10 patients (62%) required a second line of treatment. The Kawa-COVID-19 cohort differed from a comparator group of 'classical' KD by older age at onset 10 vs 2 years (p<0.0001), lower platelet count (188 vs 383 G/L (p<0.0001)), a higher rate of myocarditis 7/16 vs 3/220 (p=0.0001) and resistance to first IVIg treatment 10/16 vs 45/220 (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Kawa-COVID-19 likely represents a new systemic inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Further prospective international studies are necessary to confirm these findings and better understand the pathophysiology of Kawa-COVID-19.

This study is conducted with a hypothesis that there is no difference in the quality of life and cost-effectiveness of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients in HI and FI. Patients and Methods: A mixed-method study was conducted in Jodhpur in September 2020. The purposive sampling technique was used and data from 120 individuals admitted in HI and FI were collected. The information about the status and functioning of isolation facilities was collected from various sources. Multi-stakeholder interactions with 15 personnel engaged in managing isolation facilities were done. EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) which consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) was used to assess health-related quality of life. Results: The strength of HI strategy is demonstrated by its ability to provide psychological and social support with minimal logistic requirements but the issue of sufficient household infrastructure, adequate family and societal support for implementing this strategy is of concern. The strength of FI strategy includes its ability to provide support to patients who have issues of sufficient household infrastructure, adequate family and societal support, but this strategy poses a threat of increasing human resource constraints and financial load on the health system. The respondents from HI obtained a mean EQ-5D index score of 0.90 and a mean VAS score of 85, whereas it was 0.80 and 78.5, respectively, for FI. The cost estimated for home isolation was Rs 549 (7.43 US $) per person, whereas it was Rs 2440 (33.02 US $) for facility Isolation. Conclusion: Though HI seems advantageous in terms of a better quality of life and cost-saving over FI, both the strategies are context-specific having their own trade-offs.","Bhardwaj, P.; Joshi, N.

Results of a Cross-Sectional Study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) as a global pandemic Currently, no vaccines are available and there is little evidence of the efficacy of potential therapeutic agents. Furthermore, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population to the new coronavirus, and it is as-sumed that everyone in the population is susceptible. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the procedures described in the article is to minimize the risk of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2) virus during procedures carried out in endoscopic laboratories. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, cause severe pneumonia, or lead to death. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from none (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and it can be fatal. Case studies to-date indicate that this infection causes a mild illness (i.e. pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in approximately 80% of cases, and most cases recove; 14% have a more severe illness, 6% experience a critical illness. The vast majority of the most serious illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and people with other chronic underlying diseases. Average progression times include: â¢ in mild cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in almost 2 weeks; â¢ in severe cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in 3-6 weeks, and from symptoms to death in 2-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Special precautions should be taken and procedures followed when performing invasive medical procedures in endoscopic laboratories in patients with specific or clinically probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.

281170,Potentially Prolonged Psychological Distress from Postponed Olympic and Paralympic Games during COVID-19—Career Uncertainty in Elite Athletes,2021,"Hospital Pharmacy Service (HPS) in Spain have been impacted by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the outbreak has forced HPSs to adapt their outpatient consultation services to Telepharmacy to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of contagion. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the experience of HPSs with outpatient Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and expose the lessons learned. Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","Margusino-Framiñán, Luis; Illarro-Uranga, Aitziber; Lorenzo-Lorenzo, Karina; Monte-Boquet, Emilio; Márquez-Saavedra, Esther; Fernández-Bargiela, Noelia; Gómez-Gómez, David; Lago-Rivero, Natividad; Poveda-Andrés, José Luis; Díaz-Acedo, Rocío; Hurtado-Bouza, Juan Luis; Sánchez-Gundín, Julia; Casanova-Martínez, Cristina; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón",Farm Hosp,,632

In the clinical symptoms of Behçet's disease, many immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs are used. The suspicion that drugs used in chronic disease treatments such as Behçet's disease during pandemic will increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease, and that the disease may progress more lethally in these patients after the infection caused clinicians to worry. As far as we know, there is no study in the literature about the management of patients with Behçet's disease in the pandemic period. Fifty-four patients with Behçet's disease who were admitted to the dermatology outpatient clinic between 11 March and July 14, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. In this pandemic period, 44 of 54 patients were recommended to continue their previous treatment. While the dose of medication used by 7 patients was reduced, it was decided to change the treatment of 3 patients. No life-threatening activation was observed. None of the patients developed COVID-19 disease. This article is important in terms of being the first study in the literature examining the treatment of patients with Behçet's disease during the COVID-19. In this period, we know that the treatment practices in chronic diseases change frequently daily, and in this respect, we hope that our study will provide a perspective to other dermatology clinics in terms of the treatment of Behçet's disease during the pandemic.","Dursun, Recep; Temiz, Selami A; Özer, Ilkay; Daye, Munise; Ataseven, Arzu",Dermatol Ther,,632

In the wake of being created and afterward to a great extent relinquished in the twentieth century, many antibody preparations are presently in clinical use. Interest in utilizing antibodies to treat irresistible infections is now being fuelled by the wide dissemination of drug-resistant pathogens, the rise of new pathogens, the overall inefficacy of medications in immunocompromised hosts and the fact that antibody-based treatments are the main way to give prompt resistance against biological weapons. Given the requirement for new drug therapies and numerous ongoing innovative advances in the field of immunoglobulin research, there is generous affirmation concerning improved applications of antibody- based therapy for the anticipation and treatment of infectious diseases. The advent of new pathogens for which there is no compelling treatment alternative has redrawn the regard for the usefulness of convalescent plasma. To be sure, convalescent plasma can be an alternate and quick remedial choice in outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 flu, H5N1 flu, Ebola, Poleomyelitis, Measles and COVID-19.","Kale, M.

288817,Personal safety during the COVID-19 pandemic: realities and perspectives of healthcare workers in Latin America,2020,"BACKGROUND: Thousands of cancer surgeries were delayed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines if surgical delays impact survival for breast, lung and colon cancers. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched. Articles evaluating the relationship between delays in surgery and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) or cancer-specific survival (CSS) were included. RESULTS: Of the 14,422 articles screened, 25 were included in the review and 18 (totaling 2,533,355 patients) were pooled for meta-analyses. Delaying surgery for 12 weeks may decrease OS in breast (HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.28-1.65), lung (HR 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06) and colon (HR 1.24, 95%CI 1.12-1.38) cancers. When breast cancers were analyzed by stage, OS was decreased in stages I (HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.16-1.40) and II (HR 1.13, 95%CI 1.02-1.24) but not in stage III (HR 1.20, 95%CI 0.94-1.53). CONCLUSION: Delaying breast, lung and colon cancer surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic may decrease survival.","Johnson, Brett A; Waddimba, Anthony C; Ogola, Gerald O; Fleshman, James W; Preskitt, John T",Am. j. surg,,632

Modeling cDC development is crucial to study cDCs and harness their therapeutic potential. Here we address whether cDCs could differentiate in response to trophic cues delivered by mesenchymal components of the hematopoietic niche. We find that mesenchymal stromal cells engineered to express membrane-bound FLT3L and stem cell factor (SCF) together with CXCL12 induce the specification of human cDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Engraftment of engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (eMSCs) together with CD34+ HSPCs creates an in vivo synthetic niche in the dermis of immunodeficient mice driving the differentiation of cDCs and CD123+AXL+CD327+ pre/AS-DCs. cDC2s generated in vivo display higher levels of resemblance with human blood cDCs unattained by in vitro-generated subsets. Altogether, eMSCs provide a unique platform recapitulating the full spectrum of cDC subsets enabling their functional characterization in vivo.","Anselmi, Giorgio; Vaivode, Kristine; Dutertre, Charles-Antoine; Bourdely, Pierre; Missolo-Koussou, Yoann; Newell, Evan; Hickman, Oliver; Wood, Kristie; Saxena, Alka; Helft, Julie; Ginhoux, Florent; Guermonprez, Pierre",Nat Commun,,632

A very prominentfeature associated with severe COVID-19 is T cell lymphopenia. However, homeostatic and functional properties of T cells are ill-defined in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled individuals with mild and severe COVID-19 into our multicenter cohort and performed a cross-sectional analysis of phenotypic and functional characteristics of T cells using 40-parameter mass cytometry, flow cytometry, targeted proteomics, and functional assays. RESULTS: Compared tomild disease, we observed strong perturbations of peripheral T cell homeostasis and function in severe COVID-19. Individuals with severe COVID-19 showed T cell lymphopenia and redistribution of T cell populations, including loss of naïveT cells, skewing toward CD4+ T follicular helper cells and cytotoxic CD4+ T cells,and expansion of activated and exhausted T cells. Extensive T cell apoptosis was particularly evident with severe disease and T cell lymphopenia,which in turn was accompanied by impaired T cell responses to several common viral antigens. Patients with severe disease showed elevated interleukin-7 and increased T cell proliferation. Furthermore, patients sampled at late time points after symptom onset had higher T cell counts and improved antiviral T cell responses. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that severe COVID-19 is characterized by extensiveT cell dysfunction and T cell apoptosis, which is associated with signs of homeostatic T cell proliferation and T cell recovery.","Adamo, Sarah; Chevrier, Stéphane; Cervia, Carlo; Zurbuchen, Yves; Raeber, Miro E; Yang, Liliane; Sivapatham, Sujana; Jacobs, Andrea; Baechli, Esther; Rudiger, Alain; Stüssi-Helbling, Melina; Huber, Lars C; Schaer, Dominik J; Bodenmiller, Bernd; Boyman, Onur; Nilsson, Jakob",Allergy,,632

Few SLPs had received training in telepractice to prepare them for changes from an in-person service delivery model to synchronous telepractice. The new telepractice environment may alter vocal behaviors and communication interactions in such a way that negatively impacts voice production. Thus, delivering synchronous online clinical services may require that SLPs adopt novel prevention strategies for avoiding phonogenic voice problems. Guided by two complementary injury frameworks, the Haddon Matrix and the Haddon Countermeasures, this article provides an overview of potential factors associated with phonogenic voice problems among SLPs in telepractice and proposes possible prevention strategies to maintain optimal vocal health and function with synchronous modes of online clinical practice.","Knickerbocker, Kristie; Bryan, Cara; Ziegler, Aaron",Semin Speech Lang,,632

METHODS: Eighty-eight countries were selected based on their likelihood of providing reliable data. Using death rates/million for each country from the ""worldometer"" website, a correlation analysis was done between death rates and a country's latitude. RESULTS: A highly significant, positive correlation was found between lower death rates and a country's proximity to the equator (Pearson râ¯=â¯0.40 P < .0001, 2-tailed t test). The R squared of 0.16 means that 16% of the variation in death rates among nations is accounted for by the latitude of the country. Evidence is presented suggesting a direct correlation between sunlight exposure and reduced mortality. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to document a statistically significant correlation between a country's latitude and its COVID-19 mortality and is consistent with other research regarding latitude, Vitamin D deficiency, and COVID-19 fatalities. Limitations of this study are noted. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to confirm the correlation between latitude and COVID-19 fatalities, and to determine the optimum amounts of safe sunlight exposure and/or vitamin D oral supplementation to reduce COVID-19 fatalities in populations that are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency.","Whittemore, Paul B",Am J Infect Control,,632

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether ABO blood groups are associated with different severities of COVID-19. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis and nested prospective observational substudy of critically ill patients with COVID-19. We collected data pertaining to age, sex, comorbidities, dates of symptom onset, hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), standard laboratory parameters, and serum inflammatory cytokines. National (N = 398 671; P = .38) and provincial (n = 62 246; P = .60) ABO blood group distributions did not differ from our cohort (n = 95). A higher proportion of COVID-19 patients with blood group A or AB required mechanical ventilation (P = .02) and CRRT (P = .004) and had a longer ICU stay (P = .03) compared with patients with blood group O or B. Blood group A or AB also had an increased probability of requiring mechanical ventilation and CRRT after adjusting for age, sex, and presence of &#8805;1 comorbidity. Inflammatory cytokines did not differ between patients with blood group A or AB (n = 11) vs O or B (n = 14; P > .10 for all cytokines).

To improve sensitivity, we assessed a broad scope targeted sequence capture (TSC) panel (ViroCap) in both human and animal samples. Moreover, we adjusted TSC for the Oxford Nanopore MinION and compared the performance to an SMg approach. TSC on the Illumina NextSeq served as the gold standard. Overall, TSC increased the viral read count significantly in challenging human samples, with the highest genome coverage achieved using the TSC on the MinION. TSC also improved the genome coverage and sequencing depth in clinically relevant viruses in the animal samples, such as influenza A virus. However, SMg was shown to be adequate for characterizing a highly diverse animal virome. TSC on the MinION was comparable to the NextSeq and can provide a valuable alternative, offering longer reads, portability and lower initial cost.

The current therapy for GBM consists in concurrent radiation and chemotherapy following removal of the tumor. Although the therapy prolongs patient survival, recurrence often occurs. The major cause of tumor recurrence is thought to be GBM stem cells (GSCs), which aid the development of chemo-radiotherapy resistance, and can self-renew and aberrantly differentiate. Therefore, GSCs should be targeted to eradicate the tumor and prevent recurrence. Transcriptomic analysis has categorized GBM into proneural (PN), mesenchymal and classical subtypes, and the outcome of recurrence and prognosis markedly depends on subtype. To identify specific GSC markers, the present study analyzed public microarray and RNA-seq data and identified dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 5 (DRP5) as a candidate GSC marker. DRP5 is known to mediate semaphorin 3A signaling and is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and axon guidance during neuronal development. In the present study, DRP5 was specifically upregulated in the PN-subtype GSCs and served crucial roles in maintaining GSC properties, including tumor sphere formation, stem cell marker expression and xenograft tumor growth. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis revealed that DRP5 expression was positively correlated with signatures of stemness, including Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt/ß-catenin expression, which are also known to be positively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Conversely, DRP5 expression was negatively correlated with NF-&#954;B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 stemness signatures, which are negatively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Taken together, these findings suggested that DRP5 was specifically expressed in PN-subtype GSCs and may be used as a functional marker of PN-subtype GSCs.","Park, Min Gi; Seo, Sunyoung; Ham, Seok Won; Choi, Sang-Hun; Kim, Hyunggee",Oncol Lett,,632

In this study, we identified temporal trends in public interest in cancer-related health information using the nowcasting tool Google Trends. METHODS: We used Google Trends to query search terms related to cancer types for short-term (September 2019-September 2020) and long-term (September 2016-September 2020) trends in the US. We compared average relative search volumes (RSV) for specified time ranges to detect recent and seasonal variation. RESULTS: General search interest declined for all cancer types beginning in March 2020, with changes in search interest for ""Breast cancer,"" ""Colorectal cancer,"" and ""Melanoma"" of - 30.6%, - 28.2%, and - 26.7%, respectively, and compared with the mean RSV of the two previous months. In the same time range, search interest for ""Telemedicine"" has increased by + 907.1% and has reached a 4-year peak with a sustained increased level of search interest. Absolute cancer mortality has declined and is presently at a 4-year low; however, search interest in cancer has been recuperating since July 2020. CONCLUSION: We observed a marked decline in searches for cancer-related health information that mirrors the reduction in new cancer diagnoses and cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health professions need to be prepared for the coming demand for cancer-related healthcare, foreshadowed by recovering interest in cancer-related information on Google Trends.","Adelhoefer, Siegfried; Berning, Philipp; Solomon, Stephen B; Maybody, Majid; Whelton, Seamus P; Blaha, Michael J; Dzaye, Omar",Cancer Causes Control,,632

We aimed to understand the relationship between diabetes mellitus and the prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between diabetes (n = 84) and nondiabetes (n = 500) groups. Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox analysis were applied to determine the risk factors for the prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with nondiabetic patients, diabetic patients had higher levels of neutrophils (P = .014), C-reactive protein (P = .008), procalcitonin (P < .01), and D-dimer (P = .033), and lower levels of lymphocytes (P = .032) and albumin (P = .035). Furthermore, diabetic patients had a significantly higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia (86.9%, P = .020). In terms of complications and clinical outcomes, the incidence of respiratory failure (36.9% vs 24.2%, P = .022), acute cardiac injury (47.4% vs 21.2%, P < .01), and death (20.2% vs 8.0%, P = .001) in the diabetes group was significantly higher than that in the nondiabetes group. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that diabetes (hazard ratio 2.180, P = .031) was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 prognosis. In subgroup analysis, we divided diabetic patients into insulin-required and non-insulin-required groups according to whether they needed insulin, and found that diabetic patients requiring insulin may have a higher risk of disease progression and worse prognosis after the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is an independent risk factor for the prognosis of COVID-19. More attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment for diabetic patients, especially those who require insulin therapy.","Shang, Jian; Wang, Qian; Zhang, Haiping; Wang, Xiaoyue; Wan, Jing; Yan, Youqin; Gao, Yadong; Cheng, Jie; Li, Ziang; Lin, Jun",Am. j. med,,632

The effect of the ongoing pandemic on the cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) procedures is less well studied. We recorded and compared the rates of de novo implantations and replacements of CIEDs performed by two experienced implanters in our referral center between years 2019 and 2020, as well as the periods of lockdowns in 2020 to the corresponding periods of the previous year. Our data indicate a significant decrease in CIEDs de novo implantations during the COVID-19 pandemic (year 2020) even though the replacements were increased. Both de novo implantations and replacements were markedly declined during the first lockdown period while no significant change was observed during the second lockdown period. However, urgent pacemaker implantations did not change significantly between 2020 and 2019 during these periods. Of note, in our study the total number of de novo pacemaker and CRT implantations did not change significantly between 2019 and 2020 while ICD and ILR procedures dropped significantly.","Bechlioulis, A.; Sfairopoulos, D.; Korantzopoulos, P.",American Journal of Cardiovascular Disease,,632

353515,Prioritizing Built Environmental Factors to Tackle Chronic and Infectious Diseases in Remote Northern Territory (NT) Communities of Australia: A Concept Mapping Study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. METHOD: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. RESULT: The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. DISCUSSION: The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and / or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff.","Mboua, Pierre Célestin; Keubo, François Roger Nguépy; Fouaka, Sylvain Gautier Ngueuteu",Evol. psychiatr(Paris),,632

Ela reduz o débito cardíaco e uma das respostas é a ativação da porção simpática do sistema nervoso autônomo. Essa ativação leva a redução da variabilidade da frequência cardíaca (HRV). A HRV é uma análise muito precisa derivada de cálculos dos intervalos R-R. Recentemente na medicina humana um novo indicador foi introduzido, conhecido como turbulência da frequência cardíaca (HRT). Esse indicador avalia a resposta do ciclo de batimentos sinusais após uma contração ventricular prematura. A HRT provou ser mais eficiente que a HRV como um indicador independente da chance de óbito. Neste estudo dados de cães de raças pequenas foi coletada, eletrocardiograma, ecocardiografia foram executadas, alguns pacientes também fizeram holter e os dados foram divididos em dois grupos, sintomáticos e assintomáticos. Os indicadores de início da turbulência e de declive da turbulência foram calculados para os grupos e comparados. A diferença entre estágios sintomáticos foi marcante, com correlação moderada com parâmetros ecocardiográficos.

Several papers have noted that individuals with OCD may be particularly negatively impacted by COVID-19, and that the threat of COVID-19 may impact treatment (Banerjee, 2020; Jassi et al., 2020; Sheu et al., 2020). The study presented herein examined OCD-related and COVID-related intrusions in a non-patient sample. Individuals with elevated OCD symptoms reported having both OCD and COVID intrusions at a similar frequency. Further, OCD symptom severity was significantly correlated with the frequency of COVID related intrusions and the amount of distress they caused. However, distress from COVID related intrusions was not significantly correlated with OCD symptom severity. These results shed light on the similarities between reactions to objectively elevated threat and the perceptions of elevated threat experienced in OCD.","Acenowr, Cohley P; Coles, Meredith E",Psychiatry Res,,632
361419,Data Analytics for Predicting COVID-19 Cases in Top Affected Countries: Observations and Recommendations,2020,"To characterize the family index case for detected SARS-CoV-2 and describe testing and secondary attack rates in the family, we used individual-level administrative data of all families and all PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway in 2020. All families with at least one parent and one child below the age of 20 who lived at the same address (N = 662,582), where at least one member, i.e. the index case, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, were included. Secondary attack rates (SAR7) were defined as the share of non-index family members with a positive PCR test within 7 days after the date when the index case tested positive. SARs were calculated separately for parent- and child-index cases, and for parent- and child-secondary cases. We identified 7548 families with an index case, comprising 26,991 individuals (12,184 parents, 14,808 children). The index was a parent in 66% of the cases. Among index children, 42% were in the age group 17-20 and only 8% in the age group 0-6. When the index was a parent, SAR7 was 24% (95% CI 24-25), whilst SAR7 was 14% (95% CI 13-15) when the index was a child. However, SAR7 was 24% (95% CI 20-28) when the index was a child aged 0-6 years and declined with increasing age of the index child. SAR7 from index parent to other parent was 35% (95% CI 33-36), and from index child to other children 12% (95% CI 11-13). SAR7 from index child aged 0-6 to parents was 27% (95% CI 22-33). The percent of non-index family members tested within 7 days after the index case, increased from about 20% in April to 80% in December, however, SAR7 stabilized at about 20% from May. We conclude that parents and older children are most often index cases for SARS-CoV-2 in families in Norway, while parents and young children more often transmit the virus within the family. This study suggests that whilst the absolute infection numbers are low for young children because of their low introduction rate, when infected, young children and parents transmit the virus to the same extent within the family.","Telle, Kjetil; Jørgensen, Silje B; Hart, Rannveig; Greve-Isdahl, Margrethe; Kacelnik, Oliver",Eur. j. epidemiol,,632

The observational study was based on data from official governmental sources collected since the inception of epidemic until 28 April 2020. DALYs for a disease combines the years of life lost due to premature mortality in the population and the years lost due to disability of the disease. In addition to DALYs, temporary productivity loss due to absenteeism from work and permanent productivity loss due to premature mortality were estimated using the Human Capital Approach. The total DALYs amount to 2.01 per 1000 persons. The total permanent productivity loss was around EUR 300 million while the temporary productivity loss was around EUR 100 million.

Key leaders across the enterprise planned, executed, and continually refined a strategy against the pandemic surge. Mission-driven decisions, communication, and actions were critical in connecting and informing the stakeholders about the evolving and uncertain conditions. In partnership with internal and external stakeholders, the use of data, technology, and innovation provided new opportunities to transform existing care and business models into adaptable prototypes for mitigating risks and informing tactical steps. Execution of testing sites, building a command center, and increasing bed capacity infused daily operations. Creating innovative processes, including working with private industry to secure resources and pioneering solutions, is the result of leveraging talented teams to produce solutions.

HIRAX will survey the majority of the southern sky to measure baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) using the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen. It will operate between 400-800 MHz with 391 kHz resolution, corresponding to a redshift range of $0.8<z<2.5$ and a minimum $\Delta z/z$ of ~0.003. One of the primary science goals of HIRAX is to constrain the dark energy equation of state by measuring the BAO scale as a function of redshift over a cosmologically significant range. Achieving this goal places stringent requirements on the mechanical and optical design of the HIRAX instrument which are described in this paper. This includes the simulations used to optimize the instrument, including the dish focal ratio, receiver support mechanism, and instrument cabling. As a result of these simulations, the dish focal ratio has been reduced to 0.23 to reduce inter-dish crosstalk, the feed support mechanism has been redesigned as a wide (35 cm diam.) central column, and the feed design has been modified to allow the cabling for the receiver to pass directly along the symmetry axis of the feed and dish in order to eliminate beam asymmetries and reduce sidelobe amplitudes. The beams from these full-instrument simulations are also used in an astrophysical m-mode analysis pipeline which is used to evaluate cosmological constraints and determine potential systematic contamination due to physical non-redundancies of the array elements. This end-to-end simulation pipeline was used to inform the dish manufacturing and assembly specifications which will guide the production and construction of the first-stage HIRAX 256-element array.","Saliwanchik, Benjamin R.B.; Ewall-Wice, Aaron; Crichton, Devin; Kuhn, Emily R.; Olccek, Deniz; Bandura, Kevin; Bucher, Martin; Chang, Tzu-Ching; Chiang, H.

379211,Swiss University Students’ Risk Perception and General Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"So far, available evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection. In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The drugs can be restarted once the infectious process is resolved.","de León-Rendón, J L; Hurtado-Salazar, C; Yamamoto-Furusho, J K",Rev Gastroenterol Mex,,632

391852,"Preliminary analysis of relationships between COVID19 and climate, morphology, and urbanization in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy)",2020,"BACKGROUND: Conversations about educational challenges and potential solutions among a globally and culturally diverse group of health professions' educators can facilitate identity formation, mentoring relationships and professional network building. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more important to co-create and disseminate knowledge, specifically regarding online and flexible learning formats. APPROACH: Based on the principles of social learning, we combined speed mentoring and world café formats to offer a virtual Zoom&#8482; workshop, with large and small group discussions, to reach health professions' educators across the globe. The goal was to establish a psychologically safe space for dialogue regarding adaptation to online teaching-learning formats. EVALUATION: We aimed to establish psychological safety to stimulate thought-provoking discussions within the various small groups and obtain valuable contributions from participants. From these conversations, we were able to formulate 'hot tips' on how to adapt to (sometimes new) online teaching-learning formats while nurturing teacher and student wellbeing. REFLECTION: Through this virtual workshop we realized that despite contextual differences, many challenges are common worldwide. We experienced technological difficulties during the session, which needed rapid adaptation by the organising team. We encouraged, but did not pressure, participants to use video and audio during breakout discussions as we wanted them to feel safe and comfortable. The large audience size and different time zones were challenging; therefore, leadership had to be resilient and focussed. Although this virtual format was triggered by the pandemic, the format can be continued in the future to discuss other relevant global education topics.","McKimm, Judy; Ramani, Subha; Kusurkar, Rashmi A; Fornari, Alice; Nadarajah, Vishna Devi; Thampy, Harish; Filipe, Helena P; Kachur, Elizabeth K; Hays, Richard",Perspect Med Educ,,632
391941,"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression for Chinese Residents in Japan during the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: Neurologic events have been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a model-based evaluation of the spatial distribution of these events is lacking. PURPOSE: Our aim was to quantitatively evaluate whether a network diffusion model can explain the spread of small neurologic events. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and LitCovid data bases were searched from January 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-five case series and case studies reported 317 small neurologic events in 123 unique patients with COVID-19. DATA ANALYSIS: Neurologic events were localized to gray or white matter regions of the Illinois Institute of Technology (gray-matter and white matter) Human Brain Atlas using radiologic images and descriptions. The total proportion of events was calculated for each region. A network diffusion model was implemented, and any brain regions showing a significant association (P < .05, family-wise error-corrected) between predicted and measured events were considered epicenters. DATA SYNTHESIS: Within gray matter, neurologic events were widely distributed, with the largest number of events (â¼10%) observed in the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices, respectively. Network diffusion modeling showed a significant association between predicted and measured gray matter events when the spread of pathology was seeded from the bilateral cerebellum (r = 0.51, P < .001, corrected) and putamen (r = 0.4, P = .02, corrected). In white matter, most events (â¼26%) were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. LIMITATIONS: The risk of bias was not considered because all studies were either case series or case studies. CONCLUSIONS: Transconnectome diffusion of pathology via the structural network of the brain may contribute to the spread of neurologic events in patients with COVID-19.","Parsons, N; Outsikas, A; Parish, A; Clohesy, R; D039,; Aprano, F; Toomey, F; Advani, S; Poudel, G R",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,,632
392284,Demographic and Comorbidities Data Description of Population in Mexico with SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients(COVID19): An Online Tool Analysis,2020,"PURPOSE: Contact tracing is intended to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is difficult to conduct among people who live in congregate settings, including people experiencing homelessness (PEH). This analysis compares person-based contact tracing among two populations in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March-May 2020. METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed positive cases among PEH (n = 169) and documented in Utah's surveillance system were included in this analysis. The general population comparison group (n = 163) were systematically selected from all laboratory-confirmed cases identified during the same period. RESULTS: Ninety-three PEH cases (55%) were interviewed compared to 163 (100%) cases among the general population (P < .0001). PEH were more likely to be lost to follow-up at end of isolation (14.2%) versus the general population (0%; P-value < .0001) and provided fewer contacts per case (0.3) than the general population (4.7) (P-value < .0001). Contacts of PEH were more often unreachable (13.0% vs. 7.1%; P-value < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that contact tracing among PEH should include a location-based approach, along with a person-based approach when resources allow, due to challenges in identifying, locating, and reaching cases among PEH and their contacts through person-based contact tracing efforts alone.","Fields, Victoria L; Kiphibane, Tair; Eason, Jeffrey T; Hafoka, Siosaia F; Lopez, Adriana S; Schwartz, Amy; Henry, Ankita; Tran, Cuc H; Tate, Jacqueline E; Kirking, Hannah L; Laws, Rebecca L; Venkatappa, Thara; Mosites, Emily; Montgomery, Martha P",Ann Epidemiol,,632
397003,When Natural Hazards Intersect with Public Health: A Preliminary Exploration of the Impact of Bushfires and the COVID-19 Pandemic on Australian Coastal Drowning Fatalities,2021,"Purpose: Using data from Twitter, the purpose of this paper is to assess the coping behaviour and reactions of social media users in response to the initial days of the COVID-19-related lockdown in different parts of the world. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows the quasi-inductive approach which allows the development of pre-categories from other theories before the sampling and coding processes begin, for use in those processes. Data was extracted using relevant keywords from Twitter, and a sample was drawn from the Twitter data set to ensure the data is more manageable from a qualitative research standpoint and that meaningful interpretations can be drawn from the data analysis results. The data analysis is discussed in two parts: extraction and classification of data from Twitter using automated sentiment analysis;and qualitative data analysis of a smaller Twitter data sample. Findings: This study found that during the lockdown the majority of users on Twitter shared positive opinions towards the lockdown. The results also found that people are keeping themselves engaged and entertained. Governments around the world have also gained support from Twitter users. This is despite the hardships being faced by citizens. The authors also found a number of users expressing negative sentiments. The results also found that several users on Twitter were fence-sitters and their opinions and emotions could swing either way depending on how the pandemic progresses and what action is taken by governments around the world. Research limitations/implications: The authors add to the body of literature that has examined Twitter discussions around H1N1 using in-depth qualitative methods and conspiracy theories around COVID-19. In the long run, the government can help citizens develop routines that help the community adapt to a new dangerous environment – this has very effectively been shown in the context of wildfires in the context of disaster management. In the context of this research, the dominance of the positive themes within tweets is promising for policymakers and governments around the world. However, sentiments may wish to be monitored going forward as large-spikes in negative sentiment may highlight lockdown-fatigue. Social implications: The psychology of humans during a pandemic can have a profound impact on how COVID-19 shapes up, and this shall also include how people behave with other people and with the larger environment. Lockdowns are the opposite of what societies strive to achieve, i.e. socializing. Originality/value: This study is based on original Twitter data collected during the initial days of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The topic of “lockdowns” and the “COVID-19” pandemic have not been studied together thus far.

METHODS: For this observational cross-sectional study, a web-based survey was distributed via social media forums. We used the validated Hebrew version of the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 followed by a questionnaire developed specifically for the present study, focusing on the time of the COVID-19 pandemic (Mask Sinonasal Outcome Test), and questions regarding general health issues. The participants' mask-wearing routine was also studied. RESULTS: Seventy percent of 351 participants had experienced a change in their breathing during the time of the pandemic. The median total Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 score was 13, and 10% of the participants reported a significantly impaired quality of life. According to multivariate analyses, the only subject-related variables significantly associated with the reduced sinonasal quality of life were female gender, younger age, a background of chronic rhinitis and sinusitis, and the mask-wearing average daily duration. The mask sinonasal outcome test convergent validity was confirmed. CONCLUSION: The majority of our survey's responders, predominantly female and younger participants, reported reduced sinonasal quality of life in the COVID-19 pandemic period. It can be attributed to mask-wearing, especially for a prolonged time, irrespective of the existing mask type. These findings should encourage medical companies to produce more ""airway-minded"" personal protection equipment.","Primov-Fever, Adi; Amir, Ofer; Roziner, Ilan; Maoz-Segal, Ramit; Alon, Eran Emanuel; Yakirevitch, Arkadi",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,632
402424,Risk Assessment of Importation and Local Transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea: Statistical Modeling Approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: Health-care workers constitute a high-risk population for acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Capacity for acute diagnosis via PCR testing was limited for individuals with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial proportion of health-care workers with suspected infection were not tested. We aimed to investigate the performance of point-of-care and laboratory serology assays and their utility in late case identification, and to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. METHODS: We did a prospective multicentre cohort study between April 8 and June 12, 2020, in two phases. Symptomatic health-care workers with mild to moderate symptoms were eligible to participate 14 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, as per the Public Health England (PHE) case definition. Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had not developed PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. In phase 1, two point-of-care lateral flow serological assays, the Onsite CTK Biotech COVID-19 split IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Bitotech, Poway, CA, USA) and the Encode SARS-CoV-2 split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Device (Zhuhai Encode Medical Engineering, Zhuhai, China), were evaluated for performance against a laboratory immunoassay (EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit [Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA]) in 300 samples from health-care workers and 100 pre-COVID-19 negative control samples. In phase 2 (n=6440), serosurveillance was done among 1299 (93·4%) of 1391 health-care workers reporting symptoms, and in a subset of asymptomatic health-care workers (405 [8·0%] of 5049). FINDINGS: There was variation in test performance between the lateral flow serological assays; however, the Encode assay displayed reasonable IgG sensitivity (127 of 136; 93·4% [95% CI 87·8-96·9]) and specificity (99 of 100; 99·0% [94·6-100·0]) among PCR-proven cases and good agreement (282 of 300; 94·0% [91·3-96·7]) with the laboratory immunoassay. By contrast, the Onsite assay had reduced sensitivity (120 of 136; 88·2% [95% CI 81·6-93·1]) and specificity (94 of 100; 94·0% [87·4-97·8]) and agreement (254 of 300; 84·7% [80·6-88·7]). Five (7%) of 70 PCR-positive cases were negative across all assays. Late changes in lateral flow serological assay bands were recorded in 74 (9·3%) of 800 cassettes (35 [8·8%] of 400 Encode assays; 39 [9·8%] of 400 Onsite assays), but only seven (all Onsite assays) of these changes were concordant with the laboratory immunoassay. In phase 2, seroprevalence among the workforce was estimated to be 10·6% (95% CI 7·6-13·6) in asymptomatic health-care workers and 44·7% (42·0-47·4) in symptomatic health-care workers. Seroprevalence across the entire workforce was estimated at 18·0% (95% CI 17·0-18·9). INTERPRETATION: Although a good positive predictive value was observed with both lateral flow serological assays and ELISA, this agreement only occurred if the pre-test probability was modified by a strict clinical case definition. Late development of lateral flow serological assay bands would preclude postal strategies and potentially home testing. Identification of false-negative results among health-care workers across all assays suggest caution in interpretation of IgG results at this stage; for now, testing is perhaps best delivered in a clinical setting, supported by government advice about physical distancing.

410505,The Influence of COVID-19 on Community Disaster Resilience,2021,"BACKGROUND: Humans and viruses have co-evolved for millennia resulting in a complex host genetic architecture. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DRß1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpesvirus 7, (HHV7), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci outside the HLA associated with viral antibody response (P < 5.0 × 10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, and CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for HHV7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P = 5.0 × 10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P = 1.1 × 10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P = 1.1 × 10-8 EBV nuclear antigen. We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, from autoimmune disorders to cancer to neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.","Kachuri, Linda; Francis, Stephen S; Morrison, Maike L; Wendt, George A; Bossé, Yohan; Cavazos, Taylor B; Rashkin, Sara R; Ziv, Elad; Witte, John S",Genome Med,,632

To evaluate the safety of intermediate dose regimens of low-weight molecular heparin (LWMH) in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, particularly in older patients. We retrospectively evaluated 105 hospitalized patients (61 M, 44 F; mean age 73.7 years) treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin: 80 mg/day in normal weight and mild-to-moderate impair or normal renal function; 40 mg/day in severe chronic renal failure or low bodyweight (< 45 kg); 100 mg/day if bodyweight was higher than 100 kg. All the patients had radiologically confirmed pneumonia and 63.8% had severe COVID-19. None of the patients had fatal haemorrhage; two (1.9%) patients had a major bleeding event (one spontaneous hematoma and one gastrointestinal bleeding). Only 6.7% of patients needed transfusions of red blood cells. One thrombotic event (pulmonary embolism) was observed. When compared to younger patients, patients older than 85 years had a higher mortality (40% vs 13.3%), but not an increased risk of bleeding or need for blood transfusion.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether Covid-19-related GT - particularly on ageusia and anosmia - were primarily related to media coverage or with epidemic trends. METHODS: We retrieved GT data for searches on ""coronavirus"", ""cough"", ""anosmia"" and ""ageusia"", plotting them for a period of 5 years. In addition, we analysed the trends of those queries for 17 countries throughout the year of 2020, particularly concerning rises and peaks of searches. For anosmia and ageusia, we assessed whether the respective GT correlated with Covid-19 cases and deaths both throughout 2020 and specifically before March 16, 2020 (i.e., the date when the media started reporting that those symptoms could be associated with Covid-19). RESULTS: Over the last five years, peaks of ""coronavirus"" GT were only observed during the Winter of 2020. Rises and peaks in ""coronavirus"" searches were similar in time in the 17 different assessed countries, irrespectively of their epidemic situation. In 15 of these countries, rises in ""anosmia"" and ""ageusia"" GT occurred in the same week or one week after they were identified in the media as symptoms of Covid-19. Analysing data prior to March 16, 2020, anosmia/ageusia GT were found to have variable correlation with Covid-19 cases and deaths in the different countries.

418001,Exercise behavior and mood during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan: lessons for the future,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of COVID-19 on surgical education has been profound, and clinical learning experiences transitioned to virtual formats. This study investigated the impact of virtual experiences created to facilitate learning during the pandemic for medical students. METHODS: We performed a cohort study to determine the perceived clinical preparedness for medical students enrolled in the preclinical surgery pilot course, surgical Extended Mastery Learning Rotation (EMLR), and longitudinal surgical clerkship (LC). The preclinical surgery pilot course took place before COVID-19 disruptions, and the EMLR and LC experiences took place virtually. Specialty choice was examined in the EMLR and LC cohorts. Performance on the NBME surgical assessments was analyzed among students enrolled in the traditional clerkship and pandemic-disrupted courses and compared to national data using a two-sample t-test. RESULTS: Compared to preclinical students, EMLR and LC students demonstrated improvements in their perceived surgical clerkship readiness. After the 3-week EMLR course, in the setting of completing only one-third of the clerkship year, students had an average NBME Surgical Self-Assessment Exam score of 72 (SD 12), comparable to the national average of 71 (SD 9) pâ¯=â¯0.33. The average shelf exam score for students (Nâ¯=â¯24) enrolled in the traditional clerkship (block 1), prior to COVID-19, disruptions was 66 (SD 9) compared to an average score of 69 (SD 9) for the longitudinal clerkship students (Nâ¯=â¯20) that took the shelf exam later in the year (pâ¯=â¯0.36). COVID-19 disruptions did not affect specialty choice. All LC students have decided on a specialty; 50% nonsurgical and 50% surgical. From the EMLR cohort, 36% and 38% plan to pursue surgical and nonsurgical specialties, respectively, with 26% still undecided. CONCLUSIONS: Courses were well-liked and will be implemented in future clerkships. Surgical educators demonstrated flexibility and creativity in the development of the EMLR. Despite COVID-19 disruptions, medical students made progress in their clinical skills and foundational science knowledge.

419722,A narrative review of factors historically influencing telehealth use across six medical specialties in the United States,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and respiratory characteristics of a cohort of 43 patients with COVID-19 after an evolutive period of 28 days. DESIGN: A prospective, single-center observational study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive care. PATIENTS: Patients admitted due to COVID-19 and respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. VARIABLES: Automatic recording was made of demographic variables, severity parameters, laboratory data, assisted ventilation (HFO: high-flow oxygen therapy and IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation), oxygenation (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2) and complications. The patients were divided into three groups: survivors (G1), deceased (G2) and patients remaining under admission (G3). The chi-squared test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) was used, along with the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon test for analyzing the differences between medians. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included (G1=28 [65.1%]; G2=10 [23.3%] and G3=5 [11.6%]), with a mean age of 65 years (range: 52-72), 62% males, APACHE II 18 (15-24), SOFA 6 (4-7). Arterial hypertension (30.2%) and obesity (25.6%) were the most frequent comorbidities. High-flow oxygen therapy was used in 62.7% of the patients, with failure in 85%. In turn, 95% of the patients required IMV and 85% received ventilation in prone decubitus. In the general population, initial PaO2/FiO2 improved after 7 days (165 [125-210] vs.194 [153-285]; p=0.02), in the same way as in G1 (164 [125-197] vs. 207 [160-294]; p=0.07), but not in G2 (163 [95-197] vs. 135 [85-177]). No bacterial coinfection was observed. The incidence of IMV-associated pneumonia was high (13 episodes/1000 days of IMV). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 require early IMV, a high frequency of ventilation in prone decubitus, and have a high incidence of failed HFO. The lack of improvement of PaO2/FiO2 at 7 days could be a prognostic marker. .","Rodríguez, A; Moreno, G; Gómez, J; Carbonell, R; Picó-Plana, E; Benavent Bofill, C; Sánchez Parrilla, R; Trefler, S; Esteve Pitarch, E; Canadell, L; Teixido, X; Claverias, L; Bodí, M","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,632

The complexity arises from the dioxin and furan molecules with substitutions at positions 2, 3, 7, and 8, which are toxicologically relevant but are not easily separated from the other non-/less toxic congeners. Many regulatory methods require the use of two columns with different polarities or selectivity for dioxin analysis. The most common confirmation column pair is a (5% phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane and a (biscyanopropyl-/ cyanopropylphenyl)-methylpolysiloxane. These phases are required in USEPA-1613 for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran specificity. However, other column phases, such as the Rxi-17SilMS and the Rtx-Dioxin2, offer alternatives to the traditional column pairing and provide a similar or better separation of 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners. This study compares four columns for dioxin analysis: the Rtx-Dioxin2, Rxi-17SilMS, Rxi-5SilMS, and Rtx-2330. All columns used in this study are capable of meeting the requirements for dioxin analysis required by USEPA-1613. However, the Rtx-Dioxin2 demonstrated improved selectivity for a wider range of dioxin compounds than the Rxi-5SilMS. The Rtx-Dioxin2 is capable of resolving 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran from common interferants better than the Rxi-5SilMS and can be used as a confirmation column with either the Rtx-2330 or Rxi-17SilMS.","Stultz, Conner; Dorman, Frank",J Chromatogr A,,632

Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (&#8805; 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak.

This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group and period of the outbreak. METHODS: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time-series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015-May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the period 15 February-15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47 490 [95% empirical confidence intervals (eCIs): 43 984 to 50 362] deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95% eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced increases up to 800% during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. CONCLUSION: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to the implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.","Scortichini, Matteo; Schneider Dos Santos, Rochelle; De039,; Donato, Francesca; De Sario, Manuela; Michelozzi, Paola; Davoli, Marina; Masselot, Pierre; Sera, Francesco; Gasparrini, Antonio",Int. j. epidemiol,,632

We assessed the short-term impact of a COVID-19 immunization program with varying constraints on population health and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) needs. METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 transmission model was calibrated to French epidemiological data. We defined several vaccine implementation scenarios starting in January 2021 based on timing of discontinuation of NPIs, supply and uptake constraints, and their relaxation. We assessed the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations averted, the need for and number of days with NPIs in place over the 2021-2022 period. RESULTS: An immunisation program under constraints could reduce the burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 9-40% if the vaccine prevents against infections. Relaxation of constraints not only reduces further COVID-19 hospitalizations (30-39% incremental reduction), it also allows for NPIs to be discontinued post-2021 (0 days with NPIs in 2022 versus 11 to 125 days for vaccination programs under constraints and 327 in the absence of vaccination). CONCLUSION: For 2021, COVID-19 control is expected to rely on a combination of NPIs and the outcome of early immunisation programs. The ability to overcome supply and uptake constraints will help prevent the need for further NPIs post-2021. As the programs expand, efficiency assessments will be needed to ensure optimisation of control policies post-emergency use.","Coudeville, Laurent; Jollivet, Ombeline; Mahé, Cedric; Chaves, Sandra; Gomez, Gabriela B",PLoS One,,632

Methods: A telephonic survey was conducted with the validated in the Spanish tool Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (Telehealth Usability Questionnaire; rating from 1-7) of all candidate patients assisted consecutively in the Coloproctology Unit. We included demographic variables, education level, job status, diagnosis and consultation type. A descriptive study was done. The relationship between the willingness of consultation model in the future (telemedicine vs traditional) and the categorical variables was analysed through the chi-squared test. Results: A total of 115 patients were included. The average age was 59.9 years, being 60% women. The average score in each of the survey items was higher than 6 in all the questions but 1. 26.1% of the surveyed patients confessed being advocated to tele-assistance in the future. The only factors related to greater willingness to tele-assistance were male gender (37% vs 18.8%; P = .03) and a higher academic preparation level in favour of higher technical studies (35.9%) and university studies (32.4%) opposite to the rest (P = .043). The rest of variables studied, job status, labour regimen, diagnostic group and consultation type did not show any relationship.

432051,A Transdisciplinary Analysis of COVID-19 in Italy: The Most Affected Country in Europe,2020,"Cell death mechanisms are crucial to maintain an appropriate environment for the functionality of healthy cells. However, during viral infections, dysregulation of these processes can be present and can participate in the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. In this review, we describe some features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and some immunopathogenic mechanisms characterizing the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Lymphopenia and monocytopenia are important contributors to COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. The fine mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still unknown, and several hypotheses have been raised, some of which assign a role to cell death as far as the reduction of specific types of immune cells is concerned. Thus, we discuss three major pathways such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, and suggest that all of them likely occur simultaneously in COVID-19 patients. We describe that SARS-CoV-2 can have both a direct and an indirect role in inducing cell death. Indeed, on the one hand, cell death can be caused by the virus entry into cells, on the other, the excessive concentration of cytokines and chemokines, a process that is known as a COVID-19-related cytokine storm, exerts deleterious effects on circulating immune cells. However, the overall knowledge of these mechanisms is still scarce and further studies are needed to delineate new therapeutic strategies.","Paolini, Annamaria; Borella, Rebecca; De Biasi, Sara; Neroni, Anita; Mattioli, Marco; Lo Tartaro, Domenico; Simonini, Cecilia; Franceschini, Laura; Cicco, Gerolamo; Piparo, Anna Maria; Cossarizza, Andrea; Gibellini, Lara",,,632

During a very complex and confusing time, in which public health services in multiple countries have been completely overwhelmed, and in some cases even collapsed, these first-line household responses have been quintessential for building physical, mental, and social resilience, and for improving individual and community health. This editorial discusses the outcomes of a rapid-response preliminary survey during the first phase of the pandemic among social and community contacts in five metropolises heavily affected by the COVID-19 health crisis (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York, and Rio de Janeiro), and in twelve rural areas or countries initially less affected by the pandemic (Appalachia, Jamaica, Bolivia, Romania, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Georgia, Turkey, Pakistan, Cambodia, and South Africa). We summarized our perspectives as 17 case studies, observing that people have relied primarily on teas and spices (""food-medicines"") and that there exist clear international plant favorites, popularized by various new media. Urban diasporas and rural households seem to have repurposed homemade plant-based remedies that they use in normal times for treating the flu and other respiratory symptoms or that they simply consider healthy foods. The most remarkable shift in many areas has been the increased consumption of ginger and garlic, followed by onion, turmeric, and lemon.

439805,Time trends in racial/ethnic differences in covid-19 infection and mortality,2021,"The interaction between nutrition and human infectious diseases has always been recognized. With the emergence of molecular tools and post-genomics, high-resolution sequencing technologies, the gut microbiota has been emerging as a key moderator in the complex interplay between nutrients, human body, and infections. Much of the host-microbial and nutrition research is currently based on animals or simplistic in vitro models. Although traditional in vivo and in vitro models have helped to develop mechanistic hypotheses and assess the causality of the host-microbiota interactions, they often fail to faithfully recapitulate the complexity of the human nutrient-microbiome axis in gastrointestinal homeostasis and infections. Over the last decade, remarkable progress in tissue engineering, stem cell biology, microfluidics, sequencing technologies, and computing power has taken place, which has produced a new generation of human-focused, relevant, and predictive tools. These tools, which include patient-derived organoids, organs-on-a-chip, computational analyses, and models, together with multi-omics readouts, represent novel and exciting equipment to advance the research into microbiota, infectious diseases, and nutrition from a human-biology-based perspective. After considering some limitations of the conventional in vivo and in vitro approaches, in this review, we present the main novel available and emerging tools that are suitable for designing human-oriented research.","Cassotta, Manuela; Forbes-Hernández, Tamara Yuliett; Calderón Iglesias, Ruben; Ruiz, Roberto; Elexpuru Zabaleta, Maria; Giampieri, Francesca; Battino, Maurizio",Nutrients,,632
442221,Assessment of the Consultation Rate with General Practitioners in the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shed a spotlight on the resilience of healthcare systems, and their ability to cope efficiently and effectively with unexpected crises. If we are to learn one economic lesson from the pandemic, arguably it is the perils of an overfocus on short-term allocative efficiency at the price of lack of capacity to deal with uncertain future challenges. In normal times, building spare capacity with 'option value' into health systems may seem inefficient, the costs potentially exceeding the benefits. Yet the fatal weakness of not doing so is that this can leave health systems highly constrained when dealing with unexpected, but ultimately inevitable, shocks-such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the pandemic has highlighted the potentially enormous option value of biomedical research infrastructure. We illustrate this with reference to COVID-19 response work supported by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. As the world deals with the fallout from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, pressure will soon come to review government expenditure, including research funding. Developing a framework to fully account for option value, and understanding the public appetite to pay for it, should allow us to be better prepared for the next emerging problem.","Roope, Laurence S J; Candio, Paolo; Kiparoglou, Vasiliki; McShane, Helen; Duch, Raymond; Clarke, Philip M",Health Res Policy Syst,,632

445788,Information on COVID-19 and psychological distress in a sample of non-health workers during the pandemic period,2020,"Purpose: A serious global public health emergency (GPHE) like the COVID-19 aggravates the inequilibrium of medical care and other critical resources between wealthy and poor nations, which, coupled with the collision of cultures, indicates the vital need for developing humanitarian knowledge transcending cultures. Given the scarcity of literature addressing such unprecedent issues, this paper thus proposes new, unconventional viewpoints and future themes at the intersection of knowledge management (KM) and humanitarian inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is conceptual in nature. The data of the World Bank and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are analysed to introduce some emerging real impact topics regarding cross-cultural conflicts and humanitarian knowledge in the post-COVID business world. The theoretical foundation was built upon a critical literature review. Findings: This paper synthesizes the perspectives of culture, KM and the humanistic philosophy to distil the core component of cultural intelligence and comparatively and thereby illuminating why cross-cultural metacognition acts as a priori for achieving cosmopolitan humanitarian knowledge. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides profound implications to academics by highlighting the importance to formulating new, inter-disciplinary themes or unorthodox, phenomenon-driven assumptions beyond the traditional KM domain. This paper also offers practitioners and policymakers valuable insights into coping with the growing disparity between high- and low-income countries by showing warning signs of a looming humanitarian crisis associated with a GPHE context. Originality/value: This paper does not aim to claim the birth of a new domain but call for more research on developing a normative theory of humanitarian knowledge as transcendence of cultures. It implies uncharted territories of great interest and potential for the real impact KM community. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Chin, T.; Meng, J.; Wang, S.; Shi, Y.; Zhang, J.",Journal of Knowledge Management,,632
445789,Information on COVID-19 and Psychological Distress in a Sample of Non-Health Workers during the Pandemic Period,2020,"Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At the time of conducting this study, it had recorded over 11,301,850 confirmed cases while more than 531,806 have died due to it, with these figures rising daily across the globe. The burden of this highly contagious respiratory disease is that it presents itself in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patterns in those already infected, thereby leading to an exponential rise in the number of contractions of the disease and fatalities. It is, therefore, crucial to expedite the process of early detection and diagnosis of the disease across the world. The case-based reasoning (CBR) model is a compelling paradigm that allows for the utilization of case-specific knowledge previously experienced, concrete problem situations or specific patient cases for solving new cases. This study, therefore, aims to leverage the very rich database of cases of COVID-19 to solve new cases. The approach adopted in this study employs the use of an improved CBR model for state-of-the-art reasoning task in the classification of suspected cases of COVID-19. The CBR model leverages on a novel feature selection and the semantic-based mathematical model proposed in this study for case similarity computation. An initial population of the archive was achieved from 71 (67 adults and 4 pediatrics) cases obtained from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) repository. Results obtained revealed that the proposed approach in this study successfully classified suspected cases into their categories with an accuracy of 94.54%. The study found that the proposed model can support physicians to easily diagnose suspected cases of COVID-19 based on their medical records without subjecting the specimen to laboratory tests. As a result, there will be a global minimization of contagion rate occasioned by slow testing and in addition, reduced false-positive rates of diagnosed cases as observed in some parts of the globe.","Oyelade, Olaide N.; Ezugwu, Absalom E.",Inform.

Patients who have coronary heart disease have been identified as highly vulnerable with increased morbidity and mortality while suffering from COVID-19. In addition, patients with coronary heart disease are also suffering with clinically significant stress. Stress can cause the body to release hormones that will make heart to beat faster. Aim: This study aims to determine the relationship between the stress level of COVID-19 pandemic and frequency of relapse in patients with coronary heart disease. Methodology: The design of this study was cross-sectional which involved accidental sampling technique with descriptive analytic method, using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) instrument as independent variable and one-question questionnaire as dependent variable. The study was conducted at Indonesian Red Cross Hospital in Bogor City with a total sample of 33 coronary heart disease patients. The data analysis techniques used were univariate and bivariate with Kendall’s Tau statistical test.

As low-molecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand- and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro. We further searched for low-molecular-weight drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores with enhanced inhibiting activity, e.g., carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, emedastine, and omeprazole, in which omeprazole is the only one binding to the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low-molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.","Gao, Jia; Zhang, Liang; Liu, Xiaodan; Li, Fudong; Ma, Rongsheng; Zhu, Zhongliang; Zhang, Jiahai; Wu, Jihui; Shi, Yunyu; Pan, Yueyin; Ge, Yushu; Ruan, Ke",J Phys Chem Lett,,632

Understanding the underlying mechanism and the prognostic value of this symptom will help better manage patients. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-1, may likely spread to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory nerve, a known gateway for respiratory neurotropic viruses. We hypothesise that sudden loss of smell due to COVID-19 is the consequence of a protective host defence mechanism involving apoptosis of olfactory receptor neurons. Sacrificing smelling over neuroprotection is a logical strategy, even more so as olfaction is the only sense with the ability to regenerate in adults. Induced apoptosis of olfactory neurons has been shown in mice, successfully preventing neuroinvasion. On the other hand, adult olfactory neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated in part by the immune system, allowing to restore olfactory function. Understanding anosmia as part of a defence mechanism would support the concept of sudden anosmia as being a positive prognostic factor in the short term. Also, it may orient research to investigate the risk of future neurodegenerative disease linked to persisting coronavirus in neurons.","Le Bon, S D; Horoi, M",Med Hypotheses,,632

466002,Regulation and Trust: 3-Month Follow-up Study on COVID-19 Mortality in 25 European Countries,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia of uncertain cause has been reported in Wuhan, China since the beginning of early December 2019. In early January 2020, a novel strain of ß-coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from the pharyngeal swab specimens of patients, which was recently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is evidence of human-to-human transmission and familial cluster outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The World Health Organization(WHO) recently declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic a global health emergency. As of February 17, 2020, 71329 laboratory-confirmed cases (in 25 countries, including the United States and Germany) have been reported globally. Other than its rapid transmission, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear. In December 2019, coronavirus disease (named COVID-19 by the WHO) associated with the SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China and spread quickly across the country. AIM: To analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of this disease in Liaoning province, a Chinese region about 1800 km north of Wuhan. METHODS: The clinical data of 56 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases due to 2019-nCoV infection were analyzed. The cases originated from eight cities in Liaoning province. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 45 years, and 57.1% of them were male. No patient had been in direct contact with wild animals. Among them, 23 patients (41.1%) had resided in or traveled to Wuhan, 27 cases (48.2%) had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients, 5 cases (8.9%) had been in contact with confirmed patients with a contact history to COVID-19 patients, and 1 case (1.8%) had no apparent history of exposure. Fever (75.0%) and cough (60.7%) were the most common symptoms. The typical manifestations in lung computed tomography (CT) included ground-glass opacity and patchy shadows, with 67.8% of them being bilateral. Among the patients in the cohort, 78.6% showed reduction in their lymphocyte counts, 57.1% showed increases in their C-reactive protein levels, and 50.0% showed decreases in their blood albumin levels. Eleven patients (19.6%) were admitted to intensive care unit, 2 patients (3.5%) progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, 4 patients (7.1%) were equipped with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1 patient (1.8) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. There were 5 mild cases (5/56, 8.9%), 40 moderate cases (40/56, 71.4%), 10 severe cases (10/56, 17.9%), and 1 critical case (1/56, 1.8%). No deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted among humans. Most COVID-19 patients show symptoms of fever, cough, lymphocyte reduction, and typical lung CT manifestations. Most are moderate cases. The seriousness of the disease (as indicated by blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, oxygenation index, blood lymphocyte count, and lesions shown in lung CT) is related to history of living in or traveling to Wuhan, underlying diseases, admittance to intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilation.","Wang, Jing-Bo; Wang, Hai-Tao; Wang, Lei-Shi; Li, Lu-Ping; Xv, Jiao; Xv, Chun; Li, Xing-Hai; Wu, Yun-Hai; Liu, Hong-Yan; Li, Bai-Jun; Yu, Hong; Tian, Xia; Zhang, Zhi-Yu; Wang, Yan; Zhao, Rui; Liu, Jin-Yang; Wang, Wei; Gu, Ye",World J Clin Cases,,632

Although being in proximity to China, the original epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, Taiwan has maintained a low number of COVID-19 cases despite its close social ties and heavy traffic between Taiwan and China. Containment strategies executed by the Taiwanese government have attracted global attention. Similarly, in-hospital settings, high alertness and swift responses to the changing outbreak situation are necessary to ensure hospital staff members' safety so they can continue to save patients' lives. Herein, we present infection control measures that can be adopted in hospital settings that were executed in a Taiwanese hospital to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, including emergency preparedness and responses from the hospital administration, education, surveillance, patient flow arrangement, the partition of hospital zones, and the prevention of a systemic shutdown by using the ""divided cabin, divided flow"" strategy. The measures implemented by a Taiwan hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic may not be universally applicable in every hospital. Nonetheless, the presented infection control methods have been practically executed and can be referenced or modified to fit each hospital's unique condition.","Chang, Ya-Ting; Lin, Chun-Yu; Tsai, Ming-Ju; Hung, Ching-Tzu; Hsu, Chia-Wen; Lu, Po-Liang; Hou, Ming-Feng",Kaohsiung J Med Sci,,632
469592,Identifying and Implementing Strategies to Reduce the Risk of Self-Contamination of Health Care Workers Caused by Doffing of Personal Protective Equipment During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"In December 2019, the novel betacoronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 has since become a pandemic virus resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and deep socioeconomic implications worldwide. In recent months, efforts have been directed towards detecting, tracking, and better understanding human humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has become critical to develop robust and reliable serological assays to characterize the abundance, neutralization efficiency, and duration of antibodies in virus-exposed individuals. Here we review the latest knowledge on humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with the benefits and limitations of currently available commercial and laboratory-based serological assays. We also highlight important serological considerations, such as antibody expression levels, stability and neutralization dynamics, as well as cross-reactivity and possible immunological back-boosting by seasonal coronaviruses. The ability to accurately detect, measure and characterize the various antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for vaccine development, manage risk and exposure for healthcare and at-risk workers, and for monitoring reinfections with genetic variants and new strains of the virus. Having a thorough understanding of the benefits and cautions of standardized serological testing at a community level remains critically important in the design and implementation of future vaccination campaigns, epidemiological models of immunity, and public health measures that rely heavily on up-to-date knowledge of transmission dynamics.","Galipeau, Yannick; Greig, Matthew; Liu, George; Driedger, Matt; Langlois, Marc-André",Front Immunol,,632

470944,Misinformation of COVID-19 on the Internet: Infodemiology Study,2020,"Abstract Polymer matrix composite materials have the capacity to aid the indirect transmission of viral diseases. Published research shows that respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19), can attach to polymer substrata as a result of being contacted by airborne droplets resulting from infected people sneezing or coughing in close proximity. Polymer matrix composites are used to produce a wide range of products that are ?high-touch? surfaces, such as sporting goods, laptop computers and household fittings, and these surfaces can be readily contaminated by pathogens. This article reviews published research on the retention of SARS-CoV-2 and other virus types on plastics. The factors controlling the viral retention time on plastic surfaces are examined and the implications for viral retention on polymer composite materials are discussed. Potential strategies that can be used to impart antiviral properties to polymer composite surfaces are evaluated. These strategies include modification of the surface composition with biocidal agents (e.g., antiviral polymers and nanoparticles) and surface nanotexturing. The potential application of these surface modification strategies in the creation of antiviral polymer composite surfaces is discussed, which opens up an exciting new field of research for composite materials.","Mouritz, Adrian P.; Galos, Joel Linklater Denver P.; Ladani, Raj B.; Kandare, Everson Crawford Russell J.; Ivanova, Elena P.",Nano Select,,632

472876,Performance of fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis of emergency system in covid-19 pandemic. An extensive narrative review,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diarrhea was not uncommon in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the significance remains undetermined. METHODS: This retrospective study included 157 diarrhea cases form 564 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 29, 2020. Clinical characteristics, the course and the outcome of patients with diarrhea were analyzed. The correlation between diarrhea and fecal presence of coronavirus was also determined. RESULTS: The overall morbidity of diarrhea was 27.8% (157/564) in COVID-19 patients. Among them, 38 cases presented only with diarrhea, and 119 cases in both diarrhea and respiratory symptoms. Patients with diarrhea and respiratory symptoms had higher levels of inflammatory activity, longer hospital stay (27.5 vs. 23.0 vs. 22.0 days, p = .029) and higher odds ratio of mortality (3.2 times and 2.2 times, respectively) than those with diarrhea only or respiratory symptoms only. However, patients with diarrhea had longer time from onset to admission (14.5 days vs. 11.0 days, p = .04), higher positive viral RNA in stool (80.0% vs. 52.4%, p = .016) than those with both diarrhea and respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea caused by high enteric viral burden may lead to long course and poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. The patients with diarrhea and respiratory symptoms were prone to serious condition, and had worse outcomes. However, the patients with diarrhea alone showed mild illness but delayed health-seeking.","Shang, Haitao; Bai, Tao; Chen, Yuhua; Huang, Chao; Zhang, Shengyan; Yang, Pengcheng; Zhang, Lei; Hou, Xiaohua",Scand J Gastroenterol,,632

Here, a polydopamine (PDA)-coated substrate was used to scavenge extracellular ROS for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) expansion. The PDA-coated substrate could reduce the oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in replicative senescent MSCs. The expression of senescence-associated ß-galactosidase of MSCs from three human donors (both bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived) was suppressed on PDA. The MSCs on the PDA-coated substrate showed a lower level of interleukin 6 (IL-6), one of the senescence-associated inflammatory components. Cellular senescence-specific genes, such as p53 and p21, were downregulated on the PDA-coated substrate, while the stemness-related gene, OCT4, was upregulated. The PDA-coated substrate strongly promoted the proliferation rate of MSCs, while the stem cell character and differentiation potential were retained. Large-scale expansion of stem cells would greatly benefit from the PDA-coated substrate.","Deng, Zijun; Wang, Weiwei; Xu, Xun; Nie, Yan; Liu, Yue; Gould, Oliver E C; Ma, Nan; Lendlein, Andreas",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,632

We predicted different B-cell and T-cell epitopes by using the Immune Epitopes Database (IEDB). Homology modeling of the construct was done using SWISS-MODEL and then docked with different toll-like-receptors (TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8) using PatchDock, HADDOCK, and FireDock, respectively. From the overlapped epitopes, we designed five vaccine constructs C1–C5. Based on antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, different physiochemical properties, and molecular docking scores, we selected the vaccine construct 1 (C1) for further processing. Docking of C1 with TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8 showed striking interactions with global binding energy of −43.48, −65.88, and −60.24 Kcal/mol, respectively. The docked complex was further simulated, which revealed that both molecules remain stable with minimum RMSF. Activation of TLRs induces downstream pathways to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines against viruses and immune system simulation shows enhanced antibody production after the booster dose. In conclusion, C1 was the best vaccine candidate among all designed constructs to elicit an immune response SARS-CoV-2 and combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).","Rahman, Noor; Ali, Fawad; Basharat, Zarrin; Shehroz, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Kazim; Jeandet, Philippe; Nepovimova, Eugenie; Kuca, Kamil; Khan, Haroon",Vaccines,,632

However, the prevalence of mental health problems in frontline medical staff after fighting COVID-19 is still unknown. METHODS: Medical workers in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province were invited to participate a cross-sectional and convenience sampling online survey, which assessed the prevalence of anxiety, insomnia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: A total of 1,091 responses (33% male and 67% female) were valid for statistical analysis. The prevalence was anxiety 53%, insomnia 79%, depression 56%, and PTSD 11%. Healthcare workers in Wuhan were more likely to face risks of anxiety (56% vs. 52%, P = 0.03) and PTSD (15% vs. 9%, P = 0.03) than those in other cities of Hubei. In terms of educational attainment, those with doctoral and masters' (D/M) degrees may experience more anxiety (median of 7.0, [interquartile range (IQR) 2.0-8.5] vs. median 5.0 [IQR 5.0-8.0], P = 0.02) and PTSD (median 26.0 [IQR 19.5-33.0] vs. median 23.0 [IQR 19.0-31.0], P = 0.04) than those with lower educational degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The mental problems were an important issue for the healthcare workers after COVID-19.

482756,The Influence of COVID-19 Isolation on Physical Activity Habits and Its Relationship with Convergence Insufficiency,2020,"Purpose: One cause of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is inactivity. This study analyzed the prevalence of MetS due to causes of activity limitation (AL) in adults over 40 years old. Paticipants and Methods: Participants included 2885 people aged 40-79 (1198 men and 1687 women) who completed the Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey (KNHANES) conducted between 2013 and 2017. They were divided into two groups based on age: the middle age group (MA) included 1148 total participants, 515 men and 633 women from 40-59 years old; the older age group (OA) included 1737 total participants, 683 men and 1054 women from 60-79 years old. MetS was diagnosed according to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program and the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP-ATP III). Logistic regression was conducted to calculate the odds ratio for MetS prevalence. Results: The prevalence of MetS in people with AL increased 1.432-fold in the MA men group, 1.511-fold in the OA men group, 1.546-fold in the MA women group, and 1.565-fold in the OA women group. There were several causes of AL; people with physical activity for diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased MetS prevalence in both sexes and all age groups: MA men group (OR=3.216, 95% CI=1.852-7.354, P=0.034), MA women group (OR=2.159, 95% CI=1.854-5.346, P=0.032), OA men group (OR=3.200, 95% CI=1.235-7.841, P=0.009), and OA women group (OR=3.444, 95% CI=1.310-6.627, P=0.008). Also, mental problems in the MA men group (OR=2.284, 95% CI=1.591-4.986, P=0.012) and OA men group (OR=1.149, 95% CI=1.017-2.941, P=0.012), and musculoskeletal problems in the MA women group (OR=1.784, 95% CI=1.102-2.902, P=0.021) and OA women group (OR=1.459, 95% CI=1.054-1.993, P=0.004) increased the prevalence. Conclusion: The prevalence of MetS due to activity limitation was increased in MA and OA groups. Activity limitation increased the MetS prevalence from 1.4- to 1.5-times, Therefore, to prevent metabolic syndrome, physical activity should be increased, and guidelines should be presented according to the activity limitation causes, age, and sex.","Lee, Kyujin; Ko, Duk Han; Lee, Ji Young",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,,632
484689,Assessing Delivery of Selected Public Health Operations via Essential Public Health Operation Framework,2020,"BACKGROUND: MYRIAD (My Resilience in Adolescence) is a superiority, parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial designed to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a mindfulness training (MT) programme, compared with normal social and emotional learning (SEL) school provision to enhance mental health, social-emotional-behavioural functioning and well-being in adolescence. The original trial protocol was published in Trials (accessible at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-1917-4 ). This included recruitment in two cohorts, enabling the learning from the smaller first cohort to be incorporated in the second cohort. Here we describe final amendments to the study protocol and discuss their underlying rationale. METHODS: Four major changes were introduced into the study protocol: (1) there were changes in eligibility criteria, including a clearer operational definition to assess the degree of SEL implementation in schools, and also new criteria to avoid experimental contamination; (2) the number of schools and pupils that had to be recruited was increased based on what we learned in the first cohort; (3) some changes were made to the secondary outcome measures to improve their validity and ability to measure constructs of interest and to reduce the burden on school staff; and (4) the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic both influences and makes it difficult to interpret the 2-year follow-up primary endpoint results, so we changed our primary endpoint to 1-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: These changes to the study protocol were approved by the Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Committee and Data and Ethics Monitoring Committees and improved the enrolment of participants and quality of measures. Furthermore, the change in the primary endpoint will give a more reliable answer to our primary question because it was collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in both cohort 1 and cohort 2. Nevertheless, the longer 2-year follow-up data will still be acquired, although this time-point will be now framed as a second major investigation to answer some new important questions presented by the combination of the pandemic and our study design.

Traditional anticorrosion methods including sacrificial anodes or protective coatings have performance limitations. Here, we report atomically thin, polycrystalline few-layer graphene (FLG) grown by chemical vapor deposition as a long-term protective coating film for copper (Cu). A six-year old, FLG-protected Cu is visually shiny and detailed material characterizations capture no sign of oxidation. The success of the durable anticorrosion film depends on the misalignment of grain boundaries between adjacent graphene layers. Theoretical calculations further found that corrosive molecules always encounter extremely high energy barrier when diffusing through the FLG layers. Therefore, the FLG is able to prevent the corrosive molecules from reaching the underlying Cu surface. This work highlights the interesting structures of polycrystalline FLG and sheds insight into the atomically thin coatings for various applications.","Zhao, Zhijuan; Hou, Tianyu; Wu, Nannan; Jiao, Shuping; Zhou, Ke; Yin, Jun; Suk, Ji Won; Cui, Xu; Zhang, Mingfei; Li, Shaopeng; Qu, Yan; Xie, Weiguang; Li, Xi-Bo; Zhao, Chuanxi; Fu, Yong; Hong, Rong-Dun; Guo, Shengshi; Lin, Dingqu; Cai, Weiwei; Mai, Wenjie; Luo, Zhengtang; Tian, Yongtao; Lai, Yun; Liu, Yuanyue; Colombo, Luigi; Hao, Yufeng",Nano lett,,632

Recently, using a multi-omics-based strategy, we predicted potential drugs for COVID-19 with â¼70% accuracy. Herein, using a novel multi-omics-based bioinformatic approach and three ways of analysis, we identified the symptoms, comorbid conditions, and short-, mid-, and possible long-term complications of COVID-19 with >90% precision including 27 parent, 170 child, and 403 specific conditions. Among the specific conditions, 36 viral, 53 short-term, 62 short-mid-long-term, 194 mid-long-term, and 57 congenital conditions are identified. At a threshold ""count of occurrence"" of 4, we found that 83-100% (average 92.67%) of enriched conditions are associated with COVID-19. Except for dry cough and loss of taste, all the other COVID-19-associated mild and severe symptoms are enriched. CVDs, and pulmonary, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, kidney, liver, and immune system disorders are top comorbid conditions. Specific diseases like myocardial infarction, hypertension, COPD, lung injury, diabetes, cirrhosis, mood disorders, dementia, macular degeneration, chronic kidney disease, lupus, arthritis, etc. along with several other NCDs were found to be top candidates. Interestingly, many cancers and congenital disorders associated with COVID-19 severity are also identified. Arthritis, gliomas, diabetes, psychiatric disorders, and CVDs having a bidirectional relationship with COVID-19 are also identified as top conditions. Based on our accuracy (>90%), the long-term presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human, and our ""genetic remittance"" assumption, we hypothesize that all the identified top-ranked conditions could be potential long-term consequences in COVID-19 survivors, warranting long-term observational studies.","Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; Andrade, Bruno Silva; Weener, Marianna E; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Azevedo, Vasco; Ghosh, Preetam; Blum, Kenneth; Ganguly, Nirmal Kumar",Mol Omics,,632

METHODS: This is an epidemiological mathematical modeling study conducted to analyze the dynamics of the accumulated cases of COVID-19, which used a logistic growth model that adds a term of withdrawal of individuals as a control measure. Three possible COVID-19 propagation scenarios were simulated based on three different rates of withdrawal of individuals. They were adjusted with real data of the infected and measures of control over the population. RESULTS: The lockdown would be the best scenario, with a lower incidence of infected people, when compared to the other measures. The number of infected people would grow slowly over the months, and the number of symptomatic individuals in this scenario would be 40,265 cases. We noticed that the State of Sergipe is still in the initial stage of the disease in the scenarios. It was possible to observe that the peak of cases and the equilibrium, in the current situation of social isolation, will occur when reaching the new support capacity, at the end of August in approximately 1,171,353 infected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We established that lockdown is the intervention with the highest ability to mitigate the spread of the virus among the population.","Góis, Aédson Nascimento; Laureano, Estevão Esmi; Santos, David da Silva; Sánchez, Daniel Eduardo; Souza, Luiz Fernando; Vieira, Rita de Cássia Almeida; Oliveira, Jussiely Cunha; Santana-Santos, Eduesley",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0417-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111916/,632

The widespread use of macrolides is increasing resistance rates to these antibiotics. Molecular tools can help in diagnosis, typing and resistance detection, leading to better patient management. OBJECTIVES: To assess the MP genotypes and resistance pattern circulating in our area while comparing serological and molecular diagnosis of MP. METHODS: Molecular and serological diagnosis of MP was performed in 821 samples collected in Badalona (Barcelona, Spain) from 2013 to 2017. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and macrolide resistance detection by pyrosequencing were performed in those cases positive by PCR. Presence of respiratory viruses and relevant clinical data were also recorded. RESULTS: MP was detected in 16.8% of cases by PCR, with an overall agreement with serology of 76%. Eleven different MLVA types were identified, with 4-5-7-2 (50.1%) and 3-5-6-2 (29.2%) being the most abundant, with the latter showing a seasonal increase during the study. A total of 8% of the strains harboured a point substitution associated with macrolide resistance, corresponding mainly to an A2063G 23S rRNA mutation and directly related to previous macrolide therapy. Analysis of respiratory viruses showed viral coinfections in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Serological and molecular tools combined could improve MP diagnosis and the analysis of its infection patterns. Macrolide resistance is associated with previous therapy. Given that MP pneumonia usually resolves spontaneously, it should be reconsidered whether antibiotic treatment is suitable for all cases.","Rivaya, Belén; Jordana-Lluch, Elena; Fernández-Rivas, Gema; Molinos, Sònia; Campos, Roi; Méndez-Hernández, María; Matas, Lurdes",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32653897/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaa256,632

However, there are a number of cases, in which epidemiological, historical, or genomic evidence suggests much older viral origins than those obtained via molecular dating. We demonstrate how pervasive purifying selection can mask the ancient origins of recently sampled pathogens, in part due to the inability of nucleotide-based substitution models to properly account for complex patterns of spatial and temporal variability in selective pressures. We use codon-based substitution models to infer the length of branches in viral phylogenies; these models produce estimates that are often considerably longer than those obtained with traditional nucleotide-based substitution models. Correcting the apparent underestimation of branch lengths suggests substantially older origins for measles, Ebola, and avian influenza viruses. This work helps to reconcile some of the inconsistencies between molecular dating and other types of evidence concerning the age of viral lineages.","Wertheim, Joel O.; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L.",Molecular Biology and Evolution,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21705379/; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/28/12/3355/13644771/msr170.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr170,632

Pandemic-related stress experienced by mothers during pregnancy may act as an early risk factor for infants' regulatory capacity development by altering maternal psychosocial well-being (e.g., increased anxiety, reduced social support) and caregiving environment (e.g., greater parenting stress, impaired mother-infant bonding). The aim of the present longitudinal study was to assess the consequences of pandemic-related prenatal stress on infants' regulatory capacity. A sample of 163 mother-infant dyads was enrolled at eight maternity units in northern Italy. They provided complete data about prenatal stress, perceived social support, postnatal anxiety symptoms, parenting stress, mother-infant bonding, and infants' regulatory capacity at 3 months of age. Women who experienced emotional stress and received partial social support during pregnancy reported higher anxious symptoms. Moreover, maternal postnatal anxiety was indirectly linked to the infants' regulatory capacity at 3 months, mediated by parenting stress and mother-infant bonding. Dedicated preventive interventions should be delivered to mothers and should be focused on protecting the mother-infant dyad from the detrimental effects of pandemic-related stress during the COVID-19 healthcare emergency.","Provenzi, Livio; Grumi, Serena; Altieri, Lilia; Bensi, Giulia; Bertazzoli, Emanuela; Biasucci, Giacomo; Cavallini, Anna; Decembrino, Lidia; Falcone, Rossana; Freddi, Anna; Gardella, Barbara; Giacchero, Roberta; Giorda, Roberto; Grossi, Elena; Guerini, Paola; Magnani, Maria Luisa; Martelli, Paola; Motta, Mario; Nacinovich, Renata; Pantaleo, Dario; Pisoni, Camilla; Prefumo, Federico; Riva, Laura; Scelsa, Barbara; Spartà, Maria V; Spinillo, Arsenio; Vergani, Patrizia; Orcesi, Simona; Borgatti, Renato",Development and psychopathology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579421000766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210369/,632

646828,Collateral Crises of Gun Preparation and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiology Study,2020-05-28,"Widespread misinformation about COVID-19 poses a significant threat to citizens long-term health and the combating of the disease. To fight the spread of misinformation, Chinese governments have used official social media accounts to participate in fact-checking activities. This study aims to investigate why citizens share fact-checks about COVID-19 and how to promote this activity. Based on the elaboration likelihood model, we explore the effects of peripheral cues (social media capital, social media strategy, media richness, and source credibility) and central cues (content theme and content importance) on the number of shares of fact-checks posted by official Chinese Government social media accounts. In total, 820 COVID-19 fact-checks from 413 Chinese Government Sina Weibo accounts were obtained and evaluated. Results show that both peripheral and central cues play important roles in the sharing of fact-checks. For peripheral cues, social media capital and media richness significantly promote the number of shares. Compared with the push strategy, both the pull strategy and networking strategy facilitate greater fact-check sharing. Fact-checks posted by Central Government social media accounts receive more shares than local government accounts. For central cues, content importance positively predicts the number of shares. In comparison to fact-checks about the latest COVID-19 news, government actions received fewer shares, while social conditions received more shares.","Chen, Qiang; Zhang, Yangyi; Evans, Richard; Min, Chen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639361/,632

During construction of an infectious clone from a Vero cell-adapted coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), we found that a G–C point mutation at nucleotide position 15526, causing Arg-to-Pro mutation at amino acid position 132 of the helicase protein, is lethal to the infectivity of IBV on Vero cells. When the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing this mutation were introduced into Vero cells, no infectious virus was rescued. Upon correction of the mutation, infectious virus was recovered. Further characterization of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing the G15526C mutation demonstrated that this mutation may block the transcription of subgenomic RNAs. Substitution mutation of the Arg132 residue to a positively charged amino acid Lys affected neither the infectivity of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts nor the growth properties of the rescued virus. However, mutation of the Arg132 residue to Leu, a conserved residue in other coronaviruses at the same position, reduced the recovery rate of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts. The recovered mutant virus showed much smaller-sized plaques. On the contrary, a G–C and a G–A point mutations at nucleotide positions 4330 and 9230, respectively, causing Glu–Gln and Gly–Glu mutations in or near the catalytic centers of the papain-like (Nsp3) and 3C-like (Nsp5) proteinases, did not show detectable detrimental effect on the rescue of infectious viruses and the infectivity of the rescued viruses.","Fang, Shouguo; Chen, Bo; Tay, Felicia P.L.; Ng, Beng Sern; Liu, Ding Xing",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16979681/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206005745; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206005745,632
664831,A Web- and App-Based Connected Care Solution for COVID-19 In- and Outpatient Care: Qualitative Study and Application Development,2020-06-01,"We aimed to examine the circulating microRNA (miRNA) profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and evaluate its potential as a source of biomarkers for the management of the disease. This was an observational and multicenter study that included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-June 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care and patients admitted to the ICU. An additional study was completed including ICU nonsurvivors and survivors. Plasma miRNA profiling was performed using RT-qPCR. Predictive models were constructed using LASSO regression. Ten circulating miRNAs were dysregulated in ICU patients compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-451a and miR-486-5p) that distinguishes between ICU and ward patients [AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. Among critically ill patients, six miRNAs were downregulated between nonsurvivors and survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs (miR-192-5p and miR-323a-3p) differentiated ICU nonsurvivors from survivors [AUC (95% CI) = 0.80 (0.64-0.96)]. The discriminatory potential of the signature was higher than that observed for laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts, CRP or D-dimer [maximum AUC (95% CI) for these variables = 0.73 (0.55-0.92)]. miRNA levels were correlated with the duration of ICU stay. Specific circulating miRNA profiles are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Plasma miRNA signatures emerge as a novel tool to assist in the early prediction of vital status deterioration among ICU patients.","de Gonzalo-Calvo, David; Benítez, Iván D.; Pinilla, Lucía; Carratalá, Amara; Moncusí-Moix, Anna; Gort-Paniello, Clara; Molinero, Marta; González, Jessica; Torres, Gerard; Bernal, María; Pico, Silvia; Almansa, Raquel; Jorge, Noelia; Ortega, Alicia; Bustamante-Munguira, Elena; Gómez, José Manuel; González-Rivera, Milagros; Micheloud, Dariela; Ryan, Pablo; Martinez, Amalia; Tamayo, Luis; Aldecoa, César; Ferrer, Ricard; Ceccato, Adrián; Fernández-Barat, Laia; Motos, Ana; Riera, Jordi; Menéndez, Rosario; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Peñuelas, Oscar; Torres, Antoni; Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F.; Barbé, Ferran",Transl Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2021.05.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524421001225?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048985/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524421001225,632

The plans also include other important CSC strategies, but it is the notion of rationing scarce resources via triage that especially captured the imaginations of ethicists. Vigorous arguments have arisen over whether triage algorithms should be designed to prioritize patients based on predictions of short-, near-, or long-term survival. Additionally, there are ongoing debates about the ability of current algorithms to estimate patient survival accurately enough to be useful in triage and about the role of values like equity in triage protocols. Relatively few debates have noted, however, that while the development of CSC triage protocols has been based in medicine, public health, and ethics, the activation of CSC plans remains a political decision.","Mehta, Anuj B; Wynia, Matthew K",Hastings Cent Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529853/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1288,632

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced by all microorganisms as part of their normal metabolism. The types and classes of VOC produced is wide, including fatty acids and their derivatives (e.g. hydrocarbons, aliphatic alcohols and ketones), aromatic compounds, nitrogen containing compounds, and volatile sulfur compounds. A diversity of ecological niches exist in the human body which can support a polymicrobial community, with the exact VOC profile of a given anatomical site being dependent on that produced by both the host component and the microbial species present. The detection of VOCs is of interest to various disciplines, hence numerous analytical approaches have been developed to accurately characterize and measure VOCs in the laboratory, often from patient derived samples. Using these technological advancements it is evident that VOCs are indicative of both health and disease states. Many of these techniques are still largely confined to the research laboratory, but it is envisaged that in future bedside ‘VOC profiling’ will enable rapid characterization of microbial associated disease, providing vital information to healthcare practitioners.","Thorn, Robin Michael Statham; Greenman, John",J Breath Res,https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7155/6/2/024001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22556190/,632
679379,Using Rapid Research Implementation and Collaborations to Assess the Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Community and Clinical Cohorts,2021-04-20,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD out-competes the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 35% in terms of the calculated binding affinity. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.","Chowdhury, Ratul; Maranas, Costas D",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891,632
688625,Adherence to Personal Protective Equipment Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health-Care Personnel: A Louisiana Case Study,2021-06-08,"Introduction Seattle region hospitals have been severely impacted for several months by ongoing community spread of the novel coronavirus 2019 disease. (1,2) Although testing was initially focused on the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic patients, this effort has now expanded to include surveillance of asymptomatic patients in order to protect health care workers and prevent nosocomial infections. There is an urgent need to understand best practices for the delivery of routine medical care during an ongoing outbreak. (3) Here we report the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients screened prior to admission or a surgical or aerosolizing procedure. Methods Beginning March 30, 2020, our hospital began screening all asymptomatic patients prior to needed surgeries and aerosolizing procedures (n=350). On April 13, 2020, we expanded this practice to universal surveillance screening of all patients prior to admission (n=349). Testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using the Washington state emergency use authorized University of Washington CDC-based laboratory-developed test or FDA authorized DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2, Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2, or Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 tests. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Washington Medical Center (STUDY00009734). Informed consent was not required. Results For patients undergoing surgical or aerosolizing procedures, 3 of 350 patients (0.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. For patients who were asymptomatic and tested at the time of admission, 3 of 349 patients (0.9%) were positive and 2 of 349 (0.6%) were inconclusive; inconclusive results were treated as low-level positives. For asymptomatic patients tested for any other reason (e.g. exposure risk), 12 of 157 patients (7.6%) were positive and 1 of 157 (0.6%) were inconclusive. Meanwhile, of the 473 inpatients in this period who had any symptom concerning for COVID-19, 68 of 473 patients (14.3%) were positive. There was a variety of ordering services and locations in all indication categories, with no particular predominating medical service or location. During this time period the outpatient prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 active infection in our region was 3-5% (manuscript in review). Discussion The application of universal surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients prior to surgery or aerosolizing procedure shows that the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 is low (<1%) in asymptomatic patients without known exposure risk factors. The positivity rate for asymptomatic patients on admission screen was similar; both measures were notably lower than recently reported measurements during an outbreak in New York City that found a positivity rate of 13.7% in asymptomatic pregnant women. (4) The rate of sub-clinical infection likely varies with the scale of the community outbreak. Even in the context of a community-wide outbreak, our data show a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the urgent pre-procedural setting. These data reflect the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population of individuals who use medical services and provide an assessment of exposure risk to other patients and healthcare workers around the time of admission. The Greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) also recently published results from the first 18 days of home-based testing and reported no positive tests in 1392 patients reporting no COVID-19-like illness. (5) Although other studies support a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, the data from this metropolitan outbreak do not support a similar pattern. Clinical providers, especially those involved in performing procedures that have a risk of aerosolization, are asking for methods to risk-assess patients prior to the procedure. Pre-procedure testing is one option to accomplish this goal. Importantly, in the midst of an outbreak, testing prior to procedures can decrease the use of PPE, identify appropriate precautions for patients, and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.","Mays, James A; Greninger, Alexander L; Jerome, Keith R; Lynch, John B; Mathias, Patrick C",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20078592; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20078592v1?rss=1,632
