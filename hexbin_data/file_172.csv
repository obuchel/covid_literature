It is closely related to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of infants and young children and is more frequent during winter and spring, or sudden changes in temperature. Pneumonia is a serious disease that poses a threat to children's health and its morbidity and mortality rank first, accounting for 24.5–65.2% of pediatric inpatients. Due to juvenile age, severe illness and rapid changes, children often suffer acute heart failure, respiratory failure and even toxic encephalopathy at the same time. The concurrence in different stages of the process of emergency treatment tends to relapse, which directly places the lives of these children at risk. Severe pneumonia constitutes one of the main causes of infant mortality. In the process of nursing children with severe pneumonia, intensive care was provided, including condition assessment and diagnosis, close observation of disease, keeping the airway unblocked, rational oxygen therapy, prevention and treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure, support of vital organs, complications, and health education. The inflammatory response was proactively controlled, to prevent suffocation and reduce mortality. In summary, positive and effective nursing can promote the rehabilitation of children patients, which can be reinforced with adequate communication with the parents and/or caretakers.","Li, Wanli; An, Xinjiang; Fu, Mingyu; Li, Chunli",Exp Ther Med,172,22

However, some clinicians nevertheless attempt NIV to indirectly deliver adequate oxygenation and avoid unnecessary endotracheal intubation. CASE PRESENTATION: In this article, we report the case of a 24-year-old woman at 32 weeks' gestation who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She was successfully managed by NIV. DISCUSSION: However, NIV must be managed by providers who are trained in mechanical ventilation. This is of the utmost importance in avoiding any delay should the patient's condition worsen and require endotracheal intubation. Moreover, in pregnant women, the severity of illness may progress quickly due to the immunosuppression inherent in these patients. CONCLUSION: Special attention should be given to the choices of invasive ventilation and NIV to manage community acquired pneumonia patients in third trimester.","Mazlan, Mohd Zulfakar; Ali, Saedah; Zainal Abidin, Huda; Mokhtar, Ariffin Marzuki; Ab Mukmin, Laila; Ayub, Zeti Norfidiyati; Nadarajan, Chandran",Respir Med Case Rep,172,22
3663,3663,3663,Early and dynamic alterations of Th2/Th1 in previously immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis: a prospective observational study,16.4751,10.341511,2019-02-27,"BACKGROUND: T helper (Th) cells regulate sepsis processes, including primary pathogen clear and secondary pathogen defence. The objectives of this study were to determine the early and dynamic alterations of Th1 and Th2 populations to community-acquired severe sepsis upon onset among previously immunocompetent patients and whether it was related to clinical outcomes. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at a general intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. Immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis within 24 h upon onset were included as septic group. Healthy volunteers and critically ill patients without severe sepsis were recruited as controls. Whole blood was collected on D0, 3rd day (D3) and 7th day (D7) for septic group and once upon enrollment for controls. Th1 and Th2 populations were measured by flow cytometry and assessed for associations with 28-day mortality using cox proportional hazard models. Associations of dynamic alterations of Th cell subpopulations with clinical outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that community-acquired severe sepsis patients (n = 71) had increased Th2/Th1 and Th2 populations, compared to healthy controls (n = 7) and critically ill patients without severe sepsis (n = 7) at admission. Among the septic cohort, values of Th2/Th1 were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors on D0 (p = 0.04), D3 (p < 0.001) and D7 (p < 0.001). Patients with persistently increasing Th2/Th1 demonstrated the highest mortality (47.1%) and incidence of ICU-acquired infections (64.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Th2/Th1 was markedly up-regulated with Th2 dominance upon community-acquired severe sepsis onset among previously immunocompetent patients and its persistently dynamic increase was associated with ICU-acquired infections and 28-day death.

METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in five 10-bed ICUs of a teaching hospital, during a 2-year period. Ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), including ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were prospectively diagnosed. The agreement between VAE, VAT and VAP was assessed by k statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1059 patients (15,029 ventilator-days) were included. 268 VAP (17.8 per 1000 ventilator-days), 127 VAT (8.5 per 1000 ventilator-days) and 262 VAE (17.4 per 1000 ventilator-days) were diagnosed. There was no agreement between VAT and VAE, and the agreement was poor between VAP and VAE (k = 0.12, 95% CI 0.03–0.20). VAE and VA-LRTI were associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay. VAP, VAT and VAE were not significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement was poor between VAE and VAP. No agreement was found between VAE and VAT. VAE episodes were significantly associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay, but not with ICU mortality.","Pouly, Olivier; Lecailtel, Sylvain; Six, Sophie; Préau, Sébastien; Wallet, Frédéric; Nseir, Saad; Rouzé, Anahita",Ann Intensive Care,172,12

However, data regarding the clinical outcomes of this approach are lacking. The objective of this multicenter prospective observational cohort study was to evaluate lung transplantation outcomes in Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) patients for whom ECMO was used as a bridge to transplantation. METHODS: Between March 2015 and December 2017, a total of 112 patients received lung transplantation and were registered in the KOTRY, which is a prospective, multicenter cohort registry. The entire cohort was divided into two groups: the control group (n = 85, 75.9%) and bridge-ECMO group (n = 27, 24.1%). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in pre-transplant and intraoperative characteristics except for poorer oxygenation, more ventilator use, and longer operation time in the bridge-ECMO group. The prevalence of primary graft dysfunction at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after transplantation did not differ between the two groups. Although postoperative hospital stays were longer in the bridge-ECMO group than in the control group, hospital mortality did not differ between the two groups (25.9% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.212). The majority of patients (70.4% of the bridge-ECMO group and 77.6% of the control group) were discharged directly to their homes. Finally, the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation did not significantly affect overall survival and graft function. CONCLUSIONS: Short- and long-term post-transplant outcomes of bridge-ECMO patients were comparable to recipients who did not receive ECMO.","Ko, Ryoung-Eun; Lee, Jin Gu; Kim, Song Yee; Kim, Young Tae; Choi, Sun Mi; Kim, Do Hyung; Cho, Woo Hyun; Park, Seung-Il; Jo, Kyung-Wook; Kim, Hong Kwan; Paik, Hyo Chae; Jeon, Kyeongman",Respir Res,172,1

There was an elegant topological correspondence between each oscillation and the underlying brain anatomy, most prominently a ~35-Hz gamma-oscillation specific to the nucleus accumbens. Direct provocation of the patient’s contamination obsession modulated both firing rate and gamma-oscillation amplitude within the nucleus accumbens. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Surgical implantation of deep brain stimulating electrodes (DBS) to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an option for patients who have not fully responded to medical intervention or cognitive behavioral therapy. We measured the electrophysiology of a collection of deep brain structures during awake DBS surgery for an OCD patient with an obsession about cleanliness and contamination. The anatomic delineation of these deep brain structures was revealed by distinct brain rhythms, most notably a ~35 Hz oscillation specific to the nucleus accumbens. In the first ever measurement of a human obsessive thought, we found that this ~35-Hz biomarker, as well as the local neuronal action potential rate, were modulated by handing the patient a toothbrush to bring to his face and instructing him to “imagine brushing your teeth with this dirty toothbrush.”","Miller, Kai J.; Prieto, Thomas; Williams, Nolan R.; Halpern, Casey H.",J Neurophysiol,172,7

However, the influence of SOR on T cell immunity remains uncharacterized. Here we show the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated mouse CD8(+) T cells. We find that low oxygen level diminishes CD8(+) T cell anti-viral response in vivo. We reveal that respiratory restriction inhibits ATP-dependent matrix processes that are critical for mitochondrial-biogenesis. This respiratory restriction-mediated effect could be rescued by TCA cycle re-stimulation, which yielded increased mitochondrial matrix-localized ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that the hypoxia-arrested CD8(+) T cell anti-viral response could be rescued in vivo through brief exposure to atmospheric oxygen pressure. Overall, these findings elucidate the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated CD8(+) T cells, and suggest a new approach for reducing viral infections in COPD.","Saragovi, Amijai; Abramovich, Ifat; Omar, Ibrahim; Arbib, Eliran; Toker, Ori; Gottlieb, Eyal; Berger, Michael",,172,1

However, detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses of esophageal motor functions are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the key features of esophageal motility functions using high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) and to evaluate an objective link between esophageal motor patterns, gastric emptying, and gastroesophageal reflux. We also studied the prokinetic effects of metoclopramide. METHODS: We prospectively performed HRIM for 16 critically ill hemodynamically stable patients. Patients were included if they had low gastric volume (LGV; < 100 mL/24 h, n = 8) or high gastric volume (HGV; > 500 mL/24 h, n = 8). The HRIM data were collected for 5 h with intravenous metoclopramide administration (10 mg) after the first 2 h. RESULTS: The findings were grossly abnormal for all critically ill patients. The esophageal contraction vigor was markedly increased, indicating prevailing hypercontractile esophagus. Ineffective propulsive force was observed for 73% of esophageal activities. Panesophageal pressurization was the most common pressurization pattern (64%). Gastroesophageal reflux predominantly occurred with transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. The common features of the LGV group were a hyperreactive pattern, esophagogastric outflow obstruction, and frequent reflux. Ineffective motility with reduced lower esophageal sphincter tone, and paradoxically fewer reflux episodes, was common in the HGV group. Metoclopramide administration reduced the number of esophageal activities but did not affect the number of reflux episodes in either group. CONCLUSION: All critically ill patients had major esophageal motility abnormalities, and motility patterns varied according to gastric emptying status. Well-preserved gastric emptying and maintained esophagogastric barrier functions did not eliminate reflux. Metoclopramide failed to reduce the number of reflux episodes regardless of gastric emptying status. Trial registration ISRCTN, ISRCTN14399966.

Technological modes of educational delivery may be as effective as traditional education and can provide practitioners with increased accessibility to dementia training. Benefits of digitally based dementia education have been established including pedagogical strategies that influence dementia knowledge and care attitudes. This review aimed to appraise and synthesise contemporary experimental evidence that evaluated technology-enabled dementia education for health and social care practitioners. Outcomes based on Kirkpatrick’s Model were learner satisfaction; knowledge, skills, and attitudes; behaviours; and results. METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science were among 8 bibliographic databases searched from January 2005 until February 2020. Keywords included dementia and education (and terms for technological modes of education, learning, or training). We included experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument established the overall quality of included studies and pragmatic application of Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool established individual study quality and highlighted methodological features of educational research. Narrative synthesis was conducted as heterogeneous outcome data precluded meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 21 relevant studies: 16 evaluated online dementia education and 5 evaluated computer-based approaches. Most studies used before-after designs and study quality was moderate overall. Most studies reported knowledge-based outcomes with statistically significant findings favouring the training interventions. Positive effects were also observed in studies measuring skills and attitudinal change. Fewer studies reported significant findings for behavioural change and results due to training. Case-based instruction was a frequently described instructional strategy in online dementia education and videos were common information delivery modes. CD-ROM training and simulation activities were described in computer-based dementia education. DISCUSSION: Future emphasis must be placed on teaching and learning methods within technology-enabled dementia education which should be role relevant and incorporate active and interactive learning strategies. Future evaluations will require contextually relevant research methodologies with capacity to address challenges presented by these complex educational programmes and multi-component characteristics.

Combining speculative fiction, Clausewitzian theory and metadisciplinary analysis, this exploratory piece outlines the emergence of a war that is both new and familiar—Xenowar. ‘Xeno’ because this war incorporates the alien and the Other into a new, dynamic, topological trinity. Xenowar is the Clausewitzian trinity spun in recursive loops of alterity, where conflict diagonalizes into an inhuman, alien cognition. War persists, but Clausewitz’s wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit morphs to become topological. Combatants emerge from corporations and nations as the understanding of war as human activity evolves into the realisation that all human activity is now war. ‘Users’ are a ‘standing reserve’ for the Gestell. Simultaneously, the technological and biological merge, transforming conflict into three dimensions in a way that emphasises connection and shape, not geometry. This deforms war’s properties while preserving its form: asymmetry will be expressed as inhuman scales, and feedback loops will redefine geopolitics. Topological equivalence will mean the continuous mapping of States within Stack homeomorphism via oscillations of stretching and contraction. Westphalian deformations will increase turbulence at higher manifolds and dimensions. Equally, an inability to cut and paste borders of Stack topology will accentuate disconnection. Some Stacks may be enantiotopic to each other, mirror images but not superimposable. At other scales friction will spiral in recursions of homotopic functionalities across Stack infrastructures and diastereotopic data planes of invertible war: ‘recurgency’ will replace insurgency. State and Stack firewalls will constitute cosmotechnic event horizons of compression. From this black hole of Xenowar will pulse another type of Un-War, fought at the edges of the incomputable, an axiomatic reboot of Non-Turing mathematics and non-Abelian anyons of topological quantum computing. Sovereignty will not just be defined in the ontology of mathematical alterity. Life will prove non-computable. Adverserial relations will thus multiple via biolocial processes of mutation, while digital war’s front lines will recede to reflevive, recursive interstices. Consciousness is another limit upon which total war will press, and when war has co-opted consciousness what will we do—or even be?","Sear, Tom",Digi War,172,3

In a field devoted to the pursuit of objective data, suffering is a phenomenon with deep ties to subjective experience, moral values, and cultural norms. Suffering’s tie to subjective experience makes it challenging to discern and respond to the suffering of others. In particular, the question of whether a child with profound neurocognitive disabilities can suffer has generated a robust discourse, rooted in philosophical conceptualizations of personhood as well as the academic and experiential expertise of practiced health-care professionals. The issue remains unresolved because it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to ever truly know an infant’s lived experience. But what if this is not the best question? What if instead of asking “can this infant suffer?” the discourse is broadened to ask “is there suffering here?” This latter question demands attention to patients’ subjective experiences of suffering, but also to the web of relationships that envelop them. Without losing sight of the importance of patients’ experiences, consideration of their relationships may elucidate the presence of suffering when the patients themselves are unable to provide the same clarity. In this essay, care ethics frames an examination of how suffering manifests in the loving and caring relationships that surround an infant with profound neurocognitive disabilities, changing those relationships and affecting the individuals within them. Exploring suffering through these relationships may offer clarity on the presence and content of suffering for infants with profound cognitive disabilities, in turn offering moral guidance for responding to suffering and supporting flourishing in this context.","Campelia, Georgina D.; Kett, Jennifer C.; Wightman, Aaron",Theor Med Bioeth,172,0

Therefore, we established a rapid, accurate, simple and sensitive fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test (ICST) based on quantum dots (QDs) for detection the antibodies of Brucella infection animals serum. RESULTS: The test strips were successfully prepared by quantum dot fluorescent microspheres (QDFM) as tracers, which were covalently coupled to an outer membrane protein of Brucella OMP22. The outer membrane protein OMP28 and monoclonal antibodies of OMP22 were separately dispensed onto a nitrocellulose membrane as test and quality control lines, respectively. The critical threshold for determining negative or positive through the ratio of the fluorescent signal of the test line and the control line (H(T) / H(C)) is 0.0492. The repeatability was excellent with an overall average CV of 8.78%. Under optimum conditions, the limit of detection was 1.05 ng/mL (1:512 dilution). With regard to the detection of brucellosis in 150 clinical samples, the total coincidence rate of ICST and Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT) was 97.3%, the coincidence rate of positive samples was 98.8%, the coincidence rate of negative samples was 95.3%, the sensitivity of RBPT is 1:32, and no cross reaction with the sera of other related diseases was observed. CONCLUSION: In our present study, the QDFM has promising application for on-site screening of brucellosis owing to its high detection speed, high sensitivity, high specificity and low cost.","Kong, Yufang; Wang, Huiyu; Wu, Shaoqiang; Lv, Jizhou; Mei, Lin; Zhou, Huifang; Lin, Xiangmei; Han, Xueqing",BMC Vet Res,172,1

This is a concern to all, but even more to Critical Infrastructures, like health organizations. A Cyber Threat Monitoring System (CTMS), providing a global approach to detect and analyze cyber-threats for health infrastructures is proposed by combining a set of solutions from Airbus CyberSecurity with a machine learning pipeline to improve detection and provide awareness from cyber side to a more global approach that will combine them with physical incidents. The work is being carried out in the scope of SAFECARE project. In this work, we present the CTMS architecture and present our experimental findings with ensemble learning methods for intrusion detection. Several parameters of six different ensemble methods are optimized, using Grid Search and Bayesian Search approaches, in order to detect intrusions as soon as they occur. Then, after the determination of best set of parameters for each algorithm, the attack detection performance of these six different ensemble algorithms using the CICIDS 2017 dataset are calculated and discussed. The results obtained identified Random Forest, LightGBM and Decision Trees as the best algorithms, with no significant difference in the performance, using a 95% confidence interval.","Maia, Eva; Reis, Bruno; Praça, Isabel; Becue, Adrien; Lancelin, David; Demailly, Samantha Dauguet; Sousa, Orlando",Cyber-Physical Security for Critical Infrastructures Protection,172,26

In contrast to related approaches, our method concurrently predicts all masks, one for each pixel, and thus resolves any conflict jointly across the entire image. Specifically, predictions from overlapping masks are combined into edge weights of a signed graph that is subsequently partitioned to obtain all final instances concurrently. The result is a parameter-free method that is strongly robust to noise and prioritizes predictions with the highest consensus across overlapping masks. All masks are decoded from a low dimensional latent representation, which results in great memory savings strictly required for applications to large volumetric images. We test our method on the challenging CREMI 2016 neuron segmentation benchmark where it achieves competitive scores.

In the case of monitoring rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a robust method of capturing reliable Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) information remotely could reduce patient visits to hospitals and free up clinic space. Information would ideally be captured from a home setting by a patient. However, self-reporting of DAS-28 has limited reliability especially at moderate or high levels of disease activity. A mechanism for remotely ascertaining DAS-28 which is both accurate and precise would improve remote management for people living with RA. Methods We undertook a study to assess patient attitudes regarding a novel remote RA monitoring platform, which uses images and video captured movements to estimate DAS-28. The study involved a semi-structured 30-minutes video interview. Participants were adults with RA living in the UK. The interviews focused on these key areas: i) an overview of their history with the condition, ii) familiarity with DAS-28, iii) relationship with the clinical team, iv) relationship with technology and telemedicine, v) feedback on the RA monitoring platform. Results Eleven subjects participated in the study. They reported a median disease duration of 11 years (range: 4 to 35), and all had experienced flares, with 10/11 familiar with the DAS-28 prior to the study interview. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, most patients only had contact with clinicians or healthcare facilities over the phone, with only one patient having visited a hospital for a reason not directly related to RA, and one patient having no contact at all. Overall, patients expressed enthusiasm towards the RA monitoring platform and were confident that they would be able to use it at home. Access over the Internet was not perceived as a barrier, and the advantages of tracking disease progression regularly, sharing data with the consultant and saving time travelling to appointments far outweighed the disadvantages. Participants generally reported that they would most benefit from a blended interaction with the clinical team, combining face-to-face appointments with use of the platform at home rather than seeing the platform as a complete alternative to face-to-face assessment. Conclusion This study provides the first insight into the perception and acceptance of the RA monitoring platform in a small sample of RA patients. Results are positive, and support further evaluation of the platform. Evidence to understand how technology can improve the quality of telemedicine for people with RA is urgently needed as the pandemic continues. Disclosure F. Donadoni: None. L. Gionfrida: None. B.

No objective data exist in literature about the effect of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) on working space in laparoscopic surgery. We objectively measured this effect with computed tomography in a porcine laparoscopy model. METHODS Using standardized anesthesia, twelve 20-kg pigs without MBP and eight 20-kg pigs with MBP were studied with computed tomography at intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) levels of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg. Volumes and dimensions of the pneumoperitoneum were measured on reconstructed CT images and compared between the pigs with and those without MBP. RESULTS A reproducible and statistically significant increase of approximately 500 ml in pneumoperitoneum volume was found in the MBP group at all levels of IAP. This represents a 43 % relative increase at a pneumoperitoneum pressure of 5 mmHg, 21 % at IAP 10 mmHg, and 18 % at IAP 15 mmHg. Peak inspiratory pressure was lower at IAP 0 and 5 mmHg in the MBP group. Anteroposterior diameter in the group with MBP was lower at 0 mmHg, but abdominal dimensions were similar in both groups at all other IAPs. This shows that the gain in working space is due to a diminished volume of the intra-abdominal content and not to compression or displacement of the bowel. CONCLUSIONS MBP increases working space by reducing bowel content. Especially at low intra-abdominal working pressures, the increase in working space associated with MBP could represent an important benefit in challenging laparoscopic surgery.","Vlot, John; Slieker, Juliette C; Wijnen, René; Lange, Johan F; Bax, Klaas N M A",Surgical endoscopy,172,24

RECENT FINDINGS NA is not as rare as previously thought. The phenotype is broad, and recent nerve imaging developments suggest that NA is the most common cause of acute anterior or posterior interosseous nerve palsy. Phrenic nerve involvement occurs in 8% of all NA patients, often with debilitating consequences. Acute phase treatment of NA with steroids or i.v. immunoglobulin may benefit patients. Long-term consequences are the rule, and persisting symptoms are mainly caused by a combination of decreased endurance in the affected nerves and an altered posture and movement pattern, not by the axonal damage itself. Patients benefit from specific rehabilitation treatment. For nerves that do not recover, surgery may be an option. SUMMARY NA is not uncommon, and has a long-term impact on patients' well-being. Early immunomodulating treatment, and identifying phrenic neuropathy or complete nerve paralysis is important for optimal recovery. For persistent symptoms a specific treatment strategy aiming at regaining an energy balance and well-coordinated scapular movement are paramount.","IJspeert, Jos; Janssen, Renske M J; van Alfen, Nens",Current opinion in neurology,172,29

These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools. Yet, despite their expressive power, visualization authoring systems often assume that users want to generate visual representations that they already have in mind rather than explore designs. They also impose a data-to-graphics workflow, where binding data dimensions to graphical properties is a necessary step for generating visualization layouts. In this paper, we introduce StructGraphics, an approach for creating data-agnostic and fully reusable visualization designs. StructGraphics enables designers to construct visualization designs by drawing graphics on a canvas and then structuring their visual properties without relying on a concrete dataset or data schema. In StructGraphics, tabular data structures are derived directly from the structure of the graphics. Later, designers can link these structures with real datasets through a spreadsheet user interface. StructGraphics supports the design and reuse of complex data visualizations by combining graphical property sharing, by-example design specification, and persistent layout constraints. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a gallery of visualization examples and reflect on its strengths and limitations in interaction with graphic designers and data visualization experts.","Tsandilas, Theophanis",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,172,7

To date, there are no such studies on Swedish adolescents. As COVID-19 emerged in the middle of our ongoing 2-year follow-up examination of the Study of Adolescence Resilience and Stress, we had the unique opportunity to use the corona outbreak as a 'natural experiment' to study the impact of COVID-19 on 15-year-old adolescents in Sweden. METHODS Adolescents (baseline age 13.6±0.4 years) were recruited from schools in western Sweden (during the COVID-19 outbreak schools were kept open for those under 16 years of age). The COVID-19 pandemic reached Sweden on 31 January 2020. A total of 1316 adolescents answered the 2-year follow-up survey before (unexposed to COVID-19 pandemic, controls) and 584 after 1 February 2020 (COVID19-exposed). Data on stress, psychosomatic symptoms, happiness, relationships with parents and peers, school and health behaviours were collected. RESULTS Adolescents reported higher levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms and lower levels of happiness at follow-up compared to baseline. These changes occurred to a similar extent in both the control and COVID-19-exposed groups. Likewise, the COVID-19-exposed group showed no deterioration in peer relations or relations with parents versus controls. We did not find any significant differences between groups regarding sleep duration and physical activity.

Three open-label studies on patients with neuropathic and nociceptive malignant and nonmalignant chronic pain were analyzed. A mixed model for repeated measures linear regression analysis was used to compare the effect of OROS hydromorphone on patients with neuropathic and nociceptive pain, adjusting for potentially confounding factors. Data from patients with pure neuropathic pain and mixed pain were also compared. Safety and tolerability was assessed by recording the number of adverse events.

Secondary outcomes were the effect of OROS hydromorphone on other BPI items including ""pain relief"" and ""interference with sleep."" Patients with neuropathic pain showed a similar response to treatment with OROS hydromorphone to those patients with nociceptive pain. There was no statistically significant difference between the pain groups (difference between groups -0.552 at visit 7; P = .060 for overall difference between groups). For some outcome variables, treatment was more effective for patients with neuropathic pain. The treatment was generally well tolerated.

However, the exact interplay between HT, shoulder range of motion (ROM), competition level differences, and injury risk is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine the relationship between HT, ROM, and injury risk in baseball players. Secondarily, to determine HT based on competition level. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception until November 4, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) HT measurements and (2) arm injury or shoulder ROM. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 3. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers recorded patient demographics, competition level, HT, shoulder ROM, and injury data. RESULTS A total of 32 studies were included. There was no difference between baseball players with shoulder and elbow injuries and noninjured players (side-to-side HT difference: mean difference [MD], 1.75 [95% CI, -1.83 to 2.18]; dominant arm: MD, 0.17 [95% CI, -1.83 to 2.18]). Meta-regression determined that for every 1° increase in shoulder internal rotation (IR), there was a subsequent increase of 0.65° in HT (95% CI, 0.28 to 1.02). HT did not explain external rotation (ER ROM: 0.19 [95% CI, -0.24 to 0.61]) or horizontal adduction (HA ROM: 0.18 [95% CI, -0.46 to 0.82]). There were no differences between HT at the high school, college, or professional levels. CONCLUSION No relationship was found between HT and injury risk. However, HT explained 65% of IR ROM but did not explain ER ROM or HA ROM. There were no differences in HT pertaining to competition level. The majority of IR may be nonmodifiable. Treatment to restore and maintain clinical IR may be important, especially in players with naturally greater torsion. HT adaptation may occur prior to high school, which can assist in decisions regarding adolescent baseball participation.","Helmkamp, Joshua K; Bullock, Garrett S; Rao, Allison; Shanley, Ellen; Thigpen, Charles; Garrigues, Grant E",Sports health,172,1

Unlike clinical signs, electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring allows to detect and quantify an overdose of hypnotics. Therefore, we tested whether the use of an electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring will cause less hypotension following induction with propofol. METHODS Subjects were randomly assigned to a bispectral index (BIS)-guided (target range 40-60) or to a weight-related (2 mg.kg- 1) manual administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypotension following the administration of propofol. Secondary endpoints included the degree of hypotension and correlations between BIS and drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Incidences were analyzed with Fisher's Exact-test. RESULTS Of the 240 patients enrolled into this study, 235 predominantly non-geriatric (median 48 years, 25th - 75th percentile 35-61 years) patients without severe concomitant disease (88% American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1-2) undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery, ophthalmic surgery, and dermatologic surgery were analyzed. Patients who were manually administered propofol guided by BIS (n = 120) compared to those who were given propofol by weight (n = 115) did not differ concerning the incidence of hypotension (44% vs. 45%; p = 0.87). Study groups were also similar regarding the maximal drop in MAP compared to baseline (33% vs. 30%) and the proportion of hypotensive events related to all measurements (17% vs. 19%). Final propofol induction doses in BIS group and NON-BIS group were similar (1.93 mg/kg vs. 2 mg/kg). There was no linear correlation between BIS and the drop in MAP at all times (r < 0.2 for all) except for a weak one at 6 min (r = 0.221). CONCLUSION Results of our study suggest that a BIS-guided compared to a weight-adjusted manual administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia in non-geriatric patients will not lower the incidence and degree of arterial hypotension.

However, it is difficult to guarantee accuracy and avoid obstacles in puncture process. Therefore, developing a viable path planning method is particularly important. In this research, the bending deformation law of flexible needles during puncture was studied and the puncture path was planned to provide a feasible method for clinical application of flexible needles. METHODS According to the researchs that have been conducted, the path of the flexible needle in the tissue could be considered as a circular arc stitching. This research studied the calculation method of arc radius and obtained its actual value by the puncture experiments. Based on the arc model, the spatial transformation method of three-dimensional path planning was studied. In addition, a simplified particle swarm optimization (PSO) was applied into the process of path planning by changing the central angle of arc and the rotation angle of the needle body. RESULTS The results of Experiment 1 showed that the path radius of the flexible needle pierced into gelatin prosthesis was influenced by four parameters, which were needle diameter, tip angle, puncture speed and the weight ratio of gelatin powder. As the needle diameter and tip angle increased, the radius of needle path tended to increase, but when the puncture speed and gelatin mass ratio increased, the radius of needle path decreased. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the distances of needle tip apart from target point were 3.2 mm (barrier-free experiments) and 1.8 mm (obstacle experiments). CONCLUSIONS This research links the intelligent algorithm with the flexible needle puncture tissue process, which has high value in future clinical application. By setting the correct boundary conditions and parameters, the flexible needle can be planned to reach the target point accurately.","Cai, Chenxu; Sun, Chunsheng; Han, Ying; Zhang, Qinhe",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,172,33

It also defines ""isolated"" and ""combined"" tremor syndromes depending on whether tremor is the sole clinical manifestation or is associated with other neurological or systemic signs. This syndromic approach provides a guide to investigate the underlying etiology of tremors, either genetic or acquired. Several genetic defects have been proven to cause tremor disorders, including autosomal dominant and recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial diseases, as well as chromosomal abnormalities. Furthermore, some tremor syndromes are recognized in individuals with a positive family history, but their genetic confirmation is pending. Although most genetic tremor disorders show a combined clinical picture, there are some distinctive conditions in which tremor may precede the appearance of other neurological signs by years or remain the prominent manifestation throughout the disease course, previously leading to misdiagnosis as essential tremor (ET). Advances in the knowledge of genetically determined tremors may have been hampered by the inclusion of heterogeneous entities in previous studies on ET. The recent classification of tremors therefore aims to provide more consistent clinical data for deconstructing the genetic basis of tremor syndromes in the next-generation and long-read sequencing era. This review outlines the wide spectrum of tremor disorders with defined or presumed genetic etiology, both isolated and combined, unraveling diagnostic clues of these conditions and focusing mainly on ET-like phenotypes. Furthermore, we suggest a phenotype-to-genotype algorithm to support clinicians in identifying tremor syndromes and guiding genetic investigations.","Magrinelli, Francesca; Latorre, Anna; Balint, Bettina; Mackenzie, Melissa; Mulroy, Eoin; Stamelou, Maria; Tinazzi, Michele; Bhatia, Kailash P",Parkinsonism & related disorders,172,16

While there might be a tendency to perceive these changes negatively in terms of the impact on training, we think this unprecedented situation might present a unique learning opportunity. A group of geriatric medicine trainees and trainers devised an innovative, forward-thinking specific training plan based on existing Joint Royal Colleges of Physicians Training Board geriatric medicine curricula, encouraging development of a personal development plan (PDP) tailored to the pandemic. This model could be considered for all specialty training curricula, providing a proactive approach to optimising training during the pandemic. By formulating a 'pandemic PDP' early and considering methods to maximise learning, training needs can be met even in these extraordinary times.","Minhas, Jatinder S; Pan, Daniel; Sze, Shirley; Pareek, Manish; Miller, Chris J",Future healthcare journal,172,1

Through investigating the factor structure, this study aimed to improve the FCRI and its usability. Therefore, we did a comprehensive comparison of the factor structure results of all translations, by exploring and improving the structure of the Dutch FCRI-NL and by testing this new factor structure in two patient samples. METHODS To compare factor structure results of FCRI translations, we did a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar. We performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in a mixed cancer sample. The confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were secondary analyses performed in two randomized controlled trial samples: consecutive breast cancer patients and distressed, mainly breast cancer patients. RESULTS All translations showed comparable and reasonable factor structure results; however, the FCRI factor structure can be improved. The EFA resulted in a four-factor solution: fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) severity, cognitive coping, impact of FCR on functioning and behavioural coping. However, the 4-factor CFAs did not fit the sample 2 and 3 data well. CONCLUSION Further exploring the FCRI-NL factor structure did not result in a psychometrically stronger FCRI-NL. Therefore, we recommend retaining the 7-factor FCRI-NL.","van Helmondt, Sanne Jasperine; van der Lee, Marije Liesbeth; Bisseling, Else Maria; Lodder, Paul; de Vries, Jolanda",European journal of cancer care,172,31

However, strategies for incorporating multiple antigens into a single vector and the immunization routes may affect their immunogenicity. In this study, we utilized recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) as a model vaccine vector, and Ag85A (Rv3804c) and Mtb32 (Rv0125) as model antigens, to comparatively evaluate the influence of codon usage optimization, signal sequence, fusion linkers, and immunization routes on the immunogenicity of tuberculosis (TB) vaccine containing multiple antigens in C57BL/6 mice. We showed that codon-optimized Ag85A and Mtb32 fused with a GSG linker induced the strongest systemic and pulmonary cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Strong CMI responses were characterized by the generation of a robust IFN-γ ELISPOT response as well as antigen-specific CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells, which secreted mono-, dual-, or multiple cytokines. We also found that subcutaneous (SC) and intranasal (IN)/oral immunization with this candidate vaccine exhibited the strongest boosting effects for Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-primed systemic and pulmonary CMI responses, respectively. Our results supported that codon optimized Ag85A and Mtb32 fused with a proper linker and immunized through SC and IN/oral routes can generate the strongest systemic and pulmonary CMI responses in BCG-primed mice, which may be particularly important for the design of TB vaccines containing multiple antigens.","Zhang, Yiling; Feng, Liqiang; Li, Liang; Wang, Dimin; Li, Chufang; Sun, Caijun; Li, Pingchao; Zheng, Xuehua; Liu, Yichu; Yang, Wei; Niu, Xuefeng; Zhong, Nanshan; Chen, Ling",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,172,10

METHODS From January 2006 to August 2013 patients with a clinical suspicion of spondylodiscitis, with an infection, or with fever of unknown origin were retrospectively included if 18F-FDG-PET/CT and MRI of the spine were performed within a 2-week time span. Imaging results were compared to the final clinical diagnosis and follow-up data were collected. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were included of whom 49 patients were diagnosed with spondylodiscitis. MRI showed an overall sensitivity of 67 % and specificity of 84 %. Diagnostic accuracy was 58 %, when MRI was performed within 2 weeks after the start of symptoms and improved to 82 %, when performed more than 2 weeks after onset of symptoms. 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 95 %, with no relation to the interval between the scan and the start of symptoms.

Early in the experience, a standard circular stapler was often used, while later specifically designed staplers for SH were developed. Although the diameter of the circular cutting knife differ significantly, it remains unclear, if the volume of the excised tissue differs and if this has an influence on the long-term results and complications. METHODS We evaluated in a prospective consecutive database that underwent SH from January 2003 through April 2004. There were three devices used during the study period: end-to-end-anastomosis (EEA) 31, stapler device for haemorrhoids (SDH) and procedure for prolapse and haemorrhoids (PPH). Procedure selection was at the discretion of the surgeon; however, the indications for surgery were similar for all involved surgeons. Demographic and operative characteristics were analysed. Follow-up data were collected continuously over the time, and in May 2010, these patients received a questionnaire. Data were compared by t test and chi-square test, respectively. RESULTS There were 214 (97 females) evaluable patients. Seventy-three patients were operated with EEA-31, 52 with SDH- and 89 with PPH. The median follow-up was 6.8 years and complete data were available for 131 (61.2%) patients. Demographic characteristics were comparable within the three groups. SDH (6 ml) and PPH (6.5 ml) resected significantly (p < 0.05) more tissue than EEA (5 ml). Early postoperative incontinence rate was significantly higher in the PPH group (6%) as compared to EEA (1%) and SDH (0%). The incidence of other early complications was similar across techniques. The overall complication rates and reoperation rates were similar. Although 41% of the patients had minor anorectal complaints (itching and soiling), incontinence rates were low (2-3%) without any significant differences between the devices. CONCLUSIONS The results of cohort of SH patients support the conclusion that short- and long-term outcomes are device independent, although each approach is associated with a modest degree of ongoing anorectal symptoms.","Kahlke, Volker; Bock, Jens Uwe; Peleikis, Hans Günter; Jongen, Johannes",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,172,30

They are considered to be a rare entity with approximately 300 cases reported in the literature since it was first described by Barbette in 1672. Petit described the inferior lumbar triangle in 1783 and Grynfeltt described the superior lumbar triangle in 1866; both are anatomical boundaries where 95% of lumbar hernias occur, whereas the other 5% are considered to be diffuse. Twenty percent of lumbar hernias are congenital and the other 80% are acquired; the acquired lumbar hernias can be further classified into either primary (spontaneous) or secondary. The typical presentation of lumbar hernias is a patient with a protruding semispherical bulge in the back with a slow growth. However, they may present with an incarcerated or strangulated bowel, so it is recommended that all lumbar hernias must be repaired as soon as they are diagnosed. The ""gold standard"" for diagnosing a lumbar hernia is a CT scan, because it is able to delineate muscular and fascial layers, detect a defect in one or more of these layers, evaluate the presence of herniated contents, differentiate muscle atrophy from a real hernia, and serve as a useful tool in the differential diagnosis, such as tumors. Recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of a laparoscopic repair instead of the classic open approach as the ideal treatment option for lumbar hernias. We report a case of a spontaneous lumbar hernia initially diagnosed as a lipoma and corrected with the open approach, but after relapsing 2 years later it was corrected using a laparoscopic approach. It is followed by an extensive review of lumbar hernias literature regarding history, anatomy, and surgical techniques.","Suarez, Sebastian; Hernandez, Juan D",Surgical endoscopy,172,28
90522,90522,90522,Point-of-Care Ultrasound Can Suggest COVID-19.,16.283684,10.781059,2020,"UNLABELLED Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus, causes lethal watery diarrhea in piglets and results in large economic losses in many Asian and European countries. A large-scale outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea occurred in China in 2010, and the virus emerged in the United States in 2013 and spread rapidly, posing significant economic and public health concerns. Previous studies have shown that PEDV infection inhibits the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN), and viral papain-like protease 2 has been identified as an IFN antagonist. In this study, we found that the PEDV-encoded nucleocapsid (N) protein also inhibits Sendai virus-induced IFN-β production, IFN-stimulated gene expression, and activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB. We also found that N protein significantly impedes the activation of the IFN-β promoter stimulated by TBK1 or its upstream molecules (RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, and TRAF3) but does not counteract its activation by IRF3. A detailed analysis revealed that the PEDV N protein targets TBK1 by direct interaction and that this binding sequesters the association between TBK1 and IRF3, which in turn inhibits both IRF3 activation and type I IFN production. Together, our findings demonstrate a new mechanism evolved by PEDV to circumvent the host's antiviral immunity. IMPORTANCE PEDV has received increasing attention since the emergence of a PEDV variant in China and the United States. Here, we identify nucleocapsid (N) protein as a novel PEDV-encoded interferon (IFN) antagonist and demonstrate that N protein antagonizes IFN production by sequestering the interaction between IRF3 and TBK1, a critical step in type I IFN signaling. This adds another layer of complexity to the immune evasion strategies evolved by this economically important viral pathogen. An understanding of its immune evasion mechanism may direct us to novel therapeutic targets and more effective vaccines against PEDV infection.","Ding, Zhen; Fang, Liurong; Jing, Huiyuan; Zeng, Songlin; Wang, Dang; Liu, Lianzeng; Zhang, Huan; Luo, Rui; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,172,16

Airway epithelia are thus important targets in primary infection. Furthermore, virus replication in the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory or urinary tract in later phases of infection is essential for virus shedding and transmission. So far, the mechanisms of NiV replication in epithelial cells are poorly elucidated. In the present study, we provide evidence that bipolar targeting of the two NiV surface glycoproteins G and F is of biological importance for fusion in polarized epithelia. We demonstrate that infection of polarized cells induces focus formation, with both glycoproteins located at lateral membranes of infected cells adjacent to uninfected cells. Supporting the idea of a direct spread of infection via lateral cell-to-cell fusion, we could identify basolateral targeting signals in the cytoplasmic domains of both NiV glycoproteins. Tyrosine 525 in the F protein is part of an endocytosis signal and is also responsible for basolateral sorting. Surprisingly, we identified a dityrosine motif at position 28/29 in the G protein, which mediates polarized targeting. A dileucine motif predicted to function as sorting signal is not involved. Mutation of the targeting signal in one of the NiV glycoproteins prevented the fusion of polarized cells, suggesting that basolateral or bipolar F and G expression facilitates the spread of NiV within epithelial cell monolayers, thereby contributing to efficient virus spread in mucosal surfaces in early and late phases of infection.","Weise, Carolin; Erbar, Stephanie; Lamp, Boris; Vogt, Carola; Diederich, Sandra; Maisner, Andrea",Journal of virology,172,15

Diagnosing AD before symptoms arise will facilitate earlier intervention. The early diagnostic approaches are thus urgently needed. Methods The multifunctional nanoparticles W20/XD4-SPIONs were constructed by the conjugation of oligomer-specific scFv antibody W20 and class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) activator XD4 onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The SPIONs' stability and uniformity in size were measured by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The ability of W20/XD4-SPIONs for recognizing Aβ oligomers (AβOs) and promoting AβOs phagocytosis was assessed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. The blood-brain barrier permeability of W20/XD4-SPIONs was determined by a co-culture transwell model. The in vivo probe distribution of W20/XD4-SPIONs in AD mouse brains was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results W20/XD4-SPIONs, as an AβOs-targeted molecular MRI contrast probe, readily reached pathological AβOs regions in brains and distinguished AD transgenic mice from WT controls. W20/XD4-SPIONs retained the property of XD4 for SR-A activation and significantly promoted microglial phagocytosis of AβOs. Moreover, W20/XD4-SPIONs exhibited the properties of good biocompatibility, high stability and low cytotoxicity. Conclusion Compared with W20-SPIONs or XD4-SPIONs, W20/XD4-SPIONs show the highest efficiency for AβOs-targeting and significantly enhance AβOs uptake by microglia. As a molecular probe, W20/XD4-SPIONs also specifically and sensitively bind to AβOs in AD brains to provide an MRI signal, demonstrating that W20/XD4-SPIONs are promising diagnostic agents for early-stage AD. Due to the beneficial effect of W20 and XD4 on neuropathology, W20/XD4-SPIONs may also have therapeutic potential for AD .","Liu, Xiao-Ge; Zhang, Lun; Lu, Shuai; Liu, Dong-Qun; Zhang, Ling-Xiao; Yu, Xiao-Lin; Liu, Rui-Tian",International journal of nanomedicine,172,27

Closure of a fascia defect at the port site is an important problem of laparoscopic surgery, especially in obese patients. Aim To evaluate needle grasper fascia closure. Material and methods We closed the port site fascia using a percutaneous organ-holding device (needle grasper) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients. This study included 334 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy between January 2015 and January 2017 in our hospital. Patients were divided into 2 fascia closure groups: group 1 with a standard simple suturing technique and group 2 with a needle grasper to close the port site. Patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. Results There were 243 female and 91 male (total 334) patients with the mean age of 49.18 ±13.15 years. Only 1 patient in the BMI > 30 kg/m2 group of patients had port site hernia development with the needle grasper technique at the end of the 8-month follow-up period. The port site hernia incidence was higher in group 1 than group 2 (p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in terms of operation duration between the two groups (p < 0.001, p = 0.709, respectively). In patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2, both operation duration and port site hernia incidence were higher in simple suture closure than in the needle grasper technique (p < 0.001, p = 0.016, p = 0.005). Conclusions The needle grasper technique is easy, simple, safe, fast, and effective for fascia closure of port sites. This method can also be applied in obese patients easily, safely and in a short time.","Donmez, Turgut; Ozcevik, Halim; Sunamak, Oguzhan; Yildirim, Dogan",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,172,6

We sought to validate prospectively the comparability of SpO2/Fio2 to PaO2/Fio2 and oxygen saturation index to oxygenation index in children. We also sought to derive a noninvasive lung injury score. DESIGN Prospective, multicentered observational study in six pediatric intensive care units. PATIENTS One hundred thirty-seven mechanically ventilated children with SpO2 80% to 97% and an indwelling arterial catheter. INTERVENTIONS Simultaneous blood gas, pulse oximetry, and ventilator settings were collected. Derivation and validation data sets were generated, and linear mixed modeling was used to derive predictive equations. Model performance and fit were evaluated using the validation data set. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS One thousand one hundred ninety blood gas, SpO2, and ventilator settings from 137 patients were included. Oxygen saturation index had a strong linear association with oxygenation index in both derivation and validation data sets, given by the equation oxygen saturation index = 2.76 1 0.547*oxygenation index (derivation). 1/SpO2/Fio2 had a strong linear association with 1/PaO2/Fio2 in both derivation and validation data sets given by the equation 1/SpO2/Fio2 = 0.00232 1 0.443/PaO2/Fio2 (derivation). SpO2/Fio2 criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury were 221 (95% confidence interval 215-226) and 264 (95% confidence interval 259-269). Multivariate models demonstrated that oxygenation index, serum pH, and Paco(2) were associated with oxygen saturation index (p < .05); and 1/PaO2/Fio2, mean airway pressure, serum pH, and Paco2 were associated with 1/SpO2/Fio2 (p < .05). There was strong concordance between the derived noninvasive lung injury score and the original pediatric modification of lung injury score with a mean difference of 20.0361 α0.264 sd. CONCLUSIONS Lung injury severity markers, which use SpO2, are adequate surrogate markers for those that use PaO2 in children with respiratory failure for SpO2 between 80% and 97%. They should be used in clinical practice to characterize risk, to increase enrollment in clinical trials, and to determine disease prevalence.","Khemani, Robinder G; Thomas, Neal J; Venkatachalam, Vani; Scimeme, Jason P; Berutti, Ty; Schneider, James B; Ross, Patrick A; Willson, Douglas F; Hall, Mark W; Newth, Christopher J L",Critical care medicine,172,16

METHODS We included data from the CRISP (Computed Tomographic Perfusion to Predict Response in Ischemic Stroke Project) in which all patients underwent a baseline CTP scan before endovascular therapy. Patients were included if they had a mismatch on their baseline CTP scan and achieved successful endovascular reperfusion. Patients with mismatch were categorized into target mismatch and malignant mismatch profiles, according to the volume of their Tmax >10s lesion volume (target mismatch, <100 mL; malignant mismatch, >100 mL). We investigated the impact of CTP-to-reperfusion times on probability of achieving functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2) at day 90 and radiographic outcomes at day 5. RESULTS Of 156 included patients, 108 (59%) had the target mismatch profile, and 48 (26%) had the malignant mismatch profile. In patients with the target mismatch profile, CTP-to-reperfusion time showed no association with functional independence (P=0.84), whereas in patients with malignant mismatch profile, CTP-to-reperfusion time was strongly associated with lower probability of functional independence (odds ratio, 0.08; P=0.003). Compared with patients with target mismatch, those with the malignant mismatch profile had significantly more infarct growth (90 [49-166] versus 43 [18-81] mL; P=0.006) and larger final infarct volumes (110 [61-155] versus 48 [21-99] mL; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Compared with target mismatch patients, those with the malignant profile experience faster infarct growth and a steeper decline in the odds of functional independence, with longer delays between baseline imaging and reperfusion. However, this does not exclude the possibility of treatment benefit in patients with a malignant profile.","Tsai, Jenny P; Mlynash, Michael; Christensen, Soren; Kemp, Stephanie; Kim, Sun; Mishra, Nishant K; Federau, Christian; Nogueira, Raul G; Jovin, Tudor G; Devlin, Thomas G; Akhtar, Naveed; Yavagal, Dileep R; Bammer, Roland; Straka, Matus; Zaharchuk, Gregory; Marks, Michael P; Albers, Gregory W; Lansberg, Maarten G",Stroke,172,8

Here, we investigate whether Mss51 deletion in the mdx murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mdx-Mss51 KO) counteracts the muscle pathology and mitochondrial irregularities observed in mdx mice. We found that mdx-Mss51 KO mice had increased myofiber oxygen consumption rates and an amelioration of muscle histopathology compared to mdx counterparts. This corresponded with greater treadmill endurance and less percent fatigue in muscle physiology, but no improvement in forelimb grip strength or limb muscle force production.

The advent of a new surgical approach is a reminder of the increase in bile duct injuries in the past when laparoscopic cholecystectomy was first introduced. With this in mind, the authors describe a safe and reproducible approach to SILC. METHODS Between August 2008 and August 2009, 20 patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease underwent SILC using a totally transumbilical fundus-first approach with an intraoperative cholangiogram. Data including pain scores were collected prospectively. RESULTS In this initial series, the median operative time was 103 min (range, 55-177 min), including the time for two patients undergoing additional procedures at the time of surgery. Intraoperative cholangiograms were completed for 18 of 19 patients. Additional ports were required in four patients for safe completion of the procedure. The mean pain score 12 h postoperatively was 2.5 on a visual analogue scale with a range of 0-10. There was no morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION According to the findings, SILC with an intraoperative cholangiogram can be performed safely using a fundus-first approach. However, for SILC to become the operation of choice for the treatment of gallbladder disease, evidence is required to demonstrate its advantage over laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Patel, Ameet G; Murgatroyd, B; Carswell, K; Belgaumkar, A",Surgical endoscopy,172,30

This review details the latest evidence on the neuropathogenesis and neurologic complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RECENT FINDINGS Commonly reported neurologic complications include toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disorders, seizures, and anoxic-brain injury. These complications represent secondary injury due to COVID-19 related hypoxia, sepsis, hypercoagulability, or hyperinflammation. Postinfectious complications, such as encephalitis, postinfectious demyelination, and Guillain-Barre[Combining Acute Accent] syndrome have been reported, but are rare. Recent reports of persistent neurocognitive symptoms highlight the possibility of lasting impairment. SUMMARY Although some neurologic complications should be treated with standard practices, further investigations are still needed to determine the optimal treatment of COVID-related neurologic complications, such as ischemic stroke. Entering into the next phase of the pandemic, investigations into the long-term neurologic and cognitive impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be needed. Clinicians must have a high clinical suspicion for both acute and chronic neurologic complications among COVID-19 patients.","Hassett, Catherine E; Frontera, Jennifer A",Current opinion in infectious diseases,172,28

This phase 2 study examined the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin as adjunctive therapy in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with DSM-5-defined MDD and an inadequate response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Using a 2-stage sequential parallel-comparison design, patients were initially randomized in a 3:1 ratio to placebo or pimavanserin added to ongoing SSRI or SNRI therapy; at 5 weeks, placebo nonresponders were re-randomized to placebo or pimavanserin for an additional 5 weeks. Key endpoints were change from baseline to the end of each stage in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) total score and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) score. RESULTS Between December 2016 and October 2018, 207 patients were randomized. For the prespecified pooled Sequential Parallel Comparison Design analyses of Stages 1 and 2, the least squares (LS) mean (SE) difference for the HDRS-17 total score was -1.7 (0.85) (P = .039) and for the SDS score was -0.8 (0.29) (P = .004). At week 5 of Stage 1, LS mean (SE) difference for pimavanserin versus placebo was significant for changes on the HDRS-17 (-4.0 [1.09], P = .0003) and SDS (-1.2 [0.40], P = .0036) with effect sizes of 0.626 and 0.498, respectively. Early and sustained separation of pimavanserin from placebo (P < .05) occurred at 1 week. The most common adverse events with pimavanserin were dry mouth, nausea, and headache. CONCLUSIONS Pimavanserin demonstrated robust efficacy in patients with MDD and an inadequate response to an SSRI or SNRI. Tolerability was consistent with previous experience.

Crisis time is also a time for opportunities. With regard to telehealth, all players (providers, staff, and patients) should be informed about its benefits and should also become familiar with the use of the various telehealth options and this will only be achieved through large information campaigns necessary enriched by local teaching and training programs in both public and private institutions. The final aim is to launch the debate and foster ideas useful throughout the pandemic. This article covers the experiences of physicians as well as health professionals in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), to provide a clearer idea of what has happened and how we can improve it with the possibilities provided by telemedicine, while at the same time to put in evidence that public health systems need to be rethought to provide solutions to situations such as that we are experiencing.","Amorim, Paula; Brito, Dulce; Castelo-Branco, Miguel; Fàbrega, Carles; Gomes da Costa, Fernando; Martins, Henrique; Gonçalves, Luis; Gonçalves, Luis Martins; Martin, Verónica; Milner, James; Nêveda, Rui; Ferreira, Afonso Nunes; Pardo, Rafael; Peralta-Santos, André; Pessoa, Tomás; Silva, João; Salvador Vergès, Àngels",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,172,31

Yet, the failure rates after reconstruction are much higher than the adult population. The purpose of this paper is to understand failure rates, reasons for graft failure, and strategies for successful revision surgery. RECENT FINDINGS A complete understanding of the failure etiology is essential for the clinician treating this population prior to revision. This begins with an assessment of post-operative patient compliance and sporting activity. Surgical technique must then be scrutinized for non-anatomic tunnel placement and poor graft size/type. Concurrent bony deformity must also be addressed including lower extremity valgus alignment and tibial slope abnormalities. Meniscus and chondral injury must be aggressively treated. Furthermore, imaging must be examined to look for missed posterolateral corner injury. Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (in the setting of ligamentous laxity or rotational instability) may be also indicated as well. The surgeon can then choose a graft type and surgical technique that optimizes outcome and respects skeletal growth. Prior to surgical intervention, the clinician must also counsel patients in regard to the guarded prognosis and outcomes in this setting. Prolonged rehabilitation protocols/return-to-play timing as well as sporting activity modification in the post-operative period after revision are critical. There is limited literature on revision ACL reconstruction in the skeletally immature athlete. An understanding of all the risk factors for failure is essential in order to achieve treatment success.","Garcia, Steven; Pandya, Nirav K",Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,172,23

We aimed to examine reliability measures between two different ACT monitors using Bland-Altman analysis: bias should not exceed 50 ± 50 seconds for measurements performed during CPB or 10 ± 10 seconds before and after CPB. The ACT response should be linear in relation to the concentration of heparin in plasma. Twenty patients (n = 20) aged 20-80 years and admitted for coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled to this clinical observational study. ACT values and antifactor Xa were sampled: 1) before induction of anesthesia, 2) after heparin bolus, 3) during CPB at the start of rewarming, 4) at weaning from CPB, and 5) after heparin reversal. The evaluation comprised the Hemostasis Management System Plus™ (HMS, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and i-STAT™ (Abbott, Point of Care Inc., Princeton, NJ). Bias for the HMS Plus™ vs. i-STAT™ was +105 ± 119 seconds for measurements during CPB and +2.8 ± 11.7 seconds before and after CPB. Associated limits of agreement for the observed bias were ±235 and ±23 seconds, respectively. Inter-device correlation of ACT values was .46 (p < .001) during CPB; otherwise .48 (p = .02). Both devices produced ACT values unrelated (<10%) to the measured heparin concentration. The use of multivariable regression analysis demonstrated an independent association between the ACT measurement and hematocrit, however, not with the plasma concentration of heparin. ACT monitors demonstrate unacceptable bias differences, combined with wide limits of agreement. The ACT response correlated with hematocrit, but not with the actual heparin concentration.","Nilsson, Samuel; Appelblad, Micael; Svenmarker, Staffan",The journal of extra-corporeal technology,172,1

METHODS Fourteen patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure were treated with HFNC (FiO2 0.6, gas flow 55 l/min), NIV (FiO2 0.6, PEEP 5 cm H2O Hg, tidal volume 6-8 ml/kg ideal body weight,) and Venturi mask (FiO2 0.6, oxygen flow 15 l/min,) in a randomized order for 30 min each. Data collection included objective respiratory and circulatory parameters as well as a subjective rating of dyspnea and discomfort by the patients on a 10-point scale. In a final interview, all three methods were comparatively evaluated by each patient using a scale from 1 (=very good) to 6 (=failed) and the patients were asked to choose one method for further treatment. RESULTS PaO2 was highest under NIV (129 ± 38 mmHg) compared to HFNC (101 ± 34 mmHg, p <0.01 vs. NIV) and VM (85 ± 21 mmHg, p <0.001 vs. NIV, p <0.01 vs. HFNC, ANOVA). All other functional parameters showed no relevant differences. In contrast, dyspnea was significantly better using a HFNC (2.9 ± 2.1, 10-point Borg scale) compared to NIV (5.0 ± 3.3, p <0.05), whereas dyspnea rating under HFNC and VM (3.3 ± 2.3) was not significantly different. A similar pattern was found when patients rated their overall discomfort on the 10 point scale: HFNC 2.7 ± 1.8, VM 3.1 ± 2.8 (ns vs. HFNC), NIV 5.4 ± 3.1 (p <0.05 vs. HFNC). In the final evaluation patients gave the best ratings to HFNC 2.3 ± 1.4, followed by VM 3.2 ± 1.7 (ns vs. HFNC) and NIV 4.5 ± 1.7 (p <0.01 vs. HFNC and p <0.05 vs. VM). For further treatment 10 patients chose HFNC, three VM and one NIV. CONCLUSIONS In hypoxic respiratory failure HFNC offers a good balance between oxygenation and comfort compared to NIV and Venturi mask and seems to be well tolerated by patients.

We analyzed the outcomes of 483 patients who received HSCT between August 2017 and August 2020, at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Canada, in the retrospective study, comparing the outcomes between those who received cryopreserved or fresh peripheral blood stem cell grafts. Overall compared to those who received fresh grafts (n=348), patients who received cryopreserved grafts (n=135) had reduced survival and GRFS, reduced incidence of chronic GvHD, delay in neutrophil engraftment and higher graft failure, with no significant difference in relapse incidence or acute GvHD. However, recipients of cryopreserved matched related donor HSCT showed significantly worse OS, NRM, GRFS compared to fresh grafts. Multivariable analysis of the entire cohort showed significant impact of cryopreservation on OS, relapse, cGvHD, graft failure and GRFS. We conclude that cryopreservation was associated with inferior outcomes post-HSCT, possibly due to the combination of ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide impacting differential tolerance to cryopreservation on components of the stem cell graft; further studies are warranted to elucidate mechanisms for this observation.","Novitzky-Basso, Igor; Remberger, Mats; Chen, Carol; Pasić, Ivan; Lam, Wilson; Law, Arjun; Gerbitz, Armin; Viswabandya, Auro; Lipton, Jeffrey H; Kim, Dennis D; Kumar, Rajat; Mattsson, Jonas; Michelis, Fotios V",European journal of haematology,172,19

Various radiological subtypes of HT can be distinguished. Their influence on functional outcome is currently unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the associations between HT subtypes and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with proven large vessel occlusion included in the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic stroke in The Netherlands). METHODS All patients with follow-up imaging were included. HT was classified on follow-up CT scans according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II classification. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 90 days after stroke onset. Ordinal logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders was used to determine the association of HT subtypes with functional outcome. RESULTS Of 478 patients, 222 had HT. Of these, 76 (16%) patients were classified as hemorrhagic infarction type 1, 71 (15%) as hemorrhagic infarction type 2, 36 (8%) as parenchymal hematoma type 1, and 39 (8%) as parenchymal hematoma type 2. Hemorrhagic infarction type 2 (adjusted common OR (acOR) 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.89) and parenchymal hematoma type 2 (acOR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.78) were significantly associated with a worse functional outcome. Hemorrhagic infarction type 1 and parenchymal hematoma type 1 were not significantly associated, although their point estimates pointed in the direction of worse outcome. CONCLUSION This study suggests that parenchymal hematoma type 2 is relevant for functional outcome after an acute ischemic stroke, and smaller HTs might also influence long term functional outcome.

Consequently, a low magnesium status, which is often underdiagnosed, potentiates the reactivity to various immune challenges and is implicated in the pathophysiology of many common chronic diseases.

METHODS A systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS The search yielded 7995 unique records; 27 studies evaluating 20 interventions were included. The majority of studies were conducted in USA, with five in Australia and one in Peru. Study designs were cross-sectional (n=13); qualitative (n=5); mixed methods (n=4); experimental (n=3); and quasi-experimental (n=2). Relevance to participating Indigenous communities was rated moderate to low. Interventions were diverse in aims, ingredients, and outcomes. Aims involved (1) supporting the healthcare journey, (2) increasing knowledge, (3) providing psychosocial support, and (4) promoting dialogue about cancer. The main ingredients of the interventions were community meetings, patient navigation, arts, and printed/online/audio materials. Participants were predominately female.

With the widespread introduction of fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair by the Food and Drug Administration-approved Zenith Fenestrated endograft (ZFEN; Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) to the United States in 2012, clinicians gained the ability to apply the chimney technique to these custom devices for difficult anatomy. The purpose of this report was to demonstrate feasibility and to provide evidence on the performance of chimneys for the treatment of complex juxtarenal aneurysms that could not be adequately treated with ZFEN alone. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively maintained institutional ZFEN database capturing 110 fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repairs from October 2012 to January 2018 to identify patients undergoing a concomitant visceral artery chimney. All patients with <12 months of follow-up were excluded from further analysis. Demographic, anatomic, intraoperative, perioperative, and follow-up characteristics were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS Six patients met criteria and were included in this investigation. They were universally male with a mean age of 76.2 years at the time of ZFEN/chimney. Chimneys were placed in a total of six visceral arteries (n = 1 per patient) consisting of three renal arteries, two celiac arteries, and one accessory renal artery. Mean estimated blood loss and operative time were 283 mL and 298 minutes, respectively. Technical success was achieved in all cases. Two small type IA ""gutter"" endoleaks were detected early; both spontaneously resolved on follow-up. We observed no instances of chimney migration, stenosis, or thrombosis perioperatively or on follow-up. Two reinterventions were performed in these six patients; these consisted of a repeated renal stent for ostial stenosis at a main body fenestration and a common femoral artery endarterectomy and patch angioplasty for an access-related common femoral artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Use of ZFEN in conjunction with a singular chimney is safe, feasible, and durable in patients with difficult anatomy who do not meet instructions for use as demonstrated in this limited series.","Wang, S Keisin; Drucker, Natalie A; Dalsing, Michael C; Sawchuk, Alan P; Gupta, Alok K; Motaganahalli, Raghu L; Murphy, Michael P; Fajardo, Andres",Journal of vascular surgery,172,28

Its advantages cover both analytical performance as well as ecological greenness. The quality control of pharmaceuticals requires sensitive, fast and economic methodologies to provide a high throughput at desirable costs. The low energy and decreased solvent consumption make this technique green as well as economic, and hence it is much preferred by pharmaceutical industries. Remdesivir is a recent antiviral, previously used for the treatment of Ebola virus infections, which was approved by the US-FDA in 2020 for treatment of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Formulation and wide-scale production of this drug started recently and hence methodologies related to its quality control are highly required. A smart spectrofluorimetric method was validated as per the US-FDA guidelines for the facile estimation of Remdesivir. The assay of Remdesivir was based on its native fluorescence measurements at pH 4 and wavelengths of 244/405 nm. Calibration was achieved over the range of 1.0-65.0 ng mL-1. Different variables affecting the proposed methodology were studied to achieve maximum sensitivity, at limits of detection and quantification of 0.287 and 0.871 ng mL-1, respectively. The developed method is regarded as the first spectrofluorimetric one for the estimation of Remdesivir. The developed method was also utilized for the determination of the drug in its formulated IV infusion and in spiked human plasma.

Experiments were conducted with variable kaolin minerals mass contents (mixing ratios) in the soil columns. Measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) diminished with increased clay contents, i.e., Ks=0.00771, 0.00560, 0.00536, 0.00519, and 0.00314 cm s-1, for clay contents = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5%, respectively. Experimental NaCl concentrations in the effluent from the bottom of the soil columns were about constant for times t ≈ 800, 1200, 1300, 1400, and 3400 s from the beginning of a rinsing experiment for the clay contents = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5%, respectively. These NaCl concentrations then decreased with time quickly, and finally, approached zero. The presented model can reproduce experimental time variations of NaCl concentration in the effluent from the soil column reliably. Simulated salt mass left in the soil column with time also matches the experimental results for the clay contents = 0.2 and 0.5%. An inconsistency between simulated and experimental salt mass left in the soil columns becomes more significant as the clay content increases. These results suggest that the soil-water retention curve for the pure Toyoura sand can be applied to the soil column composed of kaolin minerals/Toyoura sand mixture when the clay content is small, i.e., less than 1%. Prediction of rinsing process becomes more difficult with increased clay content. However, the time required to remove saline water from the soil column to less than 1% of its initial value simulated by the model agrees closely with experimental results of 1000, 1500, 1700, 2100, and 5400 s, respectively.","Higashino, Makoto; Aso, Daiki; Stefan, Heinz G",Environmental science and pollution research international,172,16

We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-led oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) intervention in Kasensero, a hyperendemic fishing community (HIV prevalence: 37-41%) in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS This study was conducted among young people (15-24 years) and adult men (25+ years) between May and August 2019. The study entailed distribution of HIVST kits by trained ""peer-leaders,"" who were selected from existing social networks and trained in HIVST distribution processes. Peer-leaders received up to 10 kits to distribute to eligible social network members (i.e. aged 15-24 years if young people or 25+ years if adult man, not tested in the past 3 months, and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status at enrolment). The intervention was evaluated against the feasibility benchmark of 70% of peer-leaders distributing up to 70% of the kits that they received; and the acceptability benchmark of >80% of the respondents self-testing for HIV. RESULTS Of 298 enrolled into the study at baseline, 56.4% (n = 168) were young people (15-24 years) and 43.6% (n = 130) were adult males (25+ years). Peer-leaders received 298 kits and distributed 296 (99.3%) kits to their social network members. Of the 282 interviewed at follow-up, 98.2% (n = 277) reported that they used the HIVST kits. HIV prevalence was 7.4% (n = 21). Of the 57.1% (n = 12) first-time HIV-positives, 100% sought confirmatory HIV testing and nine of the ten (90%) respondents who were confirmed as HIV-positive were linked to HIV care within 1 week of HIV diagnosis. CONCLUSION Our findings show that a social network-based, peer-led HIVST intervention in a hyperendemic fishing community is highly feasible and acceptable, and achieves high linkage to HIV care among newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals.","Matovu, Joseph K B; Bogart, Laura M; Nakabugo, Jennifer; Kagaayi, Joseph; Serwadda, David; Wanyenze, Rhoda K; Ko, Albert I; Kurth, Ann E",PloS one,172,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Between January 2004 and December 2009, among 3,441 patients with treatment-naive HCCs, 88 patients meeting the Milan criteria with multiple HCCs (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] A stage) who underwent either RFA (n=62) or SR (n=26) were included. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were compared by using propensity score matching. In addition, multivariate analysis was performed for assess the prognostic factor. RESULTS Matching yielded 20 matched pairs of patients. In the two matched groups, the RFS rates were 30% and 30% at 5- and 10-years, respectively, in the RFA group and 60% and 48.6% in the SR group (p=0.054). The corresponding OS rates were 63.3% and 46.1% in the RFA group and 100% and 73.6% in the SR group, respectively (p=0.061). In multivariate analysis, treatment type was independently associated with RFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.51; p=0.043) whereas it was not a statistically significant factor for OS (HR=0.50; p=0.088).

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess trends in surgical practice and patient management involving elective and emergency surgery in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA The novel coronavirus has radically disrupted medical care in the first half of 2020. Little data exists regarding the exact nature of its effect on spine care. METHODS A 53-question survey was sent to the surgeon members of the LSRS. Respondents were contacted via email 3 times over a 2-week period in late April. Questions concentrated on surgical and clinical practice patterns before and after the pandemic. Other data included elective surgical schedules and volumes, as well as which emergency cases were being performed. Surgeons were asked about the status of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus testing. Circumstances for performing surgical intervention on patients with and without testing as well as patients testing positive were explored. RESULTS A total of 43 completed surveys were returned of 174 sent to active surgeons in the LSRS (25%). Elective lumbar spine procedures decreased by 90% in the first 2 months of the pandemic, but emergency procedures did not change. Patients with ""stable"" lumbar disease had surgeries deferred indefinitely, even beyond 8 weeks if necessary. In-person outpatient visits became increasingly rare events, as telemedicine consultations accounted for 67% of all outpatient spine appointments. In total, 91% surgeons were under some type of confinement. Only 11% of surgeons tested for the coronavirus on all surgical patients. CONCLUSIONS Elective lumbar surgery was significantly decreased in the first few months of the coronavirus pandemic, and much of outpatient spine surgery was practiced via telemedicine. Despite these constraints, spine surgeons performed emergency surgery when indicated, even when the COVID-19 status of patients was unknown.

The 2020 CoSTRs for neonatal life support are published either as new statements or, if appropriate, reiterations of existing statements when the task force found they remained valid. Evidence review topics of particular interest include the use of suction in the presence of both clear and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, sustained inflations for initiation of positive-pressure ventilation, initial oxygen concentrations for initiation of resuscitation in both preterm and term infants, use of epinephrine (adrenaline) when ventilation and compressions fail to stabilize the newborn infant, appropriate routes of drug delivery during resuscitation, and consideration of when it is appropriate to redirect resuscitation efforts after significant efforts have failed.

To reduce wound-related complications, purse-string skin closure was introduced as an alternative to conventional linear skin closure. This study is designed to compare wound infection rates and operative outcomes between linear and purse-string skin closure after a loop ileostomy reversal. METHODS Between December 2002 and October 2010, a total of 48 consecutive patients undergoing a loop ileostomy reversal were enrolled. Outcomes were compared between linear skin closure (group L, n = 30) and purse string closure (group P, n = 18). The operative technique for linear skin closure consisted of an elliptical incision around the stoma, with mobilization, and anastomosis of the ileum. The rectus fascia was repaired with interrupted sutures. Skin closure was performed with vertical mattress interrupted sutures. Purse-string skin closure consisted of a circumstomal incision around the ileostomy using the same procedures as used for the ileum. Fascial closure was identical to linear closure, but the circumstomal skin incision was approximated using a purse-string subcuticular suture (2-0 Polysorb). RESULTS Between group L and P, there were no differences of age, gender, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores. Original indication for ileostomy was 23 cases of malignancy (76.7%) in group L, and 13 cases of malignancy (77.2%) in group P. The median time duration from ileostomy to reversal was 4.0 months (range, 0.6 to 55.7 months) in group L and 4.1 months (range, 2.2 to 43.9 months) in group P. The median operative time was 103 minutes (range, 45 to 260 minutes) in group L and 100 minutes (range, 30 to 185 minutes) in group P. The median hospital stay was 11 days (range, 5 to 4 days) in group L and 7 days (range, 4 to 14 days) in group P (P < 0.001). Wound infection was found in 5 cases (16.7%) in group L and in one case (5.6%) in group L (P = 0.26). CONCLUSION Based on this study, purse-string skin closure after a loop ileostomy reversal showed comparable outcomes, in terms of wound infection rates, to those of linear skin closure. Thus, purse-string skin closure could be a good alternative to the conventional linear closure.","Lee, Jung Ryeol; Kim, Young Wan; Sung, Jong Je; Song, Ok-Pyung; Kim, Hyung Chul; Lim, Cheol-Wan; Cho, Gyu-Seok; Jung, Jun Chul; Shin, Eung-Jin",Journal of the Korean Society of Coloproctology,172,31

Visceral surgeons are more often confronted with laparoscopic surgery in obese patients. Besides validated surgery procedures, such as cholecystectomy and gastroesophageal reflux surgery, bariatric procedures are increasingly performed. In obese patients, the thickness of adipose panicle makes open laparoscopy hazardous. METHODS In our department, we use systematically a technique of open laparoscopy in obese patients for supramesocolic surgery, which is safe, reproducible, and permits good closure of the abdominal wall. RESULTS The surgical technique consists of opening the abdominal wall through the rectus abdominis. Helped by specific retractors called Descottes (Medtronic Laboratory), both fascias are charged by sutures separately. Incision in the fascias is made safely by pooling on sutures. Introduction of port-site is made under view control. At the end of laparoscopy, closure of both fascias is easily done. CONCLUSIONS We present a technique of open laparoscopy in obese patients, systematically used, for supramesocolic surgery.

Sleep apnoea causes hypoxaemia, and nocturnal oxygen desaturation is diagnostic in these patients. We tested the hypothesis that STOP-BANG score is associated with hypoxaemia after noncardiac surgery. METHODS This analysis was a sub-study of VISION, a prospective cohort study of perioperative cardiovascular events. With institutional review board approval, we included 630 patients in the final analysis. We assessed the association between the STOP-BANG score and postoperative hypoxaemia, defined as integrated area under the curve of [Formula: see text] saturation of 90% per h using median quantile regression. Secondarily, we selected a subset of STOP-BANG questions that best predicts postoperative hypoxaemia using 'Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator' method, and then assessed the association between the new score based on the selected questions and the primary outcome using quantile regression. RESULTS The median [q1, q3] area under [Formula: see text] of 90% per h was 0.09 [0.02, 0.39] %-h. The STOP-BANG score was not associated with hypoxaemia, with a multivariable slope coefficient of 0.002 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.01) %-h for a unit increase in the score (P=0.76). Secondarily, no association was found between the new score based on the two retained STOP-BANG questions, treatment for hypertension and neck circumference >40 cm, and the primary outcome with a multivariable slope coefficient of 0.03 (98.3% CI: -0.01, 0.06) %-h/score (P=0.07).

Given the fact that the testes and central nervous system are both immune privilege sites and the fact that Ebola virus and Zika virus can avoid immune clearance and continue proliferating and spreading by hiding in those sites, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in immune privilege sites, it attacks those sites, and it spreads again after proliferating in those sites needs to be investigated.","Xia, Jufeng",Bioscience trends,172,1

In this theoretical study, we show that acoustic streaming can be suppressed by two orders of magnitude in major regions of a fluid by optimizing the shape of its confining walls. Remarkably, the acoustic pressure is not suppressed in this shape-optimized cavity, and neither is the acoustic radiation force on suspended particles. This basic insight may lead to applications, such as acoustophoretic handling of nm-sized particles, which is otherwise impaired by the streaming.","Bach, Jacob S; Bruus, Henrik",Physical review letters,172,1

OBJECTIVE To assess the potential benefits of echinacea as a treatment of common cold. DESIGN Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00065715) SETTING Dane County, Wisconsin. PATIENTS 719 patients, aged 12 to 80 years, with new-onset common cold. INTERVENTION Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 parallel groups: no pills, placebo pills (blinded), echinacea pills (blinded), or echinacea pills (unblinded, open-label). Echinacea groups received the equivalent of 10.2 g of dried echinacea root during the first 24 hours and 5.1 g during each of the next 4 days. Indistinguishable placebo tablets contained only inert ingredients. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was the area under the curve for global severity, with severity assessed twice daily by self-report using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey, short version. Secondary outcomes included interleukin-8 levels and neutrophil counts from nasal wash, assessed at intake and 2 days later. RESULTS Of the 719 patients enrolled, 713 completed the protocol. Mean age was 33.7 years, 64% were female, and 88% were white. Mean global severity was 236 and 258 for the blinded and unblinded echinacea groups, respectively; 264 for the blinded placebo group; and 286 for the no-pill group. A comparison of the 2 blinded groups showed a 28-point trend (95% CI, -69 to 13 points) toward benefit for echinacea (P = 0.089). Mean illness duration in the blinded and unblinded echinacea groups was 6.34 and 6.76 days, respectively, compared with 6.87 days in the blinded placebo group and 7.03 days in the no-pill group. A comparison of the blinded groups showed a nonsignificant 0.53-day (CI, -1.25 to 0.19 days) benefit (P = 0.075). Median change in interleukin-8 levels and neutrophil counts were also not statistically significant (30 ng/L and 1 cell/high-power field [hpf] in the no-pill group, 39 ng/L and 1 cell/hpf in the blinded placebo group, 58 ng/L and 2 cells/hpf in the blinded echinacea group, and 70 ng/L and 1 cell/hpf in the open-label echinacea group). LIMITATION Higher-than-expected variability limited power to detect small benefits. CONCLUSION Illness duration and severity were not statistically significant with echinacea compared with placebo. These results do not support the ability of this dose of the echinacea formulation to substantively change the course of the common cold.

Currently, there are no clinically approved drugs or effective vaccines for FIP. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of FIP is still not fully understood. There is an urgent need for an effective infection model of feline infectious peritonitis induced by FIPV. Here, we constructed a field type I FIPV full-length cDNA clone, pBAC-QS, corresponding to the isolated FIPV QS. By replacing the FIPV QS spike gene with the commercially available type II FIPV 79-1146 (79-1146_CA) spike gene, we established and rescued a recombinant virus, designated rQS-79. Moreover, we constructed 79-1146_CA infectious full-length cDNA pBAC-79-1146_CA, corresponding to recombinant FCoV 79-1146_CA (r79-1146_CA). In animal experiments with one- to two-year-old adult cats orally infected with the recombinant virus, rQS-79 induced typical FIP signs and 100% mortality. In contrast to cats infected with rQS-79, cats infected with 79-1146_CA did not show obvious signs. Furthermore, by rechallenging rQS-79 in surviving cats previously infected with 79-1146_CA, we found that there was no protection against rQS-79 with different titers of neutralizing antibodies. However, high titers of neutralizing antibodies may help prolong the cat survival time. Overall, we report the first reverse genetics of virulent recombinant FCoV (causing 100% mortality in adult cats) and attenuated FCoV (causing no mortality in adult cats), which will be powerful tools to study the pathogenesis, antiviral drugs and vaccines for FCoV. Importance Tissue- or cell culture-adapted feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) usually loses pathogenicity. To develop a highly virulent FIPV, we constructed a field isolate type I FIPV full-length clone with the spike gene replaced by the 79-1146 spike gene, corresponding to a virus named rQS-79, which induces high mortality in adult cats. rQS-79 represents the first described reverse genetics system for highly pathogenic FCoV. By further constructing the cell culture-adapted FCoV 79-1146_CA, we obtained infectious clones of virulent and attenuated FCoV. By in vitro and in vivo experiments, we established a model that can serve to study the pathogenic mechanisms of FIPV. Importantly, the wild-type FIPV replicase skeleton of serotype I will greatly facilitate the screening of antiviral drugs, both in vivo and in vitro.","Wang, Gang; Hu, Guangli; Liang, Rui; Shi, Jiale; Qiu, Xiuxiu; Yang, Yiling; Jiao, Zhe; Chen, Yixi; Shen, Zhou; Li, Mengxia; Shi, Yuejun; Mao, Junfu; Peng, Guiqing",Journal of virology,172,1

This study assessed the appointment processes and terms for deans, directors, and chairs of schools and programs of public health and their views on term limits. METHODS A 10-question survey was developed for the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health and provided electronically to 127 deans and program directors in November and December 2019, of whom 58 (46%) responded. RESULTS Of 54 respondents to the question on term limits, 45 deans and directors of schools and programs of public health served with no terms or limits and 9 served with terms of 3-5 years with no limits on the number of terms. Respondents largely agreed with most arguments for or against term limits. Of 51 respondents, most indicated completely or moderately valid support for 2 arguments for term limits: diversity (n = 40) and succession planning (n = 40). Of 51 respondents, most indicated completely or moderately valid support for 3 arguments against term limits: stable and continuous leadership (n = 40), time for leadership development (n = 37), and loss of institutional memory (n = 35). Twenty-seven of 53 responding deans and directors viewed the most appropriate terms and limits as being more restrictive than their current terms; the other 26 viewed the most appropriate terms as being the same as their current terms. No respondents preferred less restrictive limits than their current terms. CONCLUSION Although term limits for deans, directors, and chairs are rare in schools and programs of public health, many deans and directors view term limits as appropriate. Schools and programs may reconsider their current policies for term limits.","Smith, Dean G",Public health reports,172,1

METHODS A structured interview was conducted with parents of living or deceased patients with GD2. Retrospective information obtained included disease presentation, progression, medical and surgical history, medications, family history, management, complications, and cause of death, as well as the impact of disease on families. RESULTS Data from 23 patients were analyzed (20 deceased and 3 living), showing a mean age at death of 19.2 months, ranging from 3 - 55 months. Fourteen patients were treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 2 were treated with substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 3 underwent bone marrow transplantation. Five patients received Ambroxol and one was on N-acetylcysteine, both considered experimental treatments. Fifteen patients had gastrostomy tubes (G-Tube) placed, while 10 underwent tracheostomies. Neurological disease manifestations included choking episodes, myoclonic jerks, autonomic dysfunction, apnea, seizures and diminished blinking, all of which worsened as disease progressed. CONCLUSIONS Current available therapies appear to prolong life but do not alter neurological manifestations. Despite aggressive therapeutic interventions, GD2 still remains a progressive disorder with a devastating prognosis, that may benefit from new treatment approaches.","Roshan Lal, Tamanna; Seehra, Gurpreet K; Steward, Alta M; Poffenberger, Chelsie; Ryan, Emory; Tayebi, Nahid; Lopez, Grisel; Sidransky, Ellen",Neurology,172,24

A significantly high frequency of aberrations was seen in peripheral blood lymphocytes of exposed subjects as compared with nonexposed ones. Most CAs were present as loss (aneuploidy) and were observed significantly in subjects having a history of alcohol consumption. It can be, thus, concluded that agricultural workers exposed to a mixture of pesticides, in addition to being alcoholic, are at a greater risk of genotoxic damage.

The current project examined relationships between workers' knowledge and perceptions of their employer's COVID-19 safety responses, job attitudes, and health. We surveyed transit workers (N = 174) between July and August 2020 and followed up 3 months later. Fifty-seven workers responded to the follow-up survey. Surveys addressed workers' knowledge and perceptions of their employer implementing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended COVID-19 safety responses, COVID-19 risk perceptions, job attitudes, and health factors. Employees reported knowledge of their employer implementing ~8 of 12 CDC-recommended responses. The most reported response was informational poster placements; the least reported was designating a point-person for COVID-19 concerns. Significant associations were found between knowledge of employer safety responses and lower COVID-19 risk perceptions, better job attitudes, and greater mental and global health. Operators (i.e. public-facing workers) reported worse perceptions of employer responses, and higher COVID-19 risk perceptions, work stress, and turnover intentions, compared with non-operators. A time-lagged panel model found that COVID-19 risk perceptions significantly mediated the relationship between public-facing work status and follow-up depression, anxiety, stress, and global health. Results reveal opportunities for transit authorities to broaden and better communicate their responses to emergent occupational safety and health crises.","Rice, Sean P M; Greenspan, Leah S; Bauer, Talya N; Rimby, Jarred; Bodner, Todd E; Olson, Ryan",Annals of work exposures and health,172,1

Early work focused on rapid sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequent in-vitro and in-silico work, along with greater understanding of the different clinical phases of the infection, have helped identify a catalogue of potential therapeutic agents requiring assessment. In a pandemic, there is a need to quickly identify efficacious treatments, and reject those that are non-beneficial or even harmful, using randomised clinical trials. Whilst each potential treatment could be investigated across multiple, separate, competing two-arm trials, this is a very inefficient process. Despite the very large numbers of interventional trials for COVID-19, the vast majority have not used efficient trial designs. Well conducted, adaptive platform trials utilising a multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) approach provide a solution to overcome limitations of traditional designs. The multi-arm element allows multiple different treatments to be investigated simultaneously against a shared, standard-of-care control arm. The multi-stage element uses interim analyses to assess accumulating data from the trial and ensure that only treatments showing promise continue to recruitment during the next stage of the trial. The ability to test many treatments at once and drop insufficiently active interventions significantly speeds up the rate at which answers can be achieved. This article provides an overview of the benefits of MAMS designs and successes of trials, which have used this approach to COVID-19. We also discuss international collaboration between trial teams, including prospective agreement to synthesise trial results, and identify the most effective interventions. We believe that international collaboration will help provide faster answers for patients, clinicians, and health care systems around the world, including for future waves of COVID-19, and enable preparedness for future global health pandemics.","Noor, Nurulamin M; Pett, Sarah L; Esmail, Hanif; Crook, Angela M; Vale, Claire L; Sydes, Matthew R; Parmar, Mahesh K B",F1000Research,172,1

Pseudocyesis is a condition in which the patient has all signs and symptoms of pregnancy except for the confirmation of the presence of a fetus. There has been described symptoms as abdominal distention, cessation of menses, morning sickness, etc.ObjectivesThe aim of this work was to distinguish between pseudocyesis and pseudopregnancy. This case presents a single 49-year-old woman, who developed the delusion of being pregnant after months of lonely confinement during Covid-19 quarantine.MethodsShe had missed her period for 10 months. She was convinced that she could feel the fetal movements. Her thought content revealed delusion of persecution, reference, and delusion of being pregnant. She did not reveal any hallucinations. Blood tests and brain imaging revealed no abnormalities. □The treatment was started with Paliperidone 100mg/month, and clonazepam 2mg/d.ResultsThe patient showed a substantial improvement within 10 weeks of treatment. Pseudocyesis and delusional pregnancy have been rarely described on scientific bibliography. A distinction has been demonstrated based on the consideration of the associated psychotic features that might be present in delusions of pregnancy, which were described in the current case. On the other hand, pseudocyesis clinical presentation is centered on the false signs and symptoms of pregnancy.ConclusionsAntipsychotics played a key role in the delusion of pregnancy. Psychodynamic and supportive psychotherapy could play a pivotal role in the management of pseudocyesis.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Tascon Guerra, M.

We turn to this body of feminist scholarship as it enables us to attune to what is happening, what remains unspoken and to pay attention to “the little things” that may be lost in a big crisis. Writing through the complexity of embodied affects (fear, loss, hope), we focus on the challenge to humanist notions of “agency” posed by these shifting timespace relations of home confinement, restricted movement and altered work-leisure routines.

Among Spanish patients, 56,799 deaths have been reported. Although we have been in this situation of pandemic for a year, studies that show risk mortality rates in patients with rheumatic diseases continue to be scarce. Objectives: In patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and infected with Covid -19, a) we want to assess the mortality rate (MR) related to COVID-19;and b) to analyze the role of RMDs in mortality risk. Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the epidemic peak in Madrid (1stMar to 20thMay2020). All patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of RMDs and SARS -CoV 2 infection were included (according to a medical diagnosis or confirmed with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic test). All patients were included since the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Main outcome: death related to COVID-19 infection. Independent variable: type of RMDs including: autoimmune (systemic autoimmune conditions (SAC) and inflammatory joint disease (IJD)) and non-autoimmune (mechanical diseases and inflammatory diseases (microcrystalline arthritis and tendonitis)). Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, chronic use of corticoids prior to COVID-19 infection. Survival techniques were used to estimate the MR related to COVID-19, given per 1,000 persons-month with a 95% confidence interval [CI]. The time of observation comprised the elapsed time between the date of COVID-19 diagnosis of infection until the date of patient's death, or end of study. Cox multiple regression analysis was run to examine the effect of autoimmune RMDs compared to non-autoimmune RMDs on mortality risk adjusted by sex, age and comorbidities. Results were expressed by Hazard Ratio (HR) and [CI]. Results: 406 patients were included with RMD and Covid -19 infection with a total follow-up 642.5 patients-month. 69.21% were women with a mean age at diagnosis of 60 ± 15.26 years. The evolution time from the diagnosis of rheumatic disease was 8 ± 8.38 years. 26% had comorbidity at baseline. 25% were chronically on corticoids prior to the infection. Of the 406 patients, 244 (60.09%) had non-autoimmune RMD (157 mechanic, 87 inflammatory) and 162 (39.9%) (106 (65.43%) IJD, 56 (34.56%) systemic condition) had autoimmune RMD. Of the 406 patients, 45 (11%) died during the follow-up, being 12± 14 days the mean time from infection to death (P50: 6[2-12] and a maximum of 60 days). MR was estimated in 70.03 [52.28-93.79] per 1,000 persons-month. MR was higher for men (MR 105[68-163]) than for women (MR 55 [37.2-81.6]) and in older people (MR <60: 4.4, [0.6-31.7];MR 60-75 years: 38.7[17.3-86.2];MR ≥75Years: 486 [354-1668]). The HR of mortality in autoimmune RMDs compared to non-autoimmune RMDs did not achieved statistical significance (HR: 1.39 [0.77-2.5], p=0.27). After adjusting for confounders, we did not find higher risk of mortality among the different types of RMDs (HR autoimmune vs non-autoinmunes: HR: 1.12 [0.6-2.02], p=0.7;HR IJD vs SAC;1.5 [0.6-3.6], p=0.34;HR non-autoimmune vs SAC: 1.1 [0.5-2.5], P=0.7). Age (HR: 1.12;[1.10-1.15], p<0.001), and the presence of comorbidities (HR: 2.05;[1.08-3.89], p=0.027) increased the Mortality risk. Conclusion: In patients with RMD and COVID-19 infection, we found a mortality rate of 7 per 100 persons-month. This study shows that the mortality risk related to COVID-19 is similar between autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases after adjusting by confounders. We also found that age and comorbidities are risk factors for mortality related to COVID-19 infection.","Freites, D.; Perez-Sancristobal, I.; Lopez Pedraza, L.; Álvarez Hernandez, M.

Mechanisms to address shortages are particularly important in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Canadian Blood Services (CBS), the national blood center serving Canada except Quebec, called a national Green Advisory Phase from May to June 2020 on platelet products and O negative red blood cells, requesting daily hospital inventory reports. When such shortages occur, it may be challenging to identify which surgical procedures are likely to require platelet transfusion support and should therefore be rescheduled. Methods: Information systems maintained by the Blood Transfusion Service (Wellsky®) and the Department of Surgical Services (ORSOS®) were cross-referenced for the 2019 calendar year at a large adult teaching hospital in Toronto with active cardiovascular and transplant programs. Only procedures that were performed more than 25 times during this period were included in the analysis. Average platelet consumption on the day of surgery, 1 week post-operatively and 30 days post-operatively was calculated. Results: 50 procedures with a potential for requiring intra-operative platelet transfusion support were identified, with the greatest demand being those involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) support (27% of cases transfused, median of 2.7 units per case) and heart, liver and lung transplantation (24% of cases transfused, median of 4.2 units per case). Although spinal surgery as a group was not a high platelet consumer (4% of cases transfused, median of 0.3 units per case), certain complex procedures such as thoracic-lumbar laminectomy and thoracic-lumbar decompression and fusion were more at risk of requiring platelet support during and in the post-operative period. Due to their frequency, procedures on CPB created the highest demand in platelets with close to 4500 units distributed during the year. Standard deviations for many procedures was large, up to 10 units in the intra-operative period. Other procedures with low-risk of intra-operative platelet transfusion support but a possibility of requiring platelet transfusion in the 30-day post-operative period included renal transplantation and neurosurgical procedures. Interestingly, renal transplant patients generally did not require transfusion support during surgery or in the immediate post-operative period but only when looking at 30-day requirements. For most patients, these procedures would therefore be at risk only in the setting of very prolonged shortages. Conclusion: Data-driven demand forecasting for intra-operative and post-operative platelet transfusion support may be of value in risk-benefit analysis of proceeding with specific surgical procedures in the setting of platelet shortages. However, some of the procedures with the highest platelet consumption serve the sickest patients and cannot be postponed.

171630,171630,171630,Outcomes in inflammatory arthropathy patients hospitalized for COVID-19,16.39936,10.613919,2021,"Background. The majority of COVID-19 symptom presentations in adults and children appear to run their course within a couple of weeks. However, a subgroup of adults has started to emerge with effects lasting several months or more after initial infection. However, little is known about long term physical, mental and social health effects of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. The purpose of this review was to determine these impacts well into the second year of the pandemic. Methods. A search was conducted using PUBMED, Web of Science, Science Direct, and COCHRANE between 11/1/2019 and 9/1/2021. Search inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) COVID-19 illness and symptoms in children; (2) SARS-COv2 in children; (3) English language; and (4) human studies only. Results. The few studies that have documented long-term physical symptoms in children show that fatigue, difficulty in concentrating (brain fog), sleep disturbances, and sensory problems are the most reported outcomes. Most studies examining the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric populations have focused on initial clinical presentation, and symptoms, which are similar to those in adult populations. Additionally, COVID-19 has had a moderate impact on children and adolescents social environment, which may exacerbate current and future physiological, psychological, behavioral, and academic outcomes. Conclusions. There are limited studies reporting long physical symptoms of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. However, pediatric COVID-19 cases are underreported due to low rates of testing and symptomatic infection, which calls for more longitudinal studies. Children who have experienced COVID-19 illness should be monitored for long physiological, psychological, behavioral, and academic outcomes.","Borel, M.; Xie, L.; Mihalcea, A.; Kahn, J.; Messiah, S.

The current scantiness of viral genomic data and underutilisation of advanced molecular analysis methods on influenza viruses circulating in Africa has limited their extensive study and representation in the global influenza ecology. We aimed to sequence influenza type-A viruses (IAVs) that previously circulated in Uganda and characterised their genetic relatedness to the vaccine viruses and publicly available Africa IAVs. Methods This was an observational study nested to the Uganda national influenza surveillance programme. We used Next-generation sequencing to locally generate genomes from 116 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 118 A(H3N2) viruses collected between 2010 and 2018 from 7 districts across Uganda. A total of 206 hemagglutinin (HA), 207 neuraminidase (NA), and 213 matrix protein (MP) sequences were genetically compared to the WHO-recommended vaccines and other viruses isolated from Africa since 1994. Viral temporal and spatial divergence and circulating genetic clades were characterised using phylogenetic methods. Findings We successfully generated gene sequences for 91·9% (215/234) viruses. Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus HA, NA, and MP proteins had 96·36-99·09%, 96·49-99·39%, and 97·48-99·95% amino acid similarity, respectively, to vaccines recommended from 2010 through 2020. The local viruses incorporated amino acid substitutions (AAS) in their antigenic, receptor binding, and glycosylation sites each year causing them to antigenically drift away from vaccines. For seasons when vaccine formulations differed, Uganda IAV antigenic sites had 1-2 extra AAS relative to the Southern than Northern hemisphere vaccine viruses. All Uganda IAVs carried the adamantine-resistance marker S31N but not the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance markers H274Y and H275Y. However, some A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had permissive substitutions V234I, N369K, and V241I typical of NAI-resistant viruses. The 2017-2018 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to global genetic clade 6B.1, while the A(H3N2) viruses isolated in 2017 belonged to clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a. Uganda IAVs obtained before 2016 clustered distinctly from other Africa viruses while later viruses mixed with other Africa, especially Kenya and Congo, and global viruses. Several unique viral lineages (bootstrap >90) persisted in Uganda and other countries for 1-3 years. Interpretation The study reveals Uganda as part of the global influenza ecology with continuous importation, antigenic drift, and extensive local transmission of IAVs, presenting a potential risk of future outbreaks. For a country with limited health resources and where social distancing is not sustainable, viral prevention by vaccination should be prioritized. The notable viral diversity in Africa is a warning to countries to broaden and incorporate genome analysis in routine surveillance to monitor circulating and detect new viruses. This knowledge can inform virus selection for vaccine production and assist in developing cost-effective virus control strategies.

Design: Claims-based retrospective cohort study of incidence. Setting: US commercial health insurance administrative claims database. Participants: Adults 25-65 years of age between 2015 and 2019 with a minimum of 12 consecutive thrombosis-free months of continuous enrollment beginning 2014 were selected. Main Outcomes: Age (10 year intervals) and sex stratum specific incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were determined for: venous thromboembolism (VTE), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), and any major thrombosis. Incidence also was estimated for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Results: Among approximately 15 million enrollees per year (half female/male), incidence of any thrombotic event (DVT, PE, CVT, or other thrombosis) was 247.89 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 245.96, 249.84). Incidence of VTE was 213.79 with ICD codes alone (95% CI: 211.99, 215.59) and 127.18 (95% CI: 125.80, 128.58) when also requiring a filled anticoagulation prescription. Incidence rates were 6.37 for CVT (95% CI: 6.07, 6.69), 26.06 for ITP (95% CI: 25.44, 26.78), 0.94 for HUS (95% CI: 0.82, 1.06), and 4.82 for HIT (95% CI: 4.56, 5.10). The co-occurrence of CVT with either ITP or HIT (diagnoses within 14 days of one another) was 0.090 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.13). Incidence tended to increase with age and was higher for women under 55. Incidence for CVT, HUS, and CVT with ITP or HIT was higher for women in all age groups. Conclusions: These results are the first US estimates for incidence of thrombotic and rare events in a large, commercially-insured US population. Findings provide a critically important reference for determining excess morbidity associated with COVID-19 and more generally for vaccine pharmacovigilance.","Weller, S.

In the past, they were thought to cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract. The emergence at the beginning of the 21st century of two highly transmissible and pathogenic β-coronaviruses, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS- CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing respiratory failure leading to the death of a large number of patients, highlighted a significant threat to the entire world. The 21st century has brought events at a catastrophic scale - the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 virus from the Coronaviridae family responsible for the disease, appeared at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and in a short time has lead to the devastation of lives of millions of people around the world. A comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and other available β-coronavirus genomes indicates the closest association of SARS-CoV-2 with the BatCov RaTG13 bat coronavirus strain (96% similarity). Therefore, it is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 virus may have evolved naturally from the RaTG13 virus strain transmitted by bats. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic include, among others, a significant number of illnesses and fatalities, inefficiency of health care systems, mental disorders and unprecedented methods of fighting the pandemic requiring closure of large sectors of the economy and a drastic reduction of interpersonal contacts. This survey presents basic information about β-coronaviruses. It also describes the course of COVID-19, taking into account a wide range of clinical symptoms from the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, reproductive and nervous systems, kidneys and skin. In addition, problems of mental disorders related to the current situation, both in patients and medical personnel as well as in general population, are discussed. The most common symptoms of COVID- 19 in children are presented.

Nees is a medicinal plant of huge pharmaceutical value, having antiviral, anti-inflammatory properties and it was also referred to as a ..under drug in the Spanish Flu pandemic during 1918 for arresting the viral growth or spread. Due to the lack of proper available vaccine and side effects of the drugs, we need an effective alternative strategy for the COVID-19 treatment and management. Bioactive secondary metabolites from this plant were docked to various targets of SARS-CoV-2 and the binding energies were compared with two reference drugs, nelfinavir and hydroxychloroquine. In silico pharmacophysical properties and toxicity predictions revealed out of 17 compounds from A. paniculata, 9 compounds, namely;andrographolide, andrographic acid, neoandrographolide, 14-deoxyandrographolide, 14-deoxy 11, 12-didehydroandrogra-pholide, onysilin, 14-deoxy 14, 15-dehydroandrographolide, 3, 4-dicaffeoylquinic acid and isoandrographolide have shown higher inhibition at multiple targets. Further, they have shown superior permeability, bioavailability properties and low levels of toxicity. Hence, the bioactive compounds from A. paniculata could be effective candidates for drug designing and could be the choice of traditional therapeutic option against COVID-19. Use of A. paniculata active constituents for the patients in the initial stages of infection may prevent its transition into severe symptoms.","Sahithya, M. D.; Srinath, M.; Kumar, B. C.; Giri, C.

Subjects and methods: The analysis was performed basing on data of 3,806 patients with COVID-19 treated at the Pavlov State Medical University, 395 of them were admitted to the intensive care units (ICU). The criterion for establishing renal dysfunction (RD) is the increase in blood creatinine level above the upper limit of reference values (0.115 mmol/l). Patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease who needed to continue routine long-term dialysis were not included in the study. We analyzed the incidence of renal dysfunction, changes in blood levels of creatinine, urea, and electrolytes during 8 days. In addition, glomerular filtration rate, diuresis volume, levels of hematocrit, hemoglobin, LDH, CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin were evaluated. Results. The frequency of RD among all patients was 19.0%, among patients in the ICU - 41.0%. In 79% and 81%, respectively, it was detected on the first day of hospitalization. The increase in the number of patients with RD and the aggravation of the existing dysfunction occurred after 6 days. At the initial stage of the disease, the manifestations of RD in most cases were not expressed even in those with an unfavorable course of the disease but the level of creatinine showed a weak but significant (p < 0.5) correlation with changes in CRP (r = 0.110), ferritin (r = 0.137), and procalcitonin (PCT, r = 0.418). The difference in the level of creatinine in patients with PСT level above and below 0.5 ng/ml was observed on the first day only;the value of this parameter returned to normal faster in the subgroup of patients whose procalcitonin level did not exceed 0.5 ng/ml. Conclusion. In case of the signs indicative of RD, it is advisable to distinguish between primary and secondary injury. In the first case, it is primarily due to systemic inflammation, in the second case it is caused by additional impact of other aggressive factors. This will make it possible to clarify the renal and non-renal indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with COVID-19, and to evaluate the results adequately since the effectiveness of RRT at different stages of the disease cannot be the same. © 2021 Serbian Chemical Society.

These impacts may be most pronounced among people in low-resource urban communities. We assessed the experiences of adults with type 2 diabetes participating in a federally-qualified health center diabetes management program. Of 72 patients called, 61 completed telephone surveys from July to October 2020 in Spanish and English. 74% of respondents were Latino with Spanish as their preferred language. Respondents' mean age was 54 years, 62% were female, and 57% had less than a high school degree. Five patients reported testing positive for COVID-19, and 7 lived with someone who tested positive. Of 33 respondents who worked outside the home before COVID-19, 61% had lost their jobs or now worked fewer hours. When asked how diabetes management behaviors changed during the pandemic, 53% of respondents reported less physical activity, while 25% reported more. 18% reported eating less healthfully, while 38% reported eating more healthfully. 43% found it more difficult to obtain healthy food. 15% reported taking their medications more regularly, while 5% reported less. 61% reported increased difficulty accessing medical care. 41% felt more worried about being able to manage their diabetes during the pandemic and 49% felt more socially isolated. Changes in diabetes self-management behaviors related to COVID-19 were both positive and negative for patients in this low-resource urban setting. Programs supporting patients with diabetes could help patients adapt to pandemic changes by facilitating access to medications and health care, providing virtual support for self-management and other health habits, connecting patients with financial and food security concerns to community resources, and addressing stress and social isolation through virtual diabetes support groups.","Zupa, Margaret Perez Stephanie Palmisano Gloria Kieffer Edith C.; Piatt, Gretchen Valbuena Felix Deverts Denise J.; Yabes, Jonathan Heisler Michele Rosland Ann-Marie",Diabetes,172,1

A large number of patients with diabetic foot are left without timely medical care and are at increased risk of complications, hospitalization, lower limb amputation, and death. A new paradigm must be adopted for the transition from inpatient care to community-based care. The introduction of a pandemic remote management for patients with diabetic foot ulcer includes an assessment of the risk of complications through telemedicine and further stratification of patients according to the developed algorithm. METHODS: A literature review was performed for articles related to telemedicine. We used PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Ovid MEDLINE to search published articles. We used the following keywords: “Telemedicine,” “diabetes mellitus,” “COVID-19,” “diabetic foot ulcer,” and “remote monitoring.” RESULTS: Implementation of the proposed pandemic care includes telemedicine for remote monitoring and treatment of patients with diabetic foot ulcers, as well as an algorithm for determining the risk of diabetic ulcer infection and patient management tactics according to the identified risk. CONCLUSION: The management of patients with diabetic foot ulcers during a pandemic includes the following goals – to reduce the burden on the health-care system, maintain the safety and functionality of diabetic foot at home, and reduce the risk of COVID-19 in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. © 2021 Mariya V.

Methods In March 2021, an online questionnaire on vaccination acceptance was proposed to adults included in a longitudinal cohort study of previous population-based serosurveys carried out in the canton of Geneva. Questions were asked about COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, reasons of acceptance or refusal, and attitudes about vaccination in general. Data on demographic (age, sex, education, income, professional status, living conditions) and health-related characteristics (having a chronic disease, COVID-19 diagnosis, smoking status) were assessed at inclusion in the cohort (December 2020). Results Overall, 4067 participants (completion rate of 77.4%) responded to the survey between March 17 and April 1, 2021. The mean age of respondents was 53.3 years and 56.0% were women. Most had completed tertiary education (64.7%) and over 60% were currently professionally active. At the time of the survey, 17.2% of respondents had already been vaccinated with at least one dose or had made an appointment to get vaccinated, and an additional 58.5% intended or rather intended to get vaccinated. The overall acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination was 75.7%, with a higher acceptance among men compared to women, older adults compared to younger adults, high-income individuals compared to those with a low income, participants living in urban and semi-urban areas compared to rural, and retirees and students compared to employed individuals. Acceptance was lower among individuals having completed apprenticeships and secondary education compared to those with tertiary education. The most common reasons reported by participants intending to get vaccinated were the desire to 'get back to normal', to protect themselves, their community and/or society, and their relatives or friends against the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as the desire to travel. Less than half (45.6%) of participants having children were willing or rather willing to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if it were recommended by public health authorities. Conclusion Although our study found a 75.7% acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, there were noticeable socio-demographic disparities in vaccination acceptance. These data will be useful for public health measures targeting hesitant populations when developing health communication strategies. These results will be updated over time with a new release of the survey in autumn 2021.","Wisniak, A.; Baysson, H.; Pullen, N.; Nehme, M.; Pennacchio, F.; Zaballa, M.-E.; Guessous, I.; Stringhini, S.; group, Specchio-COVID19 study",,172,20

Infectious diseases have been a threat during all periods of human existence. Primary measures to protect against extremely dangerous pathogens included quarantine, observation and vaccination. Vaccination was crucial in the fi ght against smallpox - the only disease, which was eradicated on a global scale. The aim of the work was to identify the main stages of development and application of vaccines for the protection against especially dangerous infection (EDI) and the contribution of Ukrainian scientists in the development of vaccines for EDI. Methods. An analysis using the Search Strategy of narrative reviews of literary sources and Internet resource was conducted to systematize data about the application of immunobiological preparations to create an active immunity against several actual EDI. The participation of scientists with Ukrainian roots in the creation of vaccines against this group of diseases is indicated. Results. Smallpox (variolation in China in the 11th century) is known as the fi rst disease against which specifi c protection was created. Until the 20s century, the fi rst fi ve vaccines against EDI were developed: Smallpox, rabies, anthrax, cholera, and plague. In the 20s century, the list was supplemented by vaccines against typhus, yellow fever, tick-borne encephalitis, tularemia, brucellosis, coxiellosis (Q-fever), hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The introduction of new technologies in the 21st century allowed improving existing preparations and creating new ones against Ebola viral disease (EVD), COVID-19 as EDIs relevant ones for the pandemic potential. Outstanding scientists with Ukrainian roots contributed to the creation of vaccines against EDI: V. Khavkin, D. Samoilovich, V. Zhdanov. Conclusion.

One potential solution to detecting COVID‐19 rapidly and effectively is by analyzing chest X‐ray images using Deep Learning (DL) models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been presented as particularly efficient techniques for early diagnosis, but most still include limitations. In this study, we propose a novel randomly initialized CNN (RND‐CNN) architecture for the recognition of COVID‐19. This network consists of a set of differently‐sized hidden layers all created from scratch. The performance of this RND‐CNN is evaluated using two public datasets: the COVIDx and the enhanced COVID‐19 datasets. Each of these datasets consists of medical images (X‐rays) in one of three different classes: chests with COVID‐19, with pneumonia, or in a normal state. The proposed RND‐CNN model yields encouraging results for its accuracy in detecting COVID‐19 results, achieving 94% accuracy for the COVIDx dataset and 99% accuracy on the enhanced COVID‐19 dataset.

It is important to examine vaccination acceptance when people are making real rather than hypothetical decisions, to identify whether targeted support is needed, and to identify implications for communications. Methods Cross-sectional online and telephone survey with probability-based sample (n=4,978) of British adults, conducted January-February 2021. Measures: socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, education, financial status), COVID-19 status, vaccine acceptance, trust in COVID-19 vaccination information sources, perceptions of vaccination priority groups, and perceptions of importance of second dose. Findings Among 5,931 individuals invited, survey response rate was 84%. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (83%) was associated with increasing age, higher level of education and having been invited for vaccination. Acceptance decreased with unconfirmed past COVID-19, greater financial hardship, and non-White British ethnicity; Black/Black British participants had lowest acceptance. Overall, healthcare and scientific sources of information were most trusted. Compared with White British participants, other ethnicities had lower trust in healthcare and scientific sources. Those with lower educational attainment or financial hardship had lower trust in healthcare and scientific sources. Those with no qualifications had higher trust in media and family/friends. While trust was low overall in community or faith leaders it was higher among those with Asian/Asian British and Black/Black British ethnicity compared with White British participants. Views of vaccine prioritisation were mostly consistent with UK official policy but there was support for prioritising additional groups. There was high support for having the second vaccine dose. Conclusions Targeted engagement is needed to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in non-White British ethnic groups, in younger adults, and among those with lower education, greater financial hardship and unconfirmed past infection. Healthcare professionals and scientific advisors should play a central role in communications and tailored messaging is needed for hesitant groups. Careful communication around vaccination prioritisation continues to be required.","Stead, M.; Jessop, C.; Angus, K.; Bedford, H.; Ussher, M.; Ford, A.; Eadie, D.; MacGregor, A.; Hunt, K.; MacKintosh, A.

Nonetheless, inadvertent exposures to environmental pathogens (e.g., Aspergillus spp. and Legionella spp.) or airborne pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and varicella-zoster virus) can result in adverse patient outcomes and cause illness among health-care workers. Environmental infection-control strategies and engineering controls can effectively prevent these infections. The incidence of health-care--associated infections and pseudo-outbreaks can be minimized by 1) appropriate use of cleaners and disinfectants; 2) appropriate maintenance of medical equipment (e.g., automated endoscope reprocessors or hydrotherapy equipment); 3) adherence to water-quality standards for hemodialysis, and to ventilation standards for specialized care environments (e.g., airborne infection isolation rooms, protective environments, or operating rooms); and 4) prompt management of water intrusion into the facility. Routine environmental sampling is not usually advised, except for water quality determinations in hemodialysis settings and other situations where sampling is directed by epidemiologic principles, and results can be applied directly to infection-control decisions. This report reviews previous guidelines and strategies for preventing environment-associated infections in health-care facilities and offers recommendations. These include 1) evidence-based recommendations supported by studies; 2) requirements of federal agencies (e.g., Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and U.S. Department of Justice); 3) guidelines and standards from building and equipment professional organizations (e.g., American Institute of Architects, Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, and American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers); 4) recommendations derived from scientific theory or rationale; and 5) experienced opinions based upon infection-control and engineering practices. The report also suggests a series of performance measurements as a means to evaluate infection-control efforts.","Sehulster, Lynne; Chinn, Raymond Y W",MMWR.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients who came to the ED over a period of 2 months and were diagnosed with possible COVID-19. We analyzed clinical and epidemiologic variables, treatments given in the ED, discharge destination, need to revisit, and reasons for revisits. Patients who did or did not revisit were compared, and factors associated with revisits were explored. RESULTS The 2378 patients included had a mean age of 57 years; 49% were women. Of the 925 patients (39%) discharged, 170 (20.5%) revisited the ED, mainly for persistence or progression of symptoms. Sixty-six (38.8%) were hospitalized. Odds ratios (ORs) for the following factors showed an association with revisits: history of rheumatologic disease (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.10-7.99; P = .03), digestive symptoms (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.14-2.63; P = .01), respiratory rate over 20 breaths per minute (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.0-1.06; P = .05), and corticosteroid therapy given in the ED (OR, 7.78; 95% CI, 1.77-14.21, P = .01). Factors associated with hospitalization after revisits were age over 48 years (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1 42-4.67; P = .002) and fever (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.99-11.27; P = .001). CONCLUSION Patients under the age of 48 years without comorbidity and with normal vitals can be discharged from the ED without fear of complications. A history of rheumatologic disease, fever, digestive symptoms, and a respiratory rate over 20 breaths per minute, or a need for corticosteroid therapy were independently associated with revisits. Fever and age over 48 years were associated with a need for hospitalization.","López-Barbeito, Beatriz; García-Martínez, Ana; Coll-Vinent, Blanca; Placer, Arrate; Font, Carme; Vargas, Carmen Rosa; Sánchez, Carolina; Piñango, Daniela; Gómez-Angelats, Elisenda; Curtelin, David; Salgado, Emilio; Aya, Francisco; Martínez-Nada, Gemma; Alonso, José Ramón; García-Gozalbes, Julia; Fresco, Leticia; Galicia, Miguel; Perea, Milagrosa; Carbó, Miriam; Iniesta, Nerea; Escoda, Ona; Perelló, Rafael; Cuerpo, Sandra; Flores, Vanesa; Alemany, Xavier; Miró, Óscar; Ortega, Mª Del Mar",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,172,33

In this study, we investigated the immune responses against the S2 subunit in BALB/c mice, which were vaccinated either with plasmid DNA encoding the S2 domain (residues 681-1120), the recombinant S2 fragment (residues 681-980) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, or with inactivated SARS-CoV. The increased number of specific cytotoxic cells (CTLs) and the high titer of specific antibody showed stimulation of both arms of the immune system in these groups. The shift in cytokines suggested that Th1-polarized immune response was induced by plasmid pCoVS2, meanwhile the Th2-dominant response was induced by recombinant S2 fragment and inactivated vaccine. However, the titer of neutralizing antibodies was only detectable in mice immunized with inactivated virus, but not with pCoVS2 plasmid. Taken together, the S2 domain could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total IgG but little neutralizing antibodies against infection by SARSCoV.","Guo, Yingjun; Sun, Shuhan; Wang, Kaiyu; Zhang, Shu; Zhu, Weijia; Chen, Ze",DNA and cell biology,172,31

All of these MAbs showed neutralizing activity (1:20,000 to 1:800,000) against the 67N strain of HEV. They also showed hemagglutination inhibition activity (1:400 to 1:409,600). Western blotting tests revealed that all of these 11 MAbs were specific for the S protein of HEV. All MAbs with neutralizing activity showed the same fluorescent staining pattern. Ten-day-old mice pups were immunized with MAb, inoculated with the 10(5) tissue culture-infective dose of HEV at 3 days after immunization, and then examined to determine the viral inhibition. The 1:800-diluted MAb120 inhibited the viral infection in mice pups, though the 1:1,000-diluted MAb120 failed to inhibit the viral infectivity. These MAbs would be a useful tool for rapid and specific diagnosis of HEV and also for antibody-based treatment of the disease.","Raihana, Royan Rahimi; Hayakawa, Marie; Sugiura, Emiko; Sugiura, Hiroaki; Hanaki, Ken-Ichi; Taniguchi, Takahide; Honda, Eiichi",The Journal of veterinary medical science,172,16

Specifically, our method is able to produce stable and accurate forecasts 2 days ahead of current time, and uses as inputs (a) official health reports from Chinese Center Disease for Control and Prevention (China CDC), (b) COVID-19-related internet search activity from Baidu, (c) news media activity reported by Media Cloud, and (d) daily forecasts of COVID-19 activity from GLEAM, an agent-based mechanistic model. Our machine-learning methodology uses a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geo-spatial synchronicities of COVID-19 activity across Chinese provinces, and a data augmentation technique to deal with the small number of historical disease activity observations, characteristic of emerging outbreaks. Our model's predictive power outperforms a collection of baseline models in 27 out of the 32 Chinese provinces, and could be easily extended to other geographies currently affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to help decision makers.","Liu, Dianbo; Clemente, Leonardo; Poirier, Canelle; Ding, Xiyu; Chinazzi, Matteo; Davis, Jessica T; Vespignani, Alessandro; Santillana, Mauricio",ArXiv,172,1

Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), serve an important role in minimizing HCP risks and are in high demand during public health emergencies. Because PPE demand can exceed supply, various public health strategies have been developed to reduce the rate of PPE consumption as supply dwindles. Extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs are strategies advocated by many governmental agencies used to increase the number of times a device can be used. Increased use of respirators designed for reuse-such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air-purifying respirators- is another option designed to reduce the continuous need for new devices as the daily need for respirator use increases. Together, these strategies are designed to reduce the number of PPE units that must be discarded daily and, therefore, extend the longevity of available supply. The purpose of this paper is to theoretically estimate the impact of extended use and limited reuse strategies for N95 FFRs and the increased use of reusable respirator options on PPE consumed. The results suggest that a considerable reduction in PPE consumption would result from extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs and the increased use of respirators designed for reuse; however, the practical benefits must be balanced with the risks and economic costs. In addition, extended use and reuse strategies must be accompanied by proper procedures to reduce risk. The study is designed to support epidemic and pandemic PPE supply and demand planning efforts.","Yorio, Patrick L; Fisher, Edward M; Kilinc-Balci, F Selcen; Rottach, Dana; Harney, Joshua; Seaton, Melissa; Dahm, Matthew M; Niemeier, Todd",Journal of the International Society for Respiratory Protection,172,33

The tissue niche imprints macrophage identity, phenotype and function. The role of vascular endothelial signals in tailoring the phenotype and function of tissue macrophages remains unknown. The lung is a highly vascularized organ and replete with a large population of resident macrophages. We found that, in response to inflammatory injury, lung endothelial cells release the Wnt signaling modulator Rspondin3, which activates ß-catenin signaling in lung interstitial macrophages and increases mitochondrial respiration by glutaminolysis. The generated tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate &#945;-ketoglutarate, in turn, serves as the cofactor for the epigenetic regulator TET2 to catalyze DNA hydroxymethylation. Notably, endothelial-specific deletion of Rspondin3 prevented the formation of anti-inflammatory interstitial macrophages in endotoxemic mice and induced unchecked severe inflammatory injury. Thus, the angiocrine-metabolic-epigenetic signaling axis specified by the endothelium is essential for reprogramming interstitial macrophages and dampening inflammatory injury.","Zhou, Bisheng; Magana, Lissette; Hong, Zhigang; Huang, Long Shuang; Chakraborty, Sreeparna; Tsukasaki, Yoshikazu; Huang, Cary; Wang, Li; Di, Anke; Ganesh, Balaji; Gao, Xiaopei; Rehman, Jalees; Malik, Asrar B",,172,16

There are few studies which assessed standard electrocardiogram (ECG) as a prognostic tool during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to identify the relationship between of ECG parameters and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 114 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and May 2020 were included in the study. Standard 12­lead surface ECG was reviewed for presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS), abnormal Q wave, T wave inversion, and duration of QRS. fQRS was observed in 36.8% (n = 42) of the patients who had SARS-CoV-2. Patient groups with and without fQRS did not differ in terms of age, gender, the presence of comorbid diseases and medical treatment. Hospitalization duration, intensive care unit(ICU) requirement, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality were found to be higher in patients with fQRS (all p values <0.05). There was a positive correlation between QRS duration and duration of hospital stay (p < 0.001, r = 0.421). QRS duration was also found to be associated with intensive care need, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that QRS duration and the presence of fQRS on standard ECG can help to identify patients with worse clinical outcome admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yildirim, Arzu; Karaca, I Oguz; Yilmaz, Filiz Kizilirmak; Gunes, H Murat; Cakal, Beytullah",J Electrocardiol,172,20

Its diagnosis is based on immunotherapeutic histories, clinical symptoms, and the computed tomography (CT) imaging. The radiological features were typically ground-glass opacities, similar to CT presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. Thus, clinicians are cautious in differential diagnosis especially in COVID-19 epidemic areas. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a 67-year-old Han Chinese male patient presenting with dyspnea and normal body temperature on the 15th day of close contact with his son, who returned from Wuhan. He was diagnosed as advanced non-small cell lung cancer and developed pneumonitis post Sintilimab injection during COIVD-19 pandemic period. The chest CT indicated peripherally subpleural lattice opacities at the inferior right lung lobe and bilateral thoracic effusion. The swab samples were taken twice within 72 hours and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) results were COVID-19 negative. The patient was thereafter treated with prednisolone and antibiotics for over 2 weeks. The suspicious lesion has almost absorbed according to CT imaging, consistent with prominently falling CRP level. The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis mixed with bacterial infection was clinically diagnosed based on the laboratory and radiological evidences and good response to the prednisolone and antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia possess similar clinical presentations and CT imaging features. Therefore, differential diagnosis depends on the epidemiological and immunotherapy histories, RT-PCR tests. The response to glucocorticoid is still controversial but helpful for the diagnosis.","Dai, Ying; Liu, Sha; Zhang, Yiruo; Li, Xiaoqiu; Zhao, Zhiyan; Liu, Pingping; Du, Yingying",J Med Case Rep,172,14

In the United States (U.S.), Latinx immigrants and other minorities have experienced greater economic burden and worse health outcomes, resulting in alarming rates of death from COVID-19. Yet the government’s relief measures to support individuals did not extend to millions of immigrants. This left many immigrants with the cruel choice to either stay home to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus or go to work to support their families. Disregard for a large segment of the population is further complemented by strict immigration policies, harsher border restrictions, and public health guidelines that failed to account for the realities faced by immigrants. In this brief, we highlight the unequal toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrants and consider social work response. We argue that the pandemic demands more of the social work profession, as the coronavirus crisis exposed more clearly the systemic inequalities toward immigrants and aggravates their vulnerabilities. Insofar as systems are unequal and racist in the context of coronavirus, there is a great need for social work response that is innovative, brave, and deeply connected to communities.","Cross, Fernanda L.; Gonzalez Benson, Odessa",Affilia J.

CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein that is able to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022 interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to considerable flexibility of the RBD. In one of these conformations, quaternary interactions are made by CR3022 to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of an adjacent subunit. Overall, this study provides insights into antigenic variation and potential cross-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-like viruses.","Wu, Nicholas C; Yuan, Meng; Bangaru, Sandhya; Huang, Deli; Zhu, Xueyong; Lee, Chang-Chun D; Turner, Hannah L; Peng, Linghang; Yang, Linlin; Burton, Dennis R; Nemazee, David; Ward, Andrew B; Wilson, Ian A",PLoS Pathog,172,21

DATA SOURCES: We searched grey literature including websites of national research and ethics regulatory bodies and health departments of selected countries. STUDY SELECTION: National guidance documents were included from six countries: Ireland, England, Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America and Canada. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from 19 documents using an a priori framework developed from the published literature. RESULTS: We organised data under five themes: ethical frameworks; guidance on ethical review; consent, vulnerable groups and personal health data. Quality improvement activity tended to be outside the scope of the ethics frameworks in most countries. Only New Zealand had integrated national ethics standards for both research and quality improvement. Across countries, there is consensus that this activity should not be automatically exempted from ethical review, but requires proportionate review or organisational oversight for minimal risk projects. In the majority of countries, there is a lack of guidance on participant consent, use of personal health information and inclusion of vulnerable groups in routine quality improvement. CONCLUSION: Where countries fail to provide specific ethics frameworks for quality improvement, guidance is dispersed across several organisations which may lack legal certainty. Our review demonstrates a need for appropriate oversight and responsive infrastructure for quality improvement underpinned by ethical frameworks that build equivalence with research oversight. It outlines aspects of good practice, especially The New Zealand framework that integrates research and quality improvement ethics.","Naughton, Corina; Meehan, Elaine; Lehane, Elaine; Landers, Ciara; Flaherty, Sarah Jane; Lane, Aoife; Landers, Dr Margaret; Kilty, Caroline; Saab, Mohamad M; Goodwin, John; Walshe, Nuala; Wills, Teresa; McCarthy, Vera; Murphy, Siobhan; McCarthy, Joan; Helen, Cummins; Madden, Deirdre; Hegarty, Josephine",Int. j. qual. health care,172,16

Leaves of Delosperma react to external damage by the bending or contraction of the entire leaf until wound edges are brought into contact. A study of leaf morphology and anatomy, biomechanics of entire leaves and individual tissues and self-sealing kinematics after a ring incision under low and high relative humidity (RH) was carried out comparing the closely related species Delosperma cooperi and Delosperma ecklonis, which are indigenous to semi-arid highlands and regions with an oceanic climate, respectively. For both species, the absolute contractions of the examined leaf segments (""apex"", ""incision"", ""base"") were more pronounced at low RH levels. Independent of the given RH level, the absolute contractions within the incision region of D. cooperi were significantly higher than in all other segments of this species and of D. ecklonis. The more pronounced contraction of D. cooperi leaves was linked mainly to the elastic properties of the central vascular strand, which is approximately twice as flexible as that of D. ecklonis leaves.","Hesse, Linnea; Kampowski, Tim; Leupold, Jochen; Caliaro, Sandra; Speck, Thomas; Speck, Olga",,172,1

The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2's higher infectivity lies partly in its host receptor recognition mechanism. Experiments show that the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2's spike protein stronger than SARS-CoV's spike RBD. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained from X-ray structures. To go beyond insights gained from X-ray structures and investigate the role of thermal fluctuations in structure, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Microseconds-long simulations reveal that while CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interfaces have similar conformational binding modes, CoV-2 spike interacts with ACE2 via a larger combinatorics of polar contacts, and on average, makes 45% more polar contacts. Correlation analysis and thermodynamic calculations indicate that these differences in the density and dynamics of polar contacts arise from differences in spatial arrangements of interfacial residues, and dynamical coupling between interfacial and non-interfacial residues. These results recommend that ongoing efforts to design spike-ACE2 peptide blockers will benefit from incorporating dynamical information as well as allosteric coupling effects.","Delgado, Julián M; Duro, Nalvi; Rogers, David M; Tkatchenko, Alexandre; Pandit, Sagar A; Varma, Sameer",Proteins,172,24

Next comes the adaptive immune response in the form of antibodies (immunoglobulins) which help in fighting infections due to SARS-CoV-2. These immune responses include increasing levels of cytokines, coagulation parameters, C-reactive protein, neutrophils, and decreasing total lymphocytes. It is also known that COVID-19 patients with severe disease often experience higher total antibody, IgM responses, and IgG responses than COVID-19 patients without congenital disease.

Moreover, inequity in local distribution also remains a problem, with clear discrimination of minorities and lack of logistical preparation in some countries.

We therefore aimed to illustrate the concept of internal coherence in nutrition and dietetics research, and its importance beyond individual elements of study quality. METHOD: A targeted literature search in Nutrition and Dietetics was used to identify research illustrating one example of three main approaches to research (scientific, interpretive and critical inquiry) published between November 2017 and November 2020. Studies were included if they related to education research based on the expertise of the authors, and illustrated diverse points about internal coherence. The authors independently critiqued included studies for internal coherence and synthesised their findings. RESULTS: From 76 manuscripts, 14 were identified as describing education research. Of the three selected studies that were critiqued, all had elements of internal coherence, in particular alignment between epistemology and methodology. However, each had elements of misalignment too, specifically between epistemology, axiology and method. The results point to the profession's historical groundings privileging the scientific approach, showing how this can yield misalignments, particularly when describing the limitations of interpretive and critical inquiry approaches.

DESIGN: Non-probabilistic, exploratory study. Participants completed an online self-administered questionnaire. Perceptions of food habit changes were measured on a five-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Data analysis was conducted in STATA v16.0. SETTING: Chile. PARTICIPANTS: Adult women between 25- and 65-years old (n= 2047). RESULTS: Of the participants, 72% were responsible for cooking, 69% for buying food, and 85% for child care. Difficulties in organizing and doing food budget works were observed in groups with a lower educational level, lower-income, and single mothers with children. Younger participants, dependent workers, women from biparental families with children, and those in mandatory quarantine perceived more changes in their food shopping and budget management tasks. Participants more educated, with higher income, and non-mandatory quarantine perceived to cook and eat healthier. Older participants perceived minor changes in their food preparation tasks at home; in contrast, more educated women and women from biparental families with children perceived more changes. If women were in charge of the kids or grocery shopping, more food environment changes were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: Women perceived changes in their food environments.

Data were collected prior to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: Combined data were analyzed using JMP Pro version 12. Mean responses from two groups were compared using a t-test and those from more than two groups using analysis of variance. Logistic regression was used to determine the significance of impact each workload variable had on individual nurses' ability to administer medications successfully as measured by occurrence of NMs. FINDINGS: The mean outcome of each of the six workload factors measured differed significantly (p < .0001) among nurses. The mean outcome for all workload factors except the hours worked was found to be significantly higher (p < .0001) for those who committed an NM compared to those who did not. At least one workload variable was observed to be significantly associated (p < .05) with the occurrence or nonoccurrence of NMs in 82.6% of the nurses in the study. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of the nurses in our study, the occurrence of an NM was significantly impacted by at least one workload variable. Because the specific variables that impact performance are different for each individual nurse, decreasing only one variable, such as patient load, will not adequately address the risk for NMs. Other variables not studied here, such as education and experience, might be associated with the occurrence of NMs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the majority of nurses, different workload variables increase their risk for an NM, suggesting that interventions addressing medication errors should be implemented based on the individual's risk profile.","Campbell, Amy A; Harlan, Todd; Campbell, Matt; Mulekar, Madhuri S; Wang, Bin",J Nurs Scholarsh,172,16

However, it is pertinent to identify the hardships associated with pet ownership. We conducted a large-scale survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2254) in spring and summer 2020 to assess the ways that relationships with pets impacted life during COVID-19. We used thematic analysis to analyze 3671 open-ended responses to three prompts. Reported concerns fell into three major categories: (1) pet-focused (meeting needs of pets; procuring supplies; accessing veterinary care; new and emerging behavioral issues; fate of the pet if owner becomes ill; general safety and well-being), (2) human-focused (issues with working from home; well-being and mental health; balancing responsibilities), and (3) household-focused (disease spread; economic issues). Quantitative analyses showed that the owner's strength of attachment to their pet, economic resources, and relationship status were associated with the types of concerns expressed. Results from this study indicate that pet owners experienced unique hardships related to changes in everyday life from the COVID-19 pandemic. These hardships should be considered alongside the potential benefits found in other studies in order to manage pet owner expectations, prevent pet relinquishment, and more fully understand multifaceted human-companion animal relationships.","Applebaum, Jennifer W; Tomlinson, Camie A; Matijczak, Angela; McDonald, Shelby E; Zsembik, Barbara A",,172,24

METHODS: From March 16th until June 15th 2020, IRD patients from private practices and rheumatology departments were asked to answer a questionnaire addressing their behaviour with respect to their immunomodulating therapy. Eight private practices and nine rheumatology departments which included rheumatology primary care centres and university hospitals participated. 4252 questionnaires were collected and evaluated. RESULTS: The majority of patients (54%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, followed by psoriatic arthritis (14%), ankylosing spondylitis (10%), connective tissue diseases (12%) and vasculitides (6%). The majority of patients (84%) reported to continue their immunomodulatory therapy. Termination of therapy was reported by only 3% of the patients. The results were independent from the type of IRD, the respective immunomodulatory therapy and by whom the patients were treated (private practices vs rheumatology departments). Younger patients (<60 years) reported just as often as older patients to discontinue their therapy. CONCLUSION: The data show that most of the patients continued their therapy in spite of the pandemic. A significant change in behavior with regard to their immunomodulatory therapy was not observed during the three months of observation. The results support the idea that the immediate release of recommendation of the German Society of Rheumatology were well received, supporting the well-established physician-patient-relationship in times of a crisis.","Hasseli, R; Müller-Ladner, U; Keil, F; Broll, M; Dormann, A; Fräbel, C; Hermann, W; Heinmüller, C-J; Hoyer, B F; Löffler, F; Özden, F; Pfeiffer, U; Saech, J; Schneidereit, T; Schlesinger, A; Schwarting, A; Specker, C; Stapfer, G; Steinmüller, M; Storck-Müller, K; Strunk, J; Thiele, A; Triantafyllias, K; Vagedes, D; Wassenberg, S; Wilden, E; Zeglam, S; Schmeiser, T",Rheumatology (Oxford),172,8

No specific methods have been identified to predict, detect and quantify the microvascular alterations during COVID-19. Our aim was to assess microvasculature through nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed NVC in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Elementary alterations were reported for each finger according to a semi-quantitative score. Capillary density, number of enlarged and giant capillaries, number of micro-hemorrhages and micro-thrombosis (NEMO score) were registered. RESULTS: We enrolled 82 patients (mean age 58.8 ± 13.2 years, male 68.3%) of whom 28 during the hospitalization and 54 after recovery and hospital discharge. At NVC examination we found abnormalities classifiable as non-specific pattern in 53 patients (64.6%). Common abnormalities were pericapillary edema (80.5%), enlarged capillaries (61.0%), sludge flow (53.7%), meandering capillaries and reduced capillary density (50.0%). No pictures suggestive of scleroderma pattern have been observed. Acute COVID-19 patients, compared to recovered patients, showed a higher prevalence of hemosiderin deposits as a result of micro-hemorrhages (P = .027) and micro-thrombosis (P < .016), sludge flow (P = .001), and pericapillary edema (P < .001), while recovered patients showed a higher prevalence of enlarged capillaries (P < .001), loss of capillaries (P = .002), meandering capillaries (P < .001), and empty dermal papillae (P = .006). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients present microvascular abnormalities at NVC. Currently ill and recovered subjects are characterized by a different distribution of elementary capillaroscopic alterations, resembling acute and post-acute microvascular damage.

We present a case of rapidly progressive pulmonary fibrosis in a Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) pattern. Successful lung transplantation was performed two months following COVID-19 infection. Description: 68 years old with known history of mild Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) , not on home oxygen, initially presented in July 2020 with worsening shortness of breath and cough. There was a strong family history for Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Her last pulmonary function tests showed a Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.24 Liters (99%) and Forced Vital Capacity of 2.69 Liters (92%). Her last High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) showed chronic stable mild interstitial fibrosis. On admission, she was positive for COVID 19 on her Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Initial CT chest showed diffuse new ground glass changes. She was treated with remdesavir, dexamethasone and antibiotics. She did not require endotracheal intubation and showed improvement in her symptoms. Unfortunately, she could not be weaned off oxygen and was discharged on six liters flow oxygen through a nasal cannula. She presented again to the hospital, one month later with worsening shortness of breath. Her PCR was negative for COVID 19. Her CT angiogram of thorax however showed interval worsening of her interstitial changes. An urgent inpatient evaluation for lung transplantation was completed and she deemed to be a suitable candidate. After 4 days into her stay, acute deterioration in her respiratory status developed with tachypnea and increased work of breathing requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Repeat CT chest showed fibrotic interstitial disease with associated traction bronchiectasis and a large amount of ground glass. She was subsequently placed on veno-venous Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV ECMO) which allowed extubation. A donor offer for bilateral lungs was accepted after one day on ECMO. She successfully underwent bilateral lung transplant in September 2020. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. She is doing well 3 months post transplant without evidence of cellular rejection. Her explant pathology showed Diffuse Alveolar Damage plus UIP Discussion: Persistent and progressive pulmonary fibrosis may develop following COVID-19 pneumonia. Risk factors may include underlying ILD and family history of IPF. In suitable candidates, lung transplantation is a viable option.","Bangash, B.; Makki, I.; Girgis, R.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,172,16

Apparently, the Delta variant has slowly dominated the other variants including B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.3. With this, World Health Organization has described this sub-lineage as variant of concern. The high transmissibility associated with Delta variant has led to second wave of pandemic in India which affected millions of people. Besides this, variant of concerns has been reported to show lower neutralization to several approved vaccines. This has led to breakthrough infections after completion of vaccination regimen. There is limited information available on the duration of protective immune response post-infection, vaccination or breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we have evaluated immune response in sera of the Covishield vaccinated individuals belonging to category: I. one dose vaccinated, II. two doses vaccinated, III. COVID-19 recovered plus one dose vaccinated, IV. COVID-19 recovered plus two doses vaccinated and V. breakthrough COVID-19 cases. The findings of the study demonstrated that the breakthrough cases and the COVID-19 recovered individuals with one or two dose of vaccine had relatively higher protection against Delta variant in comparison to the participants who were administered either one or two doses of Covishield. Prior vaccination results in less severe disease against subsequent infection provide evidence that both humoral and cellular immune response play an important role in protection.","Sapkal, Gajanan; Yadav, Pragya D; Sahay, Rima R; Deshpande, Gururaj; Gupta, Nivedita; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Patil, Deepak Y; Kumar, Sanjay; Abraham, Priya; Panda, Samiran; Bhargava, Balram",,172,1

This editorial discusses the current situation regarding digital health solutions to fight COVID-19 as well as the challenges and ethical hurdles to broad and long-term implementation of these solutions. To decrease the risk of infection, telemedicine has been used as a successful health care model in both emergency and primary care. Official communication plans should promote facile and diverse channels to inform people about the pandemic and to avoid rumors and reduce threats to public health. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Google Trends analyses are highly beneficial to model pandemic trends as well as to monitor the evolution of patients' symptoms or public reaction to the pandemic over time. However, acceptability of digital solutions may face challenges due to potential conflicts with users' cultural, moral, and religious backgrounds. Digital tools can provide collective public health benefits; however, they may be intrusive and can erode individual freedoms or leave vulnerable populations behind. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the strong potential of various digital health solutions that have been tested during the crisis. More concerted measures should be implemented to ensure that future digital health initiatives will have a greater impact on the epidemic and meet the most strategic needs to ease the life of people who are at the forefront of the crisis.","Fagherazzi, Guy; Goetzinger, Catherine; Rashid, Mohammed Ally; Aguayo, Gloria A; Huiart, Laetitia",J Med Internet Res,172,14

The confined conditions in prisons can encourage person-to-person spread with the potential for outbreaks occurring. Contact tracing is an important contributor to the longer-term management strategy for COVID-19 in prisons as well as in the community but is highly resource-intensive. This paper describes the approach to contact tracing taken by the Irish Prison Service (IPS). METHODS: The IPS National Infection Control Team, in collaboration with the National Quality Improvement (QI) team and Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland, implemented a programme to develop and train in-prison contact tracing teams (CTTs). CTTs were run by prison staff with experience of working with detainees, prison IT systems and CCTV. Protocols for undertaking contact tracing for both detainee and staff cases of COVID-19 were established. RESULTS: All prisons, and two support agencies, within the IPS now have fully functional in-prison CTTs. Every CTT has responded to at least one case COVID-19, undertaken contact tracing and instigated quarantine of contacts. CONCLUSIONS: A partnership approach with development of prison-led CTTs can provide an effective mechanism for contact tracing of COVID-19 cases within the prison setting.","Clarke, Mattea; Devlin, John; Conroy, Emmett; Kelly, Enda; Sturup-Toft, Sunita",J Public Health (Oxf),172,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a prospective registry for demographics, hospital course, and discharge dispositions of rehab-eligible acute stroke survivors admitted 6 months prior to (10/2019-03/2020) and during (04/2020-09/2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) as opposed to other facilities using descriptive statistics, and IRF versus home using unadjusted and adjusted backward stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 507 rehab-eligible stroke survivors, there was no difference in age, premorbid disability, or stroke severity between study periods (p>0.05). There was a 9% absolute decrease in discharges to an IRF during the pandemic (32.1% vs. 41.1%, p=0.04), which translated to 38% lower odds of being discharged to IRF versus home in unadjusted regression (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92, p=0.016). The lower odds of discharge to IRF persisted in the multivariable model (aOR 0.16, 95%CI 0.09-0.31, p<0.001) despite a significant increase in discharge disability (median discharge mRS 4 [IQR 2-4] vs. 2 [IQR 1-3], p<0.001) during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Admission for stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significantly lower probability of being discharged to an IRF. This effect persisted despite adjustment for predictors of IRF disposition, including functional disability at discharge.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey sent to healthcare practitioners working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the outcome. RESULTS: We surveyed 937 practitioners (56.1% females). Approximately 68%, 14%, and 18% were nurses/technicians, physicians, and pharmacists (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, a positive perception of communications with peers, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician); working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. CONCLUSION: Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professionals' resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","Hawari, Feras I; Obeidat, Nour A; Dodin, Yasmeen I; Albtoosh, Asma S; Manasrah, Rasha M; Alaqeel, Ibrahim O; Mansour, Asem H",PLoS One,172,26

Herein, we investigated this emergency situation's effect on diabetes patients' lifestyle and glycemic control. Materials and methods: Diabetes patients who visited our hospital between April 1 and June 13, 2020, for a regular consultation were asked about changes in their physical activities and dietary habits during the state of emergency period. Results: Among 168 patients, 26 (15.5%) gained > 2 kg; HbA1c levels were elevated or decreased by > 0.2% compared to that at the last visit in 57 and 51 patients (Groups D and I), respectively. Group D patients were affected to a larger extent by changes in commuting (transition to teleworking) and closures of sport gyms than Group I patients. Increased snacks, sweets, total diet, and alcohol intake could have contributed to worsening of glucose control in Group D, whereas a healthy diet and less alcohol intake could have led to better glucose control in Group I. Conclusion: During the state of emergency period, decreased physical activity levels negatively affected glycemic control. However, despite changes in physical activity level, maintaining or improving dietary habits could lead to better glycemic control in diabetes patients. During this COVID-19 pandemic, more diabetes patients are likely to shift to teleworking and stay home for longer periods.

Self-reported COVID-19 prevalence was 0.3%. Patients reported that they were worried to get COVID-19 infection (March/June: 70%/45%) and self-isolated more than others of the same age (48%/38%). The fraction of patients who changed medication due to fear of COVID-19 were 4.1%/0.6%. Female gender, comorbidities, not working, lower education, biological treatment and poor European Quality of life, 5 dimensions were associated with both anxiety and self-isolation. CONCLUSION: In >12 000 patients with inflammatory arthritis, we found widespread anxiety and self-isolation, but high medication adherence, in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This persisted during the gradual opening of society during the following months. Attention to patients' anxiety and self-isolation is important during this and potential future epidemics.","Glintborg, Bente; Jensen, Dorte Vendelbo; Engel, Sara; Terslev, Lene; Pfeiffer Jensen, Mogens; Hendricks, Oliver; Ostergaard, Mikkel; Horskjær Rasmussen, Simon; Adelsten, Thomas; Colic, Ada; Danebod, Kamilla; Kildemand, Malene; Loft, Anne Gitte; Munk, Heidi Lausten; Pedersen, Jens Kristian; Østgård, René Drage; Møller Sørensen, Christian; Krogh, Niels Steen; Agerbo, Jette; Ziegler, Connie; Hetland, Merete",,172,6

We aimed to investigate the role of peripheral blood eosinophil (EOS) as a marker in the course of the virus infection to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 227 pneumonia patients who visited the fever clinics in Shanghai General Hospital and 97 hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were involved in a retrospective research study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. The trend of EOS level in COVID-19 patients and comparison among patients with different severity were summarized. RESULTS: The majority of COVID-19 patients (71.7%) had a decrease in circulating EOS counts, which was significantly more frequent than other types of pneumonia patients. EOS counts had good value for COVID-19 prediction, even higher when combined with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Patients with low EOS counts at admission were more likely to have fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath, with more lesions in chest CT and radiographic aggravation, and longer length of hospital stay and course of disease than those with normal EOS counts. Circulating EOS level gradually increased over the time, and was synchronous with the improvement in chest CT (12 days vs 13 days, P = .07), later than that of body temperature (12 days vs 10 days, P = .014), but earlier than that of the negative conversion of nucleic acid assays (12 days vs 17 days, P = .001). CONCLUSION: Peripheral blood EOS counts may be an effective and efficient indicator in diagnosis, Evaluation, and prognosis monitoring of COVID-19 patients.","Xie, Guogang; Ding, Fengming; Han, Lei; Yin, Dongning; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Min",Allergy,172,24

METHODS: An online survey was administered to all Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology members in October, 2020 to assess PPE availability and crisis standards utilized in fall, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 1,081 infection preventionists participated. A quarter lacked sufficient disinfection supplies, N95s, isolation gowns, and gloves; 10%-20% lacked eye protection and hand hygiene supplies. Significantly more were reusing respirators than masks (65.6% vs 46.8%, respectively; P < .001); a third (32.0%, nâ¯=â¯735) were reusing isolation gowns. About half (45.9%, nâ¯=â¯496) were decontaminating respirators.

The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the major receptor for the virus, and sequence and structural analysis of the protein has been performed to determine its cross-species conservation. Based on these analyses, cattle have been implicated as a potential susceptible species to SARS-CoV-2 and have been reported to have increased ACE2 receptor distribution in the liver and kidney, and lower levels in the lungs. The goal of the current study was to determine the susceptibility of cattle to SARS-CoV-2 utilizing inoculation routes that facilitated exposure to tissues with increased ACE2 receptor distribution. For this, colostrum-deprived calves approximately 6 weeks of age were inoculated via the intratracheal or intravenous routes. Nasal and rectal swab samples, as well as blood and urine samples, were collected over the course of the study to evaluate viral shedding, viremia, and seroconversion. Pyrexia was used as the primary criteria for euthanasia and tissue samples were collected during necropsy. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in only two nasal swab samples collected on days 3 and 10 post-inoculation (pi) in two calves; one calf in the intratracheal group and the other calf in the intravenous group, respectively. Additionally, the calf in the intratracheal group that was positive on the nasal swab on day 3 pi also had a positive tracheobronchial lymph node on day 9 pi. Viral nucleic acid load on these samples, based on PCR cycle threshold values, were low and infectious virus was not recovered from the samples. These results suggest that there was no productive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in calves following intratracheal and intravenous inoculation.","Falkenberg, Shollie; Buckley, Alexandra; Laverack, Melissa; Martins, Mathias; Palmer, Mitchell V; Lager, Kelly; Diel, Diego G",Viruses,172,33

Using customized author surveys about the intellectual influence of referenced work on scientist's own papers, combined with precise measures of geographic and semantic distances between focal and referenced works, we find that being at the same institution is strongly associated with intellectual influence on scientists' and scholars' published work. Yet, this influence increases with intellectual distance: the more different the referenced work done by colleagues at one's institution, the more influential it is on one's own. Universities worldwide constitute places where people doing very different work engage in sustained interactions through departments, committees, seminars and communities. These interactions come to uniquely influence their published research, suggesting the need to replace, rather than displace diverse engagements for sustainable advance.","Duede, Eamon; Teplistkiy, Misha; Lakhani, Karim; Evans, James",,172,10

A small percentage of cases persist with prolonged positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for prolonged viral shedding amongst patient's basal clinical conditions. METHODS: We have evaluated all 513 patients attended in our hospital between 1 March and 1 July. We have selected all 18 patients with prolonged viral shedding and compared them with 36 sex-matched randomly selected controls. Demographic, treatment and clinical data were systematically collected. RESULTS: Global median duration of viral clearance was 25.5 days (n = 54; IQR, 22-39.3 days), 48.5 days in cases (IQR 38.7-54.9 days) and 23 days in controls (IQR 20.2-25.7), respectively. There were not observed differences in demographic, symptoms or treatment data between groups. Chronic rhinosinusitis and atopy were more common in patients with prolonged viral shedding (67%) compared with controls (11% and 25% respectively) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003). The use of inhaled corticosteroids was also more frequent in case group (P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis indicated that CRS (odds ratio [OR], 18.78; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 3.89-90.59; P < 0.001) was independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in URT samples, after adjusting for initial PCR Ct values. CONCLUSION: We found that chronic rhinosinusitis and atopy might be associated with increased risk of prolonged viral shedding.

Diagnoses of COVID-19 in some cases are necessary because of severe prognosis. In this study, epidemiologies, clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were studied in Taleghani Hospital, Urmia, Iran. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was carried out on 215 patients with COVID-19 during March and April 2020. Approved COVID-19 case was considered as a person with a positive respiratory sample performed by at least one of two RT-PCR methods or genetic sequencing. ANOVA repeated measure, independent t-test and logistic regression were done. A P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.93 ± 17.92 years. Regarding gender, there were 91 females (42.3%) and 124 males (57.7%). The mean hospital stay, the temperature at admission, and onset of symptoms were 4.91 ± 3.68 days, 37.40 ± 0.96°C and 5.88 ± 4.80 days, respectively. Close contact with suspected people was found in 10.2% of patients. Additionally, 44 patients (20.5%) were smokers. Shortness of breath and cough were found in 62.8% and 49.3% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities of patients. Regarding lung involvement, 33 patients (33%) were normal, most of the patients (n = 71) had 5%-25% involvement in their lung and a minority of patients (n = 13) had a severe condition of 50%-75% lung involvement. The association between smoking and mortality was tested using chi-square showing no significant difference (X2 :2.959, P = .085). There was no significant difference between AST, ALT, ALP, total, direct Bilirubin, lung involvement and suffering from fever (P > .05). High Spo2 can increase the chance of recovery by 24% with each unit reduction. Kidney involvement increases the chance of death by about 80% (95% CI: 0.104-0.013). The odds ratio of spo2 for recovery of COVID-19 was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.014-1.528; P = .037). Kaletra with odds ratio of 31.960 had the most highest effect on recovery following COVID-19 (P = .043). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 involves different organs of the body with different severity. In the meantime, smoking was not a risk factor for the virus or associated with severe manifestations of the disease. Patients with high creatinine and CPK, pulmonary involvement above 25%, and hypoxemia had a higher mortality rate. Increase of Spo2 by 1% can improve the patients by 24%. The results indicated that Kaletra had the most highest effect on improvement following COVID-19.","Gharebaghi, Naser; Farshid, Saman; Boroofeh, Behdad; Nejadrahim, Rahim; Mousavi, Jalil; Dindarian, Sina; Mohammadi, Sedra",Int J Clin Pract,172,26

We suggest two binomial logit models for explaining the change in travel pattern, linking socioeconomic data per area and travel data with the probability to stop travelling.Modelled variablesThe first model investigates the impact of the socioeconomic factors: age;income;education level;gender;housing type;population density;country of origin;and employment level. The results show that decreases in public transport use are linked to all these factors.The second model groups the investigated areas into five distinct clusters based on the socioeconomic data, showing the impacts for different socioeconomic groups. During the autumn the differences between the groups diminished, and especially Cluster 1 (with the lowest education levels, lowest income and highest share of immigrants) reduced their public transport use to a similar level as the more affluent clusters.ResultsThe results show that socioeconomic status affect the change in behaviour during the pandemic and that exposure to the virus is determined by citizens’ socioeconomic class. Furthermore, the results can guide policy into tailoring public transport supply to where the need is, instead of assuming that e.g. crowding is equally distributed within the public transport system in the event of a pandemic.","Almlöf, Erik Rubensson Isak Cebecauer Matej Jenelius Erik",European Transport Research Review,172,23

One reason for this could be the lack of knowledge regarding preventive measures against COVID-19 and the inability of the psychiatric patients to discern misinformation from facts. Patients and Methods: The study design was cross-sectional. We applied one questionnaire that evaluated knowledge of prevention measures and information about COVID-19 (comprised of two sections, each with five questions). The first section evaluated knowledge regarding the official WHO prevention measures against COVID-19, and the second consisted of false information about COVID-19 which examined the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19. These questionnaires were applied face-to-face to psychiatric male inpatients from a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Bucharest diagnosed with SMI or severe alcohol disorder (SAUD) and to male controls from the community, matched by age and education. Mean scores of patients and controls were compared using Mann-Whitney test. Results: There were 115 male psychiatric patients in total (65 SMI and 50 SAUD) and 57 controls included after the matching procedure. We found statistically significant lower (P<0.05) scores for psychiatric patients compared to controls regarding the prevention and general knowledge of COVID-19 (P<0.001), the WHO information about prevention measures (P=0.041), and the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19 (P<0.001). The fact that psychiatric patients have less knowledge about prevention measures against COVID-19 and a reduced capacity to discern misinformation suggests that we need to identify new methods to convey correct information to these patients and also to better equip them to handle misinformation regarding COVID-19. Conclusion: Patients with SMI and SAUD are less informed regarding COVID-19 infection and preventive measures compared to controls, while being prone to believing false information about COVID-19 as well.","Matei, Valentin; Pavel, Alexandru; Giurgiuca, Ana; RoÈca, Alina; Sofia, Arina; DuÈu, Irina; Tudose, Catalina",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,172,32

Their mode of action at the protein level is not completely understood. In DMD, muscle tissue is replaced by fibrotic tissue produced by fibroblasts, reducing mobility. Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) is involved in fibroblast proliferation. By treating one DMD fibroblast cell culture and one of unaffected skeletal muscle fibroblasts with methylprednisolone (MP) or hydrocortisone (HC) for 24 h or 12 d, the antiproliferative properties of glucocorticoids could be unraveled. NFAT5 localization and expression was explored by immunocytochemistry (ICC), Western blotting (WB) and RT-qPCR. NFAT5 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) colocalization was measured by ImageJ. GR siRNA was used, evaluating GR's influence on NFAT5 expression during MP and HC treatment. Cell proliferation was monitored by IncuCyte ZOOM. In DMD fibroblasts, treatment with MP for 24 h induced dots (ICC) positive for NFAT5 and colocalizing with GR. After 12 d of MP or HC in DMD fibroblasts, NFAT5 expression was decreased (RT-qPCR and WB) and growth arrest was observed (Incucyte ZOOM), whereas NFAT5 expression and cell growth remained unchanged in unaffected skeletal muscle fibroblasts. This study may help understand the antiproliferative properties of glucocorticoids in DMD fibroblasts.","Herbelet, Sandrine; De Paepe, Boel; De Bleecker, Jan L",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),172,16

Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.","Randazzo, Walter; Truchado, Pilar; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Simón, Pedro; Allende, Ana; Sánchez, Gloria",Water Res,172,24

To approach the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and secondary cerebrovascular prevention: Conclusion:: We recommend: (1) As in normal times, during the COVID-19 pandemic wave, patients need to seek urgent medical attention in case of any acute cerebrovascular event. This will assure they receive needed rapid cerebrovascular secondary prevention in addition to acute intravenous and endovascular reperfusion strategies. (2) As in normal times, during the COVID-19 pandemic wave, it is of utmost importance that patients adhere to their individual recommendations for secondary prevention. (3) Optimal secondary but also primary cerebrovascular prevention might reduce the burden of COVID-19 now and during potential subsequent waves. (4) Patients with cerebrovascular disease should strictly adhere to advice concerning the pandemic provided by their governments and to pandemic-related recommendations for them as individuals expressed by their treating physicians.","Padlina, G.; Bellwald, S.; Maurer, A.; Heldner, Mr",Curr.

In April-May 2020, state governments started political discussions about whether it would be worth the risk to reduce protective measures. In a highly politicized environment, risk perceptions and preferences for risk mitigation may vary by political inclinations. In April-May 2020, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 5517 members of the University of Southern California's Understanding America Study. Of those, 37% identified as Democrats, 32% as Republican, and 31% as Third Party/Independent. Overall, Democrats perceived more risk associated with COVID-19 than Republicans, including for getting infected, being hospitalized and dying if infected, as well as running out of money as a result of the pandemic. Democrats were also more likely than Republicans to express concerns that states would lift economic restrictions too quickly, and to report mask use and social distancing. Generally, participants who identified as Third Party/Independent fell in between. Democrats were more likely to report watching MSNBC or CNN (vs. not), while Republicans were more likely to report watching Fox News (vs. not), and Third Party/Independents tended to watch neither. However, political inclinations predicted reported policy preferences, mask use, and social distancing, in analyses that accounted for differences in use of media sources, risk perceptions, and demographic background. In these analyses, participants' reported media use added to the partisan divide in preferences for the timing of lifting economic restrictions and reported protective behaviors. Implications for risk communication are discussed.

To address this problem, we concentrate on the basic reproduction number $R_0$, which is not sensitive to testing coverage and represents transmissibility in an absence of social distancing and in a completely susceptible population. While many variables may potentially influence $R_0$, a high correlation between these variables may obscure the result interpretation. Consequently, we combine Principal Component Analysis with feature selection methods from several regression-based approaches to identify the main demographic and meteorological drivers behind $R_0$. We robustly obtain that country's wealth/development (GDP per capita or Human Development Index) is the most important $R_0$ predictor at the global level, probably being a good proxy for the overall contact frequency in a population. This main effect is modulated by built-up area per capita (crowdedness in indoor space), onset of infection (likely related to increased awareness of infection risks), net migration, unhealthy living lifestyle/conditions including pollution, seasonality, and possibly BCG vaccination prevalence. Also, we argue that several variables that significantly correlate with transmissibility do not directly influence $R_0$ or affect it differently than suggested by naive analysis.","Djordjevic, Marko; Salom, Igor; Markovic, Sofija; Rodic, Andjela; Milicevic, Ognjen; Djordjevic, Magdalena",,172,26

Machine learning algorithms represent a novel approach for the data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modeling. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learning-based score-the Piacenza score-for 30-day mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The study comprised 852 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted to the Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Italy from February to November 2020. Patients' medical history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using an electronic health record. The overall patient data set was randomly split into derivation and test cohorts. The score was obtained through the naïve Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients admitted to Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Italy) in February 2020. Using a forward-search algorithm, 6 features were identified: age, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, temperature, previous stroke, and gender. The Brier index was used to evaluate the ability of the machine learning model to stratify and predict the observed outcomes. A user-friendly website was designed and developed to enable fast and easy use of the tool by physicians. Regarding the customization properties of the Piacenza score, we added a tailored version of the algorithm to the website, which enables an optimized computation of the mortality risk score for a patient when some of the variables used by the Piacenza score are not available. In this case, the naïve Bayes classifier is retrained over the same derivation cohort but using a different set of patient characteristics. We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a naïve Bayes algorithm with 14 features chosen a priori. RESULTS: The Piacenza score exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier score=0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier score=0.16) in the external validation cohort, showing a comparable accuracy with respect to the 4C score and to the naïve Bayes model with a priori chosen features; this achieved an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier score=0.26) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier score=0.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that a customizable machine learning-based score with a purely data-driven selection of features is feasible and effective for the prediction of mortality among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Halasz, Geza; Sperti, Michela; Villani, Matteo; Michelucci, Umberto; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Biagi, Andrea; Rossi, Luca; Botti, Andrea; Mari, Chiara; Maccarini, Marco; Pura, Filippo; Roveda, Loris; Nardecchia, Alessia; Mottola, Emanuele; Nolli, Massimo; Salvioni, Elisabetta; Mapelli, Massimo; Deriu, Marco Agostino; Piga, Dario; Piepoli, Massimo",J Med Internet Res,172,32

The reason for this reduction remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore potential causes of the decrease in preterm birth exploring three hypotheses: 1. Do women who are more likely to be able to work from home incur less physical and/or emotional stress resulting in longer gestation? 2. Does the effect of COVID-19 on preterm birth vary by race? 3. Is the change provider driven? STUDY DESIGN: Using a retrospective cohort of all singleton deliveries at a single tertiary care center, we compared deliveries prior to COVID-19 (1/1/2018-1/31/2020) to those occurring during the pandemic (4/1/2020-10/27/2020). Comparisons were made pre- and post-COVID using Pearson's chi-square or t-tests as appropriate. Preterm birth, defined as delivery at <37 weeks' gestation, was analyzed overall then further classified into spontaneous and indicated. The population was then stratified by: 1. Insurance type and neighborhood disadvantage, 2. Race, and 3. Provider type. Provider type was classified as within an OPC, a clinic that provides prenatal care to those eligible for Medical Assistance, compared with non-OPC. RESULTS: In a population of 17,687 pre-COVID deliveries, and 5,396 post-COVID deliveries, there was a significant decrease in overall preterm birth (11.1 vs. 10.1%; p=0.039). Both spontaneous and indicated preterm deliveries decreased in the full population. When stratified, decreases in spontaneous preterm birth pre- versus post-COVID, were limited to deliveries to women from more advantaged neighborhoods (most advantaged: 4.4 vs. 3.8%; least advantaged: 7.2 vs. 7.4%), white mothers (white: 5.6 vs. 4.7%; black: 6.6 vs. 7.1%), and those receiving care from non-OPC providers (non-OPC providers: 5.5 vs 4.8%; OPC-providers: 6.3 vs 6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreases in spontaneous preterm birth were limited to deliveries in white women, living in more advantaged neighborhoods and delivered by non-OPC providers.

The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.","Yang, Yiyan; Yan, Wei; Hall, A Brantley; Jiang, Xiaofang",Mol. biol. evol,172,13

Mental health service users' experiences, reflecting on the complex nature of using music participation in recovery are, however, limited. This essay considers literature that explores how music can support mental health service users in a recovery process. We have selected studies that include a broad spectrum of music activities, as well as literature considering various concepts about recovery. The conceptual recovery framework CHIME, that includes five important components in the recovery process, is used as the backdrop for exploring music activities as a contribution to recovery-oriented practice and services in mental health care. Eleven key components are identified in which music can support the recovery process: Feelings of equality; Social and emotional wellbeing; Tolerance; Hope and social agency; Triggering encounters; Redefining and reframing; A social practice; Moments of flow and peak experiences; Moments of meaning; Continuity; and Potentials instead of limitations. This essay concludes that the experiential knowledge of music activities from service users' perspectives is essential knowledge when developing and using music activities in mental health recovery services. While this essay acknowledges that music activities can also produce unintended negative outcomes, the focus is on the positive contributions of music to mental health recovery processes.","Damsgaard, Janne Brammer; Jensen, Anita",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),172,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 2020 until July 2020, 11 consecutive patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PPLs sized over 5 mm were investigated by B-mode ultrasound (B-US) and CEUS. The homogeneity of enhancement (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) was examined retrospectively using CEUS. An inhomogeneous enhancement was defined as a perfused lesion with coexisting non-perfused areas (NPA). RESULTS: On B-US, all 11 patients showed an interstitial syndrome (B-lines) with PPLs between 0.5 and 6 cm. On CEUS, all cases showed peripheral NPA during the complete CEUS examination. One patient underwent a partial lung resection with subsequent histopathological examination. The histological examination showed vasculitis, microthrombus in the alveolar capillary, and small obliterated vessels. CONCLUSION: In our case series, PPLs in patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection presented a CEUS pattern with NPA during the complete CEUS examination. Our findings suggest a peripheral pulmonary perfusion disturbance in patients with COVID-19 infection. In 1 case, the histopathological correlation with the perfusion disturbance in the PPL was proven.","Safai Zadeh, Ehsan; Beutel, Björn; Dietrich, Christoph Frank; Keber, Corinna Ulrike; Huber, Katharina Paulina; Görg, Christian; Trenker, Corinna",J. ultrasound med,172,24

As a result, 372 public libraries in NSW ceased operation on the 23rd March 2020. While the closure of public libraries will undoubtedly contribute to restricting the spread of the coronavirus, given the pivotal role played by municipal libraries in local communities, as well as the special characteristics of library patrons, it will have other negative consequences. In this paper we consider the impact of the closure of municipal libraries in NSW from two perspectives: (a) its effect on the fiscal circumstances of local authorities and (b) its impact on the spread of the corona contagion as well as its broader effects on local community wellbeing. We conclude that rather than complete closure, partial constraints on library use should have been considered.","Wallace, Andrea; Dollery, Brian",Rev. adm. pública (Online),172,6

AIMS: Aim of the study is to illustrate how the workload and outcome of radiological exams changed in a community hospital during the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The exams performed in the radiology department from March 9th to March 29th, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and compared to the exams conducted during the same time-period in 2019. Only exams coming from the emergency department (ED) were included. Two radiologists defined the cases as positive or negative findings, based on independent blind readings of the imaging studies. Categorical measurements are presented as frequency and percentages, and p-values are calculated using the Chi-squared test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in the amount of exams performed in 2020: there were 143 (93|65% male, 60.7±21.5 years) patients who underwent radiological examinations from the ED vs. 485 (255|53% male, 51.2±24.8 years) in 2019. Furthermore, the total number of ED exams dropped from 699 (2019) to 215 (2020). However, the percentage of patients with a positive result was significantly higher in 2020 (69|48%) compared to 2019 (151|31%) (p<.001). The reduction of emergency radiological examinations might be a result of the movement restrictions enforced during the lockdown, and possible fear of the hospital as a contagious place. This translated to a relative increase of positive cases as only patients with very serious conditions were accessing the ED.","Vingiani, Vincenzo; Abadia, Andres F; Posa, Alessandro; Corvino, Antonio; Pasqualetto, Luigi; Presidente, Alfonso; Losco, Matteo; Gray, Hunter N; Schoepf, U Joseph",Acta Biomed,172,1

The recent National Academy of Medicine report also noted the limited evidence base supporting interventions;however, the report provided approaches that could be implemented by family physicians caring for patients who are experiencing social isolation and loneliness.1 Social prescribing is an approach involving the activities that health care professionals can suggest to link patients with nonclinical support services, which are often found in the community.1 Primary care physicians can implement social prescribing in multiple ways, including a direct referral to community-based agencies through the use of a practice-based care manager for assessing needs and tailoring the referral or by providing access to a directory of support services for patients and family caregivers.1 Peer support groups, particularly for patients with a shared illness or condition, have an extensive evidence base in chronic disease self-management and may benefit those who are socially isolated or lonely.1,14 Although cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy have the potential to mitigate the negative perceptions of social interactions, the evidence demonstrating effectiveness is limited.1 In addition to its role in assessment, information technology may offer new tools to deliver individual or group interventions to this population.1 Social media virtual communities and video-assisted friendly visits are among these intervention strategies that are currently being researched.1 The National Academy of Medicine recommends that physicians, clinical practices, and health care systems partner with community-based providers to promote care that includes and facilitates the use of tailored social services in addressing social isolation and loneliness in older adults.1 Many countries, having identified the public health implications of social isolation and loneliness, have launched initiatives to support systems-level interventions, and regional organizations have created directories of resources (Table 2). [...]screening for comorbid mood disorders may provide an opportunity to offer a more directed intervention, such as cognitive behavior therapy.","Lahlou, Rita M.; Daaleman, Timothy P.",American Family Physician,172,20

Hyper acute diagnosis and treatment are key factors which decrease mortality and morbidity in stroke patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a great strain on the healthcare system, and as a result clinicians are facing several barriers in diagnosing and treating strokes. Delayed presentation of strokes is a problem as some in the general population defer the decision to seek immediate medical attention fearing contracting the virus. Also playing a role is the paucity of healthcare professionals available during a pandemic. Recent literature demonstrates the association of acute strokes in young patients with COVID-19. Lack of clear pathophysiology of the neurological manifestations from COVID-19 intensifies the problem. A thorough examination of the intensive care unit patient has always been a challenge owing to several factors including use of sedatives, sepsis, uremia, and encephalopathy secondary to medications. Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) secondary to stroke is much more challenging to diagnose as patients are unable to communicate or elicit any motor functions apart from certain ocular movements. We present the case of a 25 year old patient with no known history of coagulopathy, but had developed COVID-19 cytokine storm which culminated in LIS secondary to pontine strokes.","Avula, Akshay; Gill, Arshpal; Nassar, Ra039; ed,; Nalleballe, Krishna; Siddamreddy, Suman; Chalhoub, Michel",J Clin Neurosci,172,24

This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on GI fellowship training. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was sent out to GI fellows in Korea between 15 February and 15 March 2021. The questionnaire included questions regarding the characteristics of GI fellows, perception of COVID-19 outbreak, impact of COVID-19 outbreak, and telemedicine on the education of a GI fellowship. Results: Among 111 answers, 94 respondents were analyzed. The GI fellows were provided with sufficient information about the COVID-19 outbreak (74.7%), well educated, and provided with personal protective equipment use (74.7% and 83.9%, respectively). On the other hand, outpatient schedule and volume decreased in 25.5% and 37.8% of respondents, respectively. Moreover, endoscopy sessions and volume decreased in 51.1% and 65.6% of respondents, respectively. As a result, 78.9% of respondents were concerned that the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affected their education. Telemedicine utilization was introduced during the COVID-19 outbreak, but only 20.0% and 10.6% of respondents agreed that telemedicine has benefits from the patient's and doctor's perspectives, respectively. In addition, only 25.9% of respondents were willing to continue telemedicine if adequately reimbursed, and 68.2% of respondents were concerned that it adversely affected their education. Conclusions: The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected GI fellowship training in Korea for outpatient clinics, gastrointestinal endoscopy, educational conferences, and telemedicine. This study highlights that GI fellowship training needs more attention in the COVID-19 outbreak.","Shin, Hyun Phil; Cha, Jae Myung; Kim, Beom Kyung; Myung, Dae-Seong; Moon, Sung-Hoon; Song, Myeong Jun; Yoon, Seung Bae; Yoo, In Kyung; Lee, Jeong Hoon; Jun, Baek Gyu; Hyun, Jong Jin",Korean J Gastroenterol,172,25

Objective: To assess how Dutch patients with cancer perceive cancer treatment and follow-up care (including experiences with telephone and video consultations [TC/VC]) and patients' well-being in comparison with a norm population during the COVID-19 crisis. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of patients participating in the Dutch Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry and a norm population who completed a questionnaire from April to May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with changes in cancer care (treatment or follow-up appointment postponed/canceled or changed to TC/VC). Differences in quality of life, anxiety/depression, and loneliness between patients and age-matched and sex-matched norm participants were evaluated with regression models. Results: The online questionnaire was completed by 4094 patients (48.6% response), of whom most were male (2493 [60.9%]) and had a mean (SD) age of 63.0 (11.1) years. Of these respondents, 886 (21.7%) patients received treatment; 2725 (55.6%) received follow-up care. Treatment or follow-up appointments were canceled for 390 (10.8%) patients, whereas 160 of 886 (18.1%) in treatment and 234 of 2725 (8.6%) in follow-up had it replaced by a TC/VC. Systemic therapy, active surveillance, or surgery were associated with cancellation of treatment or follow-up appointment. Younger age, female sex, comorbidities, metastasized cancer, being worried about getting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and receiving supportive care were associated with replacement of a consultation with a TC/VC. Patients and norm participants reported that the COVID-19 crisis made them contact their general practitioner (852 of 4068 [20.9%] and 218 of 979 [22.3%]) or medical specialist/nurse (585 of 4068 [14.4%] and 144 of 979 [14.7%]) less quickly when they had physical complaints or concerns. Most patients who had a TC/VC preferred a face-to-face consultation, but 151 of 394 (38.3%) were willing to use a TC/VC again. Patients with cancer were more worried about getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with the 977 norm participants (917 of 4094 [22.4%] vs 175 of 977 [17.9%]). Quality of life, anxiety, and depression were comparable, but norm participants more often reported loneliness (114 of 977 [11.7%] vs 287 of 4094 [7.0%]) than patients with cancer (P = .009). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with cancer in the Netherlands, 1 in 3 reported changes in cancer care in the first weeks of the COVID-19 crisis. Long-term outcomes need to be monitored. The crisis may affect the mental well-being of the general population relatively more than that of patients with cancer.","van de Poll-Franse, Lonneke V; de Rooij, Belle H; Horevoorts, Nicole J E; May, Anne M; Vink, Geraldine R; Koopman, Miriam; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Besselink, Marc G; Oerlemans, Simone; Husson, Olga; Beijer, Sandra; Ezendam, Nicole P M; Raijmakers, Natasja J H; Wollersheim, Barbara M; Hoedjes, Meeke; Siesling, Sabine; van Eenbergen, Mies C; Mols, Floortje",JAMA oncol.

This contrasts with other respiratory viruses where disease manifestations are often more severe in children. We hypothesize that a more robust early innate immune response to SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protects against severe disease.METHODSClinical outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 viral copies, and cellular gene expression were compared in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained at the time of presentation to the emergency department from 12 children and 27 adults using bulk RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Total protein, cytokines, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were quantified in nasal fluid.RESULTSSARS-CoV-2 copies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and TMPRSS2 gene expression were similar in children and adults, but children displayed higher expression of genes associated with IFN signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome, and other innate pathways. Higher levels of IFN-&#945;2, IFN-Î³, IP-10, IL-8, and IL-1ß protein were detected in nasal fluid in children versus adults. Children also expressed higher levels of genes associated with immune cells, whereas expression of those associated with epithelial cells did not differ in children versus adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were detected at similar levels in nasal fluid from both groups. None of the children required supplemental oxygen, whereas 7 adults did (P = 0.03); 4 adults died.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide direct evidence of a more vigorous early mucosal immune response in children compared with adults and suggest that this contributes to favorable clinical outcomes.FUNDINGNIH grants R01 AI134367, UL1 TR002556, T32 AI007501, T32GM007288, P30 AI124414; an Albert Einstein College of Medicine Dean's COVID-19 Pilot Research Award; and the Eric J.

Based on the experience of Italy, the present article contributes to the strategies aimed at preventing a second virus outbreak. In fact, the mismanagement of municipal solid waste could undermine the strategies during the ease of the lockdown. During the SARS-COV-2 outbreak in Italy, there was a general decrease in the selective collection rate (-15% in one municipality with a well-developed door-to-door collection system). Delays in the publication of guidelines on waste management impacted on the safety of the operators collecting potentially infected waste. Contrarily to expectations, single-use masks and gloves do not have significant impact on waste management, accounting for <1% of the residual municipal solid waste collected annually. However, the dispersion of abandoned masks and gloves outside indoor environments is creating environmental problems. Recommendations on waste management and the protection of waste operators are discussed. Finally, guidelines on the most appropriate waste treatment are presented and analyzed. The results presented in this article show that the MSW management sector has found useful solutions to tackle COVID-19; however, these solutions are not being shared sufficiently. The case study analyzed in the present work could help define strategies for preventing or controlling similar future epidemics or pandemic episodes.","Ragazzi, Marco; Rada, Elena Cristina; Schiavon, Marco",Sci Total Environ,172,13

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) in eight Israeli general hospitals. The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We surveyed HCWs in COVID-19 units and comparison units (internal medicine and cardiology) between 30th April and 7th May 2020. RESULTS: There were 522 participants: 291 from COVID-19 units and 231 from comparison units. Only one participant (0.2%, 95%CI: 0.005-1.1%)-an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID-19 unit-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In participating COVID-19 units there were two symptomatic HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 in the 2 weeks before the survey; both were infected by contact with a co-worker outside of the COVID-19 unit. CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among HCWs, coupled with an absence of symptomatic COVID-19 acquired during patient care, suggest that Israel's national guidelines for personal protective equipment, which are consistent with those of the World Health Organization, adequately protect HCWs.","Temkin, Elizabeth",Clin. microbiol. infect,172,32

Baseline vaccination rates (March 2019) for pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza at our tertiary cancer centre were 8% and 40%, respectively. The aim of this study was to increase the number of gynecologic chemotherapy patients receiving pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations to 80% by March 2020. METHODS: We performed an interrupted time series study using structured quality improvement methodology. Three interventions were introduced to address vaccination barriers: an in-house vaccination program, a staff education campaign, and a patient care bundle (pre-printed prescription, information brochure, vaccine record booklet). Process and outcome data were collected by patient survey and pharmacy audit and analyzed on statistical process control charts. RESULTS: We identified 195 eligible patients. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates rose significantly from 5% to a monthly mean of 61% and from 36% to a monthly mean of 67%, respectively. The 80% target was reached for both vaccines during one or more months of study. The in-house vaccination and staff education programs were major contributors to the improvement, whereas the information brochure and record booklet were minor contributors. CONCLUSIONS: Three interventions to promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination among chemotherapy patients resulted in significantly improved vaccination rates. Lessons learned about promoting vaccine uptake may be generalizable to different populations and vaccine types. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, initiatives to expand the program to all chemotherapy patients at our centre are underway.","McGinnis, Justin M; Jones, Rebecca; Hillis, Christopher; Kokus, Heather; Thomas, Heidi; Thomas, Jason; Alyafi, Mohammad; Bernard, Laurence; Eiriksson, Lua R; Elit, Lorraine M; Hirte, Hal; Jimenez, Waldo; Reade, Clare J; Kumar Tyagi, Nidhi; Helpman, Limor",Gynecol Oncol,172,16

The precise role of such palmitoylation of the spike protein in membrane fusion and infection is not completely understood. Here, we report that palmitoylation of the first five cysteine residues of the c-terminal cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike are indispensable for infection and palmitoylation deficient spike mutants are defective in trimerization and subsequent membrane fusion. The DHHC9 palmitoyltransferase interacts with and palmitoylates the spike protein in the ER and Golgi, and knockdown of DHHC9 results in reduced fusion and infection of SARS-CoV-2. Two bis-piperazine backbone-based DHHC9 inhibitors inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein palmitoylation and the resulting progeny virion particles released are defective in fusion and infection. This establishes these palmitoyltransferase inhibitors as potential new intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Ramadan, Ahmed A.; Mayilsamy, Karthick; McGill, Andrew R.; Ghosh, Anandita; Giulianotti, Marc A.; Donow, Haley M.; Mohapatra, Shyam S.; Mohapatra, Subhra; Chandran, Bala; Deschenes, Robert J.; Roy, Arunava",,172,23

It will take several years of persistent investment efforts to restore the pre-pandemic level of capacity and put global output back to potential. By using a production function based on the incremental capital-output ratio, we estimate the loss of production capacity for the global economy and for the two main world locomotives, the U.S. and China. To do this, we estimate the production capacity implied in our current recession baseline and the capacity that would have existed in the absence of the pandemic (precrisis scenario). The difference between the two estimates is defined as the loss of capacity generated by the pandemic.

Our objectives were to evaluate long-term IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and B-cell memory response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from a cohort of subjects recovering from COVID-19 disease and from healthy subjects that donated blood. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were quantitatively detected by ELISA using anti-S1 spike IgG. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG memory B-cells were evaluated in a randomly selected group of COVID-19 recovering subjects by reversed B-cell FluroSpot based on human IgG SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain. Statistical analysis was performed with clinical variables and time post-COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Antibody response was not detected in 26 of 392 (6.6%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Over a period of 9 months, the level of antibodies decreased by 50% but stabilized at 6 months and prevailed a protective level up to 9 months. No differences were found regarding IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody levels for age, gender, and major blood types, over-time. COVID-19 asymptomatic subjects did not differ in antibody level overtime from subjects with mild to severe disease. Repeated paired IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody level analyses disclosed that over 6 and 9 months, 15.3% (9 of 59) and 15.8% (3 of 19) of subjects became SARS-COV-2 IgG seronegative, respectively, all with low antibody level at 3 months. Rate of antibody decline was not affected by age, gender, or clinical symptomatology. In a subgroup of recovering subjects, memory B-cell response up to 9-months post COVID-19 infection, was undetectable in 31.8% (14/44) of subjects with no correlation to age, SARS-COV-2 antibody level, or time post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of COVID-19 convalescent subjects develop IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody response that prevails a protective level over a period of up to 9-months regardless of age, gender, major blood types or clinical symptomatology.","Achiron, Anat; Gurevich, Michael; Falb, Rina; Dreyer-Alster, Sapir; Sonis, Polina; Mandel, Mathilda",Clin. microbiol. infect,172,16

We outline in this commentary some of these social elements and how they may have influenced face mask use during the early stages of the pandemic. The purpose is to expand the perspective on mechanisms that are relevant to consider in pandemic response planning. Our look at these fundamental elements showed that latent aspects of the dominant culture and various symbolic meanings of behaviors can reduce adherence with public health recommendations if they are overlooked in the strategic health plans. We conclude that when policymakers decide non-pharmacological interventions during pandemics, they should take into account fundamental attitudes and beliefs that may influence population behavior.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the social and professional effects of confinement on patients with MS in 2 very different populations, from Spain and China. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to a group of patients with MS who consulted at the MS unit of Vithas hospital (DINAC Foundation) in Seville, and patients with MS attended in several provinces of China in April 2020, with the aim of analysing the differences and similarities between populations in the social and professional effects of confinement. To this end, a database was created and subsequently analysed. RESULTS: The Chinese population includes a higher proportion of younger patients and no differences were identified regarding sex. Most of the variables studied behaved in the same way in both patient populations. Spanish patients presented a lesser impact (30.7%) on their socio-economic situation than Chinese patients (44%) (P < .05). There were no significant differences between populations in the remaining variables. Social networks were widely used in the majority of patients from both populations. CONCLUSIONS: The social and professional consequences of the pandemic were very similar in both groups; the use of social networks and family support was also similar.

Total number of infections, COVID-19 related deaths, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, cost for critical and non-critical care, and productivity loss were estimated. Results: In the 20% population coverage scenario, 2 million more infections were prevented by vaccinating the 15-34 age group first, compared to vaccinating those over 65 first. A £6.6 billion reduction (13%) in direct healthcare costs was predicted by prioritising people over 65. Productivity and QALY losses were minimised by prioritising the 15-34 age group, while only vaccinating those over 65 resulted in the lowest number of deaths. Increasing population coverage from 20% to 50% resulted in drops in QALY loss and healthcare burden, but did not affect the age group strategy. A strategy that prioritises elderly vaccination would minimise QALY losses only if the death rate amongst 15-34s dropped by 17.4% (from 10.9% to 9%). Conclusions: With constraints in vaccine supplies, greater reductions in hospitalisation costs related to COVID-19 and deaths were associated with a vaccination strategy prioritising older age groups. Lower QALY and productivity losses were associated with a vaccination strategy prioritising younger cohorts. Future research adding age-group specific social distancing measures may provide further insights.","Song, W.; Yi, Y.",Value in Health,172,29

This video tutorial describes our technique for the intrapericardial isolation of the left inferior pulmonary vein in a patient affected by a left lower lobe metastasis from a colonic carcinoma. The lesion was retracting the inferior vein to such an extent that an intrapericardial approach was required in order to obtain a radical resection. The operation was carried out using a 3-port technique to allow for safe and unhindered manipulation of the hilar structures and the parenchyma. The pericardial sac was easily opened and the feasibility of the procedure was readily confirmed.

They often need help from family members and friends to provide comprehensive care. When death occurs, funerals and other death-related rituals bring family and communities together to honor the life and mourn the death of a loved one and provide needed support to family and caregivers. These collective rituals are often deeply rooted in culturally-bound values and can facilitate grief and help make sense about loss. Rituals act as bridge-building activities that allow people to organize and appraise emotions, information, and actions after a loss. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recommended restrictions to reduce infection and transmission, family members and caregivers are often faced with weighing options for honored rituals to help them grieve. Grieving during the pandemic has become disorganized. The purpose of this article is to provide case managers and other clinical staff with recommendations on guiding caregivers/families through safety precautions when a loved one dies either because of a life-limiting illness or from COVID-19 during the pandemic using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors also present information about complicated grief and ways to support coping with death and suggest safe alternatives to traditional death-related rituals and funerals in a COVID-19 era. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Primary practice settings include home health care, hospice, hospital discharge planning, case management, and primary care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Precautions necessary in a COVID-19 era may add anxiety and stress to an already difficult situation of caring for loved ones at end-of-life and grieving with their loss. Utilization of CDC guidelines lessens the risk of infection while honoring loved ones' wishes and cultural traditions surrounding death and burial. Recognition of social and spiritual connections that comfort mourners must also be considered.

BACKGROUND: To meet the workforce needs of nurses who care for adults with cancer, an academic-practice partnership was created in 2016. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing, North Carolina Cancer Hospital and UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center collaborated to provide structured clinical and didactic practice experiences for undergraduate nursing students interested in oncology nursing. With COVID-19, nursing students were not permitted to be in the clinical setting. DESIGN: Discursive paper. METHOD: An innovative and collaborative partnership created reflective and interactive activities. The majority of the learning activities were created at the revised Bloom's taxonomy level of application or higher, with some encompassing multiple levels. Students engaged in a variety of meaningful experiences requiring multiple learning processes that promoted professional development in the interpersonal and critical thinking domains. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the delivery of oncology nurse fellowship was successful because of innovative virtual strategies. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our academic-practice partnership allowed the nursing students to develop their interpersonal and critical thinking skills without entering the clinical site. This is an approach encouraged by the authors for other schools of nursing.

Several studies have been proposed and started since then, mainly covering prevention, diagnosis, management, and treatment. Objective: To identify and categorize all intervention studies up to the end of May related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to population and geo-graphical location (emphasis in Latin America) and to verify if there is any correlation according to purpose, phase, and recruitment status. Methods: One thousand six hundred seventy-two trials were selected from 1705 until May 24 on the World Health Organization clinical trials platform related to COVID-19. Jupyter and Python tools were used for data processing and cleaning. Results: One thousand six hundred seventy-two intervention studies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found. China, The United States, Iran, France, and Spain are the countries participating in the largest number of studies, while only 4,1% are from Latin America (mostly Brazilian). 28 studies are focusing only on older adults, and ten studies are based exclusively on populations under 19 years of age. Conclusion: The worldwide interest in this new disease is reflected in the increasing number of intervention studies that are being carried out to date. How-ever, the studies analyzed do not cover the most vulnerable age groups proportionally and do not have equitable participation of all the coun-tries. In Latin America, this problem is exacerbated by the region's social, economic, and political limitations. Because it is an emerging disease, there is still not enough information to establish strong correlations between the analyzed variables, and the standardization of protocols is not yet definite because most of the studies are in progress.","Solano-Sandí, Luis Armando; Cambronero-Valverde, Mónica; Herrera-Watson, Guadalupe",Medwave,172,1

Previous work has focused on supervised learning solutions, where ground truth data, in the form of historical syndromic surveillance reports, can be used to train machine learning models. However, no sufficient data -- in terms of accuracy and time span -- exist to apply such approaches for monitoring the emerging COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, unsupervised, or semi-supervised solutions should be sought. Recent outcomes have shown that it is possible to transfer an online search based model for influenza-like illness from a source to a target country without using ground truth data for the target location. The transferred model's accuracy depends on choosing search queries and their corresponding weights wisely, via a transfer learning methodology, for the target location. In this work, we draw a parallel to previous findings and attempt to develop an unsupervised model for COVID-19 by: (i) carefully choosing search queries that refer to related symptoms as identified by a survey from the National Health Service in the United Kingdom (UK), and (ii) weighting them based on their reported ratio of occurrence in people infected by COVID-19. Furthermore, understanding that online searches may be also driven by concern rather than infections, we devise a preliminary approach that attempts to minimise this part of the signal by incorporating a basic news media coverage metric in association with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Finally, we propose a transfer learning method for mapping supervised COVID-19 models from a country to another, in an effort to transfer knowledge from areas where the disease has a more extended progression.","Lampos, Vasileios; Moura, Simon; Yom-Tov, Elad; Edelstein, Michael; Majumder, Maimuna; McKendry, Rachel A.; Cox, Ingemar J.",,172,1

A preliminary report,16.287857,10.83276,2020,"The CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) contains one of the longest N termini among class A G protein-coupled receptors. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the allosteric binding site of cannabidiol (CBD) involves residues from the N terminal domain. In order to study the allosteric binding of CBD to CB1R we modeled the whole N-terminus of this receptor using the replica exchange molecular dynamics with solute tempering (REST2) approach. Then, the obtained structures of CB1R with the N terminus were used for ligand docking. A natural cannabinoid receptor agonist, &#916;9-THC, was docked to the orthosteric site and a negative allosteric modulator, CBD, to the allosteric site positioned between extracellular ends of helices TM1 and TM2. The molecular dynamics simulations were then performed for CB1R with ligands: (i) CBD together with THC, and (ii) THC-only. Analyses of the differences in the residue-residue interaction patterns between those two cases allowed us to elucidate the allosteric network responsible for the modulation of the CB1R by CBD. In addition, we identified the changes in the orthosteric binding mode of &#916;9-THC, as well as the changes in its binding energy, caused by the CBD allosteric binding. We have also found that the presence of a complete N-terminal domain is essential for a stable binding of CBD in the allosteric site of CB1R as well as for the allosteric-orthosteric coupling mechanism.","Jakowiecki, Jakub; Abel, Renata; Orzel, Urszula; Pasznik, Pawel; Preissner, Robert; Filipek, Slawomir",Molecules (Basel),172,6

Previous means of acquiring this information in the examination room were insufficient to block the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate the deployment of an automatic triage system to triage outpatients over the internet. METHODS: An automatic system was incorporated in the existing online appointment system of the hospital and deployed along with its on-site counterpart. Automatic query to the VPN travel and contact history database with each patient's National ID number was made for each attempt to acquire the patient's travel and contact history. Patients with relevant histories were denied registration or entry. Text messages were sent to patients without relevant history for the expedited route of entry if applicable. RESULTS: A total of 127857 visits was recorded. Among all the visits, 91195 were registered online. Seventy-one thousand eight hundred and sixteen of them generated text messages for expedited route of entry. Sixty-five patients had relevant histories revealed by the VPN database and were denied registration or entry. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic system to acquire outpatients' relevant travel and contact histories was deployed rapidly in one of the largest academic medical centers in Taiwan. The updated system successfully denied patients with relevant travel or contact histories entry to the hospital without causing long lines.

Demographic factors are significantly predictive of encounter type. Of any age group, patients 65+ had the lowest odds of using telehealth versus other modalities. By race and ethnicity, Black and Hispanic patients have lower odds of using telehealth versus either the ER or an office visit than either Whites or Asians - this remains true even after adjusting for age, comorbidities and preferred language.

PURPOSE: To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a pharmacy clinical decision support tool designed to increase naloxone coprescription among people at risk for opioid overdose in a large healthcare system. SUMMARY: The Military Health System Opioid Registry and underlying presentation layer were used to develop a clinical decision support capability to improve naloxone coprescription at the pharmacy point of care. Pharmacy personnel use a patient identification card barcode scanner or manually enter a patient's identification number to quickly visualize information on a patient's risk for opioid overdose and medical history related to pain and, when appropriate, receive a recommendation to coprescribe naloxone. The tool was made available to military treatment facility pharmacy locations. An interactive dashboard was developed to support monitoring, utilization, and impact on naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose. CONCLUSION: Initial implementation of the naloxone tool was slow from a lack of end-user awareness. Efforts to increase utilization were, in part, successful owing to a number of enterprise-wide educational initiatives. In early 2020, the naloxone tool was used in 15% of all opioid prescriptions dispensed at a military pharmacy. Data indicate that the frequency of naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose was significantly higher when the naloxone tool was used than when the tool was not used.","Rittel, Alexander; Highland, Krista; Maneval, Mark S; Bockhorst, Archie; Moreno, Agustin; Sim, Alan; Easter, Peter; Nichols, Chris; Costantino, Ryan C",Am. j. health system pharm,172,1

Methods: We performed a retrospective elderly cohort study from 19,987 participants with mean age 73 years old in the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We examined the risk of incident dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia, according to the quartile of Bwt variability, represented as coefficient of variation (Bwt-CV), SD (Bwt-SD), and variability independent of the mean (Bwt-VIM). Results: In fully adjusted model, the group with the highest Bwt variability (Bwt-VIM Q4) showed an increased risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.206-1.603) and Alzheimer's dementia (HR 1.46, CI 1.240-1.724) compared to the lowest quartile (Bwt-VIM Q1). We also found that subjects with the highest Bwt variability (Q4) and underweight BMI had a significantly increased risk of developing dementia (HR 1.994, 95% CI 1.302-3.054), while subjects with low Bwt variability (Q1 and Q2) and obese BMI had decreased risk of dementia (HR 0.664, 95% CI 0.505-0.872 and HR 0.648, 95% CI 0.493-0.852, respectively) compared to reference group (lowest Bwt variability (Q1) with normal baseline BMI). The effect of Bwt variability on the incidence of dementia was more prominent in subjects <75 years old and abnormal BMI groups (P for interaction < 0.05). Conclusion: The present study revealed that high Bwt variability was associated with an increased risk of dementia in the elderly.","Roh, Eun; Hwang, Soon Young; Kim, Jung A; Lee, You-Bin; Hong, So-Hyeon; Kim, Nam Hoon; Seo, Ji A; Kim, Sin Gon; Kim, Nan Hee; Choi, Kyung Mook; Baik, Sei Hyun; Yoo, Hye Jin",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),172,21

However, its injudicious abstraction and rapidly increasing contamination are posing a severe threat for sustainable water supply worldwide. Geographical Information System (GIS)-based groundwater quality evaluation using Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) has been proved to be a cost-effective tool for assessing groundwater quality and its variability at a larger scale. However, the conventional GQI approach is unable to deal with uncertainties involved in the assessment of environmental problems. To overcome this limitation, a novel hybrid framework integrating Fuzzy Logic with the GIS-based GQI is proposed in this study for assessing groundwater quality and its spatial variability. The proposed hybrid framework is demonstrated through a case study in a hard-rock terrain of Southern India using ten prominent groundwater-quality parameters measured during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Two conventional GIS-based GQI models GQI-10 (using all the ten groundwater-quality parameters) and GQI-7 (using seven 'concerned/critical' groundwater-quality parameters) as well as hybrid Fuzzy-GIS-based GQI (FGQI) models (using seven critical parameters) were developed for the two seasons and the results were compared. The Trapezoidal membership functions classified the model input parameters into 'desirable', 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' classes based on the experts' knowledge and water quality standards for drinking purposes. The concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- in groundwater were found within the WHO desirable limits for drinking water throughout the year, while the concentrations of seven parameters (TDS, NO3--N, Na+, Cl-, K+, F- and Hardness) exceed their permissible limits during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. A comparative evaluation of GQI models revealed that the FGQI model predicts groundwater quality better than the conventional GQI-10 and GQI-7 models. GQI modeling results suggest that the groundwater of most of eastern and southern parts (â¼60% in pre-monsoon season; â¼90% in post-monsoon season) of the study area is unsuitable for drinking. Further, the groundwater quality deteriorates during post-monsoon seasons compared to pre-monsoon seasons, which indicates an increased influx of contaminants from different industries, mining areas, waste disposal sites and agricultural fields during monsoon seasons. This finding calls for the strict enforcement of regulations for proper handling of effluents from various contamination sources in the study area. It is concluded that the fuzzy logic-based decision-making approach (FGQI) is more reliable and pragmatic for groundwater-quality assessment and analysis at a larger scale. It can serve as a useful tool for the water planners and decision makers in efficiently monitoring and managing groundwater quality at watershed or basin scales.","Jha, Madan Kumar; Shekhar, Ankit; Jenifer, M Annie",Water Res,172,12

Therefore, it was particularly important to examine the effect of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The patents of TCM might reflect the latest progression of scientific research. We aimed to provide reference for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by extracting and analyzing the TCM patents from the Patent Information Sharing Platform of COVID-19. The antiviral TCM patents were screened and exported from the Patent Information Sharing Platform. VOSviewer 1.6.14 was used to visualize and analyze the network of TCM in these patents. There were total 292 TCM patents, including 52 patents for etiological treatment and 240 patents for symptomatic treatment. Thirty-two provinces and 1 076 inventors were involved, mainly from Beijing, Guangdong and Jiangsu. Overall, there were 356 TCMs, 71 single prescriptions, and 221 compound prescriptions. The patents for treatment of coronavirus mainly focused on the treatment of coronavirus, while the patents for symptomatic treatment mainly focuses on the improvement of respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough. There were 14 highly frequently used TCMs, including Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Forsythiae Fructus, Isatidis Radix, Astragali Radix, Menthae Haplocalycis Herba, Gypsum Fibrosum, Houttuyniae Herba, Isatidis Folium, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Gardeniae Fructus, Platycodonis Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum.

Saliva may serve as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) as its collection is simple, non-invasive and amenable for mass- and home testing, but its rigorous validation, particularly in children, is missing. We conducted a large-scale head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in saliva and NPS of 1270 adults and children reporting to outpatient test centers and an emergency unit. In total, 273 individuals were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in either NPS or saliva. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in the two specimens showed a high agreement (overall percent agreement = 97.8%). Despite lower viral loads in the saliva of both adults and children, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva fared well compared to NPS (positive percent agreement = 92.5%). Importantly, in children, SARS-CoV-2 infections were more often detected in saliva than NPS (positive predictive value = 84.8%), underlining that NPS sampling in children can be challenging.

Mental health status was assessed using the 7-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). RESULTS: Most callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single, and retired. In total, 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline is a useful initiative to support the psychosocial needs of older adults during a health crisis.","Wahl, Anna-Sophia; Benson, Gloria; Hausner, Lucrezia; Schmitt, Sandra; Knoll, Annika; Ferretti-Bondy, Adriana; Hefter, Dimitri; Froelich, Lutz",,172,20

DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: This study covered 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The participants, who were college students with ordinary full-time status, were surveyed anonymously on their KAP regarding COVID-19 by using self-made questionnaires. In addition, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale was used to assess the psychological status of the students. METHODS: The online cross-sectional study among Chinese college students was conducted in February 2020. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the predictors of anxiety symptoms. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The level of KAP and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 740 college students from 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China were recruited in the survey. Among them, 139 (18.78%) revealed having anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the risk factor for anxiety symptoms with an increased 2.164-fold risk than male gender (OR=2.164, 95% CI=1.279 to 3.662). The knowledge (OR=0.825, 95% CI=0.779 to 0.873) and attitude (OR=0.822, 95% CI=0.762 to 0.887) regarding COVID-19 were protective factors against anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The level of KAP regarding COVID-19 was significantly negatively correlated with anxiety symptoms. Thus, understanding the level of KAP among college students during the early stages of major public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, is important. Such understanding plays an important role in adopting targeted health education strategies and reducing the psychological damage caused by these emergencies.","Jia, Yuehui; Qi, Yanbo; Bai, Li; Han, Yunfeng; Xie, Zhiping; Ge, Jie",BMJ Open,172,3

Derived from an ancient microbial defence system, these so-called ""molecular scissors"" enable precise gene editing with a low error rate. However, CRISPR systems can also be targeted against pathogenic DNA or RNA sequences. This potential is being combined with innovative delivery systems to develop new therapeutic approaches to infectious diseases. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for CRISPR-based strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Reference lists were reviewed and synthesized for narrative review. RESULTS: CRISPR-based strategies represent a novel approach to many challenging infectious diseases. CRISPR technologies can be harnessed to create rapid, low-cost diagnostic systems, as well as to identify drug-resistance genes. Therapeutic strategies, such as CRISPR systems that cleave integrated viral genomes or that target resistant bacteria, are in development. CRISPR-based therapies for emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have also been proposed. Finally, CRISPR systems can be used to reprogram human B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. The risks of CRISPR-based therapies include off-target and on-target modifications. Strategies to control these risks are being developed and a phase 1 clinical trials of CRISPR-based therapies for cancer and monogenic diseases are already underway. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR systems have broad applicability in the field of infectious diseases and may offer solutions to many of the most challenging human infections.","Binnie, Alexandra; Fernandes, Emanuel; Almeida-Lousada, Helder; de Mello, Ramon Andrade; Castelo-Branco, Pedro",Infection,172,16

I argue that loneliness is a relevant issue for bioethicists for three main reasons: it causes ill-health; particularly in the age of Covid-19, it is becoming prominent on the clinical and public health agenda, affecting millions worldwide; and it engenders several ethical and philosophical questions as a social determinant of health with a rich conceptual background. In what follows I first review the link between loneliness and ill-health and argue that it should concern bioethicists because of this link. I also demonstrate how pertinent the issue of loneliness is being considered nowadays, and mark this as another reason for bioethicists to become engaged. I then move on to define loneliness and its various forms, drawing from modern and contemporary philosophers. The way we choose to cope with the pandemic of loneliness depends in part on its theoretical underpinnings, as well as its empirical scope. Theory thus combines with empirical data in order to devise and implement a rational public health policy, necessitating the kind of interdisciplinary approach that is the bedrock of bioethics. I conclude by suggesting future areas of research and recommendations.","Lederman, Zohar",Bioethics,172,16

As sex and age influence the autonomic function associated with BP regulation our study compared BP measurements in supine and sitting positions for men and women of different ages. METHODS: We included 91 men and 118 women (&#8805;18 years) without severe diseases. Hypertension was not an exclusion criterion because it is common in older persons. Mean left brachial BP and heart rate were determined by a digital sphygmomanometer in supine position as well as in sitting position before and after hand force measurement. RESULTS: In a supine position women had slightly lower diastolic BP values than men. After sitting up, the diastolic BP increased in nearly all subjects. This increase was greater in women older than 50 years than for aged-matched men. In contrast to diastolic BP the systolic BP increased after sitting up in only two thirds of the subjects. Especially in women younger than 50 years the systolic BP often did not increase but decreased in response to postural change. The pulse pressure was mostly reduced after sitting up. This reduction was more pronounced in women than men independent of age and physical effort (i.e. hand force measurement). The sitting position also caused an increased heart rate, which was independent of sex and age. CONCLUSION: Postural changes in the systolic and diastolic BP simultaneously depend on sex and age that needs to be considered for BP measurements in supine and sitting body positions.","Bartling, Babett; Schwarzmann, Luisa; Pliquett, Rainer Ullrich; Simm, Andreas; Hofmann, Britt",Z.

Since the first outbreaks in Belgium and the United Kingdom were reported in 1971, PED has spread throughout many countries around the world and causing significant economic loss. This study was conducted to investigate the recent distribution of PEDV strains in Vietnam during the 2015-2016 seasons. METHODS: A total of 30 PED-specific PCR-positive intestinal and faecal samples were collected from unvaccinated piglets in Vietnam during the 2015-2016 seasons. The full length of the spike (S) gene of these PEDV strains were analysed to determine their phylogeny and genetic relationship with other available PEDV strains globally. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S gene sequences revealed that the 28 Vietnamese PEDV strains collected in the northern and central regions clustered in the G2 group (both G2a and G2b sub-groups), while the other 2 PEDV strains (HUA-PED176 and HUA-PED254) collected in the southern region were clustered in the G1/G1b group/sub-group. The nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) analyses based on the complete S gene sequences showed that the Vietnamese PEDV strains were closely related to each other, sharing nt and aa homology of 93.2%-99.9% and 92.6%-99.9%, respectively. The N-glycosylation patterns and mutations in the antigenic region were observed in Vietnamese PEDV strains. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides, for the first time, up-to-date information on viral circulation and genetic distribution, as well as evidence to assist in the development of effective PEDV vaccines in Vietnam.","Than, Van T; Choe, Se-Eun; Vu, Thi T H; Do, Tien D; Nguyen, Thi L; Bui, Thi T N; Mai, Thi N; Cha, Ra M; Song, Daesub; An, Dong-Jun; Le, Van P",Vet Med Sci,172,4

With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. Objective: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of ""psychosis after chloroquine."" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications;however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.

Several studies attempted to identify the user acceptance and profiles of various car-sharing services, but there is a lack of consistent evidence of the psychological drivers of user acceptance. Based on an extension of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), this paper investigates the effects of six psychological constructs on behavioral intention to use ECS. Results from applying structural equation modeling to a survey with 656 respondents in the Netherlands show that social influence represents the most important driver of behavioral intention, followed by performance expectancy and personal attitude. It is also found that high satisfaction with the current means of transport for urban trips contributes to building trust in ECS companies, while car ownership has a negative indirect effect on behavioral intention. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of hygienization measures on behavioral intention is considered. The result shows that respondents have a high degree of trust in ECS operators complying with cleaning requirements, which is translated into a lower degree of anxiety and consequently higher behavioral intention.","Curtale, Riccardo Liao Feixiong van der Waerden Peter",Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,172,1

However, several aspects of this effect remain poorly understood, for example regarding the role of prior religiosity and stress-induced anxiety. This paper explores these aspects in the context of the recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The latter has impacted dramatically on many people's well-being; hence it can be considered a highly stressful event. Through online questionnaires administered to UK (n = 140) and USA (n = 140) citizens professing either Christian faith or no religion, this paper examines the impact of the coronavirus crisis upon common people's religious beliefs. Anxiety about the coronavirus and prior religiosity showed an interaction effect upon change in religious beliefs (t(276) = 2.27, p = .024): for strong believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased strengthening of religious beliefs (r = .249), while for non-believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased scepticism towards religious beliefs (r = - .157). These observations are consistent with the notion that stress-induced anxiety enhances support for an individual's existing ideology already embraced before a stressful event occurs. This study sheds light on the psychological and cultural implications of the coronavirus crisis, which represents one of the most serious health emergencies in recent times.","Rigoli, Francesco",,172,8

This paper aims to assess and characterise SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to identify groups at greatest risk, to establish early measures to curb transmission. We analysed all mandatory notified (i.e. laboratory-confirmed) coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks with more than two cases in Baden-Wuerttemberg from calendar weeks 18-49 (from 27 April to 6 December 2020). We used the following classification for settings: asylum and refugee accommodation, care homes, care facilities, day care child centres, hobby-related, hospitality, hospitals, households, other, residence halls, schools, supported housing, training schools, transportation, treatment facilities and workplace (occupational). We used R program version 3.6.3 for analysis. In our analysis, 3219 outbreaks with 22 238 individuals were included. About 48% were in household and hobby-related settings. Care homes accounted for 9.5% of outbreaks and 21.6% of cases. The median age across all settings was 43 (interquartile range (IQR) 24-63). The median age of cases in care homes was 81 (IQR 56-88). Of all reported cases in care homes, 72.1% were women. Over 30% (466/1511) of hospitalisations were among cases in care homes compared to 17.7% (268/1511) in households. Overall, 70% (500/715) of all deceased persons in outbreaks in the study period were in care homes compared to 4.2% in household settings (30/715). We observed an exponential increase in the number of notified outbreaks starting around the 41st week with N = 291 outbreaks reported in week 49. The median number of cases in outbreaks in care homes and care facilities after the 40th week was 14 (IQR 5-29) and 11 (IQR 5-20), respectively, compared to 3 (IQR 3-5) in households. We observed an increase in hospitalisations, and mortality associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes after the 40th week. We found the care home demographic to be at greatest risk after the 40th week, based on the exponential increase in outbreaks, the number of cases, hospitalisations and mortality trends. Our analysis highlights the necessity of targeted, setting-specific approaches to control transmission in this vulnerable population. Regular screening of staff members and visitors' using rapid antigen point-of-care-tests could be a game-changer in curbing transmission in this setting.","Dressler, Aparna; Finci, Iris; Wagner-Wiening, Christiane; Eichner, Martin; Brockmann, Stefan O",Epidemiol Infect,172,26

It has resulted in multiple fatalities from SARSs all around the world. A year after the global pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported more than 79 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 1.7 million deaths, making it one of the worst and most difficult pandemics encompassed in the modern history. The ongoing triad of escalating infections, mortality, and economic loss has urgently called for recognizing SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms as a crucial step in the initial stages of infection and to which possible interventional strategies should be targeted. To mediate host cell infections, Coronaviruses utilize the immunogenic studded spikes glycoproteins on its surface as a key factor for attachment, fusion, and entrance to host cells. Herein, we shed the light on a potential strategy involving disruption of SARS-CoV-2 S protein interaction with host cell receptors through design of neutralizing antibodies targeting receptor binding domain in S1 subunit, small peptide inhibitors, peptide fusion inhibitors against S2, host cell angiotensin converting enzymes 2 (ACE2), and protease inhibitors, aiming to pave the way for controlling viral cell entrance. In this review, we also highlight the recent research advances in the antiviral drugs that target the highly exposed spike protein, aiming to stem the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kamel, Noha A; El Wakeel, Lamia M; Aboshanab, Khaled M",Viral immunol,172,20

This project surveyed buprenorphine treatment clinics to determine how many accepted pregnant women before and then during the pandemic. Of those clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic, respondents were asked what services were provided and what forms of payment they accepted. METHODS: Between July and September 2020, phone contact was made with every sixth unduplicated clinic in North Carolina listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration treatment locator (Nâ=â490 clinics). The response rate was 53%. RESULTS: Of the 128 clinics responding, 62 clinics (48%) failed to treat pregnant patients both before and during the pandemic, whereas 66 clinics (52%) accepted pregnant patients before the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 44 (66%) of these clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic. Thus, 33% fewer clinics accepted pregnant women for OUD treatment. Of these 44 clinics, 52% provided same-day intake, 45% prescribed naltrexone, and 57% offered detoxification with opioid agonists. Self-pay (95%), private insurance (77%), and Medicaid (55%) were accepted as payment. Clinics commonly reported providing individual counseling (86%). No clinics provided childcare or transportation. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the buprenorphine clinics in North Carolina turned away pregnant patients before the pandemic. During the pandemic, only 34% accepted pregnant patients, with 33% clinics that had provided medication treatment before the pandemic declining to treat pregnant patients for OUD. Thus, it is critical that policymakers ensure OUD treatment clinics accept pregnant patients.","Lensch, Ashley C; Hairston, Essence; Carter, Ginny; Jones, Hendrée E",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),172,15

Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation. A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Presentation of technique: The materials and assembly process of the novel ""Corona Curtain"" are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities. Results: A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct. The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source. Conclusion: The new ""Corona Curtain"" was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units. Future validation studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the intubation tents by quantifying the pre-/post-intubation exposure through ""point-of-care"" SARS-CoV-2 testing once these resources are more widely available.","Hill, Eric; Crockett, Christopher; Circh, Ryan W.; Lansville, Frank; Stahel, Philip F.",Patient Saf.

It is unclear how time spent on housework and childcare has changed between working men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The purpose of this study is to investigate how working men and womens responsibilities for housework and childcare changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan depending on occupation, job type, and the number of employees in the workplace. MethodsA cross-sectional analysis (N=14,454) was conducted using data from an internet monitoring study (CORoNa Work Project), which was conducted in December 2020. A multilevel logistic model with nested prefectures of residence was conducted to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for change in time devoted to housework and childcare among men and women adjusting for age, household income, frequency of telecommuting, presence of spouse who work, occupation, job type, the number of employees in the workplace, and the incidence rate of COVID-19 by prefecture. ResultsRegardless of occupation related factors, more women than men reported increased time spent on housework and childcare. Furthermore, women were significantly more likely to experience an increase in time spent on those activities than men (housework: OR 1.97, 95% CI [1.75, 2.21], p < 0.001; childcare: OR 1.66, 95% CI [1.37, 2.02], p < 0.001).

The objective of this study was to measure the opinions of patients related to the radiology department during the pandemic. Material and Methods: The survey developed by the researcher in line with the current literature was applied to measure the satisfaction of patients in the radiology department. The survey consisted of 26 questions, the first six of which involved demographic characteristics. The survey was conducted with a face-to-face interview method. Results: The study included 300 patients referred to the radiology department due to any reason and who were voluntarily participated. The responders answered the questions that “Did you get information about your radiology examination before your appointment?” as “no” by 78%, “Did you have any questions to radiology department staff after your examinations?” as “yes” by 26% and “Did the staff of the radiology department and/or the radiologist take the time to answer your questions?” as “no” by 60.4%. The overall rate of satisfaction with the services delivered in the radiology department was found as 95%. Discussion: Our survey shows that as high as 95% of the patients who were referred to the radiology department for imaging for any reason were satisfied with the radiology department during the pandemic. Such satisfaction surveys in departments such as radiology, where patients have limited access to staff, especially radiologists, provide valuable feedback to clinicians and other healthcare providers.","Yurdaisik, I.; Aksoy, S.

In this study, we identified an identical ribosomal frameshift motif among the three bat-human pairs of viruses and strong purifying selection after jumping from bats to humans. This represents genetic signatures of coronaviruses that are related to bat-to-human transmission. To further trace the early human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in North America, a geographically stratified genome-wide association study (North American isolates and the remaining isolates) and a retrospective study were conducted. We determined that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 1059.C>T and 25563.G>T were significantly associated with approximately half of the North American SARS-CoV-2 isolates that accumulated largely during March 2020. Retrospectively tracing isolates with these two SNPs was used to reconstruct the early, reliable transmission history of North American SARS-CoV-2, and European isolates (February 26, 2020) showed transmission 3 days earlier than North American isolates and 17 days earlier than Asian isolates. Collectively, we identified the genetic signatures of the three pairs of coronaviruses and reconstructed an early transmission history of North American SARS-CoV-2.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of dental evacuation systems in reducing aerosols during oral prophylactic procedures in a large clinical setting. METHODS: This was a single-center, controlled clinical trial using a split-mouth design. A total of 93 student participants were recruited according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Aerosol samples were collected on blood agar plates that were placed around the clinic at 4 treatment periods: baseline, high-volume evacuation (HVE), combination (HVE and intraoral suction device), and posttreatment. Student operators were randomized to perform oral prophylaxis using ultrasonic scalers on 1 side of the mouth, using only HVE suction for the HVE treatment period and then with the addition of an intraoral suction device for the combination treatment period. Agar plates were collected after each period and incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. Colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were determined using an automatic colony counter. RESULTS: The use of a combination of devices resulted in significant reductions in CFUs compared with the use of the intraoral suction device alone (P < .001). The highest amounts of CFUs were found in the operating zone and on patients during both HVE and combination treatment periods. CONCLUSIONS: Within limitations of this study, the authors found significant reductions in the amount of microbial aerosols when both HVE and an intraoral suction device were used. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The combination of HVE and intraoral suction devices significantly decreases microbial aerosols during oral prophylaxis procedures.","Suprono, Montry S; Won, John; Savignano, Roberto; Zhong, Zhe; Ahmed, Abu; Roque-Torres, Gina; Zhang, Wu; Oyoyo, Udochukwu; Richardson, Paul; Caruso, Joseph; Handysides, Robert; Li, Yiming",J Am Dent Assoc,172,16

The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains undefined, and whether specific inflammatory biomarker patterns can distinguish MIS-C from other hyperinflammatory syndromes, including Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether inflammatory biomarkers could be used to distinguish between these conditions. Methods: We studied a prospective cohort of patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease and an established cohort of patients with new-onset systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and MAS associated with systemic JIA (JIA-MAS), diagnosed according to established guidelines. The study was done at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH, USA). Clinical and laboratory features as well as S100A8/A9, S100A12, interleukin (IL)-18, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), and IL-6 concentrations were assessed by ELISA and compared using parametric and non-parametric tests and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Findings: Between April 30, 2019, and Dec 14, 2020, we enrolled 19 patients with MIS-C (median age 9·0 years [IQR 4·5-15·0]; eight [42%] girls and 11 [58%] boys) and nine patients with Kawasaki disease (median age 2·0 years [2·0-4·0]); seven [78%] girls and two [22%] boys). Patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease had similar S100 proteins and IL-18 concentrations but patients with MIS-C were distinguished by significantly higher median concentrations of the IFNÎ³-induced CXCL9 (1730 pg/mL [IQR 604-6300] vs 278 pg/mL [54-477]; p=0·038). Stratifying patients with MIS-C by CXCL9 concentrations (high vs low) revealed differential severity of clinical and laboratory presentation. Compared with patients with MIS-C and low CXCL9 concentrations, more patients with high CXCL9 concentrations had acute kidney injury (six [60%] of ten vs none [0%] of five), altered mental status (four [40%] of ten vs none [0%] of five), shock (nine [90%] of ten vs two [40%] of five), and myocardial dysfunction (five [50%] of ten vs one [20%] of five); these patients also had higher concentrations of systemic inflammatory markers and increased severity of cytopenia and coagulopathy. By contrast, patients with MIS-C and low CXCL9 concentrations resembled patients with Kawasaki disease, including the frequency of coronary involvement. Elevated concentrations of S100A8/A9, S100A12, and IL-18 were also useful in distinguishing systemic JIA from Kawasaki disease with high sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation: Our findings show MIS-C is distinguishable from Kawasaki disease primarily by elevated CXCL9 concentrations. The stratification of patients with MIS-C by high or low CXCL9 concentrations provides support for MAS-like pathophysiology in patients with severe MIS-C, suggesting new approaches for diagnosis and management.

During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt, which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the Rt. METHODS: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of Rt. A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. RESULTS: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the Rt was rapidly decreasing. The maximal Rt displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing Rt. CONCLUSIONS: The aSIR model provides a simple and accurate computational tool for continuous Rt estimation and evaluation of the efficacy of mitigation measures.","Shapiro, Mark B; Karim, Fazle; Muscioni, Guido; Augustine, Abel Saju",J Med Internet Res,172,33

We describe the integration of small group anatomy and clinical skills sessions to accomplish this. Objective Albany Medical College switched to a completely virtual curriculum during March 2020. However, learning anatomy requires more than just lectures and small group conversations. Both clinical skills and anatomy courses require a hands-on curriculum. Although the lecture portion of these courses can be delivered virtually, the hands-on sessions contribute to the students? ability to see and experience three-dimensional integration. Materials 1). Lectures in both Anatomy and Clinical Skills, 2). 3-D Anatomy modules using the Toltec Virtual Human Dissector platform, 3). Anatomical prosections, 4). Virtual cases, using the SECTRA Table platform, and 5). Clinical Skills sessions with ultrasound demonstrations. Methods In the fall semester of 2020, the first-year class of 145 was randomly divided into 6 groups of about 24 students. During the musculoskeletal theme, there were 8 anatomy lab sessions and 4 clinical skills sessions. On days with corresponding clinical skills sessions, a group of 24 students came to the lab for a one-hour review of the anatomy on prosected specimens and Sectra Table cases. Several structures were tagged in each cadaver and students were provided with a key. This allowed for self-assessment and a chance to apply knowledge gained from lectures and 3-D anatomy directly to real anatomy. Faculty rotated to address questions and to quiz the students on the anatomy topics. Each group spent one hour in the anatomy lab and then immediately rotated to the clinical skills session. The emphasis in the clinical skills portion was the connection between musculoskeletal anatomy and function, along with physical exam maneuvers. Each session began with a demonstration highlighting an aspect of musculoskeletal ultrasound to correlate anatomy with 2-D imaging. Faculty rotated to address questions and provide demonstrations of maneuvers when indicated. Results There were no differences in exam scores when compared to previous classes for either anatomy or physical diagnosis topics. Conclusion Student feedback revealed the correlation of anatomy followed by clinical skills helped them better understand the anatomy and connection to the physical exam without the risks of exposure to large groups of students. Significance The new curriculum demonstrates that we can still teach the material and deliver the content in an effective manner despite the limitations of the COVID pandemic. Implication: The success of this model resulted in new and preferred structure of these classes.","Fahl, Jeffrey Khan Amanda Lowry Natalia Hogan Kathyrn Kerr Hamish Bowen Brady Smith Michael",The FASEB Journal,172,24

Therefore, one of the objectives of the health systems should implement safety practices to minimize the risk of contagion among these health professionals. Monitoring environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 may help to determine the potential of the environment as a transmission medium in an area highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2, such as an intensive care unit. The objective of the study was to analyze the environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces collected in an intensive care unit, which is dedicated exclusively to the care of patients with COVID-19 and equipped with negative pressure of - 10 Pa and an air change rate of 20 cycles per hour. Furthermore, all ICU workers were tested for COVID-19 by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA methods. RESULTS: A total of 102 samples (72 collected with pre-moistened swabs used for collection of nasopharyngeal exudates and 30 with moistened wipes used in the environmental microbiological control of the food industry) were obtained from ventilators, monitors, perfusion pumps, bed rails, lab benches, containers of personal protective equipment, computer keyboards and mice, telephones, workers' shoes, floor, and other areas of close contact with COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals who cared for them. The analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed no detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in environmental samples collected by any of the two methods described. Furthermore, none of the 237 ICU workers was infected by the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ICU surfaces could not be determined supporting that a strict cleaning protocol with sodium hypochlorite, a high air change rate, and a negative pressure in the ICU are effective in preventing environmental contamination. These facts together with the protection measures used could also explain the absence of contagion among staff inside ICUs.","Escudero, Dolores; Boga, José Antonio; Fernández, Javier; Forcelledo, Lorena; Balboa, Salvador; Albillos, Rodrigo; Astola, Iván; García-Prieto, Emilio; Álvarez-Argüelles, Marta Elena; Martín, Gabriel; Jiménez, Josu; Vázquez, Fernando",Intensive Care Med Exp,172,20

When the observations are independent, the analysis of such studies can be based on standard methods for multistate models. However, the independence assumption is often violated, such as in multicenter studies, which makes standard methods improper. This work addresses the issue of nonparametric estimation and two-sample testing for the population-averaged transition and state occupation probabilities under general multistate models with cluster-correlated, right-censored, and/or left-truncated observations. The proposed methods do not impose assumptions regarding the within-cluster dependence, allow for informative cluster size, and are applicable to both Markov and non-Markov processes. Using empirical process theory, the estimators are shown to be uniformly consistent and to converge weakly to tight Gaussian processes. Closed-form variance estimators are derived, rigorous methodology for the calculation of simultaneous confidence bands is proposed, and the asymptotic properties of the nonparametric tests are established. Furthermore, I provide theoretical arguments for the validity of the nonparametric cluster bootstrap, which can be readily implemented in practice regardless of how complex the underlying multistate model is. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed methods is good, and that methods that ignore the within-cluster dependence can lead to invalid inferences. Finally, the methods are illustrated using data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial.","Bakoyannis, Giorgos",Biometrics,172,20

The assembly of NSP7, NSP8 and NSP12 proteins is highly dynamic in solution, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We report the crystal structure of the complex between NSP7 and NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2, revealing a 2:2 heterotetrameric form. Formation of the NSP7-NSP8 complex is mediated by two distinct oligomer interfaces, with interface I responsible for heterodimeric NSP7-NSP8 assembly, and interface II mediating the heterotetrameric interaction between the two NSP7-NSP8 dimers. Structure-guided mutagenesis, combined with biochemical and enzymatic assays, further reveals a structural coupling between the two oligomer interfaces, as well as the importance of these interfaces for the RdRP activity of the NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complex. Finally, we identify an NSP7 mutation that differentially affects the stability of the NSP7-NSP8 and NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complexes leading to a selective impairment of the RdRP activity. Together, this study provides deep insights into the structure and mechanism for the dynamic assembly of NSP7 and NSP8 in regulating the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with important implications for antiviral drug development.","Biswal, Mahamaya; Diggs, Stephen; Xu, Duo; Khudaverdyan, Nelli; Lu, Jiuwei; Fang, Jian; Blaha, Gregor; Hai, Rong; Song, Jikui",Nucleic acids res,172,20

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease may differ, most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients may develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or mechanical ventilatory support. In this study, we aimed to identify validity of our modified scoring system for foreseeing the approach to the COVID-19 patient and the disease, the treatment plan, the severity of morbidity and even the risk of mortality from the clinician's point of view. In this single center study, we examined the patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between 01/04/2020 and 01/06/2020, of the 228 patients who were between 20 and 90 years of age, and whose polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests of nasal and pharyngeal swab samples were positive. We evaulated 228 (92 male and 136 female) PCR (+) patients. Univariate analysis showed that advanced age (p < 0.001), hemoglobin (p < 0.001), troponin-I (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p < 0.001), HT (p = 0.01), CAD (p = 0.001), DM (p < 0.001), history of malignancy (p = 0.008), along with m-sPESI scores (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients that needed intensive care due to COVID-19 infection. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only the m-sPESI score higher than &#8805; 2 was found to be highly significant in terms of indicating the need for ICU admission (AUC 0.948; 84.6% sensitivity and 94.6% specificity) (p < 0.001). With an increasing number of hospitalized patients, healthcare providers are confronting a deluge of lab results in the process of caring for COVID-19 patients. It is imperative to identify risk factors for mortality and morbidity development. The modified sPESI scoring system, which we put forward, is successful in predicting the course of the disease at the presentation of the patient with COVID-19 disease and predicting the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity, can detect the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity.","As, Ahmet Kagan; Erdolu, Burak; Duman, Burak; Yazgan, Elif; Eris, Cuneyt; Aydin, Ufuk; Ata, Yusuf; Sengoren Dikis, Ozlem; Türk, Tamer",J. thromb. thrombolysis,172,16

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with cardiometabolic disturbances, is a source of proinflammatory cytokines and a marker of visceral adiposity. We investigated the relation between EAT characteristics and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This post-hoc analysis of a large prospective investigation included all adult patients (&#8805;18 years) admitted to San Raffaele University Hospital in Milan, Italy, from February 25th to April 19th, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan for COVID-19 pneumonia and had anthropometric data available for analyses. EAT volume and attenuation (EAT-At, a marker of EAT inflammation) were measured on CT scan. Primary outcome was critical illness, defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), invasive ventilation or death. Cox regression and regression tree analyses were used to assess the relationship between clinical variables, EAT characteristics and critical illness. One-hundred and ninety-two patients were included (median [25th-75th percentile] age 60 years [53-70], 76% men). Co-morbidities included overweight/obesity (70%), arterial hypertension (40%), and diabetes (16%). At multivariable Cox regression analysis, EAT-At (HR 1.12 [1.04-1.21]) independently predicted critical illness, while increasing PaO2/FiO2 was protective (HR 0.996 [95% CI 0.993; 1.00]). CRP, plasma glucose on admission, EAT-At and PaO2/FiO2 identified five risk groups that significantly differed with respect to time to death or admission to ICU (log-rank p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Increased EAT attenuation, a marker of EAT inflammation, but not obesity or EAT volume, predicts critical COVID-19.

It has been established that many factors influence the immune system, including genetics, hormonal, and nutrition status. This study reviews the effect of the different dietary patterns and some selected micronutrients that most populations suffer from its deficiency, such as vitamin D, zinc, selenium, and iron, on the immune system. The aim was to focus on the impact of different diets and many nutrients on immunity which may protect or ameliorate COVID-19 patients. Mediterranean diet (Mid Diet) is characterized by excellent vegetables, fruits, seeds, seafood, and moderate meat. This dietary pattern is linked to a well-functioning immune system. Med Diet contains many antioxidants as vitamin C, beta-carotene, and polyphenols that exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Med Diet may be considered an effective and reasonably simple way to attenuate the intensity of COVID-19 infection. The vegetarian diet (Veg Diet), the plant-based diet, is also linked to healthy immune responses. It plays a criteria role in activating and strengthen both innate and adaptive immunity. It increases gutmucosa health and reduces autoimmunity related disorders. Contrariwise, the western diet (West Diet) is a popular pattern intake rich in carbohydrates, salt, saturated and trans lipid, while lacking in complex carbohydrates and fibers. This dietary pattern leads indirectly to increase inflammatory markers, obesity, and many diseases. Available evidence indicates that several micronutrients,including vitamin D, zinc, selenium, and iron, play an immune-supporting role, modulate the immune activity, and lower the possibility of infection.Optimizing vitamin D and zinc status definitely has advantages in COVID-19 patients.Evidence showed that various diet and different micronutrients play a role in the immune system and COVID-19 patients. © 2021 The Author(s).","Aljadani, H.",Current Research in Nutrition and Food Science,172,30

We present a case of placental severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in a woman with mild COVID-19 disease, then review the literature. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. A 29-year-old multigravida presented at 40-4/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias 2 days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate maternal vascular malperfusion, with no fetal vascular malperfusion, as well as SARS-CoV-2 virus in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and also rarely in trophoblasts.

Despite her mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction and other pregnancy complications) and possible vertical transmission-especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. This raises important questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing throughout pregnancy.","Hsu, Albert L; Guan, Minhui; Johannesen, Eric; Stephens, Amanda J; Khaleel, Nabila; Kagan, Nikki; Tuhlei, Breanna C; Wan, Xiu-Feng",J Med Virol,172,32

Among SARS-CoV-2-infections-associated neurological symptoms fatigue, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness and anosmia/ageusia are most frequent, but less frequent neurological deficits such as seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome or ataxia may also occur. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we present a case of a 62-year-old man who developed a subacute cerebellar syndrome with limb-, truncal- and gait ataxia and scanning speech 1 day after clinical resolution of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Apart from ataxia, there were no signs indicative of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome or Miller Fisher syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebellar atrophy. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cerebellum was excluded by normal cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and, most importantly, absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody production. Other causes of ataxia such as other viral infections, other autoimmune and/or paraneoplastic diseases or intoxication were ruled out. The neurological deficits improved rapidly after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory and clinical findings as well as the marked improvement after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy suggest a post-infectious, immune-mediated cause of ataxia. This report should make clinicians aware to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential cause of post-infectious neurological deficits with an atypical clinical presentation and to consider high-dose corticosteroid treatment in case that a post-infectious immune-mediated mechanism is assumed.","Werner, Jana; Reichen, Ina; Huber, Michael; Abela, Irene A; Weller, Michael; Jelcic, Ilijas",BMC Infect Dis,172,1

AlGaN‐based light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) may be considered as an alternative, but due to their inherent low efficiencies in the deep‐UV spectral region, significant developments are required to address efficiency issues. Here, a mercury‐free chip‐size deep‐UV light source is shown which is enabled by high‐vacuum chip‐scale cavity sealing overcoming the limitations of both mercury lamps and deep‐UV LEDs. These deep‐UV chips are cathodoluminescence based, in which a cavity is created with high vacuum integrity for efficient field‐emission. These chips demonstrate optical output power ≥20 mW (efficiency ≈4%) and, owing to the spectral overlap of phosphor cathodoluminescence spectra and germicidal effectiveness curve, resulted in log 6 (99.9999%) germicidal efficiency. Additionally, these chips offer high reliability, “instant” ON/OFF capability, high operational lifetimes, and low‐temperature dependence with complete design freedom.

New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies. HYPOTHESIS: A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID-19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including glutathione, vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and ""cytokine storm syndrome"" with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"" (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NF-&#954;B and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione with associated anti-viral effects should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID-19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with ivermectin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NF-&#954;B and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil. These three broad-based interventions urgently need to be subjected to randomized, controlled trials.","Horowitz, Richard I; Freeman, Phyllis R",Med Hypotheses,172,1

Corticosteroids (CS) are known to impair immune response. The objective was to evaluate the risk of developing post-procedural infection within 4 weeks of receiving depot CSI for chronic pain as part of on going quality improvement project. We hypothesised that interventional treatment with depot steroids will not cause a significant increase in clinical infection in the first 4 weeks. METHODS: Telephone follow-up was performed as a part of prospective longitudinal audit in a cohort of patients who received interventional treatment for chronic pain at a multidisciplinary pain medicine centre based at a university teaching hospital. Patients who received interventional treatment in the management of chronic pain under a single physician between October 2019 and December 2020 were followed up over telephone as part of on going longitudinal audits. Data was collected on any infection within 4 and 12 weeks of receiving the intervention. Outcomes collected included type of intervention, dose of depot steroids and pain relief obtained at 12 weeks following intervention. RESULTS: Over a 15 month period, 261 patients received pain interventions with depot CS. There was no loss to follow-up. Nine patients reported an infection within 4 weeks of receiving depot steroids (9/261, 3.4%). None of the patients tested positive for Covid-19. Eight patients (8/261, 3%) reported an infection between 5 and 12 weeks following the corticosteroid intervention. Although none of the patients tested positive for Covid-19, two patients presented with clinical and radiological features suggestive of Covid-19. Durable analgesia was reported by 51% (133/261) and clinically significant analgesia by 30% (78/261) at 12 weeks following the intervention. Failure rate was 19% (50/261).

To combat the spread of the virus and prevent an uncontrolled outbreak with limited resources, national lockdown protocols have taken effect in the Netherlands since March 13th, 2020. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, type and characteristics of HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year prior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches was performed from the start of Dutch nationwide lockdown orders from March 13th until May 13th, 2020 and the corresponding period one year prior. Dispatch-, operational-, patient-, injury-, and on-site treatment characteristics were extracted for analysis. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel and the time physicians were unable to take call was described. RESULTS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HEMS and HEMS-ambulance was requested in 528 cases. One year prior, a total of 620 requests were received. The HEMS (helicopter and ambulance) was cancelled after deployment in 56.4% of the COVID-19 cohort and 50.7% of the historical cohort (P = 0.05). Incident location type did not differ between the two cohorts, specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of injuries that occurred at home in pandemic versus non-pandemic circumstances. Besides a decrease in the number of falls, the distribution of mechanisms of injury remained similar during the COVID-19 study period. There was no difference in self-inflicted injuries observed. Prehospital interventions remained similar during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year prior. Specifically, prehospital intubation did not differ between the two cohorts. The rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel was 23.1%. Physicians who tested positive were unable to take call for a mean of 25 days (range 8-53). CONCLUSION: A decrease in the number of deployments and increase in the number of cancelled missions was observed during the COVID-19 study period. No major differences in operational- and injury characteristics were found for HEMS and HEMS-ambulance dispatches between the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and the same period one year prior. These findings highlight the importance of continued operability of the HEMS, even during pandemic circumstances.

Empirical studies leveraging such methods when randomization is unethical or impractical have grown in the health sciences in recent years. The adoption of so-called ""causal"" methods to account for both/either measured and/or unmeasured confounders is an important addition to the methodological toolkit for understanding the distribution, progression, and consequences of infectious diseases (IDs) and interventions on IDs. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and in the absence of systematic randomization of exposures or interventions, the value of these methods is even more apparent. Yet to our knowledge, no studies have assessed how causal methods involving pooling individual-level, observational, longitudinal data are being applied in ID-related research. In this systematic review, we assess how these methods are used and reported in ID-related research over the last 10 years. Findings will facilitate evaluation of trends of causal methods for ID research and lead to concrete recommendations for how to apply these methods where gaps in methodological rigor are identified. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will apply MeSH and text terms to identify relevant studies from EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, CINAHL, EconLit with Full Text, PsychINFO), EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. Eligible studies are those that apply causal methods to account for confounding when assessing the effects of an intervention or exposure on an ID-related outcome using pooled, individual-level data from 2 or more longitudinal, observational studies.

We designed and administered a global survey to examine the effects of COVID-19 on vascular surgeons and explore the COVID-19-related stressors faced, coping strategies used, and support structures available. METHODS: The Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons was an anonymous cross-sectional survey sponsored by the Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force. The survey analysis evaluated the effects of COVID-19-related stressors on vascular surgeons measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. The 28-item Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory was used to assess the active and avoidant coping strategies. Survey data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) from April 14, 2020 to April 24, 2020 inclusive. Additional qualitative data were collected using open-ended questions. Univariable and multivariable analyses of the factors associated with the anxiety levels and qualitative analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1609 survey responses (70.5% male; 82.5% vascular surgeons in practice) from 58 countries (43.4% from United States; 43.4% from Brazil) were eligible for analysis. Some degree of anxiety was reported by 54.5% of the respondents, and 23.3% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Most respondents (â¼60%) reported using active coping strategies and the avoidant coping strategy of ""self-distraction,"" and 20% used other avoidant coping strategies. Multivariable analysis identified the following factors as significantly associated with increased self-reported anxiety levels: staying in a separate room at home or staying at the hospital or a hotel after work (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.79), donning and doffing personal protective equipment (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.41-2.33), worry about potential adverse patient outcomes due to care delay (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16-1.87), and financial concerns (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.49-2.42). The factors significantly associated with decreased self-reported anxiety levels were hospital support (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.91) and the use of positive reframing as an active coping strategy (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgeons globally have been experiencing multiple COVID-19-related stressors during this devastating crisis. These findings have highlighted the continued need for hospital systems to support their vascular surgeons and the importance of national societies to continue to invest in peer-support programs as paramount to promoting the well-being of vascular surgeons during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shalhub, Sherene; Mouawad, Nicolas J; Malgor, Rafael D; Johnson, Adam P; Wohlauer, Max V; Coogan, Sheila M; Loveland, Katherine A; Cuff, Robert F; Leonardi, Claudia; Coleman, Dawn M; Sheahan, Malachi G; Woo, Karen",J. vasc. surg,172,11

The study population was a sequential cohort of 86 critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Data characterizing the sedative medications, doses, drug combinations, and duration of administration were collected daily and compared to published recommendations for sedation of critically ill patients without COVID-19. The associations between drug doses, number of drugs administered, baseline patient characteristics, and inflammatory markers were investigated. RESULTS: Among the study cohort, propofol and hydromorphone were the most common initial drug combination, with these medications being used on a given day in up to 100% and 88% of patients, respectively. The doses of sedative and analgesic infusions increased for patients over the first 10 days, reaching or exceeding the upper limits of published dosage guidelines for propofol (48% of patients), dexmedetomidine (29%), midazolam (7.7%), ketamine (32%), and hydromorphone (38%). The number of sedative and analgesic agents simultaneously administered increased over time for each patient, with more than 50% of patients requiring 3 or more agents by day 2. Compared with patients requiring 3 or fewer agents, as a group patients requiring more than 3 agents were of younger age, had an increased body mass index, increased serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, had a lower PaO2:FIO2 (ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen), and were more likely to receive neuromuscular blockade. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the clinical impression of elevated sedative use in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 relative to guideline-recommended sedation practices in other critically ill populations.","Balakrishna, Aditi; Walsh, Elisa C; Hamidi, Arzo; Berg, Sheri; Austin, Daniel; Pino, Richard M; Hanidziar, Dusan; Chang, Marvin G; Bittner, Edward A",Am. j. health system pharm,172,16

Here, we aimed to elucidate the effect of DMTs on the humoral immune response to mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in MS patients. MethodsWe obtained sera from 912 Sardinian MS patients and 63 healthy controls 30 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and tested them for SARS-CoV-2 response using anti-Spike (S) protein-based serology. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by anti-Nucleocapsid (N) serology. Patients were either untreated or undergoing treatment with a total of 13 different DMTs. Differences between treatment groups comprised of at least 10 patients were assessed by generalized linear mixed-effects model. Demographic and clinical data and smoking status were analyzed as additional factors potentially influencing humoral immunity from COVID-19 vaccine. ResultsMS patients treated with natalizumab, teriflunomide, azathioprine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab, and rituximab showed significantly lower humoral responses compared to untreated patients. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in response between patients treated with the other drugs (dimethyl fumarate, interferon, alemtuzumab and glatiramer acetate) and untreated patients. In addition, older age, male, sex and active smoking were significantly associated with lower antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. MS patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher humoral responses to vaccine than uninfected patients. ConclusionHumoral response to BNT162b2 is significantly influenced by the specific DMTs followed by patients, as well as by other factors such as previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, sex, and smoking status. These results are important to inform targeted strategies to prevent clinically relevant COVID-19 in MS patients.","Pitzalis, Maristella; Idda, Maria Laura; Lodde, Valeria; Loizedda, Annalisa; Lobina, Monia; Zoledzwieska, Magdalena; Virdis, Francesca; Delogu, Giuseppe; Pirinu, Federica; Marini, Maria Giuseppina; Mingoia, Maura; Frau, Jessica; Lorefice, Lorena; Fronza, Maria; Carmagini, Daniele; Carta, Elisa; Orrù, Valeria; Uzzau, Sergio; Solla, Paolo; Loi, Federica; Devoto, Marcella; Steri, Maristella; Fiorillo, Edoardo; Floris, Matteo; Zarbo, Ignazio Roberto; Cocco, Eleonora; Cucca, Francesco",,172,30

As part of this process, Waymo is committed to providing the public with informative and relevant data regarding the demonstrated safety of Waymo's automated driving system, which we call the Waymo Driver. The data presented in this paper represents more than 6.1 million miles of automated driving in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, including operations with a trained operator behind the steering wheel from calendar year 2019 and 65,000 miles of driverless operation without a human behind the steering wheel from 2019 and the first nine months of 2020. The paper includes every collision and minor contact experienced during these operations as well as every predicted contact identified using Waymo's counterfactual, what if, simulation of events had the vehicle's trained operator not disengaged automated driving. There were 47 contact events that occurred over this time period, consisting of 18 actual and 29 simulated contact events, none of which would be expected to result in severe or life threatening injuries. This paper presents the collision typology and severity for each actual and simulated event, along with diagrams depicting each of the most significant events. Nearly all the events involved one or more road rule violations or other errors by a human driver or road user, including all eight of the most severe events, which we define as involving actual or expected airbag deployment in any involved vehicle. When compared to national collision statistics, the Waymo Driver completely avoided certain collision modes that human driven vehicles are frequently involved in, including road departure and collisions with fixed objects.","Schwall, Matthew; Daniel, Tom; Victor, Trent; Favaro, Francesca; Hohnhold, Henning",,172,3

Six replicated experiments were conducted between 2010 and 2016 with field-grown basil of a susceptible cultivar exposed to naturally occurring wind-dispersed sporangiospores of P. belbahrii to evaluate conventional fungicides registered for basil downy mildew in the United States and in development for this use. This project revealed the importance for successful management of using a preventive fungicide application schedule, maintaining a 7-day application interval, and using application equipment designed to provide thorough spray coverage to plants (drop nozzles). Fungicide efficacy was assessed based on incidence of symptomatic leaves rather than disease severity, which is stringent but realistic because there is zero tolerance for disease on fresh-market herbs. Most fungicides were tested as the formulated product marketed in the United States. Oxathiapiprolin was tested as experimental formulations. Its trade name is Orondis. Overall best control was achieved in 2016. Excellent control (99% based on AUDPC values) was obtained with four fungicide programs with oxathiapiprolin, Revus, and ProPhyt, indicating this combination of chemistry was more important than specific timing for each fungicide. Ranman applied in alternation with Revus plus K-Phite was not quite as effective (89% control); this treatment was ineffective in 2015 when the 7-day spray interval was not maintained. Best treatment in 2015 was Quadris applied in alternation with Revus plus oxathiapiprolin for two of three Revus applications. Two different alternations of these fungicides also were effective. But Quadris alternated with Revus was ineffective. When tested singly, the most effective fungicides in 2013 (listed in order based on AUDPC values) were Zampro, Revus, oxathiapiprolin, and Ranman. ProPhyt was effective in 2013 but not in 2012, when another phosphorous acid fungicide, K-Phite, also was ineffective. Only oxathiapiprolin and Zampro were effective in the 2012 experiment; Revus and Ranman were ineffective. Presidio was ineffective both years. Based on the results from this study, Orondis is the most effective fungicide among those evaluated for managing basil downy mildew, and Zampro is second. Neither were labeled for this use on field-grown basil as of June 2020. Ranman applied in alternation with Revus plus K-Phite, a commonly recommended program of labeled fungicides, provided very good control.","McGrath, Margaret Tuttle",Plant Dis,172,10

A cross-sectional cohort study,16.238718,10.40401,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We are currently in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Research into previous infectious disease outbreaks has shown that healthcare workers are at increased risk for burnout during these dire times, with those on the front lines at greatest risk. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the wellness of emergency physicians (EP). METHODS: A survey was sent to 137 EPs in a multi-hospital network in eastern Pennsylvania. We compared 10 primary and two supplemental questions based on how the physicians had been feeling in the prior 2-3 weeks (COVID-19 period) to the same questions based on how they were feeling in the prior 4-6 months (pre-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: We received 55 responses to the survey (40.1% response rate). The study found that during the pandemic, EPs felt less in control (p-value = 0.001); felt decreased happiness while at work (p-value 0.001); had more trouble falling asleep (p-value = 0.001); had an increased sense of dread when thinking of work needing to be done (p-value = 0.04); felt more stress on days not at work (p-value <0.0001); and were more concerned about their own health (p-value <0.0001) and the health of their families and loved ones (p-value <0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant decrease in EP wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the pre-pandemic period. We need to be aware of evidence-based recommendations to help mitigate the risks and prevent physician burnout.","Fitzpatrick, Kevin; Patterson, Rachel; Morley, Krista; Stoltzfus, Jill; Stankewicz, Holly",West J Emerg Med,172,17

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all adult patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to a quaternary care hospital in Pakistan from March 1 to April 15, 2020. The extracted variables included demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory tests and radiological findings during admission. Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Results: Sixty-six COVID-19 patients were hospitalized during the study period. Sixty-one percent were male and 39% female; mean age was 50.6±19.1 years. Fever and cough were the most common presenting symptoms. Serial chest X-rays showed bilateral pulmonary opacities in 33 (50%) patients. The overall mortality was 14% and mean length of stay was 8.4±8.9 days. Ten patients (15%) required intensive care unit (ICU) care during admission, of which six (9%) were intubated. Age &#8805;60 years, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, ICU admission, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio &#8805;3.3, and INR &#8805;1.2 were associated with increased risk of mortality. Conclusion: We found a mortality rate of 14% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 cases are still increasing exponentially around the world and may overwhelm healthcare systems in many countries soon. Our findings can be used for early identification of patients who may require intensive care and aggressive management in order to improve outcomes.","Ayaz, Ahmed; Arshad, Ainan; Malik, Hajra; Ali, Haris; Hussain, Erfan; Jamil, Bushra",,172,1

Prior research suggests starting a new job is an uncertain experience; we theorize that the COVID-19 pandemic creates additional environmental stressors that affect new hire engagement. First, we hypothesize that the occurrence of COVID-19 and unemployment rates relate negatively to engagement. Second, we theorize that the effects of the pandemic become more disruptive on new hire engagement as they gain tenure within the organization. Third, drawing from strategic management theory, we test whether States that introduce stronger COVID-19 policies help enhance the engagement of new hires. Examining a U.S. national sample of 12,577 newly hired (90 days or less) quick service restaurant employees across 9 months (January-September, 2020), we find support for these hypotheses. Subsequent model comparisons suggest there may be health stressors that shape engagement more strongly than purely economic stressors. These findings may be important because they highlight the experiences of workers more likely to be exposed to the pandemic and affected by COVID-related policies. Should the results generalize to other samples and jobs, this study offers potentially new research directions for understanding relationships between macro stressors and new hire perceptions and socialization. It also offers practical implications by helping organizations understand the importance of explicitly managing job insecurity, particularly in terms of COVID-19 policy.

One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID19 is essentially unknow. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. It includes why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell, and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in the innate immune defense. Here we propose a striking yet plausible amplification mechanism in the immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our calculated results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100000 folds, resembling the cyclic O3-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens (COVID19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.","Lu, Qing-Bin",,172,16

Due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and the national emergency state, virtual visits were implemented as an alternative to in-person visits. With this study we aimed to establish asthma patients' general satisfaction with the quality of health care provided by virtual visits (phone or video calls). Materials and methods. A questionnaire (9 questions) was published on the Facebook page of the Portuguese Association of Asthmatics. It was available online for general self-reported asthmatic patients to answer for one month, starting on 11st May 2020. The survey only allowed one answer per registered user. Results. Fifty-five responses were obtained. Patients were satisfied with communication with providers (greater than 88%); nevertheless, one-half evaluated the virtual visit as inferior when compared to in-person visits. About one third attributed a classification of 6 or less (0-10 scale, 0 being the worst and 10 the best consultation possible), but still most of the patients would either recommend it or use this kind of medical visits in the future, even outside the actual pandemic context. Patients also referred some important limitations, as lack of physical examination and the fact that the medical visit was more impersonal. Only 27% had technical issues accessing virtual visits. Positive aspects were also named, such as virtual visits being practical and avoiding the need to move to the hospital. Discussion and conclusions. Our survey revealed that small changes could further increase patients' satisfaction, adherence, and confidence in telemedicine. Although presenting some limitations, virtual visits seem to be generally well accepted by asthmatic patients and it might be a good alternative for in-person visits, at least in such difficult times when social distancing is recommended.","Sabina Sousa, C; Trigueiro Barbosa, M; Aguiar, R; Benito-Garcia, F; Morais-Almeida, M",Eur. ann. allergy clin. immunol,172,21

Extension has not only been an audience for Agricultural Safety and Health Center work, but also an essential partner in promoting evidence-based farm health and safety in communities. This commentary stems from a collaborative effort among Center leaders across the nation who developed a set of surveys to explore the ways COVID-19 has affected Extension professionals. Preliminary data gathered from across the nation suggest that while many Extension professionals feel prepared to address challenges from the pandemic and are well supported by their State and Center's resources, over half also reported moderate to great difficulty in balancing personal and professional needs and, to a lesser extent, balancing remote work and family needs. Because Extension professionals act as connectors between Agricultural Safety and Health Centers and farmers and their families, they serve in a role similar to first-responders. COVID-19 has exacerbated the potential for anxiety, stress, and other mental health concerns among this group.

(3) The proportion of patients with comorbidities increased with age. (4) Seventy-one per cent of the patients had positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results and 29% had positive chest CT scans before admission to the hospital. (5) Lesions in all lobes of the lung were observed as the main chest CT findings (76%). (6) Decrease in lymphocytes and increase in monocytes were common in the patients over 40 years old but rare in the youth. Eosinophils (50%), red blood cells (39%) and haemoglobin (40%) decreased in all age groups. (7) The proportion of patients with CRP and PCT elevation increased with age. (8) Thirty-nine per cent of the patients had elevated IgE, with the highest proportion in the old (49%). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics and imaging/laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients vary in different age groups. Personalised criteria should be formulated according to different age groups in the early screening and diagnosis stage.","Liu, Xuemei; Lv, Jie; Gan, Lin; Zhang, Ying; Sun, Feng; Meng, Bo; Jheon, Andrew; Yan, Fang; Li, Bin; Xuan, Zhou; Ma, Xiumin; Wulasihana, Muhuyati",Indian J Med Microbiol,172,24

The current study examined whether daily practice of brief mindfulness training has a beneficial impact on affective well-being, and mitigates the negative impact of exposure to COVID-19 news during the pandemic. Participants were randomly assigned into a mindfulness training (MT) group or a waitlist control (WC) group. Participants in the MT group practiced guided mindfulness meditation for a minimum of 10 min each day for 10 days. Both groups completed questionnaires assessing well-being at baseline and after the 10-day period. We also included four ecological momentary assessments (EMA) interspersed throughout the day to measure fine-grained affective states and recent exposure to COVID-19-related news, which has been linked to negative affect. We observed an increase in positive affect in the MT group compared to the WC group in the post-training assessment. However, no group differences emerged in the other three post-training affective measures of negative affect, anxiety and depression. EMA revealed that the MT group also showed more positive affective valence than the WC group across the 10 days. Notably, the WC group reported more negative affective valence following COVID-19 news exposure, whereas the MT group was not impacted. Taken together, our study indicates brief sessions of guided mindfulness meditation during COVID-19 may boost positive affect and serve as a protective buffer against the negative impact of exposure to COVID-19-related news on affective well-being. These findings highlight the utility of mindfulness meditation as an accessible and cost-effective technique to elevate positive affect amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kam, Julia W Y; Javed, Javeria; Hart, Chelsie M; Andrews-Hanna, Jessica R; Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne M; Mills, Caitlin",Psychol. res,172,16

Antiviral treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) could be an alternative treatment option. In this case report, we present two kidney transplant recipients and two hemodialysis patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received CP. Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined sequentially by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay and specific cellular responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot. Before treatment, in both kidney transplant recipients and one hemodialysis patient antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers (&#8804;1:40). ELISpot responses in the four patients were either weak or absent. After CP treatment, we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific cellular responses. After intermittent clinical improvement, one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms on Day 12 after treatment and received a second cycle of CP treatment. Altogether, three patients clinically improved and could be discharged from the hospital. However, one 83-year-old multimorbid patient deceased. Our data suggest that the success of CP therapy may only be temporary in patients with chronic kidney disease; which requires close monitoring of viral load and antiviral immunity and possibly an adaptation of the treatment regimen.","Lindemann, Monika; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Dolff, Sebastian; Konik, Margarethe; Rohn, Hana; Platte, Maximillian; Thümmler, Laura; Schwarzkopf, Sina; Schipper, Leonie; Bormann, Maren; van de Sand, Lukas; Breyer, Marianne; Klump, Hannes; Knop, Dietmar; Lenz, Veronika; Temme, Christian; Dittmer, Ulf; Horn, Peter A; Witzke, Oliver",J Med Virol,172,10

This study aimed to analyze cases of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients with RVO (Valdecilla cohort). Patients and methods: Between December 2008 and December 2020, 429 patients with RVO were attended to in our clinic. Ten patients had COVID-19, one of which did not have VRF or thrombophilia. The remaining nine patients had RVO prior to the infection and VRF, six had carotid atherosclerosis, and four had antiphospholipid syndrome. The infection did not cause thrombotic phenomena in any of them. Conclusions: RVO is a rare manifestation of COVID-19. In our cohort of patients with RVO, COVID-19 disease did not lead to thrombotic events.","García Palacios, J D; Puente Ruiz, N; Napal Lecumberri, J J; Hernández Hernández, J L",Rev. clin. esp.

Anti-CHOL/COVID-19 medicines are inexistent. Vitamin A (VA) refers to a potent nutrient with anti-cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory actions. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential functions and molecular mechanisms of VA as a potential treatment for patients with both CHOL and COVID-19 (CHOL/COVID-19). The transcriptome data of CHOL patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Analysis database. Furthermore, the network pharmacology approach and bioinformatics analysis were used to identify and reveal the molecular functions, therapeutic biotargets, and signaling of VA against CHOL/COVID-19. First, clinical findings identified the medical characteristics of CHOL patients with COVID-19, such as susceptibility gene, prognosis, recurrence, and survival rate. Anti-viral and anti-inflammatory pathways, and immunopotentiation were found as potential targets of VA against CHOL/COVID-19. These findings illustrated that VA may contribute to the clinical management of CHOL/COVID-19 achieved by induction of cell repair, suppression of oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction, and amelioration of immunity. Nine vital therapeutic targets (BRD2, NOS2, GPT, MAPK1, CXCR3, ICAM1, CDK4, CAT, and TMPRSS13) of VA against CHOL/COVID-19 were identified. For the first time, the potential pharmacological biotargets, function, and mechanism of action of VA in CHOL/COVID-19 were elucidated.","Liang, Xiao; Zhou, Rui; Li, Yu; Yang, Lu; Su, Min; Lai, Keng Po",Aging (Albany NY),172,16

In this review, we present the uptake of preprint server use in nephrology and discuss specific considerations regarding preprint server use in medicine. Distribution of kidney-related research on preprint servers is rising at an exponential rate. Survey of nephrology journals identified that 15 of 17 (88%) are publishing original research accepted submissions that have been uploaded to preprint servers. After reviewing 52 clinically impactful trials in nephrology discussed in the online Nephrology Journal Club (NephJC), an average lag of 300 days was found between study completion and publication, indicating an opportunity for faster research dissemination. Rapid review of papers discussing benefits and risks of preprint server use from the researcher, publisher, or end user perspective identified 53 papers that met criteria. Potential benefits of biomedical preprint servers included rapid dissemination, improved transparency of the peer review process, greater visibility and recognition, and collaboration. However, these benefits come at the risk of rapid spread of results not yet subjected to the rigors of peer review. Preprint servers shift the burden of critical appraisal to the reader. Media may be especially at risk due to their focus on ""late-breaking"" information. Preprint servers have played an even larger role when late-breaking research results are of special interest, such as during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 has brought both the benefits and risks of preprint servers to the forefront. Given the prominent online presence of the nephrology community, it is poised to lead the medicine community in appropriate use of preprint servers.","Vlasschaert, Caitlyn; Giles, Cameron; Hiremath, Swapnil; Lanktree, Matthew B",,172,16

This suggests that a key contributory factor could be immunosenescence that is both age-related and lifestyle-induced. As the immune system itself is heavily reliant on mitochondrial function, then maintaining a healthy mitochondrial system may play a key role in resisting the virus, both directly, and indirectly by ensuring a good vaccine response. Furthermore, as viruses in general, and quite possibly this new virus, have also evolved to modulate immunometabolism and thus mitochondrial function to ensure their replication, this could further stress cellular bioenergetics. Unlike most sedentary modern humans, one of the natural hosts for the virus, the bat, has to ""exercise"" regularly to find food, which continually provides a powerful adaptive stimulus to maintain functional muscle and mitochondria. In effect the bat is exposed to regular hormetic stimuli, which could provide clues on how to resist this virus. In this paper we review the data that might support the idea that mitochondrial health, induced by a healthy lifestyle, could be a key factor in resisting the virus, and for those people who are perhaps not in optimal health, treatments that could support mitochondrial function might be pivotal to their long-term recovery.","Nunn, Alistair V W; Guy, Geoffrey W; Brysch, Wolfgang; Botchway, Stanley W; Frasch, Wayne; Calabrese, Edward J; Bell, Jimmy D",Immun Ageing,172,20

We estimated the effect of health behaviors against air pollution on reducing the risk of COVID-19 during the initial phase of the pandemic. The attack rates of COVID-19 in 159 mainland Chinese cities during the first 2 weeks after the closure of major cities was estimated; air pollution level as a surrogate indicator of the mask-wearing rate. Data on air pollution levels and meteorologic factors 2 weeks prior to the closure were obtained. The attack rate was compared with the level of air pollution using a generalized linear model after adjusting for confounders. When fine particulates (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels increased by one unit of air quality index (AQI), the infection risk decreased by 0.7% and 3.4%, respectively. When PM2.5 levels exceeded 150 (level 4), the infection risk decreased (relative risk, RR = 0.635, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.442 to 0.912 for level 4; RR = 0.529, 95% CI: 0.337 to 0.830 for level 5; respectively). After controlling for the number of high-speed railway routes, when PM2.5 and NO2 levels increased by one AQI, relative risk for PM2.5 and NO2 was 0.990 (95% CI, 0.984 to 0.997) and 0.946 (95% CI, 0.911 to 0.982), respectively, demonstrating a consistently negative association. It is postulated that, during the early phase of the pandemic, the cities with higher air pollution levels may represent the higher practice of mask-wearing to protect from air pollution, which could have acted as a barrier to the transmission of the virus. This study highlights the importance of health behaviors, including mask-wearing for preventing infections.","Yoon, Miryoung; Kim, Jong-Hun; Sung, Jisun; Lim, Ah-Young; Hwang, Myung-Jae; Kim, Eun-Hye; Cheong, Hae-Kwan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),172,2

A Canadian Society of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force was convened with multi-specialty involvement from otolaryngology-head & neck surgery, general surgery, critical care and anesthesiology to develop a set of recommendations for the performance of tracheotomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients. Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure. CONCLUSION: The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible.

Furthermore, in the wake of the recent new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, the momentum for rural migration is increasing, to prevent the risk of infection with the help of penetration of remote work. However, there is not enough debate about what kind of land will attract the population. Therefore, in this paper, we will consider this problem by performing correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis with the inflow rate and the excess inflow rate of the population as the dependent variables, using recent government statistics for each prefecture. As a result of the analysis, in addition to economic factor variables, variables of climatic, amenity, and human factors correlated with the inflow rate, and it was shown that the model has the greatest explanatory power when multiple factors were used in addition to specific factors. Therefore, local prefectures are required to take regional promotion measures focusing on not only economic factors but also multifaceted factors to attract the outside population.","Kokubun, Keisuke",,172,14

While molecular and rapid antigen tests are targeted for early diagnosis, immunoassays have a larger role in epidemiological studies, understanding longitudinal immunity, and in vaccine development and response. METHODS: The performance of the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay was evaluated against the Beckman ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in New Mexico, and against the Siemens ADVIA Centaur COV2G assay in New York. Discordant samples were parsed using a microneutralization assay. RESULTS: A SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate of 23.8% was observed in the samples tested in New York (September 2020), while in the same month the positivity rate was 1.5% in New Mexico. Positive and negative agreement were 67.6% (95% CI 49.5-82.6%) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.5-99.9%), respectively, with the Beckman test, and 98.0% (95% CI 95.7-99.3%) and 94.8% (95% CI 93.4-96.0%), respectively, with the Siemens test. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies discloses an AUC, area under the curve, of 0.996 (95% CI 0.992-0.999) for the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay. The criterion associated to the Youden Index was determined to be >12.9 kAU/L with a sensitivity of 99.44% and a specificity of 99.82%. CONCLUSIONS: The LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay is highly sensitive and specific. The balance of these parameters, without emphasis on high specificity alone, is particularly important when applied to high prevalence populations, where a highly sensitive assay will result in reporting a lower number of false negative subjects.","Bonelli, Fabrizio; Blocki, Frank A; Bunnell, Tina; Chu, Edward; De La O, Arriel; Grenache, David G; Marzucchi, Ginevra; Montomoli, Emanuele; Okoye, Lilian; Pallavicini, Luca; Streva, Vincent A; Torelli, Alessandro; Wagner, Aaron; Zanin, Davide; Zierold, Claudia; Wassenberg, James J",Clin Chem Lab Med,172,12

One of the ER structures observed in plants is known as 'organised smooth endoplasmic reticulum' (OSER), consisting of symmetrically stacked ER membrane arrays. In plants, these structures were first described in certain specialised tissues, e.g. the sieve elements of the phloem, and more recently in transgenic plants overexpressing ER membrane resident proteins. To date, much of the investigation of OSER focused on yeast and animal cells but research into plant OSER has started to grow. In this update, we give a succinct overview of research into the OSER phenomenon in plant cells with case studies highlighting both native and synthetic occurrences of OSER. We also assess the primary driving forces that trigger the formation of OSER, collating evidence from the literature to compare two competing theories for the origin of OSER: that OSER formation is initiated by oligomerizing protein accumulation in the ER membrane or that OSER is the result of ER membrane proliferation. This has long been a source of controversy in the field and here we suggest a way to integrate arguments from both sides into a single unifying theory. Finally, we discuss the potential biotechnological uses of OSER as a tool for the nascent plant synthetic biology field with possible applications as a synthetic microdomain for metabolic engineering and as an extensive membrane surface for synthetic chemistry or protein accumulation.","Sandor, Andras; Fricker, Mark David; Kriechbaumer, Verena; Sweetlove, Lee J",Plant physiol,172,1

The COVID-19 pandemic, which reached Rwanda in March 2020, presented new and unique challenges for infectious disease control. The objective of this paper is to characterize Rwanda's domestic response to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight effective strategies so that other countries, including high and middle-income countries, can learn from its innovative initiatives. Methods: Government publications describing Rwanda's healthcare capacity were first consulted to obtain the country's baseline context. Next, official government and healthcare system communications, including case counts, prevention and screening protocols, treatment facility practices, and behavioral guidelines for the public, were read thoroughly to understand the course of the pandemic in Rwanda and the specific measures in the response. Results: As of 31 December 2020, Rwanda has recorded 8,383 cumulative COVID-19 cases, 6,542 recoveries, and 92 deaths since the first case on 14 March 2020. The Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Centre, and the Epidemic and Surveillance Response division have collaborated on preparative measures since the pandemic began in January 2020. The formation of a Joint Task Force in early March led to the Coronavirus National Preparedness and Response Plan, an extensive six-month plan that established a national incident management system and detailed four phases of a comprehensive national response. Notable strategies have included disseminating public information through drones, robots for screening and inpatient care, and official communications through social media platforms to combat misinformation and mobilize a cohesive response from the population. Conclusion: Rwanda's government and healthcare system has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with innovative interventions to prevent and contain the virus. Importantly, the response has utilized adaptive and innovative technology and robust risk communication and community engagement to deliver an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Karim, Naz; Jing, Ling; Lee, J Austin; Kharel, Ramu; Lubetkin, Derek; Clancy, Camille M; Uwamahoro, Doris; Nahayo, Ernest; Biramahire, Joseph; Aluisio, Adam R; Ndebwanimana, Vincent",Ann Glob Health,172,16

We now show the developmental protein expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry throughout gestation, from first through third trimester. We found TMPRSS2 expression was rarely detectable in villous endothelium and very rarely detectable in the ST across gestation. We found ACE2 expression varied during gestation with circumferential ST expression more common in early gestations and polarized expression more common in later gestation.

AIM: Considering the fact that the reported data in different articles for the type and prevalence of skin manifestations related to the COVID-19 pandemic are inconsistent, we have described the mechanism and type of skin lesions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this review article, we have searched the Medline database (PubMed) for the combination of the following key terms ""Dermatological Manifestation"", ""cutaneous Manifestation"", ""Skin Manifestation"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"". RESULTS: The prevalence of skin manifestations related to COVID-19 ranged from 0.2% to 20%. The majority of these skin lesions are maculopapular eruptions. The skin presentations related to the COVID-19 pandemic are described below. Traumatic skin conditions such as dermatitis in individuals, especially those with allergies, might initiate secondary to over-washing or rinsing with inappropriate detergents. Also, inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (mask-gloves-shield) can trigger skin lesions on the face and hands or aggravate the lesions of acne, seborrhoeic dermatitis, eczema, etc. Furthermore, cutaneous adverse drug reactions may occur during hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients. Also, psychocutaneous disorders due to acute stress can trigger or deteriorate several skin manifestations. Moreover, COVID-19 prevalence and course may be changed in patients with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory underlying skin disorders such as psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, scleroderma who are on immunosuppressive or biological medications to control their disorders. CONCLUSION: Due to the various dimensions of skin organ involvement and the large population affected, long-term skin conditions following this pandemic can be a lot more problematic than it appears. Serious preventive measures and medical supports are necessary to avoid skin disorders from becoming permanent or even chronic.","Molaee, Hamideh; Allahyari, Fakhri; Emadi, Seyed Naser; Radfar, Shokofeh; Razavi, Zahra",Cutan Ocul Toxicol,172,21

There is a pressing need to improve our understanding of the immunology of this disease to contain the pandemic by developing vaccines and medicines for the prevention and treatment of patients. In this review, we aim to improve our understanding on the immune response and immunopathological changes in patients linked to deteriorating clinical conditions such as cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, autopsy findings and changes in acute-phase reactants, and serum biochemistry in COVID-19. Similar to many other viral infections, asymptomatic disease is present in a significant but currently unknown fraction of the affected individuals. In the majority of the patients, a 1-week, self-limiting viral respiratory disease typically occurs, which ends with the development of neutralizing antiviral T cell and antibody immunity. The IgM-, IgA-, and IgG-type virus-specific antibodies levels are important measurements to predict population immunity against this disease and whether cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is taking place. High viral load during the first infection and repeated exposure to virus especially in healthcare workers can be an important factor for severity of disease. It should be noted that many aspects of severe patients are unique to COVID-19 and are rarely observed in other respiratory viral infections, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia and lung tissue damage, a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Lymphopenia causes a defect in antiviral and immune regulatory immunity. At the same time, a cytokine storm starts with extensive activation of cytokine-secreting cells with innate and adaptive immune mechanisms both of which contribute to a poor prognosis. Elevated levels of acute-phase reactants and lymphopenia are early predictors of high disease severity.

Thus, patients awaiting a SOT or HSCT face the dilemma of choosing between a life-saving treatment that presents a significant threat of COVID-19 and the risk of waitlist dropout, progression of disease, or mortality. The lack of established literature on COVID-19 complicates the issue as patients, particularly those with inadequate health literacy, may not have the resources needed to navigate these decisions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a standardized phone survey of patients awaiting SOT or HSCT to assess the prevalence of inadequate health literacy and attitudes toward transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Seventy-one patients completed the survey, with a response rate of 84.5%. Regardless of health literacy, most waitlisted candidates recognized that the current pandemic is a serious situation affecting their care and that COVID-19 poses a significant risk to their health. Despite the increased risks, most patients reported they would choose immediate transplantation if there was no foreseeable end to the pandemic, and especially if the medical urgency did not permit further delay. There were no differences in responses across the patient waitlist groups for heart, kidney, liver, and stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS These findings can help transplant centers decide how transplantation services should proceed during this pandemic and can be used to educate patients and guide discussions about informed consent for transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Ek Khoon; Koh, Ye Xin; Kee, Terence; Juhari, Juhainah Binte; Tan, Teing Ee; Sim, David Kheng Leng; Ho, Aloysius Yew Leng; Krishnan, Lalitha; Tee, Ping Sing; Krishnamoorthy, Thinesh Lee; Goh, Brian Kim Poh; Tan, Ban Hock; Chung, Shimin Jasmine; Phua, Ghee Chee; Jeyaraj, Prema Raj",Ann Transplant,172,29

As older adults with serious illness increasingly rely on the support of others, there is a need to foster effective integration of the social convoy in digitally supported palliative care. OBJECTIVES: Conduct a qualitative study examining patient, social convoy, and health care provider perspectives on digital health for palliative care to inform the design of future digital solutions for older adults with serious illness and their social convoy. METHODS: Grounded theory approach using semi-structured interviews (N = 81) with interprofessional health care providers, older adults with serious illness, and their social convoy participants at home, clinic, or Zoom. Interviews were conducted using question guides relevant to the participant group and audio-recorded for verbatim transcription. Two coders lead the inductive analysis using open and axial coding. RESULTS: Thematic results aligned with the human-centered design framework, which is a participatory approach to the design process that incorporates multiple user stakeholders to develop health solutions. The human-centered design process and corresponding theme included the following: 1) Empathy: Patient, Caregiver, and Provider Experience reports participants' experience with managing serious illness, caregiving, social support, and technology use. 2) Define: Reactions to Evidence-Based Care Concepts and Barriers illustrates participants' perspectives on the domains of palliative care ranging from symptom management to psychosocial-spiritual care. 3) Ideation: Desired Features reports participant recommendations for designing digital health tools for palliative care domains. CONCLUSION: Digital health provides an opportunity to expand the reach of geriatric palliative care interventions. This paper documents human-centered preferences of geriatric palliative care digital health to ensure technologies are relevant and meaningful to health care providers, patients, and the caregiving social convoy.","Portz, Jennifer Dickman; Ford, Kelsey Lynett; Doyon, Katherine; Bekelman, David B; Boxer, Rebecca S; Kutner, Jean S; Czaja, Sara; Bull, Sheana",J. pain symptom manage,172,22

The SARS-CoV-2 is seventh and latest in coronavirus family with unique exonucleases for repairing any mismatches in newly transcribed genetic material. Therefore, drugs with novel additional mechanisms are required to simultaneously target and eliminate the virus. Thus, a newly deciphered N protein is taken as a target that belongs to SARS-CoV-2. They play a vital role in RNA transcription, viral replication and new virion formation. This study used virtual screening, molecular modeling and docking of the 8987 ligands from Asinex and PubChem databases against this novel target protein. Three hotspot sites having DScore &#8805;1 (Site 1, Site 2 and Site 3) for ligand binding were selected. Subsequently, high throughput screening, standard precision and extra precision docking process and molecular dynamics concluded three best drugs from two libraries. Two antiviral moieties from Asinex databases (5817 and 6799) have docking scores of -10.29 and -10.156; along with their respective free binding energies (&#916;G bind) of -51.96 and -64.36 on Site 3. The third drug, Zidovudine, is from PubChem database with docking scores of -9.75 with its binding free energies (&#916;G bind) of -59.43 on Site 3. The RMSD and RMSF were calculated for all the three drugs through molecular dynamics simulation studies for 50 ns. Zidovudine shows a very stable interaction with fluctuation starting at 2.4 Å on 2 ns and remained stable at 3 Å from 13 to 50 ns.

Higher maternal mental health distress, including perinatal anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-specific phobia, is supposed to be increasing during the pandemic, which impacts pregnant women's health and their infants and calls for intervention. Due to the social distancing protocols posed by the pandemic, telemental health interventions have fast become the most common form of psychosocial support for maternal mental health. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of maternal low-intensity psychosocial telemental interventions in improving mental health outcomes. The trial's objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of telemental low-intensity psychosocial interventions in pregnant and postpartum women attending the Women Wellness and Research Centre in Qatar in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The clinical trial is randomized in which pregnant women will be assigned equally through block randomization between two arms: (1) a control group and (2) an intervention group. The primary endpoint is the perinatal psychological distress, including perinatal depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 phobia in their third trimester; the secondary, tertiary, fourth, and fifth endpoints will be in the postnatal period (3-5 weeks, 2-4 months, 5-7 months, and 8-10 months). This trial involves pregnant women in their second trimester with no mental health illness history who communicate in English and Arabic and consent to participate. A sample size of 58 (29 participants per arm) is targeted. DISCUSSION: This study will provide recommendations about the efficacy of low-intensity psychosocial maternal telemental interventions to be implemented as a preventive service.

The present study examines the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on psychological and physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among university students in Turkey. A cross-sectional survey design was used for data collection. From May 11th to May 15th 2020, the study utilized snowball sampling techniques to gather data through an online survey. The pandemic's psychological effects on participants were measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey assess related HRQOL were used to make mental health assessments. 1120 university students were contacted to complete the survey. Of these, a total of 1095 completed the survey, translating to a participation rate of 97.7%. Overall, 64.6%, 48.6% and 45.2%, and 34.5% of all participants self-reported symptomatic signs of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. Female gender and poor family relationships were identified as risk factors for probably PTSD, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as well. The mean scores of Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) and Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) were 66.99 ± 2.14 and 40.76 ± 2.31, respectively. Students suspected of a history with PTSD had considerably lower total scores for PCS-12 and MCS-12, when cross checked for similarity to those without such a history. The findings of this research suggest that evidence of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress is commonly apparent among university students during the period of the COVID-19 crisis. Prevention and intervention approaches to attenuate the psychosocial impact should be an integral component of crisis response during pandemic conditions.","Cam, Hasan Huseyin; Ustuner Top, Fadime; Kuzlu Ayyildiz, Tülay",Curr Psychol,172,16

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A structural color resin composite, Omnichroma (OM, Tokuyama Corp, Chiyoda City, Tokyo, Japan), and two comparison resin composites, Filtek Supreme Ultra (FS, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) and Tetric EvoCeram (TE, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), were used. The flexural properties of the resin composites were determined in accordance with the ISO 4049 specifications. For surface properties, 70 polymerized specimens of each resin composite were prepared and divided into seven groups of 10. Surface roughness (Sa), gloss (GU), and surface free energy (SFE) were investigated after the following finishing and polishing methods. Three groups of specimens were finished with a superfine-grit diamond bur (SFD), and three with a tungsten carbide bur (TCB). After finishing, one of the two remaining groups was polished with a one-step silicone point (CMP), and the other with an aluminum oxide flexible disk (SSD). A group ground with SiC 320-grit was set as a baseline. RESULTS: The average flexural strength ranged from 116.6 to 142.3 MPa in the following order with significant differences between each value: FS > TE > OM. The average E ranged from 6.8 to 13.2 GPa in the following order with significant differences between each value: FS > TE > OM. The average R ranged from 0.77 to 1.01 MJ/mm3 in the following order: OM > FS > TE. The Sa values of the OM groups polished with CMP and SSD were found to be significantly lower than those of the other resin composites, regardless of the finishing method. The GU values appeared to be dependent on the material and the finishing method used. The OM specimens polished with SSD showed significantly higher GU values than those polished with CMP. Most of the resin composites polished with SSD demonstrated significantly higher Î³S values compared to the other groups. Extremely strong negative correlations between Sa and GU in the combined data from the three resin composites and each resin composite and between Sa and Î³S in the OM specimens were observed; GU showed a strong positive correlation with Î³S in the same material. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that both flexural and surface properties are material dependent. Furthermore, the different finishing and polishing methods used in this study were observed to affect the Sa, GU, and SFE of the resin composites.","Mizutani, K; Ishii, R; Takamizawa, T; Shibasaki, S; Kurokawa, H; Suzuki, M; Tsujimoto, A; Miyazaki, M",Oper.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22 2020 to Apr 02 2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with a similar total population number to Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the mean of basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was 4.34 (95% CI, 3.04–6.00) in Italy and 3.16 (95% CI, 1.73–5.25) in Hunan. There would be a total of 182 051 infected cases (95%CI:116 114–274 378) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Aug 05 in Italy. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures should be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.","Wangping, Jia; Ke, Han; Yang, Song; Wenzhe, Cao; Shengshu, Wang; Shanshan, Yang; Jianwei, Wang; Fuyin, Kou; Penggang, Tai; Jing, Li; Miao, Liu; Yao, He",Front.

Utilizing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) in the molecular delivery approach, the formed emulsion nanovesicle (TMB-NPs@PLGA) exhibits an enrichment of the collective signal molecules in a single antibody-antigen conjugation. A specific antibody-conjugated TMB-NPs@PLGA forms an immunocomplex sandwich structure upon the addition of influenza virus (IV)/A. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dissolves the PLGA nanovesicles, releasing the encapsulated TMB-NPs. Sequentially, the TMB-NPs release TMB molecules upon the addition of DMSO. The released TMB is catalytically oxidized by H2O2 with self-assembled protein-inorganic nanoflowers, where copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) acted as the nanozyme. The developed immunoassay demonstrates high sensitivity for IV/A with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 32.37 fg mL-1 and 54.97 fg mL-1 in buffer and serum, respectively. For practical needs, a clinically isolated IV/A/H3N2 and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected with the LODs of 17 pfu mL-1 and 143 fg mL-1, respectively. These results show the applicability of the advanced TMB-NPs@PLGA-based colorimetric sensor for the highly sensitive detection of airborne respiratory viruses.","Khoris, Indra Memdi; Ganganboina, Akhilesh Babu; Suzuki, Tetsuro; Park, Enoch Y",Nanoscale,172,24

Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (Alert Levels) were implemented in 2020 to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in NZ and were likely to have affected antibiotic prescribing. Methods: We aimed to identify the impact of these public health interventions on community antibiotic dispensing. We also examined rates of hospitalisation with infectious diseases that could be influenced by changing community antibiotic use. A retrospective review of two national databases was undertaken. Findings: 1.17 million people received 1.19 million prescriptions for antibiotics between 23/02/2020 and 18/07/2020. Antibiotic dispensing rates fell from 14 prescriptions per 1000 population per week during pre-Alert Level weeks to 9 prescriptions per 1000 population per week (a reduction of 36%) during the weeks of COVID Alert Level 3-4. Large reductions were seen with antibiotics predominantly used for respiratory- or urinary-tract infections. Hospital discharges with sentinel infections did not increase over this period;pneumonia discharges during Alert Level weeks were lower than in 2017-2019 (3 vs 6 discharges per 100,000 population). Interpretation: A large reduction in community antibiotic dispensing was observed in NZ during the implementation of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to eliminate COVID-19. Despite this marked reduction in antibiotic use, there was no increase in rates of hospitalisation for sentinel infections that community antibiotic use could prevent. These findings suggest that countries with high rates of antibiotic use could significantly reduce their use without an increase in morbidity.

METHODS: Keratinocyte viability and in vitro wound closure were assessed in keratinocyte cultures. Effects of topical TASE (0.5 µg/mL of allicin in 97% ethanol) on acute cutaneous WH were determined in a murine model of acute cutaneous wound. Twelve mice were alternately assigned to the vehicle- and TASE-treated groups (n=6 per group). Expression levels of mRNA for keratinocyte differentiation marker-related proteins (filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin) and lipid synthetic enzymes (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4), fatty acid synthase (FA2H), 3-hydroxy- 3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA), and serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)) were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on day 3 and 8 after wounding, while transepidermal water loss (TEWL) rates were measured in wounded areas. RESULTS: TASE accelerated WH both in vivo (40% vs. 22% reduction in wound area, P<0.01) and in vitro (90% vs. 65% reduction in wound area, P<0.01). Moreover, topical applications of TASE upregulated the expression levels of epidermal mRNA for ELOVL4, HMGCoA, SPT, filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin (P<0.05 vs. vehicle-treated controls) on day 3 after wounding. Likewise, TASE significantly lowered TEWL rates in comparison with vehicle alone on day 8 (33.06±2.09 g/(m2·h) vs. 24.60±2.04 g/(m2·h), P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Topical applications of TASE stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and formation of epidermal permeability barrier function, leading to acceleration of acute cutaneous WH. Topical products containing TASE could be used to manage acute cutaneous WH.","Santiago, Juan Luis; Galan-Moya, Eva Maria; Muñoz-Rodriguez, Jose Ramon; de la Cruz-Morcillo, Miguel Angel; Redondo-Calvo, Francisco Javier; Gracia-Fernandez, Ignacio; Elias, Peter M; Perez-Ortiz, Jose Manuel; Man, Mao-Qiang",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,172,15

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the characteristics of TDIs under the transmission control measures in Wuhan City utilizing an epidemiologic investigation. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this retrospective study, epidemiologic information, including the number of patients, gender, age, and TDI parameters such as time since injury to the clinic visit, etiology, tooth location, and the type of injury was extracted from the records of patients in the hospital from two periods: period 1 (between January 23, 2020, and April 7, 2020) and period 2 (between January 23, 2019, and April 7, 2019). The data from the two periods were compared and analyzed. RESULT: A total of 158 patients were treated for TDIs (120 in 2019 and 38 in 2020). Males were more likely to suffer from TDIs than females with a ratio of 1.5:1, both in 2020 and 2019. Other than that, there were characteristic changes in TDIs during the transmission control measures in the COVID-19 epidemic, which included the number of patients, age, time since injury to the clinic visit, etiology, tooth location and the type of TDI. CONCLUSION: The transmission control measures during the COVID-19 epidemic had a significant impact on the epidemiology and etiology of TDIs in Wuhan City.","Yang, Yu-Ting; Zhang, Wei; Xie, Long; Li, Zu-Bing; Li, Zhi",Dent. traumatol,172,16

However, medicine is undergoing a profound transformation, generating data at an unprecedented scale, which opens new frontiers to study and understand diseases. With the wealth of data collected, new challenges for statistical inference arise, as datasets are often high dimensional, exhibit an increasing number of measurements at irregularly spaced time points, and are simply too large to fit in memory. Many current implementations for time-to-event analysis are ill-suited for these problems as inference is computationally demanding and requires access to the full data at once. Here we propose a Bayesian version for the counting process representation of Cox's partial likelihood for efficient inference on large-scale datasets with millions of data points and thousands of time-dependent covariates. Through the combination of stochastic variational inference and a reweighting of the log-likelihood, we obtain an approximation for the posterior distribution that factorizes over subsamples of the data, enabling the analysis in big data settings. Crucially, the method produces viable uncertainty estimates for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. We show the utility of our method through a simulation study and an application to myocardial infarction in the UK Biobank.","Jung, Alexander W.; Gerstung, Moritz",,172,24

METHODS: Members of a Norwegian fitness association were invited to fill out an online questionnaire including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), sleep disturbances and change in PA habits (decreased, unchanged, increased) during the COVID-19 lockdown from 12 March to 15 June 2020. RESULTS: A sample of 1281 members aged 19-81 years were included (31% females; mean ± SD age 49 ± 11.5). Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 4.4%, respectively. During the lockdown period, 13.8% reduced, 21.9% increased and 64.3% did not change PA level. In total 21.9% reported sleeping disturbances. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were statistically significantly associated with sleep disturbances. Change in PA did not influence the association between mental health and sleep. CONCLUSION: Compared to studies from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were substantial lower in this Norwegian sample of relatively physically active adults.

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56°C prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. METHODS: By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay RESULTS: We showed that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 disease group (n = 9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cutoff value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended, and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.","Hu, Xiumei; An, Taixue; Situ, Bo; Hu, Yuhai; Ou, Zihao; Li, Qiang; He, Xiaojing; Zhang, Ye; Tian, Peifu; Sun, Dehua; Rui, Yongyu; Wang, Qian; Ding, Dan; Zheng, Lei",J Clin Lab Anal,172,24

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and biological characteristics of COVID-19 patients presenting with an associated arterial thromboembolic event. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentric study in 3 centers between France and Italy. All patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and arterial thromboembolic events were included in the analysis. RESULTS: From March 8th to April 25th 2020, we identified 20 patients (24 events) with arterial thromboembolic events over 209 admitted patients (9.6%) with severe COVID-19 infection. Arterial thrombotic events included acute coronary occlusions (n = 9), stroke (n = 6), limb ischemia (n = 3), splenic infarcts (n = 3), aortic thrombosis (n = 2) and occlusive mesenteric ischemia (n = 1). At the time of the event, 10/20 (50%) of patients received thromboprohylaxis, 2/20 (10%) were receiving treatment dose anticoagulation and 5/20 (25%) were receiving antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that serious arterial thrombotic events might occur in Covid-19 patients. However, the exact incidence of such events and the best way to prevent them yet remains to be investigated.","de Roquetaillade, C; Chousterman, B G; Tomasoni, D; Zeitouni, M; Houdart, E; Guedon, A; Reiner, P; Bordier, R; Gayat, E; Montalescot, G; Metra, M; Mebazaa, A",Int. j. cardiol,172,25

METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted across the country using semi-structured web-based questionnaire among COVID-19 negative and asymptomatic healthcare workers, taking hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis. Descriptive and multivariate logistic-regression models were applied for analysis. RESULTS: Of the 166 participants, at least one adverse event was experienced by 37.9% participants, gastrointestinal being the most common (30.7%). Risk was higher in participants <40 years age (odd's ratio (OR): 2.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-5.05) and after first dose of hydroxychloroquine (51.2%, OR: 2.38, 95%CI: 1.17-4.84). Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis was initiated without electrocardiography by 80.1% of HCWs. Only 21.6% of those with cardiovascular disease could get prior ECG. CONCLUSIONS: A higher incidence of adverse events was observed when results were compared with studies involving patients on long-term hydroxychloroquine therapy. Younger age and first dose were associated with greater incidence of adverse events though all were self-limiting. Monitoring prior and during prophylaxis was inadequate even among those with cardiovascular disease and risk-factors.

DIPs interfere with the propagation and spread of infectious standard virus (STV), reduce virus yields by competing for viral and cellular resources, and induce antiviral responses. These properties open exciting possibilities for the development of DIP-based antivirals. Exploring options for cell culture-based DIP production, we have established a fully continuous cultivation process, where one bioreactor is used to grow cells that are fed to two bioreactors operated in parallel for virus production. This system allows head-to-head comparisons of STV and DIP replication dynamics over extended time periods. Cultivations were performed at two residence times (RT, 22 and 36 h) using MDCK suspension cells grown in a fully defined medium. For infection, we used a virus seed generated by reverse genetics containing STVs and a known DIP carrying a deletion in segment 1 (delS1(1)). Four days post infection, DIPs achieved maximum concentrations of 7.0·10(9) virions/mL and 8.4·10(9) virions/mL for RTs of 22 and 36 h, respectively. Furthermore, oscillations in virus titers with two to three maxima were found for DIP accumulation at 36 and 22 h RT, respectively. To complement the study, a basic mathematical model using simple kinetics and a reasonable number of parameters to describe DIP-propagation in continuous cultures was established. Upon fitting the model individually to each of the two data sets, oscillations in the viral dynamics and the cell population dynamics were described well. Modeling suggests that both STV inactivation and virus degradation have to be taken into account to achieve good agreement of simulations and experimental data for longer RTs. Together, the high DIP titers obtained, and the successful simulation of the experimental data showed that the combination of continuous bioreactors and mathematical models can enable studies regarding DIP dynamics over extended time periods and allow large scale manufacturing of DIP-based antivirals.","Tapia, Felipe; Laske, Tanja; Wasik, Milena A.; Rammhold, Markus; Genzel, Yvonne; Reichl, Udo",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,172,30

Ground water is an indicator of regional development by improving the economic domain through intensive agricultural practices, and aesthetic value through sufficient ground water supply as drinking water, fertile soil, and healthy vegetation. However, ground water availability and associated human perceptions were the main themes of the present study. In this study, both primary and secondary data were incorporated to understand the human adaptation behaviour in drought-prone areas of the fringe of Chhotanagpur plateau region (Bankura-I and II blocks) to ground water storage. GWPZ mapping is a very important exposure to knowing the ground reality. So, the MCDM-AHP method has been developed based on the eight dominant conditioning factors viz. geomorphology, lithology, lineament density, soil, drainage density, LULC, average slope, and slope aspect using GIS analytics with field expertise. The output result was validated with comparing 105 inventory stations where 0.850 AUC value was good for accepting the GWPZ model. As a result, a major portion of the study area is dominated by poor to moderate possibilities of ground water level (ground water level drops 1–2 m during the pre-monsoon) due to Proterozoic granite gneiss formation over the study area. With comparing demographic status, it was not favourable for a healthy lifestyle. Agriculture dominated rural environment of Bankura-I and II blocks is far away from the modern digital environment that is why ground water has played a very crucial role in the field of development. Moreover, to build up a good level of ground water recharge zone through rainfall harvesting, and sustainable land use planning will be the best management practices. So, availability of ground water should be a positive sign of development in the field of the economic sector and sustainable human society.","Das, Mantu; Parveen, Tania; Ghosh, Deep; Alam, Jiarul",Environ Earth Sci,172,3

Results A total of 316,718 hospitalizations were included (48.7% female, mean 72.5 years), and 21,191 (6.7%, 95% CI 6.6-6.8%) deaths occurred. In-hospital mortality increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the three previous years for patients with acute stroke from 8.3% (95% CI 8.0-8.5) to 9.6% (95% CI 9.1-10.2) while no significant changes were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, ALI, aortic rupture, and TIA. When comparing patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.4%, 95% CI 2.3-2.5) vs. non-infected patients, a higher in-hospital mortality was observed for acute stroke (12.4% vs. 9.0%), ALI (14.3% vs. 5.0%), and TIA (2.7% vs. 0.3%) while no statistically significant differences were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, and aortic rupture. Conclusion This retrospective analysis of claims data provided hints for an association of COVID-19 pandemic with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with acute stroke. Furthermore, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased mortality in patients with stroke, TIA, and ALI. Future studies are urgently needed to better understand the underlying mechanism and relationship between the new coronavirus and acute stroke.","Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Seiffert, Moritz; Gerloff, Christian; L’Hoest, Helmut; Acar, Laura; Thomalla, Götz",Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,172,33

METHODS: Following the methodology framework and analytical strategies used in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, the incidence, death, DALYs and risk factors of RIT were examined by age, gender and states from 1990 to 2019 in the US. All estimates were calculated as counts, age-standardized rates per 100,000 people and percentage change, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized incidence, death and DALY rates per 100,000 people of RIT were 339,703 (95% CI 303,184 to 382,354), 13.6 (95% CI 12.2 to 14.4) and 384.9 (95% CI 330.6 to 458.6), respectively. Among RIT causes, upper respiratory infection accounted for the large majority of RIT age-standardized incidence rate, while lower respiratory infection constituted the highest proportion of RIT age-standardized death and DALY rates. The age-standardized incidence, death and DALY rates of RIT in 2019 and their temporal trends since 1990 varied widely across states and socio-demographic index. Among all attributable risk factors, smoking was the leading one for age-standardized RIT deaths in 2019, followed by low temperature and alcohol use (the attributable fractions were 17.7%, 15.3% and 6.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that RIT remained a major cause of health burden in the US, with large disparities persisting between US states. Intervention efforts for RIT hotspots, high-risk populations and modifiable risk factors are necessary.","Zhong, Wen; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Kong, Jude Dzevela; Safiri, Saeid; Behzadifar, Masoud; Liu, Jun; Liu, Xinyao; Wang, Weijun",Clin Epidemiol,172,21

This study aimed to investigate the severity, prevalence, and predictors of moral distress experienced by Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide, voluntary, anonymous, single time-point, online survey of self-identified frontline healthcare workers was conducted between 27th August and 23rd October 2020. Participants were recruited through health organisations, professional associations, or colleges, universities, government contacts, and national media. Results: 7846 complete responses were received from nurses (39.4%), doctors (31.1%), allied health staff (16.7%), or other roles (6.7%). Many participants reported moral distress related to resource scarcity (58.3%), wearing PPE (31.7%) limiting their ability to care for patients, exclusion of family going against their values (60.2%), and fear of letting co-workers down if they were infected (55.0%). Many personal and workplace predictors of moral distress were identified, with those working in certain frontline areas, metropolitan locations, and with prior mental health diagnoses at particular risk of distress. Moral distress was associated with increased risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout. Conversely, feeling appreciated by the community protected against these risks in healthcare workers. Conclusions: Safeguarding healthcare workforces during crises is important for both patient safety and workforce longevity. Targeted interventions are required to prevent or minimise moral distress and associated mental health concerns in healthcare workers during COVID-19 and other crises.","Smallwood, Natasha; Pascoe, Amy; Karimi, Leila; Willis, Karen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,172,18

The outbreak further exploded in Europe and America in mid-March 2020 to become a global health emergency. We reviewed recent published articles and on-line open messages on SARS-CoV-2–positive infants and children younger than 20 years of age. Symptoms are usually less severe in children than in adults. Twelve critically or mortally ill children were found in the published or news reports before April 6, 2020. Vertical transmission from the mother to her fetus or neonate has not been proven definitively. However, six early-onset (<7 days) and 3 late-onset neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the literature. We also summarized the presentations and contact information of 24 SARS-CoV-2–positive children announced by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread.

This detects all five mRNAs because of the 3′-coterminal, nested-set arrangement of coronavirus mRNAs. The mRNAs were readily detected even after extensive purification of virions and after RNase A treatment of virions. In sucrose gradients the peaks of virus particles, genomic RNA (gRNA), and mRNAs were coincident. Cellular mRNA was not detected in virions. The molar ratio of gRNA to each mRNA ranged from about 10 to 30 for IBV-Beaudette and 25 to 800 for IBV-M41. The molar ratio of genomic to intracellular viral mRNAs was also determined. From this it was estimated that the efficiency of incorporation of gRNA into virions was at least 20- to 100-fold greater, depending on the mRNA species, for IBV-Beaudette and 100- to 500-fold for IBV-M41. It is concluded that most virions contain only gRNA or contain only one species of mRNA on average in addition to gRNA.","Zhao, X.; Shaw, K.; Cavanagh, D.",Virology,172,1

Unfortunately, treatment options are currently limited or even unavailable. Thus, the aim of our study was to explore the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets for co-infection. METHODS: To further understand the mechanisms underlying co-infection, we used a series of bioinformatics analyses to build host factor interaction networks and elucidate biological process and molecular function categories, pathway activity, tissue-specific enrichment, and potential therapeutic agents. RESULTS: We explored the pathologic mechanisms of COVID-19 and dengue co-infection, including predisposing genes, significant pathways, biological functions, and possible drugs for intervention. In total, 460 shared host factors were collected; among them, CCL4 and AhR targets were important. To further analyze biological functions, we created a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis. In addition, common signaling pathways were acquired, and the toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways exerted a significant effect on the interaction. Upregulated genes were identified based on the activity score of dysregulated genes, such as IL-1, Hippo, and TNF-α. We also conducted tissue-specific enrichment analysis and found ICAM-1 and CCL2 to be highly expressed in the lung. Finally, candidate drugs were screened, including resveratrol, genistein, and dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: This study probes host factor interaction networks for COVID-19 and dengue and provides potential drugs for clinical practice. Although the findings need to be verified, they contribute to the treatment of co-infection and the management of respiratory disease.","Zheng, Wenjiang; Wu, Hui; Liu, Chengxin; Yan, Qian; Wang, Ting; Wu, Peng; Liu, Xiaohong; Jiang, Yong; Zhan, Shaofeng",Front Immunol,172,26

Present study highlights the deterrents to recruiting CCP donors at a hospital based blood centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential CCP donors were contacted individually by telephone and a group approach through camp organisers from May to July 2020. Recruitment challenges were noted and deferrals of these recruited donors during screening and medical examination was obtained and analysed. RESULTS: Total 1165 potential CCP donors were contacted. Around 47% donors were lost due to challenges related to information storage and retrieval. Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID‐19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery. CONCLUSION: The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.","Dhiman, Yashaswi; Coshic, Poonam; Pandey, Hem Chandra; Khatiwada, Basanta; Singh, Jasmeet; Mehta, Vikas; Gupta, Sanjay",Transfus Med,172,10

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician–patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms “telemedicine” and “COVID-19.” RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.","Hagge, Daniel; Knopf, Andreas; Hofauer, Benedikt",HNO,172,11

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four leading experts were selected and recruited to participate in this iterative web-based Delphi study. An open-ended questionnaire was administered to collect the expert panel's views in the first round. In the second round, the panel was asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement with individual items gleaned from qualitative content analysis of views expressed in the first round. The participants were offered the opportunity to reevaluate and correct their initial responses in subsequent rounds. Responses in the second and following rounds were analyzed using quantitative descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The first and second rounds were completed by 54.2% (n=13/24) and 58.3% (n=14/24) of the selected panel, respectively, while 10 out of these 14 participants completed the third round. The panel cited in-person essential medical services, telehealth for fever/respiratory symptoms, surveillance for influenzae-like illness, and minimization of spread to staff as important and appropriate roles of primary care, which are urgent and feasible during a pandemic. Regarding conditions/support for these roles, the panel indicated that institutional support and funding for separate areas, workforce, and telehealth, along with public-private collaborative governance, are urgent, but not feasible.

Its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts, in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and, thus, interfere with the host's innate immune response. A recently identified novel ASFV viral protein (pI329L) was found to inhibit the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway, TLR3 being a crucial “danger detector.” pI329L has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar to TLR3, suggesting that pI329L might act as a TLR3 decoy. To explore this idea, we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose (a) a model for the TLR3–Toll-interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and (b) a structural fold for pI329L, detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain. As this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available TLR3 templates, a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/refinement (I-TASSER) structural prediction with expertise-guided posterior refinement. The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.","Henriques, Elsa S; Brito, Rui M M; Soares, Hugo; Ventura, Sónia; de Oliveira, Vivian L; Parkhouse, R Michael E",Protein Science,172,1

However, whether PCT can serve as a useful candidate for differentiating KD from sepsis, and even for predicting incomplete KD, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) nonresponsiveness and coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 254 Chinese KD children were enrolled and divided into 6 subgroups, including complete KD, incomplete KD, IVIG-responsive KD, IVIG-nonresponsive KD, KD with CAAs and KD without CAAs. Blood samples were collected from all subjects within 24-h pre- and 48-h post-IVIG infusion, respectively. PCT, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood cell counts were detected. In addition, both 261 children with sepsis and 251 healthy children sex- and age-matched with KD children were enrolled in the same period. RESULTS: (1) PCT experienced the highest increase in sepsis patients before antibiotic therapy, followed by acute KD patients and the healthy controls. (2) The proportion of KD patients with a PCT concentration below 0.25 ng/ml was 11 folds higher than that of sepsis patients. (3) PCT had a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 30.3% at a cutoff value of > 0.15 ng/ml to predict IVIG nonresponsiveness, and the proportion of IVIG-nonresponders with a PCT concentration of 0.25–0.50 ng/ml was 2 folds higher than that of IVIG-responders. CONCLUSIONS: The PCT concentrations below 0.25 ng/ml may be useful for discriminating KD from sepsis, and moreover, the PCT concentrations of 0.25–0.50 ng/ml may be helpful in predicting IVIG nonresponsiveness.","Niu, Man Man; Jiang, Qi; Ruan, Jin Wei; Liu, Hui Hui; Chen, Wei Xia; Qiu, Zhen; Fan, Guo Zhen; Li, Rui Xue; Wei, Wei; Hu, Peng",Clin Exp Med,172,9

Understanding tissue microanatomy is crucial for students to be able to recognize cellular structures and follow disease pathogenesis. Traditional histology teaching labs rely on light microscopes and a limited array of slides, which inhibits simultaneous observation by multiple learners, and prevents in-class discussions. We have developed an interactive web-based microscopy tool called “Histoscope” for oral histology in this context. METHODS: Good quality microscope slides were selected for digital scanning. The slides were scanned with multiple layers of z-stacking, a method of taking multiple images at different focal distances. The digital images were checked for quality and were archived on Histoscope. The slides were annotated, and self-assessment questions were prepared for the website. Interactive components were programmed on the website to mimic the experience of using a real light microscope. RESULTS: This web-based tool allows users to interact with histology slides, replicating the experience of observing and manipulating a slide under a real microscope. Through this website, learners can access a broad array of digital oral histology slides and self-assessment questions. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of Histoscope in a course can shift traditional teacher-centered histology learning to a collaborative and student-centered learning environment. This platform can also provide students the flexibility to study histology at their own pace.","Sharmin, Nazlee; Chow, Ava K.; Dong, Alice S.; Milos, Nadine C.",Healthc Inform Res,172,1

As the pandemic still unfolds, uncertainty circles around the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). To diminish the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and lessen the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of MS patients, it is essential to understand knowledge, attitudes, and various behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among MS patients. Therefore, this study aimed to look at the behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among patients with MS. A total of 176 MS patients diagnosed at least one year before the survey were conveniently sampled online in Saudi Arabia and their data collected using a structured interview questionnaire in electronic Google form. We determined the reliability of the questionnaire by measuring its internal consistency in a pilot sample of 30 participants. Overall, more than 80% of participants had good knowledge and attitudes towards Covid-19. However, this did not correlate well with the impact on healthcare (r = 0.06). Our study revealed that 46% of participants were anxious about taking their medication, and 32% of participants missed their hospital appointments. Furthermore, 15% of the participants had a relapse but did not go to the hospital because of the pandemic, 15.9% stopped their DMTs, and 35.2% missed drug infusions or refills. Our study revealed overall good knowledge and attitudes related to Covid-19 among MS patients. However, the healthcare impact was considerable, as 32% of the participants missed their hospital appointments, and another 15% had a relapse.

METHODS Three hundred fifteen patients who were diagnosed with COVID- 19 and applied to the chest diseases outpatient clinic between May 2020 and August 2020 for control in the 1st month were included in the study. Patient information was collected from the hospital information system and the e-pulse system. RESULTS Females accounted for 50.2 % of the our patients and their mean age was 47.9 ± 14.8 (19-88) years. 14.3% (n: 45) of the individuals were 65 years of age and older. 20.6% (n: 65) of our patients were smoking. 70.2% (n: 221) of our patients were treated at home. 133 patients had at least one comorbid disease. The patients most frequently reported cough, dyspnea, weakness, myalgia and diarrhea. The most common symptoms were cough, dyspnea, weakness and myalgia in the first month. Initial D-dimer, initial CRP and the values of platelet, D dimer and CRP in the first month were detected to be higher in patients with persistens symptoms when the laboratory values of patients whose symptoms continue after 1 month were examined. It was determined that the symptoms had persisted in patients who had been hospitalized, had dual therapy, had comorbid diseases and had more common pathologies in their pulmonary imagings. CONCLUSION Symptoms may persist for a long time in hospitalized patients, in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia and concomitant chronic diseases and in patients with high D-dimer and high CRP at the time of admission.

Prior to lockdown we had cancelled routine CF clinics and used this unique opportunity to rapidly redesign outpatient services providing remote video-assisted consultations (VAC) with digital technology. VAC also enabled vulnerable shielding MDT members or those self-isolating through COVID contact to provide care. We describe our experience in rolling out VAC. Methods and results: We initially used AccurX®, a healthcare provider (HCP) text message-initiated video call service. From March 20th–April 17th 2020, 192 physician-led VACs were completed to support pwCF with the lowest FEV1% in our clinic. From April 18th we moved to the NHS England and NHS Improvement supported secure Attend Anywhere® service with pre-arranged appointment times, constructing 10 bespoke MDT waiting area ‘clinics’ with 44 active MDT users, including an all-discipline MDT clinic. Over 8 months, 1,348 consultations (602 hours) took place with most activity (1,163 consultations;86%;557 hours) in the MDT clinic. Other areas used were CF Nurse Specialist (n = 86), CFRD (n = 21), Dietetics (n = 12), Physiotherapy (n = 31) and Psychology (n = 19). Since August 2020, we have reinstated routine face-to-face clinics for emergencies and Annual Review, but >90% of our pwCF are now managed virtually via VAC with remote spirometric monitoring (Nuvoair®). Conclusions: MDT members and pwCF report a high satisfaction with VAC with an increased number of pwCF using it. VAC has improved pwCF's access to MDT services, abolishing the need to travel for and the risk of cross-infection associated with physical routine review, whilst improving appointment convenience. There has also been improved collaboration between professionals with this new way of working, and we continue to adapt our services to the benefit of pwCF.","Nazareth, D.; Sumner, C.; Walshaw, M.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,172,21

Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity. Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS, and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection. The vaccine is designed in silico by following a reverse vaccinology method acknowledging its antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity. The vaccine candidate that we have designed as a result of this work shows promising result indicating its potential capability of simulating an immune response.","Faiza, Muniba; Abdullah, Tariq; Calderon-Tantalean, Jose Franklin; Upadhyay, Manish Ravindranath; Abdelmoneim, Abdelrahman H.; Akram, Fareeha; Thakur, Bhupender Singh; Abdulaziz, Ibrahim; Ononamadu, Chimaobi James; Ghoraba, Dina Abdelazim; Munawar, Saba; Faruque, MD Fakhrul Islam; Kigen, Collins; Sharma, Abhishek; Kumar, Ashwani; Khalid, Aqsa; Gharip, Ali; Gupta, Ankit; Manikumar, Manne; Chaudhary, Uma",bioRxiv,172,21

We describe such an expansion of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family in certain bat families. Members of the CEA family in humans and mice are exploited as cellular receptors by a number of pathogens, possibly due to their function in immunity and reproduction. The CEA family is composed of CEA-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and secreted pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs). PSGs are almost exclusively expressed by trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface. The reason why PSGs exist only in a minority of mammals is still unknown. RESULTS: Analysis of the CEA gene family in bats revealed that in certain bat families, belonging to the subgroup Yangochiroptera but not the Yinpterochiroptera subgroup an expansion of the CEA gene family took place, resulting in approximately one hundred CEA family genes in some species of the Vespertilionidae. The majority of these genes encode secreted PSG-like proteins (further referred to as PSG). Remarkably, we found strong evidence that the ligand-binding domain (IgV-like domain) of PSG is under diversifying positive selection indicating that bat PSGs may interact with structurally highly variable ligands. Such ligands might represent bacterial or viral pathogen adhesins. We have identified two distinct clusters of PSGs in three Myotis species. The two PSG cluster differ in the amino acids under positive selection. One cluster was only expanded in members of the Vespertilionidae while the other was found to be expanded in addition in members of the Miniopteridae and Mormoopidae. Thus one round of PSG expansion may have occurred in an ancestry of all three families and a second only in Vespertilionidae. Although maternal ligands of PSGs may exist selective challenges by two distinct pathogens seem to be likely responsible for the expansion of PSGs in Vespertilionidae. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid expansion of PSGs in certain bat species together with selection for diversification suggest that bat PSGs could be part of a pathogen defense system by serving as decoy receptors and/or regulators of feto-maternal interactions.

Although IRTs have significant potential for human body temperature measurement, the literature indicates inconsistent diagnostic performance, possibly due to wide variations in implemented methodology. A standardized method for IRT fever screening was recently published, but there is a lack of clinical data demonstrating its impact on IRT performance. Aim: Perform a clinical study to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of standardized IRT-based fever screening and evaluate the effect of facial measurement location. Approach: We performed a clinical study of 596 subjects. Temperatures from 17 facial locations were extracted from thermal images and compared with oral thermometry. Statistical analyses included calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values for detection of febrile subjects. Results: Pearson correlation coefficients for IRT-based and reference (oral) temperatures were found to vary strongly with measurement location. Approaches based on maximum temperatures in either inner canthi or full-face regions indicated stronger discrimination ability than maximum forehead temperature (AUC values of 0.95 to 0.97 versus 0.86 to 0.87, respectively) and other specific facial locations. These values are markedly better than the vast majority of results found in prior human studies of IRT-based fever screening. Conclusion: Our findings provide clinical confirmation of the utility of consensus approaches for fever screening, including the use of inner canthi temperatures, while also indicating that full-face maximum temperatures may provide an effective alternate approach.","Zhou, Yangling; Ghassemi, Pejman; Chen, Michelle; McBride, David; Casamento, Jon P.; Pfefer, T.

METHODS: We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from adult and pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and from their contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Manitoba between March and December 2020. We compared viral growth in cell culture, cycle threshold values from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)/mL) between adults and children. RESULTS: Among 305 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, 97 samples were from children aged 10 years or younger, 78 were from children aged 11–17 years and 130 were from adults (≥ 18 yr). Viral growth in culture was present in 31% of samples, including 18 (19%) samples from children 10 years or younger, 18 (23%) from children aged 11–17 years and 57 (44%) from adults (children v. adults, odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28–0.72). The cycle threshold was 25.1 (95% CI 17.7–31.3) in children 10 years or younger, 22.2 (95% CI 18.3–29.0) in children aged 11–17 years and 18.7 (95% CI 17.9–30.4) in adults (p < 0.001).

A return to normal surgery workflow depends prevalence and transmission of coronavirus in elective surgical patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of active SARS‐CoV‐2 infection during a second wave among patients admitted to hospital for elective surgery in Victoria. METHODS: Prospective cohort study across 8 hospitals in Victoria during July‐August 2020, enrolling adults and children admitted to hospital for elective surgery or interventional procedure requiring general anaesthesia. Study outcomes included a positive PCR test for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the preoperative period (primary outcome); and for those with a negative test preoperatively, the incidence of a positive PCR test for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the postoperative period. RESULTS: We enrolled 4,965 elective adult and paediatric surgical patients from 15 July to 31 August, 2020. Four patients screened negative on questionnaire but had a positive PCR test for coronavirus, resulting in a Bayesian estimated prevalence of 0.12% (95% probability interval: 0 to 0.26%). There were no reports of healthcare worker infections linked to elective surgery during and up to 2 weeks after the study period. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in asymptomatic elective surgical patients during a second wave was approximately 1 in 833. Given the very low likelihood of coronavirus transmission, and with existing current hospital capacity, recommencement of elective surgery should be considered.

Despite the implementation of new automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the 24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures.

Establishing the basic science of cultured meat has been the primary focus of the last decade but it is now feasible that cultured meat products will enter the market within the next 3 to 4 years. This proximity to market introduction demands an evaluation of aspects of the cultured meat production process that have not yet been outlined or discussed in significant detail. For example, one technological approach for the production of cultured meat uses adult muscle stem cells, the limited proliferative capacity of which necessitates repeated collection of tissue samples via biopsies of living donor animals. The selection of donor animals and the details of biopsy processes must be optimized, as this is a key bottleneck in the cultured meat production process. The number of stem cells harvested from a biopsy, together with their proliferative capacity, determines a ‘multiplicity factor’ achieved by a cultured meat production process, thus dictating the reduction in number of animals required to produce a given quantity of meat. This article considers potential scenarios for these critical upstream steps, focusing on the production of cultured beef as an example. Considerations related to donor selection and details of the biopsy process are discussed in detail. The practicalities of various scenarios for cultured beef production, the health of donor animals, and regulatory issues associated with the safety of cultured meat for consumers are also considered. © 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: we conducted a descriptive study of chest CT findings in 26 patients hospitalized with coronavirus pneumonia at the UCK over a 9-month period, from March 17 to November 17, 2020. Hitachi - CT-scanner 16 slice was used in all our patients. After analyzing lesions, these were divided into lesions suggestive and non-suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: the average age of patients was 53.02 years. Male sex was the most affected (76.9%). Respiratory distress was the most common clinical symptom (61.5%). Arterial hypertension and renal failure were the most common comorbidities (3O% and 6%). Bilateral ground-glass opacities, with a predominantly peripheral distribution, accounted for 69.2% of cases, followed by condensations (57.7%) and crazy paving (19.2%). Severe COVID-19 was most frequently found (34.61%). Distal and proximal pulmonary embolism was the most common complication (11.5%). Among the associated diseases, pleurisy and pulmonary PAH were most frequently found (30.8%). The majority of our patients had parenchymal lung lesions, corresponding to early-stage disease on CT (50%). CONCLUSION: at the UCK, during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, lesions on CT suggestive of COVID-19 were dominated by plaque-like ground-glass opacities, followed by nonsystematized parenchymatous condensations and crazy paving. The less observed atypical lesions consisted of unilateral, peribronchovascular pseudo-nodular condensations and infection in the remodeled lung. Severe COVID-19 was the most common CT finding. Proximal and distal pulmonary embolism was the most common complication. This study highlights that these findings are consistent with those reported in the literature.","Tshienda, Frederick Tshibasu; Tshikwela, Michel Lelo; Risasi, Jean-Robert Makulo; Situakibanza, Hippolyte Nani Tuma; Salem, Randa; Ndjock, Patrick Sekele Marob; Makwala, René Ngiyulu; Aundu, Antoine Molua; Mabiala, Joseph Bodi; Ntumba, Jean-Marie Kayembe; Longo-Mbenza, Benjamin",Pan Afr Med J,172,33

Currently, there is no universally approved protocol for disinfecting lead garments in the electrophysiology laboratory. This study explores the feasibility of using ATP testing to assess the microbial burden of lead aprons and evaluates the impact of a sanitary intervention. METHODS: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) testing is a well-established hospital standard to quantify biological matter on a surface and, by proxy, the microbial burden. It is measured in RLU (relative light units). Pre-intervention ATP testing was performed on 34 lead garments after use for electrophysiology procedures. The thyroid collar, mid-chest vest, and left axillary areas of the garments were swabbed using a Hygiena SystemSure II luminometer with ATP swabs (Hygiena, Camarillo, CA). These sites were then disinfected with disinfectant wipes (PDI Super Sani-cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipe) and ATP testing was repeated. RESULTS: The mean duration of garment wear was 213 min. The thyroid collars had the highest mean RLU before intervention, followed by the mid-chest vest and the left axillary areas. The intervention was found to significantly decrease ATP readings for all three sites (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0001, p = 0.0002 respectively). Linear regression modeling to assess the impact of intervention showed a significant correlation with pre-intervention ATP values for all three sites but no correlation with fluoroscopy time, fluoroscopy dose, or total time spent within the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Lead garments harbor microbial contamination after use according to ATP testing. A sanitary intervention can decontaminate lead garments and potentially reduce rates of hospital infection.","Allam, Sahitya; McDowell, Emily; Heard, Brittney; Kim, Taelim; Luu, Emmelyn; Muto, Carlene; Mazimba, Sula; Mehta, Nishaki",J Interv Card Electrophysiol,172,1

The long-term consequences of delaying procedures in response to COVID-19 remains unknown. We developed a high-throughput approach to understand the impact of delaying procedures on patient health outcomes using electronic health record (EHR) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used EHR data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s (VUMC) Research and Synthetic Derivatives. Elective procedures and non-urgent visits were suspended at VUMC between March 18, 2020 and April 24, 2020. Surgical procedure data from this period were compared to a similar timeframe in 2019. Potential adverse impact of delay in cardiovascular and cancer-related procedures was evaluated using EHR data collected from January 1, 1993 to March 17, 2020. For surgical procedure delay, outcomes included length of hospitalization (days), mortality during hospitalization, and readmission within six months. For screening procedure delay, outcomes included 5-year survival and cancer stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 416 surgical procedures that were negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Using retrospective data, we found 27 significant associations between procedure delay and adverse patient outcomes. Clinician review indicated that 88.9% of the significant associations were plausible and potentially clinically significant. Analytic pipelines for this study are available online. CONCLUSION: Our approach enables health systems to identify medical procedures affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate the effect of delay, enabling them to communicate effectively with patients and prioritize rescheduling to minimize adverse patient outcomes.","Zheng, Neil S.; Warner, Jeremy L.; Osterman, Travis J.; Wells, Quinn S.; Shu, Xiao-Ou; Deppen, Stephen A.; Karp, Seth J.; Dwyer, Shon; Feng, QiPing; Cox, Nancy J.; Peterson, Josh F.; Michael Stein, C.; Roden, Dan M.; Johnson, Kevin B.; Wei, Wei-Qi",J Biomed Inform,172,24

Thus, there is a need to develop Arabic versions of psychometrically validated instruments for evaluating a wider range of aspects related to stress and stressors. The Higher Education Stress Inventory (HESI) is an instrument used to assess various aspects of stress and stressors related to higher education in different educational settings and among different student populations. To date, no exploratory or confirmatory factor analyses have been conducted to study the factor structure of the Arabic version of the HESI. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the HESI (Arabic-HESI) among nursing students in Jordan. METHODS: The structure of the instrument was tested using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and maximum likelihood estimation among a sample of 355 nursing students at five Jordanian universities. RESULTS: The Arabic-HESI proved to have excellent content validity index (CVI = 0.92). The instrument showed good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.75), as well as for the two emerged factors “challenges” and “dissatisfaction” (Cronbach’s α were 0.75, 0.72 respectively). The results support the two-factor model for the Arabic-HESI, as the instrument was found to have robust structure and acceptable goodness-of-fit indices. CONCLUSION: The Arabic-HESI is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing stress levels and stressors among nursing students in Jordan. Using the shortened version of the HESI to assess stress among nursing students is recommended. Identifying new features of stress and stressors among nursing students in Jordan will enable universities and nursing faculties to better support their students.","Masha’al, Dina; Hayajneh, Audai A.; Tawalbeh, Loai Issa",BMC Psychiatry,172,10

Face masks present a challenge to this process because they can both alter acoustic information and conceal the talker’s mouth. Here, we investigated the degree to which different types of face masks and noise levels affect speech intelligibility and subjective listening effort for young (N = 180) and older (N = 180) adult listeners. We found that in quiet, mask type had little influence on speech intelligibility relative to speech produced without a mask for both young and older adults. However, with the addition of moderate (− 5 dB SNR) and high (− 9 dB SNR) levels of background noise, intelligibility dropped substantially for all types of face masks in both age groups. Across noise levels, transparent face masks and cloth face masks with filters impaired performance the most, and surgical face masks had the smallest influence on intelligibility. Participants also rated speech produced with a face mask as more effortful than unmasked speech, particularly in background noise. Although young and older adults were similarly affected by face masks and noise in terms of intelligibility and subjective listening effort, older adults showed poorer intelligibility overall and rated the speech as more effortful to process relative to young adults. This research will help individuals make more informed decisions about which types of masks to wear in various communicative settings.

A significant number of Temminck's pangolins (Smutsia temminckii) are presented for veterinary care and rehabilitation in southern Africa. Little is known about the physiology and normal health of this species, making diagnosis and medical management difficult. This study aimed to establish reference intervals (RIs) for hematology and plasma clinical chemistry in the Temminck's pangolin. RIs were generated according to international guidelines using samples from 27 healthy free-living (n = 18) and rehabilitated (n = 9) pangolins. Hematology was performed using the Abaxis VetScan HM5 analyzer with manual differentials; clinical chemistry was performed using heparin plasma on the Abaxis VetScan VS2 and Cobas Integra 400 Plus analyzers. Hematology RIs were: RBC 3.88–8.31 × 10(12)/L, HGB 73–150 g/L, HCT 26–51%, MCV 59–72 fL, MCH 15.6–21.4 pg, MCHC 257–325 g/L, RDW 14.3–19.1%, WBC 1.80–10.71 × 10(9)/L. Vetscan VS2 clinical chemistry RIs were: albumin 27–41 g/L, ALP 26–100 U/L, ALT 25–307 U/L, amylase 267–826 U/L, bilirubin 4–10 μmol/L, calcium 2.1–2.2 mmol/L, globulin 21–55 g/L, glucose 3.8–10.0 mmol/L, phosphate 1.3–2.6 mmol/L, potassium 3.6–5.9 mmol/L, sodium 132–140 mmol/L total protein 52–84 g/L, and urea 5.3–11.4 mmol/L. RIs for creatinine were not calculated as analytical imprecision exceeded analytical performance goals. Cobas Integra clinical chemistry RIs were: albumin 22–33 g/L, ALP 20–104 U/L, ALT 17–291 U/L, amylase 466–1,533 U/L, bilirubin 1–14 μmol/L, calcium 2.0–2.4 mmol/L, creatinine <58 μmol/L, globulin 23–49 g/L, glucose 3.6–10.1 mmol/L, phosphate 1.0–2.2 mmol/L, potassium 3.1–5.8 mmol/L, sodium 137–150 mmol/L, total protein 47–72 g/L, and urea 6.0–12.5 mmol/L. There was significant bias between the two chemistry analyzers for several measurands. Differences were found for some analytes between free-living and rehabilitated animals, probably reflecting differences in nutrition and hydration. These are the first RIs generated for Temminck's pangolin.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for streamlined regulatory approval processes—which can be achieved in part through regulatory convergence and cooperation—both to accelerate availability of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics and to maintain the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19. METHODS: The Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF) established the Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) in 2008 to advance regulatory convergence among APEC’s 21 member economies. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed in 2018 to measure convergence. RESULTS: This paper reports survey results collected from KPI tracking in March 2020 from medical product regulatory authorities in all 21 APEC economies concerning areas of regulatory practice in which they could converge and cooperate. For example, from 2008 to 2020, there was a 14.3% increase in the number of APEC member economy regulatory authorities sharing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Certificates and a 28% increase in the number of regulatory authorities accepting multisite licenses in that same period. In addition, this paper explores how APEC economies could realize a maximum level of regulatory convergence and cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: Convergence efforts within APEC can accelerate availability of medical products including that related to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, while maintaining the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. New KPIs and capability building are to be considered to enable a new era of innovation ushered in by COVID-19.","Chong, Sannie Siaw Foong; Kim, Mirinea; Limoli, Michelle; Obscherning, Eric; Wu, Patricia; Feisee, Lila; Nakashima, Nobumasa; Lim, John C.

Eighteen strains of influenza C virus were detected in these samples using a combined tissue culture/RT‐PCR diagnostic method. Most patients with influenza C virus infection (13/18) were infants or young children (<2 years of age). The most frequent symptoms were fever and cough, and the clinical presentation of influenza C virus infection was similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Thirteen of the 18 infected patients were hospitalized; 3 presented with a severe lower respiratory infection. The hemagglutinin‐esterase (HE) gene of 10 isolates was sequenced to determine the lineages of the circulating influenza C viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the isolated strains had an HE gene belonging to the C/Yamagata/26/81‐related lineage. These results show that influenza C virus regularly circulates in Normandy and generally causes a mild upper respiratory infection. Because the differential clinical diagnosis of influenza C virus infection is not always easy, it is important to identify viral strains for both patient management and epidemiological purposes. J.

Quantitation is vital for determining stability or decline of antibody titers in convalescence, efficacy of different vaccination regimens, and detection of asymptomatic infections. Quantitation typically requires two-step ELISA testing, in which samples are first screened in a qualitative assay and positive samples are subsequently analyzed as a dilution series.

However, there have been few scientific reports on the effects of such behavioral restrictions on walking parameters. RESEARCH QUESTION: Did behavioral restrictions during the state of emergency in Japan effect walking parameters in daily life outdoor walking? METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, four walking parameters, namely, the average number of steps taken, walking speed, step length, and cadence, were measured using a smartphone application among 3901 participants (mean age ± standard deviation: 60.3 ± 28.9 years) from March 2 to June 15 in both 2019 and 2020. Repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance was used to compare the walking parameters between the two years. RESULTS: The number of steps significantly decreased (p < .001) in 2020 (∼3400 steps) compared to that in 2019 (∼4400 steps), indicating that the state of emergency greatly affected the amount of physical activity performed per individual. Conversely, walking speed increased (p < .001 during the period when the state of emergency was issued) in 2020 (∼1.25 m/s) compared to that in 2019 (∼1.23 m/s), attributable to an increased step length. SIGNIFICANCE: Although changes in walking speed and step length were small compared to those in the number of steps, those changes were consistently seen during the state of emergency, suggesting that people tried to walk faster in their outdoor walking. Such change in walking behavior may have protected further deterioration of health due to restricted activity.","Obuchi, Shuichi P.; Kawai, Hisashi; Ejiri, Manami; Ito, Kumiko; Murakawa, Kenji",Gait Posture,172,21

METHODS: we retrospectively analyzed the yearly activity of the “Head & Neck Cancer Unit” at the Azienda Ospedali Riuniti Marche Nord (Italy) during 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic) and we compared it with the one performed in 2019. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-square. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed comparing the total number of patients treated for H&N squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 2019 with the ones in 2020. Moreover, no differences were identified in term of cancer stage at the moment of the surgery between 2019 and 2020. On the contrary, a significant reduction in the number of surgical procedures carried out for thyroid (p<0.05) and skin (p<0.001) malignancies was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Despite Covid-19 limitations, our institution was able to preserve the number of major oncologic procedures without negative impact on patients’ care. We believe that the creation of specific COVID-free hospital can be the key preserve quality of care in epidemic emergency.","D'Ascanio, Luca; Latini, Gino; Pandolfini, Manlio; Imperatori, Luca; Di Stadio, Arianna",Oral Oncol,172,22

However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face contacts on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are especially relevant for older people’s mental health. Our analyses rely on an online quota sampling survey conducted in France, Italy and Spain during April 14–24, 2020. We considered the subsample of individuals aged 50 + (N = 4207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyze how changes in intergenerational contacts differed by socioeconomic factors and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in face-to-face contacts. Finally, the change in digital devices’ use has been explored as a consequence of both decreased physical intergenerational contacts (PIC) and increased non-physical intergenerational contacts (NPIC). We found that about 50% of older people have increased their NPIC during the first lockdown. Younger individuals, those with medium level of education, and those economically better off displayed higher probabilities of increased NPIC as compared to their counterparts. NPIC increased especially for individuals whose face-to-face contacts decreased, particularly so if this happened with respect to contacts with children. A large share of older people has increased their use of video calls and instant messages, while only some increased the use of social media. These findings are relevant to understand how intergenerational contacts changed during the pandemic and may be central to better plan future outbreak responses.

METHODS/DESIGN: We are enrolling a hospital-based cohort and a sample of non-ill infants in four countries (Albania, Jordan, Nicaragua, and the Philippines) using a common protocol. We are currently starting year 2 of a 2- to 3-year study and will enroll approximately 3,000 infants hospitalized for any acute illness (respiratory or non-respiratory) during periods of local influenza and/or RSV circulation. After informed consent and within 24 h of admission, we collect blood and respiratory specimens and conduct an interview to assess socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, and symptoms of acute illness (onset ≤10 days). Vital signs, interventions, and medications are documented daily through medical record abstraction. A follow-up health assessment and collection of convalescent blood occurs 3-5 weeks after enrollment. Influenza and RSV infection is confirmed by singleplex real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. Serologic conversion will be assessed comparing acute and convalescent sera using hemagglutination inhibition assay for influenza antibodies and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for RSV. Concurrent with hospital-based enrollment, respiratory specimens are also being collected (and tested by rRT-PCR) from approximately 1,400 non-ill infants aged <1 year during routine medical or preventive care. DISCUSSION: The Influenza and RSV in Infants Study (IRIS) promises to expand our knowledge of the frequency, clinical features, and antibody profiles of serious influenza and RSV disease among infants aged <1 year, quantify the proportion of infections that may be missed by traditional surveillance, and inform decisions about the potential value of existing and new vaccines and other prevention and treatment strategies.","Thompson, Mark G.; Hunt, Danielle R.; Arbaji, Ali K.; Simaku, Artan; Tallo, Veronica L.; Biggs, Holly M.; Kulb, Carolyn; Gordon, Aubree; Khader, Ilham Abu; Bino, Silvia; Lucero, Marilla G.; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Shifflett, Pat; Sanchez, Felix; Marar, Basima I.; Bakalli, Ilirjana; Simões, Eric A.

OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in clinicians’ attitudes about sharing notes with patients. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND MAIN MEASURE: Survey of outpatient primary and specialty care clinicians who were from a large group practice and had one or more patients who accessed notes. The main outcome was percent change (before vs. after implementation) in clinician perception that online visit notes are beneficial overall. KEY RESULTS: Of the 563 invited clinicians, 400 (71%) took the baseline survey; 295 were eligible for a follow-up survey with 192 (65%) responding (119 primary care, 47 medical specialties, 26 surgical specialties). Before implementation, 29% agreed or somewhat agreed that visit notes online are beneficial overall, increasing to 71% following implementation (p<0.001); 44% switched beliefs from bad to good idea; and 2% reported the opposite change (p<0.001). This post-implementation change was observed in all clinician categories. Compared to pre-implementation, fewer clinicians had concerns about office visits taking longer (47% pre vs. 15% post) or requiring more time for questions (71% vs. 16%), or producing notes (57% vs. 28%). Before and after implementation, most clinicians reported being less candid in documentation (65% vs. 52%) and that patients would have more control of their care (72% vs. 78%) and worry more (72% vs. 65%). CONCLUSIONS: Following implementation, more primary and specialty care clinicians agreed that sharing notes with patients online was beneficial overall. Fewer had concerns about more time needed for office visits or documentation. Most thought patients would worry more and reported being less candid in documentation.

Factors affecting accuracy and precision in TPUS motion estimation must be assessed to realise its full potential. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were imaged using volumetric TPUS during the Clarity-Pro trial (NCT02388308). Prostate motion was measured online at patient set-up and offline by experienced observers. Cone beam CT with markers was used as a comparator and observer performance was also quantified. The influence of different clinical factors was examined to establish specific recommendations towards efficacious ultrasound guided radiotherapy. RESULTS: From 330 fractions in 22 patients, offline observer random errors were 1.5 mm, 1.3 mm, 1.9 mm (left–right, superior-inferior, anteroposterior respectively). Errors increased in fractions exhibiting poor image quality to 3.3 mm, 3.3 mm and 6.8 mm. Poor image quality was associated with inconsistent probe placement, large anatomical changes and unfavourable imaging conditions within the patient. Online matching exhibited increased observer errors of: 3.2 mm, 2.9 mm and 4.7 mm. Four patients exhibited large systematic residual errors, of which three had poor quality images. Patient habitus showed no correlation with observer error, residual error, or image quality. CONCLUSIONS: TPUS offers the unique potential to directly assess inter- and intra-fraction motion on conventional linacs. Inconsistent image quality, inexperienced operators and the pressures of the clinical environment may degrade precision and accuracy. Experienced operators are essential and cross-centre standards for training and QA should be established that build upon current guidance. Greater use of automation technologies may further minimise uncertainties.","Grimwood, Alexander; Thomas, Karen; Kember, Sally; Aldis, Georgina; Lawes, Rebekah; Brigden, Beverley; Francis, Jane; Henegan, Emer; Kerner, Melanie; Delacroix, Louise; Gordon, Alexandra; Tree, Alison; Harris, Emma J.; McNair, Helen A.",Phys Imaging Radiat Oncol,172,24

Our objective is to investigate the importance of an exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why the COVID-19 outbreak has exploded. To that end, our goal is to document EGPB in the comprehension of disease data, study how it evolves as the epidemic progresses, and connect it with compliance of personal safety guidelines such as the use of face coverings and social distancing. We also investigate whether a behavioral nudge, cost less to implement, can significantly reduce EGPB. RATIONALE: The scientific basis for our inquiry is the received wisdom that infectious disease spread, especially in the initial stages, follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. If people suffer from EGPB, they will likely make incorrect judgments about their infection risk, which in turn, may lead to reduced compliance of safety protocols. METHOD: To collect data on prediction bias, we ran an incentivized, experiment on a global, online platform with participation from people in forty-three countries, each at different stages of progression of COVID-19. We also constructed several indices of compliance by surveying participants about their frequency of hand-washing and use of sanitizers and masks; their willingness to pay for masks; their view about the social appropriateness of others’ behavior; and their like/dislike of government responses. The prediction data was used to construct several measures of EGPB. Our experimental design permits us to identify the root of under-prediction as EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate the speed at which exponential processes unfold. RESULTS: Respondents make predictions about the path of the disease using a model that is substantially less convex than the actual data generating process. This creates significant EGPB, which, in turn, is significantly and negatively associated with non-compliance with safety measures. The bias is significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative to those at an early stage of disease progression. A simple behavioral nudge that shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. CONCLUSION: Behavioral biases concerning the comprehension of disease data are quantitatively important, and act as severe impediments to effective policy action against the spread of COVID-19. Clear communication of future infection risk via raw numbers could increase the accuracy of risk perception, in turn, facilitating compliance with suggested protective behaviors.","Banerjee, Ritwik; Bhattacharya, Joydeep; Majumdar, Priyama",Soc Sci Med,172,20

To overcome this drawback, this article presents the development of an interactive virtual reality (VR)-based framework that allows one to simulate the execution of rehabilitation tasks and robotic assistance through a robotic standing wheelchair. The virtual environment developed considers the kinematic and dynamic model of the standing human–wheelchair system with a displaced center of mass, since it can be displaced for different reasons, e.g.,: bad posture, limb amputations, obesity, etc. The standing wheelchair autonomous control scheme has been implemented through the Full Simulation (FS) and Hardware in the Loop (HIL) techniques.

For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2+) and PT at low concentrations (2 µM Zn(2+) and 2 µM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture. The RNA synthesis of these two distantly related nidoviruses is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the core enzyme of their multiprotein replication and transcription complex (RTC). Using an activity assay for RTCs isolated from cells infected with SARS-CoV or EAV—thus eliminating the need for PT to transport Zn(2+) across the plasma membrane—we show that Zn(2+) efficiently inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of the RTCs of both viruses. Enzymatic studies using recombinant RdRps (SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9) purified from E. coli subsequently revealed that Zn(2+) directly inhibited the in vitro activity of both nidovirus polymerases. More specifically, Zn(2+) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2+) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.","te Velthuis, Aartjan J.

We explore mathematical models of predator-prey systems, in order to assess whether dormancy can be an effective adaptive strategy to outcompete perennially active (PA) prey, even when both forms of the dormitive prey (active and dormant) are individually disadvantaged. RESULTS: We develop a dynamic population model by introducing an additional dormitive prey population to the existing predator-prey model which can be active (active form) and enter dormancy (dormant form). In this model, both forms of the dormitive prey are individually at a disadvantage compared to the PA prey and thus would go extinct due to their low growth rate, energy waste on the production of dormant prey, and the inability of the latter to grow autonomously. However, the dormitive prey can paradoxically outcompete the PA prey with superior traits and even cause its extinction by alternating between the two losing strategies. We observed higher fitness of the dormitive prey in rich environments because a large predator population in a rich environment cannot be supported by the prey without adopting an evasive strategy, that is, dormancy. In such environments, populations experience large-scale fluctuations, which can be survived by dormitive but not by PA prey. CONCLUSION: We show that dormancy can be an effective adaptive strategy to outcompete superior prey, recapitulating the game-theoretic Parrondo’s paradox, where two losing strategies combine to achieve a winning outcome. We suggest that the species with the ability to switch between the active and dormant forms can dominate communities via competitive exclusion.","Wen, Tao; Koonin, Eugene V.; Cheong, Kang Hao",BMC Biol,172,29

As evident during the 2003 global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it is important to provide support for health care workers (HCWs) who are vulnerable during infectious outbreak scenarios. Here we focus on the identification and evaluation of existing support mechanisms incorporated within emergency plans across various jurisdictional levels. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis of 12 emergency plans from national, provincial and municipal levels were conducted using NVIVOTM software. The plans were scanned and coded according to 1) informational, 2) instrumental, and 3) emotional support mechanisms for HCWs and other first responders. RESULTS: Emergency plans were comprised of a predominance of informational and instrumental supports, yet few emotional or social support mechanisms. All the plans lacked gender-based analysis of how infectious disease outbreaks impact male and female HCWs differently. Acknowledgement of the need for emotional supports was evident at higher jurisdictional levels, but recommended for implementation locally.

Social deprivation and stress have a negative impact on atopic eczema symptoms, and social change in recent decades has led to a “westernized” lifestyle associated with high prevalence of atopic eczema in industrialized countries. Urbanization leads to an increase in air pollution and a decrease in biodiversity, which negatively affects atopic eczema. Climate change alters the allergenicity of pollen, which increases atopic eczema symptoms in some patients during the pollen season. Protective natural and social factors for the prevention of atopic eczema and for the promotion of “climate resilience” should be given greater consideration in future research.","Luschkova, Daria; Zeiser, Katharina; Ludwig, Alika; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia",Allergol Select,172,30

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. METHODS: We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R(0)] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R(0) value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. FINDINGS: For the baseline scenario, when R(0) was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000–320 000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5–8·5) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000–776 000) when R(0) was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8–20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000–1 249 000) when R(0) was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9–33·1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6–99·9) when R(0) was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5–99·7) when R(0) was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 −94·4) when R(0) was 2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R(0) of 1·5. INTERPRETATION: Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

Mechanosensitive in nature, the endothelium responds to the magnitude and temporal waveform of shear stress in the vessels. Endothelial dysfunction can lead to atherosclerosis and other diseases. Modeling endothelial function and dysfunction in organ systems in vitro, such as the blood–brain barrier and tissue-engineered blood vessels, requires sourcing endothelial cells (ECs) for these biomedical engineering applications. It can be difficult to source primary, easily renewable ECs that possess the function or dysfunction in question. In contrast, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be sourced from donors of interest and renewed almost indefinitely. In this review, we highlight how knowledge of vascular EC development in vivo is used to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into ECs. We then describe how iPSC-derived ECs are being used currently in in vitro models of organ function and disease and in vivo applications.","Kennedy, Crystal C.; Brown, Erin E.; Abutaleb, Nadia O.; Truskey, George A.",Front Cardiovasc Med,172,30

Previous studies have determined that CD8(+) T lymphocytes are required to restrict acute, productive MCMV infection within the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigated the contribution of humoral immune responses in control of MCMV brain infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Utilizing our MCMV brain infection model, we investigated B-lymphocyte-lineage cells and assessed their role in controlling the recovery of reactivated virus from latently infected brain tissue. Brain infiltrating leukocytes were first phenotyped using markers indicative of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells. Results obtained during these studies showed a steady increase in the recruitment of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells into the brain throughout the time-course of viral infection. Further, MCMV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) were detected within the infiltrating leukocyte population using an ELISPOT assay. Immunohistochemical studies of brain sections revealed co-localization of CD138(+) cells with either IgG or IgM. Additional immunohistochemical staining for MCMV early antigen 1 (E1, m112–113), a reported marker of viral latency in neurons, confirmed its expression in the brain during latent infection. Finally, using B-cell deficient (Jh(−/−)) mice we demonstrated that B-lymphocytes control recovery of reactivated virus from latently-infected brain tissue. A significantly higher rate of reactivated virus was recovered from the brains of Jh(−/−) mice when compared to Wt animals. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that MCMV infection triggers accumulation and persistence of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells within the brain, which produce antibodies and play a significant role in controlling reactivated virus.","Mutnal, Manohar B.; Hu, Shuxian; Lokensgard, James R.",PLoS One,172,16

It is therefore important to characterise the initiation and persistence of adaptive immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 amidst the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: Here, we conducted a longitudinal study on hospitalised moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients from the acute phase of disease into convalescence at 5 and 9 months post‐symptom onset. Utilising flow cytometry, serological assays as well as B cell and T cell FluoroSpot assays, we assessed the magnitude and specificity of humoral and cellular immune responses during and after human SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. RESULTS: During acute COVID‐19, we observed an increase in germinal centre activity, a substantial expansion of antibody‐secreting cells and the generation of SARS‐CoV‐2‐neutralising antibodies. Despite gradually decreasing antibody levels, we show persistent, neutralising antibody titres as well as robust specific memory B cell responses and polyfunctional T cell responses at 5 and 9 months after symptom onset in both moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings describe the initiation and, importantly, persistence of cellular and humoral SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific immunological memory in hospitalised COVID‐19 patients long after recovery, likely contributing towards protection against reinfection.","Sandberg, John Tyler; Varnaitė, Renata; Christ, Wanda; Chen, Puran; Muvva, Jagadeeswara R; Maleki, Kimia T; García, Marina; Dzidic, Majda; Folkesson, Elin; Skagerberg, Magdalena; Ahlén, Gustaf; Frelin, Lars; Sällberg, Matti; Eriksson, Lars I; Rooyackers, Olav; Sönnerborg, Anders; Buggert, Marcus; Björkström, Niklas K; Aleman, Soo; Strålin, Kristoffer; Klingström, Jonas; Ljunggren, Hans‐Gustaf; Blom, Kim; Gredmark‐Russ, Sara",Clin Transl Immunology,172,1

CCFs are commonly treated via endovascular embolization, which theoretically restores physiological pressure differentials. OBJECTIVE: To present our institutional data with CCF treated with embolization and discuss endovascular routes, recurrence rates, and dynamic IOP changes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 42 CCF patients who underwent Onyx (Covidien, Irvine, California) embolization and pre- and postoperative IOP measurement at a single institution. RESULTS: CCFs were 19.0% direct (type A) and 81.0% indirect (types B, C, or D). Onyx-18 liquid embolisate was used during all embolizations. Overall rate of total occlusion was 83.3% and was statistically similar between direct and indirect fistulas. Preoperative IOP was elevated in 37.5%, 100.0%, 75.0%, and 50% in type A, B, C, and D fistulas, respectively. Average ΔIOP was -7.3 ± 8.5 mmHg (range: -33 to +8). Follow-up time was 4.64 ± 7.62 mo. Full angiographic occlusion was a predictor of symptom resolution at 1 mo (P = .026) and 6 mo (P = .021). Partial occlusion was associated with persistent symptoms postoperatively at 1 mo (P = .038) and 6 mo follow-up (P = .012). Beyond 6 mo, negative ΔIOP was associated with continued symptom improvement. Recurrence occurred in 9.5% of patients, all of which were indirect CCFs. CONCLUSION: Onyx embolization of CCF is an effective treatment for CCF and often results in the reversal of IOP elevation. Full occlusion predicts favorable clinical outcomes up to 6 mo. Postoperative IOP reduction may indicate favorable long-term clinical outcomes.","Al Saiegh, Fadi; Baldassari, Michael P; Sweid, Ahmad; Bilyk, Jurij; Mouchtouris, Nikolaos; Hafazalla, Karim; Abendroth, Michael; Velagapudi, Lohit; Khanna, Omaditya; Chalouhi, Nohra; Sajja, Kalyan; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Gooch, M Reid; Rosenwasser, Robert; Jabbour, Pascal",Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown),172,20

PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the role of miR-26a-5p-neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF/REST), Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) pathway in the protection mechanism of MT against CIRI in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were induced with ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in vivo model; PC12 cells were induced with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in vitro model; and MT intervention was conducted before the model was established. The effect of MT on autophagy factors (LC3II/LC3I, P62), inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10) and oxidative stress indexes (MDA, GSHPx, SOD) was explored, and then the above three indexes were determined by real-time quantitative PCR, ELISA, and detection kit corresponding to oxidative stress indexes. The neuroprotective effect of MT pretreatment on brain IR injury was evaluated by neurological deficit scores and TUNEL method. The levels of miR-26a-5p and NRSF were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot, and the interaction between them was evaluated by dual luciferase report. The role of JAK2-STAT3 pathway in MT protection mechanism was verified by pathway blocker (AG490) and Western blot. RESULTS: MT pretreatment can significantly reduce neurological deficit score and neuronal apoptosis, inhibit CIRI autophagy, inflammation and oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro, reduce LC3II/LC3I, TNF-α, IL-6, MDA and increase P62, IL-10, GSHPx, SOD. Further analysis identifies that downregulating miR-26a-5p or upregulating NRSF can eliminate the protective effect of MT, and NRSF is the direct target of miR-26a-5p. The protective effect of MT can also be eliminated under AG490 intervention. CONCLUSION: MT plays a protective role by regulating miR-26a-5p-NRSF and JAK2-STAT3 pathway to improve CIRI autophagy, inflammation and oxidative stress.","Yang, Bo; Zang, Li-E; Cui, Jing-Wen; Zhang, Ming-Yuan; Ma, Xue; Wei, Lin-Lin",Drug Des Devel Ther,172,12

This is a challenge because there are dozens of bacterial and viral species that might be used in a biological attack and many have closely related near-neighbor organisms that are harmless. The biothreat agent, along with its near neighbors, can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or a biocluster for short. The ability to comprehensively detect the important biothreat clusters with resolution sufficient to distinguish the near neighbors with an extremely low false positive rate is required. A technological solution to this problem can be achieved by coupling biothreat group-specific PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The biothreat assay described here detects ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters on the NIAID priority pathogen and HHS/USDA select agent lists. Detection of each of the biothreat clusters was validated by analysis of a broad collection of biothreat organisms and near neighbors prepared by spiking biothreat nucleic acids into nucleic acids extracted from filtered environmental air. Analytical experiments were carried out to determine breadth of coverage, limits of detection, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. Further, the assay breadth was demonstrated by testing a diverse collection of organisms from each biothreat cluster. The biothreat assay as configured was able to detect all the target organism clusters and did not misidentify any of the near-neighbor organisms as threats. Coupling biothreat cluster-specific PCR to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry simultaneously provides the breadth of coverage, discrimination of near neighbors, and an extremely low false positive rate due to the requirement that an amplicon with a precise base composition of a biothreat agent be detected by mass spectrometry.","Sampath, Rangarajan; Mulholland, Niveen; Blyn, Lawrence B.; Massire, Christian; Whitehouse, Chris A.; Waybright, Nicole; Harter, Courtney; Bogan, Joseph; Miranda, Mary Sue; Smith, David; Baldwin, Carson; Wolcott, Mark; Norwood, David; Kreft, Rachael; Frinder, Mark; Lovari, Robert; Yasuda, Irene; Matthews, Heather; Toleno, Donna; Housley, Roberta; Duncan, David; Li, Feng; Warren, Robin; Eshoo, Mark W.; Hall, Thomas A.; Hofstadler, Steven A.; Ecker, David J.",PLoS One,172,29

A G-CSF treatment used in neutropenic cancer with SARS-CoV-2 infections is related to a higher rate of respiratory failure according to progressive and growing evidence. In this small retrospective non-randomized study, we found an association between G-CSF treatment and the parameters predisposing for worse infections with COVID-19 and neutropenia compared with patients not treated with G-CSF. We also found that the number of days on G-CSF treatment was related to a higher risk of mortality in a multivariable analysis among patients treated with G-CSF. ABSTRACT: Background: Approximately 15% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 develop a distress syndrome secondary to a host hyperinflammatory response induced by a cytokine storm. Myelosuppression is associated with a higher risk of infections and mortality. There are data to support methods of management for neutropenia and COVID-19. We present a multicenter experience during the first COVID-19 outbreak in neutropenic cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Clinical retrospective data were collected from neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities, tumor type, stage, treatment, neutropenia severity, G-CSF, COVID-19 parameters, and mortality were analyzed. A bivariate analysis of the impact on mortality was carried out. Additionally, we performed a multivariable logistic regression to predict respiratory failure and death. Results: Among the 943 cancer patients screened, 83 patients (11.3%) simultaneously had neutropenia and an infection with COVID-19. The lungs (26%) and breasts (22%) were the primary locations affected, and most patients had advanced disease (67%). In the logistic model, as adjusted covariates, sex, age, treatment (palliative vs. curative), tumor type, and the lowest level of neutrophils were used. A significant effect was obtained for the number of days of G-CSF treatment (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1,1,03,92], p-value = 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a prolonged G-CSF treatment could be disadvantageous for these cancer patients with infections by COVID-19, with a higher probability of worse outcome.","Sereno, María; Jimenez-Gordo, Ana María; Baena-Espinar, Javier; Aguado, Carlos; Mielgo, Xabier; Pertejo, Ana; Álvarez-Álvarez, Rosa; Sánchez, Ana; López, Jose Luis; Molina, Raquel; López-Alfonso, Ana; Hernández, Berta; Chiara, Luis Enrique; Martín, Ana Manuela; López-Martín, Ana; Dorta, Miriam; Collazo-Lorduy, Ana; Casado, Enrique; de Molina, Ana Ramirez; Colmenarejo, Gonzalo",Cancers (Basel),172,1

In the present study, we established a novel simultaneous detection system using TaqMan real-time PCR designed as a system for detection of microbes from bovine diarrhea using real-time PCR (referred to as Dembo-PCR). Dembo-PCR simultaneously detects a total of 19 diarrhea-causing pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Specific primer–probe sets were newly designed for 7 pathogens and were synthesized on the basis of previous reports for 12 pathogens. Assays were optimized to react under the same reaction conditions. The PCR efficiency and correlation coefficient (R(2)) of standard curves for each assay were more than 80% and 0.9766, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of Dembo-PCR in fecal sample analysis was measured with feces spiked with target pathogens or synthesized DNA that included specific nucleotide target regions. The resulting limits of detection (LOD) for virus-spiked samples, bacteria and DNA fragments were 0.16–1.6 TCID(50) (PFU/reaction), 1.3–13 CFU/reaction and 10–100 copies/reaction, respectively. All reactions showed high sensitivity in pathogen detection. A total of 8 fecal samples, collected from 6 diarrheic cattle, 1 diarrheic calf and 1 healthy cow, were tested using Dembo-PCR to validate the assay’s clinical performance.

This paper aims to verify the theory of GDBP-IE and reveals the mechanism of GDBP-IE in the Chinese context. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method was used to analyze valid samples of Chinese industrial enterprises (N = 615). The empirical conclusions are as follows. (1) Corporate tangible resources, corporate intangible resources (CIR), market environment, public supervision and policy and institutional environment (PIE) have a significant positive effect on GDB (i.e., green supply chain management practice and clean production behavior). (2) Compared with other factors, the positive effect of CIR on GDB is the strongest. (3) The level of positive effect of PIE on GDB is not as significant as other factors. (4) GDB has a significant positive effect on green development performance (i.e., corporate social performance, corporate financial performance and corporate environmental performance). This paper provides effective evidence for researchers to use other methods to further verify the theory of GDBP-IE in the Chinese context.

Even low levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in khat could induce public health concern. In a market-based study, from five popular khat varieties, a total of 35 composite khat samples were analyzed for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its main transformation products, and four hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers. Extraction was carried out by quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method (QuEChERS). OCP concentrations were determined by head space solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME–GC–MS). Every sample contained β-HCH above the maximum residue limit set by the European Commission. For total DDT, this was the case for 25.7% of the samples. The ratios of (p,p′-DDD + p,p′-DDE) to p,p′-DDT were less than one for 85% of khat samples, demonstrating recent use of DDT in khat farmlands. Conversely, the ratio of β-HCH to total HCH varied from 0.56 to 0.96, implying historical input of technical HCH. Assuming a daily chewable portion of 100 g, dietary intakes of p,p′-DDT, total DDT and total HCH by adults ranged from 3.12 to 57.9, 6.49 to 80.2 and 39.2 to 51.9 ng (kg body weight)(−1) day(−1), respectively. These levels are below acceptable levels suggested by international organizations. Chewing khat showed lower non-cancer health risk, but showed relatively higher cancer risk in terms of OCPs.

This has caused some centers to modify existing CPR procedures, limit the duration of CPR or consider avoiding CPR altogether. In this review, we propose a procedure for CPR in the ICU that minimizes the number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the patient and conserves the use of scarce personal protection equipment (PPE). Highlighting the low likelihood of successful resuscitation in high risk patients may prompt them to decline CPR. We recommend the preemptive placement of central venous lines in high risk patients with intravenous tubing extensions that allow medication delivery from outside the patients’ rooms. During CPR, this practice can be used to deliver critical medications without delay. The use of a mechanical compression system for CPR further reduces the risk of infectious exposure to health care providers. ECMO should be reserved for patients with few comorbidities and a single failing organ system. Reliable teleconferencing tools are essential to facilitate communication between providers inside and outside of the patient's room. General principles regarding the ethics and peri-resuscitative management of COVID-19 patients are also discussed.","Cheruku, Sreekanth; Dave, Siddharth; Goff, Kristina; Park, Caroline; Ebeling, Callie; Cohen, Leah; Styrvoky, Kim; Choi, Christopher; Anand, Vikram; Kershaw, Corey",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,172,23

Genetic variants which influence behavioural or immune responses to pathogens, selected for by pathogen pressure, may influence this variability. Two relevant polymorphisms in this context are the s allele of the serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) and the G allele of the interleukin-6 gene (IL-6 rs1800795). Methods: The frequencies of the 5-HTTLPR s allele and IL-6 rs1800795 G allele were obtained from published data. The correlations between these allele frequencies and the prevalence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were examined across 44 nations. Results: The IL-6 rs1800795 G allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence ({rho} = -0.466, p < 0.01) and mortality ({rho} = -0.591, p<0.001) across nations. The 5-HTTLPR s allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality rates ({rho} = -0.437, p = 0.023). Conclusions: These results suggest that a significant relationship exists between genetic variants that influence behavioural and immune responses to pathogens and indices of the impact of COVID-19 across nations. Further investigation of these variants and their correlates may permit the development of better preventive or therapeutic strategies in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rajkumar, R.

Three new political spaces offer opportunities to take the global health agenda a significant step forward: the emerging new development paradigm, the post-2015 debates at the United Nations and the dynamics created through the increasing trans-border health challenges the World Health Organization (WHO) must deal with under conditions of globalization. Presently there are concerns whether the major initiatives that have boosted global health in the last 20 years will continue to grow and attract sufficient funding. But the more pertinent question is whether they are still suited to address the major concerns global health faces between now and 2030. In addition many of the global health challenges can only be addressed through actions in sectors other than health and by facing the inherently political nature of health as well as strong opposition from parts of the private sector. A well-financed and rules based governance system — adapted to complex multilateralism — is needed to manage, complement and integrate the many issue-based initiatives. The next era of global health will be judged by its political capacity to ensure global health security, build universal health coverage, address the commercial determinants of non-communicable diseases and reduce global health inequalities. This will require a focus on producing global public goods for health (GPGH) through strong international organizations, in particular the WHO, supported by governments who have the political will and the institutional capacity to practice smart sovereignty, reach beyond the heath sector and engage with non-state actors.","Kickbusch, Ilona",Public Health Rev,172,26

Current methods that permit the assembly of DNA circuits in mammalian cells are laborious, slow, expensive and mostly not permissive of rapid prototyping of constructs. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be easily mixed and matched to combinatorially assemble one transcriptional unit with different characteristics, or a hierarchy of transcriptional units weaved into complex circuits. MTK renders many cell engineering operations facile, as showcased by our ability to use the toolkit to generate single-integration landing pads, to create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and to iterate through Cas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we used the MTK to successfully design and rapidly construct in mammalian cells a challenging multicistronic circuit encoding the Ebola virus (EBOV) replication complex. This construct provides a non-infectious biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cellular assay for exploring the transcription and replication steps of the EBOV viral life cycle in its host. Its construction also demonstrates how the MTK can enable important and time sensitive applications such as the rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging BSL4 viruses that pose a major threat to human health.","Fonseca, João Pedro; Bonny, Alain R.; Kumar, G.

This collaborative model of care aims to address barriers in youth service access by designing services that meet the needs of youth and caregivers. However, heterogeneity across models requires a better understanding of the preferences for key service characteristics. METHOD: A discrete choice experiment was conducted among 274 caregivers of youth aged 14–29 years with mental health challenges. The experiment consisted of 12 attributes with four levels each, representing different service components; additional measures were collected, including demographics and burden assessments. Utility values were calculated, representing the degree of preference for a given level of an attribute. Latent class analysis was conducted to understand subgroups with different service preferences, identifying three latent classes with differing IYSH service preferences. RESULTS: The largest class (n = 173, 63.1%), entitled ‘Comprehensive, Integrative Service Access’, strongly valued practical aspects of service design, such as rapid access and support for a wide range of needs. The ‘Service Process Features’ class (n = 67, 24.5%) expressed a relative prioritization of process features of service access, while the smaller ‘Caregiver Involvement’ (n = 34, 12.4%) class most highly prioritized caregiver involvement in their youths’ services. Similar demographic characteristics and caregiver burden were found across classes, although participants in the Caregiver Involvement latent class were supporting younger youth. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers have diverse youth service preferences and relative priorities that should be taken into account when designing services. System designers and service providers are encouraged to take caregivers’ preferences and priorities into account, alongside youth priorities, whether designing service delivery models or an individual service plan for a youth.

We determined that SRp20 does not co-localize with TIA-1, however, under conditions of oxidative stress, indicating that the close association of these two proteins during poliovirus infection is not representative of a general response to cellular stress. We confirmed that the expression of a dominant negative version of TIA-1 (TIA-1-PRD) results in the dissociation of stress granules. Finally, we demonstrated that expression of wild type TIA-1 or dominant negative TIA-1-PRD in cells during poliovirus infection does not dramatically affect viral translation. Taken together, these studies provide a new example of the unique cytoplasmic foci that form during poliovirus infection.","Fitzgerald, Kerry D.; Semler, Bert L.",Virus Research,172,1

Although the respiratory tract is the primary portal of entry of SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal involvement associated with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may also occur. No drug or vaccine has been approved due to the absence of evidence deriving from rigorous clinical trials. Increasing interest has been highlighted on the possible preventative role and adjunct treatment of lactoferrin, glycoprotein of human secretions part of a non-specific defensive system, known to play a crucial role against microbial and viral infections and exerting anti-inflammatory effects on different mucosal surfaces and able to regulate iron metabolism. In this review, analysing lactoferrin properties, we propose designing a clinical trial to evaluate and verify its effect using a dual combination treatment with local, solubilized intranasal spray formulation and oral administration. Lactoferrin could counteract the coronavirus infection and inflammation, acting either as natural barrier of both respiratory and intestinal mucosa or reverting the iron disorders related to the viral colonization.","Campione, Elena; Cosio, Terenzio; Rosa, Luigi; Lanna, Caterina; Di Girolamo, Stefano; Gaziano, Roberta; Valenti, Piera; Bianchi, Luca",Int J Mol Sci,172,6

METHODS: Retrospective, multicentre analysis of radiological examinations requested, via our teleradiology network, from 2017 to 2020 during two timeframes (calendar weeks 5–8 and then 12–15). We included CT scans or MRIs performed for strokes, multiple traumas (Body-CT), cranial traumas (CTr) and acute non-traumatic abdominal pain (ANTAP). We evaluated the number and percentages of examinations performed, of those with a pathological conclusion, and of examinations involving the chest. RESULTS: Our study included 25 centres in 2017, 29 in 2018, 43 in 2019 and 59 in 2020. From 2017 to 2019, the percentages of examinations were constant, which was also true for chest CTs. Each centre’s number of examinations, gender distribution and patient ages were unchanged. In 2020, examinations significantly decreased: suspected strokes decreased by 36% (1052 vs 675, p < 0.001), Body-CT by 62% (349 vs 134, p < 0.001), CTr by 52% (1853 vs 895, p < 0.001) and for ANTAP, appendicitis decreased by 38% (45 vs 90, not statistically significant (NS)) sigmoiditis by 44% (98 vs 55, NS), and renal colic by 23% (376 vs 288, NS). The number of examinations per centre decreased by 13% (185.5 vs 162.5, p < 0.001), whereas the number of examinations of the ""chest"" region increased by 170% (1205 vs 3766, p < 0.001).

Worldwide, this pandemic had a huge impact on the mental health of people in many countries causing similar reaction in terms of emotions and concerns at the population level. Our study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of Italian university students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the period immediately after the first lockdown through the administration of a questionnaire on the personal websites of students attending their undergraduate courses at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. We used the Patient-Health-Engagement-Scale, Self-Rating-Anxiety-Scale, and Self-Rating-Depression-Scale to assess engagement, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms of our sample. RESULTS: The sample size was 501 subjects, of which 35.33% were classified as anxious and 72.93% as depressed. Over 90% of respondents had good understanding of the preventive measures despite over 70% suffered from the impossibility of physically seeing friends and partners. Around 55% of students would have been willing to contribute much more to face the pandemic. An increase in the occurrences of anxiety was associated with being female, being student of the Rome campus, suffering from the impossibility of attending university, being distant from colleagues, and being unable of physically seeing one’s partner. Performing physical activity reduced this likelihood. CONCLUSION: University students are at risk of psychological distress in the case of traumatic events. The evolution of the pandemic is uncertain and may have long-term effects on mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to study the most effective interventions to identify vulnerable subgroups and to plan for acute and long-term psychological services to control and reduce the burden of psychological problems.

OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe the utilization of telehealth services provided by Doctor On Demand, Inc., a well-known telehealth company in the United States, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explore how the number of virtual visits, reasons for visits, and patients served changed over time. METHODS: We reported data as a percentage change from the baseline week during 2 distinct time periods: February-June 2019 and February-June 2020 based on 4 categories of visits: respiratory illness, unscheduled behavioral health, scheduled behavioral health, and chronic illness. RESULTS: In 2020, the total visit volume increased considerably from March through April 7, 2020 (59% above the baseline) and then declined through the week of June 2 (15% above the baseline). Visits for respiratory illnesses increased through the week of March 24 (30% above the baseline) and then steadily declined through the week of June 2 (65% below the baseline). Higher relative increases were observed for unscheduled behavioral health and chronic illness visits through April (109% and 131% above the baseline, respectively) before a decline through the week of June 2 (69% and 37% above the baseline, respectively). Increases in visit volume among rural residents were slightly higher than those among urban residents (peak at 64% vs 58% above the baseline, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although this telehealth service provider observed a substantial increase in the volume of visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is interesting to note that this growth was not fueled by COVID-19 concerns but by visits for behavioral health and chronic illness. Telehealth services may play a role as a “safety valve” for patients who have difficulty accessing care during a public health emergency.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Thompson, James; Taylor, Prentiss; Dean, Kristin; Yuan, Tony; Tong, Ian; Mehrotra, Ateev",J Med Internet Res,172,16

Disinfection guidelines specify that drinking water with turbidity ≥1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) is not suitable for disinfection and therefore not fit for purpose. Treated wastewater typically has higher concentrations of particles (1–10 NTU for secondary treated effluent). Two processes widely used for disinfecting wastewater are chlorination and ultraviolet radiation. In both cases, particles in wastewater can interfere with disinfection and can significantly increase treatment costs by increasing operational expenditure (chemical demand, power consumption) or infrastructure costs by requiring additional treatment processes to achieve the required levels of pathogen inactivation. Many microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, protozoans) associate with particles, which can allow them to survive disinfection processes and cause a health hazard. Improved understanding of this association will enable development of cost-effective treatment, which will become increasingly important as indirect and direct potable reuse of wastewater becomes more widespread in both developed and developing countries. This review provides an overview of wastewater and associated treatment processes, the pathogens in wastewater, the nature of particles in wastewater and how they interact with pathogens, and how particles can impact disinfection processes.","Chahal, C.; van den Akker, B.; Young, F.; Franco, C.; Blackbeard, J.; Monis, P.",Adv Appl Microbiol,172,1

METHOD: Relevant literature was obtained from the Scopus database for the period from 2001–2020. Examples of keywords used in the query included “college student”, “university student”, and undergraduate student” combined with keywords such as wellbeing, wellness, suicide, and anxiety. No language restriction was used. Only research articles were considered. The search query was validated. Bibliometric indicators and mappings such as active countries, institutions, authors, highly cited documents, and the most frequently encountered topics were identified and discussed to shed light on research gaps in the Arab region. Research gaps were also identified. The analysis was carried out on February 12, 2021. RESULTS: The search query returned 309 research articles published by authors from 17 different Arab countries. Less than one-third (n = 97, 31.4%) of the retrieved articles were carried out in collaboration with authors from 39 non-Arab countries, mainly from the United Kingdom and the United States. The overall contribution of researchers from the Arab region to global research in the field was 5.6%. In total, 1212 authors from 791 different institutions participated in publishing the retrieved research articles. At the country level, Saudi Arabia (n = 125, 40.5%) ranked first, followed by Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon. At the institutional level, The University of Jordan (n = 25, 8.1%) ranked first, followed by King Saud University, and Kuwait University.

RESEARCH AIMS (1) To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobins are found in human milk after vaccination, and (2) to characterize the time course and types of immunoglobulins present. METHODS A longitudinal cohort study of lactating women (N = 7) who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 2020 and January 2021 provided milk samples.

The current research aims to explore the association between economic complexity, human capital, renewable energy generation, urbanization, economic growth, export quality, trade and ecological footprint for the top ten economic complex countries. This study applied panel data estimators, for instance, fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and the system-GMM long-run estimators from 1980 to 2017. The long-run estimates reveal that economic complexity, economic growth, export quality, trade and urbanization increase ecological footprint.

METHODS: In this paper, we report a survey on the adoption of the recommended protective behaviours before and during the epidemic. We also assessed demographic correlates, and beliefs (towards COVID‐19 and protective behaviours, towards SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission, social dilemma variables, and perceived external cues) of a representative sample of British residents. Data were collected during the early stage of the COVID‐19 epidemic that spread worldwide in 2020. RESULTS: Results showed a marked increase in the adoption of protective behaviour. We also identified targets for intervention in variables related to transmission of the virus and social dilemma‐related beliefs. Sex differences in the adoption of protective measures, as well as differences associated with the frequency of social contacts, were associated with differences in beliefs.

Here, we review the roles of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of various enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria and protozoa, which infect the epithelial lining of the human and animal intestine. At host cell entry, enteric viruses, including norovirus, recognize mainly histo-blood group antigens. At the initial step of bacterial infections, carbohydrates also function as receptors for attachment. Here, we describe the function of carbohydrates in infection by Salmonella enterica and several bacterial species that produce a variety of fimbrial adhesions. During invasion by enteropathogenic protozoa, apicomplexan parasites utilize sialic acids or sulfated glycans. Carbohydrates serve as receptors for infection by these microbes; however, their usage of carbohydrates varies depending on the microbe. On the surface of the mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, various carbohydrate moieties are present and play a crucial role in infection, representing the site of infection or route of access for most microbes. During the infection and/or invasion process of the microbes, carbohydrates function as receptors for various microbes, but they can also function as a barrier to infection. One approach to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents is to modify the drug structure. Another approach is to modify the mode of inhibition of infection depending on the individual pathogen by using and mimicking the interactions with carbohydrates. In addition, similarities in mode of infection may also be utilized. Our findings will be useful in the development of new drugs for the treatment of enteric pathogens.","Kato, Kentaro; Ishiwa, Akiko",Trop Med Health,172,20

Docking results indicated that the nsp16/nsp10 complex has the best binding affinities where the strongest binding was detected with apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, prunin and acaciin with −9.4, −9.3 and −9.3 kcal/mol binding energy, respectively, compared to the control (SAM) with −8.2 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the stability of these complexes was studied using molecular dynamics of 150 ns, which were then compared to their complexes in the other three targets. MM-PBSA calculations suggested the high stability of acaciin-nsp16 complex with binding energy of −110 kJ/mol. This study sheds light on the structure-based design of natural flavonoids as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs targeting the nsp16/10 complex. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

No data exist regarding its impact on PM(2.5) pollution. We aimed to assess PM(2.5) levels before, during, and after lockdown (7 March 2020–16 May 2020) in Volos, one of Greece’s most polluted industrialized cities, and compare PM(2.5) levels with those obtained during the same period last year. Meteorological conditions were examined as confounders. Methods: The study period was discriminated into three phases (pre-lockdown: 7 March–9 March, lockdown: 10 March–4 May, and post-lockdown period: 5 May–16 May). A wireless sensors network was used to collect PM(2.5), temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed data every 2 s. Results: The lockdown resulted in a significant drop of PM(2.5) by 37.4% in 2020, compared to 2019 levels. The mean daily concentrations of PM(2.5) exceeded the WHO’s guideline value for 24-h mean levels of PM(2.5) 35% of the study period. During the strictest lockdown (23 March to 4 May), the mean daily PM(2.5) levels exceeded the standard 41% of the time. The transition from the pre-lockdown period into lockdown or post-lockdown periods was associated with lower PM(2.5) concentrations. Conclusions: A reduction in the mean daily PM(2.5) concentration was found compared to 2019. Lockdown was not enough to avoid severe exceedances of air pollution in Volos.","Kotsiou, Ourania S.; Saharidis, Georgios K.

Inhibition of this vital proteolytic process is effective in preventing the virus from replication in infected cells and therefore provides a potential COVID-19 treatment option. Guided by previous medicinal chemistry studies about SARS-CoV-1 main protease (SC1MPro), we have designed and synthesized a series of SC2MPro inhibitors that contain β-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal (Opal) for the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the SC2MPro active site cysteine C145. All inhibitors display high potency with IC50 values at or below 100 nM. The most potent compound MPI3 has as an IC50 value as 8.5 nM. Crystallographic analyses of SC2MPro bound to 7 inhibitors indicated both formation of a covalent bond with C145 and structural rearrangement from the apoenzyme to accommodate the inhibitors. Virus inhibition assays revealed that several inhibitors have high potency in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in both Vero E6 and A549 cells. Two inhibitors MP5 and MPI8 completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in Vero E6 cells at 2.5-5 μM and A549 cells at 0.16-0.31 μM. Their virus inhibition potency is much higher than some existing molecules that are under preclinical and clinical investigations for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study indicates that there is a large chemical space that needs to be explored for the development of SC2MPro inhibitors with extreme potency. Due to the urgent matter of the COVID-19 pandemic, MPI5 and MPI8 may be quickly advanced to preclinical and clinical tests for COVID-19.","Yang, Kai S.; Ma, Xinyu R.; Ma, Yuying; Alugubelli, Yugendar R.; Scott, Danielle A.; Vatansever, Erol C.; Drelich, Aleksandra K.; Sankaran, Banumathi; Geng, Zhi Z.; Blankenship, Lauren R.; Ward, Hannah E.; Sheng, Yan J.; Hsu, Jason C.; Kratch, Kaci C.; Zhao, Baoyu; Hayatshahi, Hamed S.; Liu, Jin; Li, Pingwei; Fierke, Carol A.; Tseng, Chien-Te K.; Xu, Shiqing; Liu, Wenshe Ray",bioRxiv,172,1

METHODS: We estimated the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to upper and lower respiratory infections (URIs and LRIs) and attributable risk factors in China by a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. Incidence, mortality, and DALYs were stratified by sex, age, and province. Risk factors for respiratory infections were analyzed from exposure data. FINDINGS: The age-standardized incidence rates of URIs and LRIs were 179,077 and 3926 per 100,000 persons in 2019, with a 7•52% and 35•07% decrease from 1990, respectively. Moreover, 2801 and 185,264 persons died of URIs and LRIs in 2019, respectively. DALYs for URIs and LRIs also decreased from 1,516,727 in 1990 to 928,617 in 2019 and from 38,278,504 in 1990 to 4,020,676 in 2019. The burden of URIs and LRIs were generally similar in males and females, but relatively higher in the new-borns and the elderly. Child malnutrition and low birth weight were the most important cause of age-standardized DALYs of LRIs and URIs, respectively.

Quality and performance indicators showed that the implementation of this model improved access to genetic counseling and minimized delays for genetic tests for patients, who reported to be overwhelmingly satisfied with the process. However, it remains unknown whether this model is robust and sustainable or requires adjustments. In addition, whether the model could be deployed elsewhere remains also to be elucidated. The C-MOnGene study was therefore designed to gain an in-depth understanding of the context in which the model was developed and implemented, and document the lessons that can be learned to optimize oncogenetic services delivery in other settings. ABSTRACT: Medical genetic services are facing an unprecedented demand for counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in a context of limited resources. To help resolve this issue, a collaborative oncogenetic model was recently developed and implemented at the CHU de Québec-Université Laval; Quebec; Canada. Here, we present the protocol of the C-MOnGene (Collaborative Model in OncoGenetics) study, funded to examine the context in which the model was implemented and document the lessons that can be learned to optimize the delivery of oncogenetic services. Within three years of implementation, the model allowed researchers to double the annual number of patients seen in genetic counseling. The average number of days between genetic counseling and disclosure of test results significantly decreased. Group counseling sessions improved participants’ understanding of breast cancer risk and increased knowledge of breast cancer and genetics and a large majority of them reported to be overwhelmingly satisfied with the process. These quality and performance indicators suggest this oncogenetic model offers a flexible, patient-centered and efficient genetic counseling and testing for HBOC. By identifying the critical facilitating factors and barriers, our study will provide an evidence base for organizations interested in transitioning to an oncogenetic model integrated into oncology care; including teams that are not specialized but are trained in genetics.","Lapointe, Julie; Dorval, Michel; Chiquette, Jocelyne; Joly, Yann; Guertin, Jason Robert; Laberge, Maude; Gekas, Jean; Hébert, Johanne; Pomey, Marie-Pascale; Cruz-Marino, Tania; Touhami, Omar; Blanchet Saint-Pierre, Arnaud; Gagnon, Sylvain; Bouchard, Karine; Rhéaume, Josée; Boisvert, Karine; Brousseau, Claire; Castonguay, Lysanne; Fortier, Sylvain; Gosselin, Isabelle; Lachapelle, Philippe; Lavoie, Sabrina; Poirier, Brigitte; Renaud, Marie-Claude; Ruizmangas, Maria-Gabriela; Sebastianelli, Alexandra; Roy, Stéphane; Côté, Madeleine; Racine, Marie-Michelle; Roy, Marie-Claude; Côté, Nathalie; Brisson, Carmen; Charette, Nelson; Faucher, Valérie; Leblanc, Josianne; Dubeau, Marie-Ève; Plante, Marie; Desbiens, Christine; Beaumont, Martin; Simard, Jacques; Nabi, Hermann",Cancers (Basel),172,1

Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the etiological agent of FMD that can spread rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. FMDV is internalized into host cell by the interaction between FMDV capsid proteins and cellular receptors. When the virus invades into the cells, the host antiviral system is quickly activated to suppress the replication of the virus and remove the virus. To retain fitness and host adaptation, various viruses have evolved multiple elegant strategies to manipulate host machine and circumvent the host antiviral responses. Therefore, identification of virus-host interactions is critical for understanding the host defense against virus infections and the pathogenesis of the viral infectious diseases. This review elaborates on the virus-host interactions during FMDV infection to summarize the pathogenic mechanisms of FMD, and we hope it can provide insights for designing effective vaccines or drugs to prevent and control the spread of FMD and other diseases caused by picornaviruses.","Li, Kangli; Wang, Congcong; Yang, Fan; Cao, Weijun; Zhu, Zixiang; Zheng, Haixue",Front Immunol,172,12

Although a range of evidence has guided policy, epidemiological models have been central. It is less clear whether models to support decision making have sought to integrate COVID-19 epidemiology with a consideration of broader health, wellbeing and economic implications. We report on a rapid review of studies seeking to integrate epidemiological and economic modelling to assess the impacts of alternative policies. Overall, our results suggest that few studies have explored broader impacts of different COVID-19 policies in the UK. Three studies looked only at health, capturing impacts on individuals with and without COVID-19, with various methods used to model the latter. Four models considered health and wider impacts on individuals’ economic outcomes, such as wages. However, these models made no attempt to consider the dynamic impacts on economic outcomes of others and the wider economy. The most complex analyses sought to link epidemiological and dynamic economic models. Studies compared a wide range of policies, although most were defined in general terms with minimal consideration of their granular specifications. There was minimal exploration of uncertainty, with no consideration in half the studies. Selecting appropriate models to inform decisions requires careful thought of factors relevant to the decision options under consideration such as the outcomes of interest, sectors likely to be impacted and causal pathways. In summary, better linking epidemiological and economic modelling would help to inform COVID-19 policy.

Sudden and improved access to telemedicine was propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which governments, insurers, and health systems ramped up telemedical utilization with short-term exceptions and waivers. As in-person care opportunities open back up, the presence of telemedicine is not receding and thus its widespread adoption needs to be facilitated outside pandemic-specific conditions. Long-term funding for telemedicine acquisition, centralized electronic health records, extended waivers related to telemedicine coverage and use, a Medicaid expansion that involves parity in telemedicine and in-person care, a nationalized licensure system, and an assessment of what types of care settings can and cannot utilize telemedicine are necessary recommendations to improve the sustainability of telemedicine after the pandemic.","Kaundinya, Trisha; Agrawal, Rishi",Quality management in health care,172,1

Kidney diseases are particularly challenging to tackle because they are pathologically diverse and are often asymptomatic. As such, kidney disease is often diagnosed late, and the global burden of kidney disease continues to be underappreciated. When kidney disease is not detected and treated early, patient care requires specialized resources that drive up cost, place many people at risk of catastrophic health expenditure and pose high opportunity costs for health systems. Prevention of kidney disease is highly cost-effective but requires a multisectoral holistic approach. Each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) has the potential to impact kidney disease risk or improve early diagnosis and treatment, and thus reduce the need for high-cost care. All countries have agreed to strive to achieve the SDGs, but progress is disjointed and uneven among and within countries.

METHODS: We carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy. A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence. Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression. RESULTS: Among both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women. The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile. Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.

METHODS: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay (~99% specificity). The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay. FINDINGS: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21–28, range 13–39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13–20, 21–27 and 28–41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P = 0.02).

The ATX–LPA axis has been associated with cognitive dysfunction and inflammatory diseases, mainly in a range of nonalcoholic liver diseases. Recently, preclinical and clinical evidence has suggested a role of LPA signaling in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and AUD-related cognitive function. However, the ATX–LPA axis has not been sufficiently investigated in alcoholic liver diseases. An exploratory study was conducted in 136 participants, 66 abstinent patients with AUD seeking treatment for alcohol (alcohol group), and 70 healthy control subjects (control group). The alcohol group was divided according to the presence of comorbid liver diseases (i.e., fatty liver/steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis, or cirrhosis). All participants were clinically evaluated, and plasma concentrations of total LPA and ATX were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Data were primarily analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) while controlling for age, body mass index, and sex. Logistic regression models were created to assess the association of the ATX–LPA axis and AUD or liver disease. LPA and ATX were log(10)-transformed to fit the assumptions of parametric testing.The main results were as follows: total LPA and ATX concentrations were dysregulated in the alcohol group, and patients with AUD had significantly lower LPA (F((1,131)) = 10.677, p = 0.001) and higher ATX (F((1,131)) = 8.327, p = 0.005) concentrations than control subjects; patients with AUD and liver disease had significantly higher ATX concentrations (post hoc test, p < 0.05) than patients with AUD but not liver disease; significant correlations between AUD-related variables and concentrations of LPA and ATX were only found in the non-liver disease subgroup (the duration of alcohol abstinence with LPA and ATX (r = +0.33, p < 0.05); and the severity of AUD with ATX (rho = −0.33, p < 0.05)); and a logistic regression model with LPA, ATX, and AUD-related variables showed an excellent discriminative power (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.915, p < 0.001) for distinguishing patients with AUD and comorbid liver disease. In conclusion, our data show that the ATX–LPA axis is dysregulated in AUD and suggest this lipid signaling, in combination with relevant AUD-related variables, as a reliable biomarker of alcoholic liver diseases.","Flores-López, María; García-Marchena, Nuria; Pavon, Francisco Javier; Lara, Estrella; Porras-Perales, Oscar; Araos, Pedro; Requena-Ocaña, Nerea; Torres-Galván, Sandra; Mañas-Padilla, M.

688057,688057,688057,A Traumatic Tick Bite: A Case Report,16.227053,10.6410675,2021-04-19,"Innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral infection, and in turn, viruses have evolved to evade host immune surveillance. As a result, viruses may persist in host and develop chronic infections. Type I interferons (IFN-α/β) are among the most potent antiviral cytokines triggered by viral infections. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease of pigs that is characterized by negligible induction of type I IFNs and viral persistence for an extended period. For IFN production, RIG-I/MDA5 and JAK-STAT pathways are two major signaling pathways, and recent studies indicate that PRRS virus is armed to modulate type I IFN responses during infection. This review describes the viral strategies for modulation of type I IFN responses. At least three non–structural proteins (Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp11) and a structural protein (N nucleocapsid protein) have been identified and characterized to play roles in the IFN suppression and NF-κB pathways. Nsp’s are early proteins while N is a late protein, suggesting that additional signaling pathways may be involved in addition to the IFN pathway. The understanding of molecular bases for virus-mediated modulation of host innate immune signaling will help us design new generation vaccines and control PRRS.","Sun, Yan; Han, Mingyuan; Kim, Chiyong; Calvert, Jay G.; Yoo, Dongwan",Viruses,172,20

Primary healthcare has moved into the front line as COVID-19 testing transitions from hospitals to multiple providers, where tracking testing behaviours can be fragmented and delayed. Pooled general practice data are a valuable resource which can be used to inform population and individual care decision-making. This project aims to examine the feasibility of using near real-time electronic general practice data to promote effective care and best-practice policy. METHODS: The project will utilize a design thinking approach involving all collaborators (primary health networks [PHNs], general practices, consumer groups, researchers, and digital health developers, pathology professionals) to enhance the development of meaningful and translational project outcomes. The project will be based on a series of observational studies utilizing near real-time electronic general practice data from a secure and comprehensive digital health platform [POpulation Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) general practice data warehouse]. The study will be carried out over 1.5 years (July 2020–December 2021) using data from over 450 general practices within three Victorian PHNs and Gippsland PHN, Eastern Melbourne PHN and South Eastern Melbourne PHN, supplemented by data from consenting general practices from two PHNs in New South Wales, Central and Eastern Sydney PHN and South Western Sydney PHN. DISCUSSION: The project will be developed using a design thinking approach, leading to the building of a meaningful near real-time COVID-19 geospatial reporting framework and dashboard for decision-makers at community, state and nationwide levels, to identify and monitor emerging trends and the impact of interventions/policy decisions. This will integrate timely evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic related to its diagnosis and treatment, and its impact across clinical, population and general practice levels.","Georgiou, Andrew; Li, Julie; Pearce, Christopher; McLeod, Adam; Wabe, Nasir; Hardie, Rae-Anne; Franco, Guilherme Saffi; Imai, Chisato; Sezgin, Gorkem; Thomas, Judith; Dai, Zhaoli; Sheikh, Muhammad Kashif; Proposch, Amanda; Weeding, Stephen; Wickham, Brendon; Badrick, Tony; Murgatroyd, Darnel",Health Res Policy Syst,172,16

Los factores que explicarían esta conexión son heterogéneos y, a veces, contradictorios. Probablemente las alteraciones en la función y tamaño de la vía aérea, la desregulación (congénita y adquirida) del tono de la vía aérea, las alteraciones en la respuesta inmunitaria a las infecciones y las variantes genéticas en dicha respuesta sean los cuatro mecanismos principales implicados en la asociación entre las infecciones respiratorias virales y el posterior desarrollo del asma o sibilancias en los niños. Futuras estrategias terapéuticas y de prevención deberían considerar estos mecanismos. Viral respiratory infections are the factor most frequently associated with asthma (independently of phenotype, age, and phase of the natural history of asthma during which the infection occurs) and there is a strong temporal association between viral respiratory infections and acute obstructive/asthmatic episodes. Nevertheless, the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of asthma remains poorly characterized. The factors that could explain this association are heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory. The four main causative mechanisms implicated in the association between viral respiratory infections and the subsequent development of asthma or wheezing in children are alterations in airway function and size, dysregulation (congenital and acquired) of airway tone, alterations in the immune response to infections, and the genetic variants involved in immune response. These mechanisms should be taken into account in future preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Castro-Rodríguez, J. A.",Anales de Pediatría,172,20
